#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20493	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	6	No.  This is another stage in a totally failed budgeting system.  Not only does this year's budget fail to address the reform issues, adopting instead the easy option of taxing ordinary families and businesses, but the whole budgetary procedure of which the Revised Estimates comprise a part is one that is not fit for running a corner shop.  It is an absolutely arcane and archaic system of budgeting.  We are to see a Book of Estimates published without a single target therein.  We will see a Book of Estimates with no pressure to deliver efficiency.If we had put in place the United Kingdom's system of efficiency agreements each year, we would by now, over six years, have €4 billion to spare out of the Estimates to address economic problems.  Under our system, there are no consequences in the event of failure.  Last year, Ministers reported in their annual output statements that over 40% of the targets they set out to achieve in the previous year had not been achieved.  Not even one Minister blushed, let alone tendered his resignation for those failures.We really need to sharpen up.  We cannot continue to spend money without accountability for consequences or transparency as to what is happening.  If we do not wise up and reform the system, people will rightly say this House is failing them.  This sickens me after all the years during which this side of the House has been demanding reform.  We have called for reform through the Committee of Public Accounts and members of all parties, including Fianna Fáil backbenchers and not just members of the Opposition, issued an agreed policy statement, yet we have done nothing about it.  The Government stands indicted on that front.  The motion on the Revised Estimates does not deserve to be passed on the nod, as has been suggested.

In normal circumstances, the House would agree to this but these are not normal circumstances.  The changes being made in departmental Estimates are fundamental.  There are major changes being made in this regard and we need to debate in the House the revision of the Estimates process and the associated logic.As the Tánaiste will recall, I asked the Taoiseach yesterday some questions on the report presented by the International Monetary Fund, IMF.  In his reply, he said, in effect, that the IMF's figures were wrong.  The IMF has issued a statement standing over the figures it presented, which show that the cost of stabilising the banking system in Ireland will be more expensive than in any other country in the developed world.  The cost will amount to €6,000 for every man, woman and child in the country.  In such circumstances, we need to have a debate on the Revised Estimates.  We need to have the Taoiseach back in the House to explain how he got his information so wrong yesterday.  We need a debate on what the Government intends or does not intend to do about the banking system.We need to do more than agree the motion on the Revised Estimates without debate.  The House is being asked to agree, without debate, that the Revised Estimates would just be handed over to the Departments and that arrangements would be made for the presentation of new Estimates, as if it were just a case of making adjustments in the Estimates for a few hundred thousand euro here and there.  We are in an entirely different set of circumstances and the issue needs to be debated properly in the House.

Over this past week and more, we have seen both the media and the political establishment focused on the proposition on what to all intents and purposes is a minor reshuffle of junior Ministers.  We must take on board and recognise that while that dominates political commentary in the front pages of our newspapers today, the truth is that the overwhelming mass of ordinary people do not give a tuppence for what happens in the political careers of either members of the Government or any of the Opposition voices at this point in time.  What they are looking to this House for is a clear strategy to get them out of the current difficulties.On the proposition before us, where we are being asked to accept without debate proposals on Revised Estimates, the people are anxiously waiting for a clear statement of intent on the part of Government on job retention and creation.  Those are the critical elements missing from the Government's address of the current crisis for months despite repeated appeals from voices here on the Opposition benches.  It is galling that in these circumstances we are being asked to adopt these proposals without debate.  The people want real debate and real focus on what can be done, what measures the Tánaiste and her colleagues at the Cabinet table are taking to ensure that existing jobs are saved and there is the prospect of a light at the end of the tunnel because currently none is showing.Regarding SR Technics, we have already lost 600 key technical jobs in that organisation, with some of them offered relocation in Zurich.

Many Members who did not get a chance to speak on Second Stage will attend Committee Stage, for which only one day is scheduled next week, to make their Second Stage contributions.  Effectively, Committee Stage will never reach any of the substantive amendments or individual provisions in the Bill.  The quality of the debate will be dramatically curtailed.  We should not have this approach to the legislation.  There would be some understanding on this side of the House if the Minister found agreement to ensure proper time given for debating each element of the Bill.  Today's order, however, will be just a straightforward guillotine that will curtail debate which is inappropriate.

It is unacceptable that we would dispose of this in such a short time.  The Bill will have large implications for family budgets, imposing the increase in the health levy, the cut in early child care payments and reducing rent supplement and people's entitlements to unemployment assistance.  For that reason, it should be given adequate time for debate in the House.

It will be difficult to find the opportunity in the course of the limited time being provided with a guillotine falling at 3.30 p.m.  This is important legislation.  Among the issues already referred to by Deputy Shortall, there is also the cancellation of the Christmas bonus to welfare recipients.  The Departments have spun this as representing 2% of the overall social welfare budget.  It represents, however, a significantly higher percentage of the annual budget of those dependants who look forward to and need that lift at that critical time of the year.  The consequences——

Against that background, I would like to press the Tánaiste further on the plans for the legislation on the national asset management agency.  I do not want to understate the importance of this issue.  It is possibly the most important legislation the House will ever pass.  The scale of the commitment we are entering into on behalf of the taxpayer is unprecedented.We heard from the Taoiseach yesterday that he is to proceed on the basis of an interim board being established over the summer.  I would like to clarify on what legal authority that interim board will be acting.  Will it make decisions that compromise the position of the Dáil?

We need to have some certainty regarding on what authority it will be operating.  If it makes decisions about, for example, the price at which assets might be purchased, we will be undermining the freedom of the Dáil to strike a fair balance.  These are important issues.  The scale of this is unprecedented so, while it might slightly bend the Ceann Comhairle's tolerance of the rules, it is so important that we need to have clarity from Government as to what will come before the House, what will happen to banking in the long hiatus before we see legislation——

The heads of the legislation are being worked on at present.  Given the fact we hope to have this legislation passed during this session, if at all possible, and preparation for the legislation is under way, the Government has decided to consider the possibility of the establishment of an interim board to prepare the scope of the preparatory work that needs to be done.  Naturally the constitution for the appointment of chairperson and CEO will be contained within the framework of the legislation.  I reiterate that it is a priority for the Government to have the legislation on the floor of the House as quickly as possible.

While a newspaper editorial is not in order here, I read an editorial in The Irish Times which bears directly on this matter.  Three years ago we had A Vision for Change.  It was to be a programme for reform at the heart of which is this legislation.  It is appalling that although this was launched with a welter of publicity, nothing has changed in the interim.  The body that was to implement it is not in place.  There is no implementation plan for it.  If it were not for Deputies like Deputy Neville who have steadily kept this issue on the public agenda, it would disappear without trace.  We need to have some clarity.  When there is a Government strategy there should be some way of implementing it, a budget put in place and an implementing committee so that we can have some testing of the performance at the end of a year.  This is unacceptable.

Here we are into the so-called summer stage of the Dáil this year and publication is now expected in 2010.  How many more deferrals of this essential legislation must we await before there is a realisation of what is absolutely wrong at the heart of the Department of Health and Children?  The Minister for Health and Children is present.  It is time she was held accountable for these failures.  That is just one example of the many failures in that Department.

When Deputy Burton asked about this legislation yesterday the Taoiseach clearly stated — Deputy Burton drew attention to the fact — that the legislation to establish this agency was not on the A list and was down somewhere on the C list.  In response to Deputy Burton yesterday, the Taoiseach indicated to the House that the legislation would not appear until the autumn and that it was intended to establish the board on an interim basis in the meantime.  This raises issues to which Deputy Burton has drawn attention about how we can have an agency established without legislation which will have functions including the acquisition and valuing of property with all of the consequences that will have for the State finances without authority from Dáil Éireann.  The Tánaiste has told the House this morning, in contradiction to what the Taoiseach said yesterday, that the legislation will be presented this session.  I want a straight answer.  Will this Bill be brought before the House this session or in the autumn as indicated by the Taoiseach yesterday?  If it is to be introduced this session, can the Tánaiste indicate when it will be published?My second question also relates to a matter I raised yesterday regarding moving the writs for the two Dáil by-elections that are due to be held.  When I asked the Taoiseach about this yesterday he said that the Government had not yet made a decision on it.

I ask the Tánaiste for a clear statement as to when the Government intends to move the writs for these two by-elections.  I understand the writs would need to be moved before the second week in May if the by-elections are to proceed on 5 June.  The Tánaiste should clearly indicate to the House this morning the Government's intention with regard to the moving of the writs.  Of course it is open to Opposition parties to move the writs in circumstances where the Government fails to do so.  What are the Government's intentions with regard to the moving of the writs so that the Labour Party can make its decision as to whether and when we might bring a motion before the House to move them?

However, on the basis that it is a priority the heads will be published as quickly as possible, with a view to having the legislation on the floor of the House as quickly as possible.On the other issue, the Government has not decided when it will move the writ.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	56	This morning's Irish Independent carries an article by the Minister for Finance.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	58	It is excellent that he is prepared to communicate with us through the newspapers.  The article states that the agency will acquire loans at an appropriate discount from their face value.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	60	Yesterday's newspapers carried——

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	62	——advertisements for property in Dublin 4 in the AIB bank centre at a discount of 34.5%

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	64	Tens of thousands of people are losing their jobs and becoming redundant——

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	66	——because these people on the Government benches cannot organise saving our banking and economic systems.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	70	May I ask——

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	72	——if we can have a debate on the NAMA?

#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	74	When will the Report Stage of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Bill be taken in the House?  The Minister for Health and Children told us on Committee Stage that she is expecting to implement the legislation in the autumn and it still needs to go to the Seanad.  Is it planned to go ahead in the timeframe we were originally given?  There has been some speculation in the media that for financial reasons it might not proceed in the autumn.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	75	I believe it will be taken in the House in three weeks.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	76	I wish to raise a matter that is causing great angst and despair among those in the farming community, which is the sneaky cut introduced in the budget of €28 million for the fallen animal scheme.  Regarding animal health and welfare, the Government has made no plans regarding the disposal of dead animals.  It will cost every farmer €160 to dispose of them.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	77	The Deputy cannot raise animal welfare matters on the Order of Business.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	78	It is a nightmare.  The Government has no plans and has nothing done.

#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	80	The Government has done nothing with regard to animal health and welfare.  This is a cop out.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	81	I know, but the Deputy cannot raise it now.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	82	It has destroyed the farming community and it will hear a lot more about that.

#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	84	Farmers cannot get burial licences, but must go to the nearest vet.  It is a disaster that will come back to haunt the Minister.  The Government may save €28 million, but it will destroy the environment.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	85	The Deputy must conclude.  This is not on the legislation list.  I call Deputy Tuffy.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	86	It is on the "C" list, but when will it be introduced?
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	87	There is another way to raise the matter.  The Deputy is on a monologue here, but that is not on.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	88	I gave up being Pudsy Ryan and talking to myself.  This place is the worst place I ever came to.

#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	91	An advertising campaign being shown currently on our television stations deals with the issue of the abuse of alcohol by children and young people and tries to raise the awareness of adults in terms of their responsibility.  Legislation has been promised for years on this area and task forces have been set up to work on the issue.  When Deputy Bertie Ahern was Taoiseach, he promised legislation would be introduced.  Where is that legislation now?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	92	I assume the Deputy is referring to the sale of alcohol Bill.  That will be introduced later this year.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	93	That legislation has been promised for the past five years.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	94	I want to ask about legislation that has disappeared from the list, namely, the Irish Sports Council (Amendment) Bill, which was promised.  What status will the Institute of Sport have if that legislation is dropped?
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	95	We cannot go into the detail of it.  All we can do now is find out what is happening with the legislation.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	96	The Minister has decided not to proceed with the legislation.  Currently an internal review is taking place.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	97	With regard to pending legislation and the five point penalty to be imposed under the Road Traffic Act for not having an NCT certificate on display, what oversight is there of NCT testing centres?
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	98	We cannot go into that now as the Deputy well knows.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	99	May I just make the point?  As far as I know, there is currently no such oversight facility.  People are being asked to go and check themselves.  I had a personal experience——
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	100	If the Deputy puts down the matter for the Adjournment, I feel sure it would be selected.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	101	This is important.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	103	I will put down a parliamentary question, but are they currently using the opportunity under the Road Traffic Act to——

#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	105	When will the employment agency regulation Bill be published and when will it come before the House?  I am aware that 220 jobs will be lost tomorrow in the Amann Industries Corporation in Tralee.  Is there anything the Tánaiste can do to save even some of those jobs?
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	106	The Tánaiste could not say that in her Department yesterday.

#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	108	Our economy is being devastated and now we have a loss of jobs.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	110	I would be more than happy to speak to the Deputy privately on the latter matter because I appreciate it is a significant issue for Tralee in his constituency.  I hope the employment agency legislation will be available this session.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	111	When will the Tánaiste be in a position to make an announcement about the future of the SR Technics facility, given it is three weeks tomorrow since the bulk of the workforce was let go?  Last Friday, despite the efforts of——

If I did, I would have to allow Deputy Deenihan raise his issue.  I must be consistent.  Standing Orders govern me just as they do the Deputy and there is nothing I can do about it.  There are several ways to raise the issue and every time the Deputy raised it and was within order, he was allowed do so.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	113	We cannot both speak at the same time.

#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	117	There seems to have been a setback in moving towards a digital Ireland as a result of the withdrawal of the Boxer DTT consortium from the digital terrestrial television project.  This has serious implications, particularly for people living on the east coast who will lose access to British television stations this year.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	118	We cannot go into detail on that now as the Deputy well knows.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	119	I am getting to the point of legislation.

#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	121	The Broadcasting Bill deals with the issue of DTT, but the whole landscape has been transformed by the withdrawal of the company that was to provide this.  When will Report Stage of the Broadcasting Bill be resumed and will the Minister bring forward new amendments to deal with the transformed situation in which we now find ourselves?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	122	We will try to facilitate that as quickly as possible.  I will discuss the matter with the Whip.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	123	With regard to No. 68, the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission (Amendment) Bill, has any comparative work been done on the role of parliaments?  It is suggested that the Bill will be published in 2009.  Has the opportunity been taken to examine the function of parliaments or will there be an opportunity for public consultation?  I raise this matter to be of assistance to the Ceann Comhairle because many people have taken upon themselves the role of people who know how parliament should or should not be run.  Many of them are rather ignorant and ill informed.  Therefore, it would be useful, in so far as this comparative work has been done in other parliaments, to provide an opportunity for people who are more patient and thoughtful to make a contribution to assist the legislation.  To what committee will the legislation go, where will it be discussed, will there be an opportunity for discussion or will it be just a short, sharp piece of legislation that comes from Government and leaves matters just as bad as they are?
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	124	I think Churchill said that parliament was a substitute for fisticuffs.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	125	I like that.  We will not have the Queensberry rules today.  With regard to that legislation, a team has been set up in the House to consider amendments to the legislation, but I am not au fait  with the contents of the legislation.

When political legacies are discussed in future, one thing is for certain — the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, will always be remembered as the Minister who abolished Christmas by robbing people of their Christmas bonuses.I was amazed in the debate that followed the budget both on the airwaves and in the House to hear one Minister after another state there had been no cut in social welfare.  I heard the Taoiseach say on the news that the Government would not countenance cutting welfare rates and then attempt to take credit for increasing the rates in the good times.  I am not sure what the Government considers the Christmas bonus to be.  Clearly, it sees the bonus as something of a luxury, something trivial that is not a necessity or important.  I am not sure how Government Members spend Christmas or whether they just treat it as another time of the year without the extra associated costs, but Christmas is a time of greater expense for the majority of people.  While many enjoy Christmas, they are filled with dread wondering how they will cope and how they are going to afford it.  I know of the dread that comes early in January for families in particular when bills and outstanding credit union loans must be paid.  Worse, a moneylender's loan may need to be paid, but there is often no money to pay it.Last night, the Minister seemed to discount or trivialise the issue of moneylenders.  It may not be something that concerns her, but it is a matter of great concern to the many groups working with people in financial difficulties.  The morning after the budget, members of a local credit union contacted me to inform me that people would experience difficulties after Christmas.  They are concerned that those difficulties will now be compounded.  The Free Legal Advice Centres, FLAC, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and many similar groups have expressed vocal concerns about moneylenders and the appalling lack of regulation thereof.Three weeks ago, the House discussed the issue of rising debt.  Fine Gael made sound, sensible proposals to deal with the issue and we asked the Government to give us its views on legislating for rising debt, regulating moneylenders and so on.  Now we find ourselves in a situation where these problems are going to be compounded and trebled by the Government's abolition of the Christmas bonus.  In light of this motion, I ask that the Government consider the matter of regulating moneylenders.  Some of their websites cite interest rates of up to 150%.  That they are legitimate moneylenders is a part of the difficulty.  When people are in dire circumstances, they will go for the easy option at the time, but it is not easy to pay up to 150% on a loan.  With a financial institution, one might only pay 10%.  This matter must be addressed, particularly given the current climate.Every family is entitled to celebrate Christmas.  The extra payment is what allows Christmas to happen in many poor households.  For others, and this has been stated publicly by many groups representing different sectors dependent on the bonus, it amounts to a fill of oil and the payment of bills.  People have become wholly and solely dependent on it.  I want to concentrate on its importance for families with children in particular.  If one is on jobseeker's allowance for the required period and it is one's only income, together with a top-up for one's children, one cannot save for Christmas out of the amount received and does not have the opportunity to put money aside.Last night, the Minister addressed the issue of deflation, but the amount spent on necessities comprises the largest part of many social welfare recipients' household budgets.  Deflation is not helping them.  The Minister should remember that they will lose the early child care supplement of €1,000 per year per child under six years of age.  Other Members have discussed pensioners losing the bonus.The Government's decision to scrap the bonus is reprehensible and must be reversed.  I have lost count of the number of people who have asked me how they would afford Christmas this year.  They cannot believe that the payment will not be made, as they will not be able to buy presents or have proper Christmas dinners.  The decision shows the most Scrooge-like mentality seen in the State to date.  I do not know when the Minister was last in a toy shop, but €204 will not go far in providing three or four children with Christmas presents.  How does one explain to a five year old that we are in tighter economic times?  It is not a lavish payment that allows families to go wild.  Rather, it allows them to keep their heads above water.  Many of them are borrowing, even with the bonus, to meet the cost.  They are already to the pin of their collars and what the Government is doing will make the situation far worse.The Government can dress this up any way it likes.  It can call it the lesser of two evils, but the axing of the bonus is a social welfare cut.  The Minister's statement, namely, that it would be the first payment to be returned were there a windfall, is rubbish, nonsense and disingenuous.  If the Minister for Finance will contribute, perhaps he can tell the House whether there will be a windfall anywhere in the Exchequer.

Clarity in the House would be good.  From where does the Minister for Social and Family Affairs see a windfall coming?Once this decision has been made and she has taken the heat, is she really saying that she will re-examine the matter?  She has said that she will, but the amendment is not couched in such definite language.  She has also pledged to reintroduce it if she beats her savings targets, which come from her investigations into fraudulent social welfare claims.  Bearing in mind that she failed last year to meet her targets, I do not see how she will find more than €156 million extra this year.  Even if she does, nobody believes that the bonus will be paid.Speaking on the salvation of the Christmas bonus last October, the Minister stated: "Even with the challenging budgetary situation, the payment of this additional money to social welfare customers is a clear sign that helping those most in need of support remains the key priority for the Government."  Clearly, axing the bonus shows that helping those who are most in need of support is no longer a key priority.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	147	I welcome the opportunity to speak, but I do not welcome the issue on which I speak.  No one wants to see the Christmas bonus being cut.  In the first of many budgets introduced in the past year, the Government hit the over 70s medical cards.  It saw the reaction.  While thousands might not be out on the streets as a result of this cut, I do not doubt that reality will hit home next Christmas when people find themselves without money to buy what they want for their children, grandchildren and so on and necessities such as diesel, oil and gas.The Government has wasted money in recent years, including €52 million on e-voting machines, millions of euro on their storage and €180 million for the health service computer system, but no heads have rolled.  These two items alone would have more than covered the Christmas bonus.  There were ways for the Government to avoid this situation, but it has taken the easier way out and taken money from the elderly, those with disabilities and those on long-term social welfare benefits.  I ask the Ministers for Social and Family Affairs and Finance to re-examine this matter to determine whether it would be possible to reinstate the bonus.  It may only be an overall cut of 2% in social welfare, but the time of year and those from whom it will be taken are the issue.There has been much waste in the HSE.  For example, an ordinary meeting of a health forum is usually only attended by 16 of its 28 members.  It is only a talking shop, yet 15 HSE executives attend for a number of hours.  The committee cannot make a decision or give guidance.  It is only an informational structure.  This type of body is allowed to stay in place at a significant cost to the State. While there is no effort to streamline them or to save money, the first item to be cut is a Christmas bonus from those who are least well off.  I ask the Government to reconsider and to do the right thing.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	148	I propose to share time with Deputies Thomas Byrne, Cyprian Brady and O'Rourke.First, I am pleased to intervene in this debate because the decision taken in this matter was a decision of the Government.  To put this matter in context, one should consider what has happened in recent years in the Estimates, in which provision has been made for a 70% Christmas bonus.  While it is true that in most recent years, a 100% payment was made, the additional 30% required to so do usually was not agreed by the Government until near the end of the financial year.  The saving of €156 million to be made this year that was announced in the recent budget was accounted for by not providing for the 70% bonus.  Were the full bonus to be paid, it would cost approximately €223 million.I have listened with great care to this debate and I have not heard a single Deputy propose how this €223 million would be found in the current financial year.  It can only be found in one of three ways, namely, by a reduction of €223 million in some other head or subhead of expenditure, the imposition of an additional €223 million in taxation or, and I assume this is the position of the Opposition in default, by borrowing to pay the aforementioned amount.  These are the economic realities at present and it is important that all Members reflect on them.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	151	Prior to the budget, I furnished the finance spokespersons of the Opposition parties with a great deal of information on the precise position of expenditures and revenues in the State and they are well aware of the position.  I believe that while the Opposition considers it to be its duty to hold the Government to account and while its spokespersons put forward certain proposals before the budget that did not stack up in numerical terms — I do not take issue with them in that regard at present — the exercise of briefing the Opposition parties on the budgetary position before the budget was of benefit because it improved the tone of the debate in respect of this budget.However, one must face facts and must reflect on the realities we face.  One major reality is that our borrowing has been reined in at 10.75% or our annual national wealth this year, which still constitutes an extremely large figure.  Our expenditure is too high and our tax base was too low.  Work has begun in repairing the tax base and as I made clear in my Supplementary Budget Statement, in future, work must focus on expenditure because there is a limit to the amount of taxation that can be exacted in any economy and there is a limit to the amount of borrowing that any economy can undertake.  As this applies to Ireland at present, all expenditure must be scrutinised.A number of Members suggested in their interventions that expenditure on the Department of Social and Family Affairs should be exempt from any such exercise.  Although Members are aware of the position, it is important to state again that in the context of the general burden of expenditure in the State, welfare accounts for €21.5 billion of the total.  This is a substantial sum of money as the envisaged tax receipts this year before the budget were €33 billion.  Consequently, welfare already accounted for two thirds of total tax receipts in the State this year.  Therefore, we must reflect on the reason we are in this position.

However, I wish to put on the record of the House a few essential facts.  In the past decade, the Government has been able to provide highly significant increases in welfare payments.  For example, the payment of child benefit has increased from less than €44 to €166 per month.  The State contributory pension has risen from €113 to more than €230 per week.  The weekly rate of long-term jobseeker's allowance was raised from €93 to €204.

As I noted recently in this House, the science of economic forecasting has become like meteorology and it is extremely difficult to predict the economic weather.  The position has moved to one in which the forecast this year is that the cost of living will reduce and not increase.  However, the Government is not prepared to adjust social welfare rates on the basis of a forecast.

It is like any household — one cannot spend what one does not have.  The Department and the Minister have come out early and been upfront about this.  Nobody likes making changes to people's daily lives and their income by making cuts that have become essential if we are to provide a top-class social welfare system for the most vulnerable people in the country.  That the Minister has come out so early gives people a chance to budget in whatever way they can take account of the change that will take place at Christmas.This is a bonus payment.  I worked in employment exchanges in the early 1980s where there was no such thing as a Christmas bonus.  People were on very low payments, whether on assistance or benefit, invalidity or disability benefit.  That has changed dramatically over the past ten years.  Child benefit has increased from €44 ten years ago to €166 per month now.

#CyprianBrady	unknown-#CyprianBrady-party	unknown-#CyprianBrady-dob	unknown-#CyprianBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	219	The contributory pension has increased from €113 ten years ago to €230, an increase of over 100%.  Old people appreciate that and accept that conditions have improved.  I have spoken to pensioners on this issue and they see it as a bonus they receive at Christmas.  The vast majority would rather have a bonus reduced or taken away at Christmas once a year rather than having their payment cut on a weekly basis.  That makes life more difficult for people.In my constituency, we have a large number of people dependent on welfare payments such as lone parent's allowance, invalidity, disability or pension payments.  A certain section of society will not be able to manage finances and income and will end up in trouble irrespective of the payment they receive.  These people must be assisted.  It is incumbent on every Member of the House to ensure that these people are aware of what is available.  They can make a telephone call to the money advice and budgeting service; they do not have to go to the office.Other Members referred to moneylenders.  I have dealt with cases where people got into trouble with moneylenders.  The advice we can give them is that there is help out there for them.  There is a welfare system in place to assist them.  Some people cannot cope or live from day to day and find moneylenders knocking at their doors.  We must protect those people.  We must make adjustments now rather than waiting and making tougher decisions, which would have a more direct impact on people, later in the year or next year.  Only in the good times could a 100% bonus be paid.  The sum of over €200 million saved will ensure that those who need it most get it and weekly payments will not be affected directly.  They will be in a position to continue to manage their finances week to week.Fraud is being tackled and taken seriously.  Great resources are being put into it and this is money well spent.  There are opportunities out there.  For many years I have listened to people saying that a person was not entitled to a payment but was receiving it or taking advantage of the system.  We must accept that fraud takes place, and we must tackle it.  The Department had major success on fraud towards the end of last year.  Whatever resources are needed will ensure that those who most need it will get it, as will the most vulnerable people.  Early signalling of this change will give people a chance——

The Minister for Finance has pointed out that we have one of the most generous and efficient welfare systems in Europe, if not the world.  People in other jurisdictions are envious of what we can do with our welfare system.  The percentage of income the country spends on welfare shows that successive Governments have tried to protect people and ensure that the most vulnerable in society are catered for and protected.  The measures that must be taken are not palatable and no one likes taking these decisions.

It is edifying that, in the first week back after Easter, most of the debate in this House has been on social welfare, with the Social Welfare Bill and this motion.  For the Minister and those who shadow her it means more time in the Chamber but it is important that we debate the matter as it is a part of life in receipt of a major amount of funding.Last night, when I spoke on the Social Welfare Bill, and this morning, when walking to Leinster House, I thought that, as the song goes, would it not be lovely to be in opposition where one can demand, demand, demand and constantly put forward ideas without the corresponding saving?

#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	232	That would be lovely but then as I came in I thought it would not be lovely because one likes to feel that one is contributing to a full debate, which this is from the point of view of the Labour Party, on how this payment could be made out of the social welfare budget.  That means that if the Christmas bonus was to be paid, it would have to come from the subhead of some other item in social welfare.  It is only when one has been a Minister, and I do not want to talk myself up or down, and faced with a plethora of subheads, which is particularly acute in the Department of Social and Family Affairs, that one must make a decision.  These are Government decisions.  To taunt and say silly things across the Chamber — calling people Marie Antoinette, for example — is puerile and infantile.  It was as if someone took delight in the decision.  I am quite sure Marie Antoinette took delight when she said whatever she said, historians have changed their minds several times on it.  To think that anybody would approach with delight saying to people that a Christmas bonus would not be paid would mean that person is very sadistic.Nobody wants to do this but the country is faced with a 20% increase in the social welfare budget, mainly due to the rising tide of unemployment.  It is sad and almost hopeless for people with no jobs.  I know the Minister is trying to ensure that those who have to queue for benefits would be treated in a dignified and proper fashion and I reiterate that today.  People are now looking to get unemployment benefits who have never dreamt of or faced today's measure of unemployment.We cannot cut the single parent allowance, unemployment benefit or child benefit.  Neither can we cut the carer's allowance.  We all met with carers' groups prior to the supplementary budget and we indicated that the very best we could hope for would be no dilution of the carer's benefit payments or the respite payment for carers.  That was preserved.I do not know in the current climate how long more we can keep preserving such measures.  Social welfare has the first call, which is correct for a society in which people have rightly always placed great emphasis on looking after those who are vulnerable and in need.  My plea today is that we all would continue to wish to focus on the unemployed, single parents and child benefit.  We should ensure that those who get some measure of support and comfort from such payments will continue to be able to do so.  I am hopeful that this will continue to be the tenet of Government.The Minister opened a chink in the argument last night and Deputy Enright asked her to elaborate on that chink.

She is from a neighbouring constituency and one is always careful of such things.  The Minister, Deputy Hanafin, indicated that if there was a chance of giving this Christmas bonus, she would grasp the opportunity and encourage the Minister for Finance to do so as well.  That is more or less what she said but perhaps I have encapsulated her comments incorrectly.I add my voice to this and will continue to do so.  As the months go by and Christmas approaches, we hope there will be some avenue which could be further explored for the partial or whole payment of this Christmas bonus.  Be that as it may, the position is very serious in Irish economic life and it behoves us all to approach it in a serious fashion and ensure that the money so garnered for the social welfare budget — it is up 20% in less than one year — will continue to be used usefully and well.
#ThomasByrne	unknown-#ThomasByrne-party	unknown-#ThomasByrne-dob	unknown-#ThomasByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	242	The motion I speak on today is difficult but the decisions faced by the Government in the past few months have been extremely difficult.  Never before have such difficult circumstances been seen in this State.  Who would want to have to make the decisions taken by Government?  Who would want to increase social welfare payments by 20%?  This is all about unemployment and who would want to have to deal with this?  The problem we face must be tackled.The social welfare budget must be increased dramatically and we must spend two thirds of our tax revenue on social welfare because of the economic crisis we face but who would want to do so?  We would rather be reducing taxes, with fewer people on welfare.  That should be the aim of the Government throughout this crisis.  Ideally, there should be less of a Christmas bonus, as who among the unemployed is looking forward to it; they want a job and we must work towards that by getting public finances back in order.  People are not looking forward to a Christmas bonus because they want a job instead.  It is our responsibility to do whatever we can to try to get them into work.Some €21.3 billion is being spent on social welfare this year, with the tax take only €33 billion or €34 billion.  We are not sure about that and it may even go down.  The figure has decreased in the first couple of months of the year, although I have confidence that the actions taken by the Minister will address that.  By any measure, a massive amount is being spent on social welfare.The Minister has ensured that no other areas in social welfare are to be cut at a time when prices are going down.  I acknowledge that food prices have not decreased but there is deflationary pressure on food and utilities.  I encourage any of my constituents who want to switch utility, particularly electricity to Bord Gáis or Airtricity, to do so.  In my own area there is competition for gas supply which brings about a reduced price.  The regulator may need to move more quickly but Government action has taken place.  Those prices should be decreased and people should get more bang for their buck.Child benefit has increased dramatically.  Why should child benefit be paid as it is to me, a Deputy with two children?  It should be taxed or means tested.  The Minister has indicated such measures will be introduced, but when they are there will be a Private Members' motion in this House criticising it.  Every action taken by this Government is criticised, as well as every change it wishes to make.  Every change made by this Government has garnered attention from some lobby group which is then picked up by the Opposition.  I would not describe the people benefitting from the Christmas bonus as part of a lobby group but that is the hallmark of the Opposition.  This issue concerned a very difficult decision which no Government would like to take.I urge the Government to reconsider the payment as soon as we are out of the current economic position.  It could also be reconsidered as we do more work on fraud prevention.  The Minister has done tremendous work on that but much more can be done, as many people are committing social welfare fraud.  They must be dealt with as the cake is only so big and it must be divided as best we can.  There are inherently difficult decisions in this, which the Opposition knows.  Despite that, the Opposition will argue that the Government is acting incorrectly.At a meeting of the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs we met with representatives of the Combat Poverty Agency, which has done much good work.  As that agency merged with the Department, there was a lobby group to prevent that happening.  Any changes we have made to agencies or in trying to make the social welfare process better have been objected to.  I will look for the child benefit payment system to be examined as such a system is not right at a time when we cannot pay the Christmas bonus.  We do not have the €223 million to pay the bonus and it cannot be gained through taxation or borrowing.At the same time as we are dealing with this problem, wealthy people or those with good earnings are still getting a children's allowance.  I encourage the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, the Minister for Finance and the Commission on Taxation to consider the issue as savings must be made.  We do not know the circumstances of every family but it is not right for people on very high incomes to be taking a bit of the social welfare cake that would be better spent elsewhere, either on the Christmas bonus, reducing the taxation burden or on the extra expenditure required because of unemployment.There were significant increases in the October budget of 3% or 4% in the payment rates of social welfare.  Prices are going down, although there may be arguments about certain aspects, and the phenomenon is being repeated in the UK, even with sterling so weak and imports so expensive.  There are advantages and disadvantages to decreasing prices for the economy as a whole but it is good for people on social welfare.I spoke briefly to the Minister for Finance last week and I told him our challenge as a Government is to keep prices down and provide people with more buying power.  We want this Christmas bonus to be paid but the money must be found.  The Opposition does not have to find the money and it can just criticise the Government's action.  I have confidence that when we emerge from the current economic position, not only will the Christmas bonus be paid but it will not be paid to the tens of thousands of those currently out of work as I hope they will be back at work by then.

#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	247	I do not believe the money needs to be appropriated from within the social welfare budget.  The motion states that "the €156 million required for the payment this year could be raised through further restrictions on interest relief on rental property, including restriction of relief on rental properties".In a downturn such as that which we are experiencing, the areas that must be protected are those where jobs are being created.  In addition, we must protect those who are losing their jobs.  As a result, there is a need to examine the position with regard to the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Social and Family Affairs, Education and Science and Health and Children and ensure they are protected.  I do not buy the argument being put forward by those who represent the Government to the effect that the money required had to be obtained from within the social welfare budget.  We should find that money elsewhere and we should ensure that those who are most vulnerable are protected.  What we should be doing is targeting those who can afford the services of accountants and who can stash away their money.  These people will not be spending their money in the economy.  The Minister can rest assured that practically every cent of the Christmas bonus would have gone back into local economies throughout the country next December.  There is no doubt but that those economies, local shops and the people who would have received the bonus need the money.It is not an exaggeration to state that the Government is cancelling Christmas for many families.  All Members are in direct contact with ordinary families within their constituencies and they will be aware that these people spend their bonus money on food for Christmas dinner, presents for grandparents and the fuel required to provide extra heat at that time of year.  Discontinuing the bonus will cause genuine hardship for the most vulnerable people.Before coming into the House, I carried out a Google search on the name "Scrooge".  Everyone perceives Scrooge to be the man who tried to cancel Christmas until three ghosts appeared to him and taught him the error of his ways.  As a result of my search, I came across a definition on Wikipedia which states that it is usually assumed that Scrooge is a banker or professional moneylender.  That says it all with regard to the recent budget.  The only people who will benefit from the latter are bankers and professional moneylenders.  Such moneylenders — be they legal or illegal — will benefit because increasing numbers of people will be obliged to borrow money from them because otherwise they will simply not be able to afford everything they need for Christmas.The recent budget was a matter of both priorities and economics.  The economics are that if people do not have money to spend at Christmas, then their local economies will not benefit and businesses and others will feel the strain.  The hardship that will occur is an extremely serious matter for the families which will be affected by the removal of the bonus.I received an e-mail from the Senior Citizens Parliament, which points out that the Christmas bonus was first paid in 1955.  There was not a great deal of money floating around at that stage and many people emigrated to England to try to earn some to send back to their families.  The e-mail also states that, according to Dáil records, a bonus of a double week was paid in 1955.  It further states that eventually in the 1980s the principle of a payment to all in receipt of social welfare payments of all types was achieved.  It points out that this was a progressive development and one which was greatly needed and appreciated.  The e-mail also states that if the country was in a position to pay the bonus in 1955, then surely €156 million can be found to ensure that it is paid in December of this year and in future years.If the 1950s were bad for this country's economy, so were the 1980s.  However, whoever was in power between 1955 and today — the Minister's party was in office for the majority of the period — managed to pay the Christmas bonus.  Even though we are experiencing a downturn, we still have a great deal of money but the first thing that is being cut is the Christmas bonus.  This will affect the most vulnerable.It is a matter of choosing priorities and those in Cabinet have a duty in this regard.  I do not accept the argument that the money must be taken from specific areas and that the Department must make savings within its budget.  That is why the Labour Party has specifically chosen not to identify areas within the Department's budget from which the money could be obtained.  We are of the view that this money should be procured through a reduction in the interest relief on rental property.  Such interest relief goes into the pockets of the kind of people who are quite likely to fly to New York to do their Christmas shopping, whereas those in receipt of the Christmas bonus will most definitely not do so.  It is for these reasons that I suggest that not only is the discontinuance of the bonus extraordinarily Scrooge-like in the context of its effect on the most vulnerable in society, it is also extraordinarily bad economics.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	248	Deputy Jan O'Sullivan referred to Scrooge, who is a character in A Christmas Carol  by Charles Dickens.  The Victorians — quite possibly in the form of Dickens — invented the modern concept of Christmas.  The opening line of A Christmas Carol  is: “Marley was dead: to begin with.”  The opening line of the Government’s history could well be “The Celtic tiger was dead to begin with”.  The Celtic tiger died because the Government neglected it and instead overfed fat cat bankers and developers and others who filed into the Galway tent each year.  That is why we are in the circumstances in which we currently find ourselves.  Instead of a Celtic tiger, we now have fat cats.While we continue to bail out the fat cat bankers and developers, the payment made once a year to the most vulnerable in society is being removed.  This payment amounts to approximately €240 and it is issued at the time of the year when people need it most.  The overall cost of the bonus is a mere pittance when compared to the amount we have invested in trying to bail out the banks, to what will be the eventual cost relating to the national asset management agency or, as Deputy Burton refers to it, the "banana bank" and to the cost of PPARS and similar projects — such as that involving the e-voting machines — which are an example of the waste that marks this Government's tenure.  The removal of the bonus indicates where the Government's priorities lie.We were led to believe that the sun shone continually for the past ten years.  As soon as a rainy day arrived, however, the Government went after the vulnerable, namely, the elderly and those on long-term social welfare payments.  It is these individuals who are taking the hit.  There is a perverse logic to the position adopted by the Government in respect of the motion.  It has stated that because we are not identifying areas of the social welfare budget from which the money might be taken, it will not accept the motion.  The logic behind the Government's argument is that in order to assist certain poor people, it must take money from other poor people.There are many areas from which the money required could be obtained.  Income tax was increased in the budget — by means of the levy — but nothing was done to tax the wealthy.  Action could have been taken in the context of removing the Cinderella clause that applies in respect of tax exiles or ending the tax breaks given to property investors — who benefit to the tune of €500 million per year — and others.  The money is there to pay for the Christmas bonus, but it is a case of changing priorities and direction.  Unfortunately, the Government has failed in this regard.What is striking about the Christmas bonus is that those who receive it do not even spend it on themselves.  Instead, they spend it on their grandchildren or on buying presents.  They might spend it on a turkey for a family gathering over Christmas or so that there is a bottle of whiskey in the house in case a neighbour calls in.  This money is not going to a tax exile in Portugal or to a tax haven, it is being spent in local shops and supermarkets, stimulating the local economy.  The Government is looking at this in terms of savings without considering the local economic context or individual circumstances.In my constituency, Fianna Fáil backbenchers and Government Senators have mentioned their discomfort over this issue.  I have listened to them crying crocodile tears on local radio about it.  They have an option today, they can relieve their discomfort by voting to support this motion.  Although it is a cliché, if they do not support it, they are turkeys voting for Christmas because when I am out canvassing, the cutting of the Christmas bonus is being raised by the public on every doorstep.I also hear on the doorsteps that we are all the same.  We are not all the same, there is a clear difference that distinguishes the Labour Party from the Government.  We are not going to be in Government no matter what the circumstances, we will not stand over everything.  There are some areas where a line must be drawn.  The public recalls that when it was proposed that VAT be introduced on children's shoes, the Labour Party walked out of Government because it was an unacceptable tax on the poor and the vulnerable.  We would have also walked out of Government on this issue.Where are the lines drawn for this Government?  Deputy Rabbitte put it eloquently a week ago when he explained that the Green Party had become so entrenched in Government that no longer will the Greens walk out on Fianna Fáil but Fianna Fáil will walk out on the Greens.Returning to Dickens's  A Christmas Carol, Scrooge has been treated unfairly since the book was published.  The novel closes with talk of Scrooge’s generosity because the story is about redemption, where someone who was miserly at the start became very generous.  We know that Fianna Fáil cannot be redeemed.  If it is to be rehabilitated, it must happen on the Opposition benches because it will never be rehabilitated while in Government.The most poignant scene in the novel is the ghost of Christmas present drawing back his cloak to show two wretched children.  Scrooge asks who these children are and the ghost replies that the boy is ignorance and the girl is want, and that Scrooge should beware of them both, particularly ignorance.  The ignorance the public has endured about Fianna Fáil and this Government in recent years is long past and the Minister should beware of it because the members of the public are waiting for the Government on the doorsteps.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	249	The Minister should stop picking on the weakest in society.  The cutting of the Christmas bonus has caused an unprecedented public response and not only among those who will lose it; other people who are employed refer to it as a miserable act.The Government amendment states that €223 million is needed to fill the gap, a substantial amount.  Government speakers all say that this must come from the social welfare budget but my colleagues have all highlighted that this should not be the case, there should be procedures in place to act on the need to call in money from other sources.  We have listed those sources and they include off-shore accounts, rental income paid to overseas landlords renting houses in this country, tax relief for rental income and a real plan to tax high earners.  There are many ways to make savings and get the money, and it does not need to be from the social welfare budget.Suggesting that all social welfare recipients would lose money if the Christmas bonus was retained is incorrect, there are other ways to go about this.  The most vulnerable will be punished by this miserly attack.  I have listened to the sad stories being told by pensioners about losing this small cushion that they depend on at Christmas.  It goes on small gifts for grandchildren and the Christmas food and the luxury they could not otherwise afford, such as visits to family and cards for neighbours who have helped out during the year.  These are quality of life issues that must be made available.Some of them mention the extra heating costs or the taxi they might be able to afford for one night out, this is not a luxury they indulge in during the year.  These people are not living the high life, the Christmas bonus allowed them to top up a little on the basics.  Most of them are sad and disappointed, but the anger is coming from those looking in on the situation who recognise the impact it will have on the elderly.I was talking to a young man who is in receipt of the disability allowance.  He cannot work and never will, this is his income for the rest of his life.  He needs his "old banger" of a car to get to the shops and frequently to the hospital.  He is now worried that he will have to cut back on heating, food or some other basic because of the loss of this bonus.  This man is meticulous about his budget, measuring out his money on a weekly basis, exactly aware of his expenditure, unless an emergency arises.  It is for those emergencies that he wants to set aside a little extra.  The Christmas bonus allowed a small degree of flexibility to plan for emergencies.  He pointed out that his family are generous and supportive and that they can supplement his income on occasion.  He treasures his independence, however, he does not want to ask for help, it damages his pride if he does.He is in the fortunate position of having a supportive family because there are many who do not have that.  Those people might find themselves turning to moneylenders.  We are not imagining this, it is a fact.  These people are vulnerable and the last thing they need is a further threat from the debt collector when he calls in his debts.It is easy to say to those on social welfare that the cost of living has dropped.  For most of them this has little bearing on real life.  They cannot access those places where there is good value because they do not have a car.  They are dependent on local convenience stores that are often much more expensive.  Telling them about the drop in the cost of living is pointless, it has no meaning. During the week an elderly woman, who is diabetic, talked to me at length about her situation.  The quality of her food is very important for her.  Again, I do not claim the €230 or so at Christmas would take care of that problem entirely but she pointed out that it would have been a help and given her a little support.A chiropodist contacted me yesterday — he has also contacted many of my colleagues — about the charge for chiropody which affects people with medical cards.  He particularly mentioned elderly people and people who are diabetic.  Once again, they are the hardest hit by the budget.  If their current social welfare payments do not allow them to pay the extra charge that is demanded of them, as any little amount they have set aside will be eroded, he pointed out that they will not go for the visit to the chiropodist that they badly need.  That will have huge long-term consequences.  I put that problem against the background of somebody already being on a very meagre budget.  One can see how important €220 or €230 is to them.Mention should also be made of the suspension of the community support programme.  I realise it is not dealt with by the Minister's Department but it is important in this context.  It is under the remit of the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  It involves a small amount of money but it is having a huge impact on the safety, security and quality of life of elderly people.  I have received numerous complaints about it.  Again, somebody will have to pick up the tab for it, whether it is directly by way of putting in place the cost of the pendant alarms and so forth or the family will once again be called on to provide that support.  Otherwise, people will live in fear.These are small items but, collectively, the cuts amount to a threat to the safety and security of certain categories of social welfare recipients.  These are not the type of people who will be drinking fine wine, eating caviar or heading abroad for their Christmas break.  They will be struggling to make ends meet to provide the little bit of luxury they might have hoped to have for Christmas.  It is a mean and miserable cut and I ask the Minister to reverse it.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	250	Given the times in which we are living, when there is such turmoil not just in this country but also in other parts of the world, although it is far worse in this country, one would wonder why losing the Christmas bonus is having such an impact.  The difficulty with losing the Christmas bonus is that the people who receive it never benefited in the first place from the ten years of boom this country experienced.  Being on long-term social welfare payments, regardless of what they were, meant one's income was fixed.  The people who did not benefit from the type of excesses we saw in this country are now being hit with probably the meanest cut of all.The argument is made that this is a discretionary payment.  Why, therefore, would somebody be so upset when it is gone?  When Fianna Fáil was in Opposition it had a slogan, which resonated with the entire country, that cuts affect the old, the sick and the poor.  I do not blame this Minister entirely for what has happened.  The social welfare budget did not drop out of the sky; it is part of the package the Minister for Finance put together.  It was a little rich of him today to tell Members of the Opposition that we are living in a bubble.  There was a bubble all right, and I would not like to say where it was.  It was not outside of anyone's body, but inside.  It was also a little rich of him today to criticise the Opposition for not knowing what is happening in the country.  We have been trying to tell him for the past two years what has been happening.The old were the first to be hit, through the medical card.  That issue was half resolved.  The poor are now being hit, as are people who are sick or who have a disability.  However, I must pay tribute to the Minister.  It was proposed in one of the budgets — there have been three in quick succession — that people with a disability would not receive disability allowance until they were 18 years old, as opposed to the current position where they receive it at 16 years of age.  When the hard facts were pointed out to the Minister, she reversed the decision.  I pay tribute to her for that.  I now ask her to seriously examine this particular measure and reverse it.All Members are canvassing at present.  In the free time we have we usually find ourselves on somebody's doorstep.  Some mornings ago I was doing that and spoke to a woman whose husband has been ill for many years.  She asked about the Christmas bonus.  I told her we would do our best to have the decision reversed.  I asked her what she does with the Christmas bonus.  She told me that in November, when the bonus is paid, she usually has the children's clothes put aside and she pays for them with the bonus.  As soon as that is done, she said, she starts on the other things for Christmas.We can talk all we like about the notion that social welfare is discretionary and not a right.  One can argue that it is insurance or contribution based.  I happen to believe that if we intend to look after people who do not have the financial wherewithal to look after themselves, it should be a right.  However, that is a different argument.  Nevertheless, how does one lower the expectations of children?  How does one tell children that one cannot afford a toy this year, without shattering the illusion of Christmas?  It is an illusion, but it is a nice illusion and one that we have built up and encouraged.  It is one of the few nice times during the year from which children benefit.  How does one shatter that illusion for children?  How does one start lowering their expectations?There are all sorts of arguments and one hears them every day.  This Government might seem to be floundering around in some type of unreality but it has done some things very deliberately which worry me.  It started with setting the public sector against the private sector.  That was a very deliberate campaign which bore fruit.  We will see the consequences of it in the next few years.  It has now set about dividing the workers from the people who depend on the State.  One can hear it rippling everywhere.  That worries me even more.  We will all pay for that type of division eventually because it divides society.  It boxes people away, which worries me.  We should never allow that to happen.One can say that people on very limited incomes should manage their money better.  However, I have never seen the poor at sales.  The reason one does not see the poor at sales is that they do not have enough money to go to them.  They never have enough to set aside money to build up a lump sum so they can go to the sales and pick up the bargains the rest of us get.  The people on social welfare about whom I worry more than others, as I have said to the Minister previously, are the people who are by themselves, the lone parents or single people living alone.  They are the people who suffer most from a decision such as this.  All the research shows that lone parents and people with children are most likely to fall into poverty.  They are the people who need this bonus more than anybody else.I have praised the Minister for reversing the decision on disability allowance.  I now urge her to re-examine this decision.  We hear she is enjoying huge success in the elimination of fraud.  She should have another look at the budget and see if it is possible to reinstate this once-off annual payment on which so many people have come to rely.  It is not as if this is something new.  It is something that people on limited incomes factor into their budgets every year.  Removing it will cause enormous hardship.
#MichaelFinneranFF	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-party	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	251	I thank the Deputies who have contributed to this debate, both last night and today.  Members on all sides of the House are genuinely concerned about the impact the cancellation of the Christmas bonus payment will have on all long-term social welfare recipients, especially those persons who are unemployed and pensioners.  The Government shares that concern and as the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, outlined in her speech last night, this was a difficult decision to make and one which would not have been made but for the current economic climate.In the context of very tough decisions having to be made across the whole range of Government expenditure, the provision of €21.3 billion for social welfare services in 2009 — 20% more than the amount spent in 2008 — is a clear demonstration of the Government's commitment to protecting the vulnerable and providing income support to the increasing number of people who are losing their jobs.  In the past decade there have been significant increases in welfare payments, with child benefit increasing from €44 to €166 per month; the State contributory pension increasing from €113 to €230 per week and the rate of jobseeker's allowance being raised from €93 to €204 per week.The Government regrets that social welfare cuts had to be made but it was simply not possible to avoid them.  Savings must be made in some areas of social welfare expenditure in order to keep the welfare budget at a level the State can afford this year and to absorb the additional expenditure on social welfare payments resulting from the sharp rise in unemployment.  Cuts in social welfare have been kept to a minimum at just €300 million in the context of a 2009 budget of €21.3 billion.In deciding where to achieve the savings in welfare expenditure there were no easy options and everything had to be considered, including a general cut in all weekly social welfare payment rates which the Government avoided.  In fact, as recently as January 2009 weekly welfare rates were increased by the 3% plus provided for in the budget of October last at a time when 2.5% inflation was predicted for 2009.  As Deputies are aware, the forecast has changed significantly with a drop of 4% in the consumer price index now expected for this year.The payment of a full Christmas bonus in 2009 would cost an estimated €223 million.  We appreciate that the decision not to pay a Christmas bonus in 2009 will be difficult for people even if it has been possible to give more than eight months' notice to those affected, but we genuinely believe that savings in other areas of welfare expenditure could have caused greater hardship.  The alternative of cutting all weekly payments would have a much greater effect on households.In response to the Private Members' proposition that the required savings could be made through further fraud control and restriction on interest relief on rental property, the Minister confirmed in her speech last night that control measures are also being intensified to reduce the incidence of social welfare fraud and to effect savings.  Those control activities will continue to be prioritised.  Furthermore, the Minister for Finance provided in the supplementary budget for the restriction of interest relief for rental properties this year.  In other words, it has been necessary to adopt a wide range of measures to address our unprecedented fiscal crisis.  It is simply wrong to suggest that the cancellation of the Christmas bonus could readily have been avoided simply by taking other measures.The Minister, Deputy Hanafin, indicated on budget day and again last night that if there is a financial windfall or additional savings then the bonus will be the first payment to be restored.  What the Minister said is on record.  I wish to conclude by assuring the House that the Government will reconsider the payment of the Christmas bonus as soon as we are out of the current economic situation.  In the meantime we will do our very best to continue to help people who are under financial pressure.

If we are to be judged by this Fianna Fáil proposal to withdraw the Christmas bonus we will be judged very harshly.  Not since Ernest Blythe took the shilling off the old age pensioners has such a mean and lousy, uncaring and miserable proposal come from an Irish Government.  The Minister puts Scrooge in the ha'penny place and she will go down in history as the one who stole Christmas from the poor.  The Minister's proposal is base, low, vile, cruel, nasty, dismal, shabby, unkind, wretched and niggardly.  The Minister is despicable for bringing forward her rotten proposal.  She should be ashamed of herself.  But of course never having experienced a day's poverty in her life and cosseted from such by her upper middle class lifestyle she has neither sympathy for nor empathy with the poor.  She is poorly equipped to run the Department of Social and Family Affairs.

#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	256	The poor need a champion and the Minister simply does not fit that bill.The Christmas bonus is a recognition of the additional costs that arise during the festive season and it is intended to allow those of our citizens who cannot afford those costs to take part in the Christmas festival like everyone else.  It is a recognition of their worth to the rest of us.  It removes some of the stress and worry that is characteristic of poverty.  It allows a little sweetness and light to enter people's lives.  Now the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, and the new Minister of State, Deputy Áine Brady, propose to put out that light and withdraw any possibility of sweetness at Christmas.  They should be ashamed of themselves.Who are the people who will be adversely affected by this Fianna Fáil proposal?  Who are the people the Fianna Fáil Party in government has selected for special brutal treatment?  Who has Fianna Fáil decided are best able to fund the developers and the bankers' excesses?  They include old age pensioners, disabled people, the long-term unemployed, the blind, widows and carers, single parents and others.  Is Fianna Fáil seriously saying those citizens who are worthy of our care and support should pay for the bloody bankers by having their Christmas abolished?  Again I say, shame on Fianna Fáil.I come from a Fianna Fáil family and background and I am very aware of the old ethos of that extended family.  I recall being told of Mr. Blythe taking the shilling from the old age pensioners and the attendant message that the weakest in our society must be protected.  That then was the Fianna Fáil ethos.  My late father would turn in his grave if he knew how far the party had shifted from that earlier and honourable position.The abolition of the Christmas bonus is a benchmark.  It is a crossing of the line.  It is a point of no return for Fianna Fáil.  Those on whom it depended to put it in this House will hear their message.  Fianna Fáil has abandoned them and they will pay back Fianna Fáil in kind.  There are many decent, honourable men and women representing Fianna Fáil in this House.  I know from talking to them that this proposal is the opposite to all in which they believe.  It cuts across the ethos of fairness and justice that they hold dear as well, and which they seek to uphold as Members of this House.  I appeal to them to stand by their principles, to reject this rotten, mean proposal by either voting against the proposal and for the Labour proposition that the Christmas bonus be reinstated or if that is a bridge too far, to abstain when the vote is called.The Government proposal to abolish the Christmas bonus for welfare recipients will adversely and severely affect approximately 1 million citizens.  The money saved will be used to bail out the rotten banks and the building speculators who are long-time friends of Fianna Fáil.  Welfare recipients did not cause the problems we now face and why should they pay to bail out those who caused the problem?
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	257	In concluding the debate, I thank all Members who contributed to the debate on this Labour Party motion.  I thank especially Deputy Shortall for introducing the motion to the House.In a way the Christmas bonus is a bit of a misnomer.  It is not a bonus, it is a payment that pensioners, people on disability payments, and people who are on social welfare payments have now come to expect will be paid to them at Christmas time.  It has been paid in one form or another since 1980.  The Government treats the payment as if it were some kind of Christmas present from Fianna Fáil.  It is treated in much the same way as some kind of national lottery grant.  There is a grand announcement every year from the Minister for Social and Family Affairs — formerly the Minister for Social Welfare — that the Christmas payment will be made.  It may well be that later in 2009, depending on the state of the finances, a Fianna Fáil Minister, acting as some kind of latter-day Santa Claus, will announce that the payment is to be partially reinstated, or reinstated for some of its former recipients, in some way that would cynically seek to make political gains on the issue.Either the Government is absolutely determined that the bonus will not be paid in 2009 or it is announcing its abolition so its payment will be all the sweeter when a Fianna Fáil Minister announces its reinstatement in some shape or form.  The reality is that the payment is one that pensioners, people on disability allowances and social welfare payments have come to expect.  It is the payment grandparents use to buy presents for their grandchildren.  It is the payment used by people on social welfare to ensure there is some degree of festive cheer at Christmas among families and in households that are not well off.The consequence of the removal of the payment is that those on low incomes and social welfare payments who are living in poverty will turn to where they turned in the past in times of financial difficulty, that is, to moneylenders.  The only two groups who had reason to cheer as a result of the budget announced by the Government two weeks ago were moneylenders and property developers.  Property developers' vacant properties and unfinished housing estates and developments will now be taken off their hands by "an bord bail out", the new agency the Government intends to establish.  Moneylenders must envisage considerable opportunities for themselves to rifle and exploit again those in poor circumstances.  We have already seen the reports of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul on the consequences of moneylending and its resurgence in the climate in which we find ourselves.The Minister seeks to justify the abolition of the payment on grounds of cost.  Deputy Shortall addressed that issue very comprehensively last night by pointing out that the cost is not as great as is being protested by Ministers.  The payment is always spent and is not pocketed by the people who receive it.  When it is made, it is spent in the retail sector within a matter of days or weeks.  It is used to buy the Christmas presents for children and other family members.  Straight away, therefore, there is a return to the State in the form of VAT.  This return will not accrue if the payment is abolished.  Since the payment is spent in the retail sector, it will go into the pay packets of those who work in retail businesses, from which the State will recoup another portion of the payment in the form of income tax, PRSI and income levies.  What is not recouped in the form of income tax and VAT will be used in turn by businesses to help them pay the rates they owe to local authorities.  The reality is that the bulk of the Christmas payment will be returned to the State if it is made.  This has not been considered in the calculation.In our motion, as in our pre-budget statement, we set out a number of areas in which the Government could have raised revenue had it so wished and had it been minded to consider those individuals in our economy and society who are in a better position to pay.  There are ways in which revenue can be raised, including by way of closing off tax reliefs and shelters.  I do not propose to detail them now but it is interesting to note that the Government, instead of identifying them, looked to those who are poorest in society, as it did in the previous budget, to pay the cost of the profligacy of the past decade.  The first people to be targeted were pensioners, followed by special needs children.  Then pensioners were targeted again in addition to people on disability payments in receipt of the Christmas payment.We will vote on this motion in a few moments.  Let me address a number of Members of the House on how they will vote.  I ask Deputies Healy-Rae and Lowry directly to vote with us on this motion.  We all understand the way politics works and that the two Deputies signed up in June 2007 to support the Government in the course of the life of this Dáil.  I know both would want to honour that agreement with the Government.  We have never seen the content of the agreement but I am certain, from knowing both Deputies, that they never signed up to an agreement with the Government to support taking the Christmas payment from old age pensioners and those on disability allowances.  It would not dishonour them in this House to vote against a measure to which they never signed up to support and do not, in honour, have to support now.  They are not bound by whatever agreement they made with the Government to support the measure today.  If they support it, they cannot go back to their constituencies and say they were voting in order to honour an agreement they made with the Government.  There is no such agreement.  I challenge both Deputies to show any Member of the House where they made an agreement stating they would vote with the Government to take the Christmas payment off old age pensioners and those on disability allowances.Deputy Mary White, deputy leader of the Green Party, stood on the plinth on the night of the budget and said there were green fingerprints all over the budget.  The only green fingerprints I can see all over it are those of the fingers that are picking the pockets of the poorest people in this country by depriving them of the Christmas payment.  Are those the green fingerprints Deputy White told the people were all over the budget?I studied the programme for Government and saw the agreement to which the Green Party signed up in June 2007.  Nowhere in that agreement is there any statement that the Green Party would support the taking away of the Christmas payment from pensioners and others in need thereof.  There is nothing in the programme for Government that commits the Green Party to supporting the measure.  The only reason it would support the measure today is to stay in office.  They only reason its members will end up going through the lobby or voting in favour of it today is if they feel it does not matter and that the people who are on pensions and disability payments can be sacrificed.  These recipients can go away with green finger-marks on their backs because they have been let down by people who are more interested in saving their own seats at Cabinet and associated privileges.The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, often gives us short pious homilies when he appears on "Six One News" to justify things he will not do in Cabinet but tells us all we must do them after he has made decisions on them.  He should appear on "Six One News" again to tell the pensioners, those who are on disability payments and the poorest people in the country why the Green Party supports taking the Christmas payment from them.This is the moment when Members must vote on this issue and there is no escaping.  There is no justification for them going back to their constituencies or their parties to offer some kind of political explanation as to why they did it.  There is no political or moral justification for voting in favour of taking the Christmas payment from the poorest people in the country.

In conclusion, I want to suggest something else which I have noticed over a long period of years in this House, namely, the reluctance of those responsible for social policy to explicitly state what are their assumptions about the people who are recipients.It is very clear from what we have heard so far from the Minister that there is no acceptance of the concept of a floor below which nobody would be allowed to fall in terms of some kind of citizenship.  Over the years, when I was in my other life and lecturing in this area, there were usually three models of social policy.  The first was where one regarded it as a residuum of economic activity — one spent what one had left over to spend.  The second model was when one assumed the economy operated in a way that required compensation — one had to correct the effect of the economy — and this was usually the basis for most of the insurance driven policies.  The third was the great proposals following the Second World War, introduced by a British Labour Government, which argued that one should have an egalitarian emphasis and, therefore, there should be a floor below which one's citizens should never sink into poverty.  This is the view of the late and great Professor Titmuss and others in Britain.What is very clear is that the present Government is following the miserable notion of a residual theory of its population and, therefore, one finds this in the second last paragraph of the Minister's speech, where it is stated: "It is important for each of the savings measures to be considered in the context of the overall economic situation and the need for immediate action to reduce the major gap between public income and expenditure."  In other words, all of those who will be affected by this Bill must pay for the gap that was created by shabby and outrageously neglectful Governments and several institutions responsible to the State, as well as irresponsible behaviour by speculative builders, assisted by equally treacherous bankers with no commitment to the public good.  The public good having been betrayed by all of these, do they pay for the situation?  If the goal is as stated in the second last paragraph of the Minister's speech, and if there is a gap to be bridged, do they bridge that gap?  No, they do not.  We have just been debating how the poorest of the poor will pay at Christmas.Right through this Bill, there is another streak, namely, the extraordinary emphasis on an anti-young people ideology.  I support the elimination of any and every obstacle to a person who wants to get back to education, enter training or upskill.  However, if that is the case, why does a person have to remain two years unemployed?  What we have in the Minister's speech are a few deceitful camouflages, suggesting, for example, that a few hours in pre-school is a better and more efficient way to substitute for child supplement.  This Bill is an outrageous use of the poorest people, who have no choice and no discretion, as pawns to pay for those to whom the Government will not turn its attention.  This is why the Bill should be opposed.

However, in broad terms, the purpose of the Bill is to underpin the social welfare system, which it is very important to do, through sustainable public finances.  The fact is that in the supplementary budget the rates enjoyed by the vast majority of social welfare recipients have been protected.  There has been no general reduction in rates despite the transformation of the price outlook between last October, when the rates were set for this year, and now.  I was just leafing through the memoirs of a former Taoiseach of the 1980s, Dr. Garret FitzGerald.  According to his own account, he spent a lot of time worrying about over-indexation of social welfare payments.  As far as I am aware, it is not a word that has crossed this Minister's lips.The previous debate which is relevant to this one concerned the Christmas bonus, which, incidentally, was introduced by Deputy Michael Woods in 1980 when he was Minister for Social Welfare.  Of course, it was stopped for two or three years by the Fine Gael-Labour coalition in the mid-1980s.  I do not remember much rhetoric from that side of the House——

It was done, defended and voted on, even by as passionate a person as Deputy Michael D. Higgins, during the mid-1980s.  Sometimes the rhetoric we use in this House is overblown and not particularly consistent with what was done by parties in government.As we know, the public finances are very stretched at the moment.  One of the reasons they are stretched is the economic situation.  The rise in unemployment is leading to the social welfare bill being €21.3 billion, which is approximately 30% of the budget on the expenditure side.  It is an 8.7% increase on what was envisaged last October and a 20% increase year on year.  These figures were contained in the Minister's speech.  Maintaining those levels of payments in current circumstances is a real achievement by the Government.  By and large, this is recognised outside the House.  The vast majority of the criticism of the budget, including in this House, has been that it is so-called hammering the middle classes and the coping classes, and all the rest of it.  There is an implicit recognition that the social welfare system has been largely protected.  I make a point in passing that my office, the Office of Public Works, is working with the Department of Social and Family Affairs on increasing and improving accommodation for applicants in the current situation.Among the measures in the Bill is a substantial increase in the employee PRSI ceiling.  There is no ceiling on the employers' side.  By definition, that affects the better off.  It is a form of solidarity.  It has been quite a sharp rise but many commentators advocate that the ceiling should have been lifted altogether.I would take the view, and I thought I heard such a view being tentatively expressed by the Labour Party spokesperson on finance as an initial reaction on budget night or the following day, that the reduction in the jobseeker's allowance payment to the under 20s might not necessarily be such a regressive matter.  We do not want people at that young age to habituate themselves to being unemployed.I again compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, on the substitution of a preschool year for the early childhood payment.  Listening to Deputy Higgins, one would never know that it had been Labour Party policy for some years to have an extra preschool year.  I believe it is a concrete substitution of a money grant which, of course, could be expended on any purpose, with something from which children will definitely benefit.As with all housing subsidies. there is a tendency for the rent supplement at whatever the level to be used to the benefit of the landlord.  Part of the intention with this change is to put downward pressure on rents.  I am very pleased, as are people in my constituency, that the carers allowance was left untouched.This is the centenary of the introduction of the old age pension in 1909 by David Lloyd George.  Our social welfare system has made considerable progress since that date.  Unemployment assistance was introduced by Fianna Fáil in 1933.  Children's allowance was introduced by Seán Lemass in 1944.  In the late 1960s and early 1970s Charles Haughey introduced the free schemes.  In a position of bipartisanship, I acknowledge that after we joined the EEC the Fine Gael and Labour national coalition Government made substantial improvements in social welfare payments.  In the turbulent years from 1980 to 1982, there were three years when there were 25% increases albeit at a time when inflation was in the high teens.  None the less, that was a commitment.  After 1987 there was implementation of the Commission on Social Welfare recommendations, which the previous Fine Gael and Labour Government had claimed was unaffordable.  After 1997, pensions and child benefit were increased.  The old age contributory pension in 1997 was £78 and today it is €230.  Child benefit was £30 and is €166 today, which is a very substantial increase.An article in today's edition of The Irish Times expresses deep dissatisfaction with the political system.  From time to time people suggest that if only we had bankers, economists and philosopher kings in government how much better the system would be.  Fortunately today not many people will recommend putting bankers into government — not after what has happened.  I remember in 1987 when Charles Haughey was at a bankers’ dinner and one of them recommended putting a couple of bankers in as Ministers, he said to them: “You look after your business and we’ll look after ours.”  The problem is a misunderstanding of the nature of politics.  It is not just about finding what is the right decision but actually making it happen and persuading people that it is the right way to go.  As the man who first introduced the pension, David Lloyd George, told Irish negotiators during the treaty negotiations: “The politician who thinks he can deal out abstract justice without references to forces around him cannot govern.”
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	266	The measures which are being introduced to implement the decisions announced in the recent budget have, as we know, been driven by the need to achieve a very significant level of Exchequer savings in this year and over the course of several years to come.  In this context, it is particularly welcome that the need to achieve real savings in Government expenditure is being accompanied by the most important policy development for preschool children in the history of the State, the introduction of a free preschool year in early years care and education.As a result, the cessation of the early child care supplement payment to parents of preschool children from the end of this year will be followed immediately, from January 2010, by the introduction of the new scheme in early years care and education for children in their preschool year.  This is a development which is to be much welcomed and the response which I have had from the sector over the past two weeks has very strongly endorsed this view.When the early child care supplement was introduced in April 2006, it was criticised in many quarters because it directed resources away from more beneficial investment in early years care and education, in particular, in the form of preschool education.  Many experts in early years care and education, including bodies such as NESF, the National Women's Council of Ireland and the OECD, argued at the time and since that the funding directed into the supplement as a direct universal payment to parents, was more than twice what would have been needed to implement a free preschool care and education year targeted at preschool children.The recent National Competitiveness Council report noted that "pre-primary education is a key determinant of student performance at all levels of education as it leads to improvements in students' skills levels, motivation and the propensity to learn, which in turn raises the private and social returns from all future investments in their education".  These views are also supported by the commitment in the programme for Government to ensure that every child has access to a preschool place by 2012.  In re-evaluating the allocation of resources to the early child care supplement, ECS, the opportunity has been taken to establish a new child-centred approach to early years policy and provision and to reinvest an estimated €170 million of the savings made into the preschool year from January 2010.The preschool year will be implemented by my office and all voluntary and private preschool services which meet the requirements of the scheme will be invited to apply for entry by the end of next month.  The preschool year will run from September of each year, in line with the school year.  However, rather than delay the introduction of the scheme to September 2010, which would deny the benefit of the measure to children who are due to start primary school at that time, the preschool year will be introduced from January 2010, immediately after cessation of the ECS payments.An annual capitation grant of over €2,400 will be payable to preschool services participating in the scheme over a full year.  Parents who avail of the preschool year in a playschool will be entitled to a provision of five weekly sessions of three hours per day for 38 weeks per annum.  This amounts to a weekly capitation grant of €64.50.  Parents who avail of the preschool year in a full or part-time child care service will be entitled to 50 weeks of free preschool provision of five weekly sessions of two hours and 15 minutes per day.  This amounts to a weekly capitation grant of €48.50.  The service must reduce the weekly child care fee for parents by this amount.All children aged between three years and three months and four years and six months immediately prior to the start of each preschool year, that is on 1 September, will be eligible.  For the preschool year commencing in January 2010, children will be eligible if they are aged between three years and seven months and four years and ten months at 1 January of that year.  This is only for the first year of operation of the scheme.The preschool year will be guided by the principles of Síolta, the early years care and education framework which the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs is implementing.  This will support the provision of a high quality environment for children in this important year.  Services participating in the scheme will be supported by Síolta co-ordinators who will work with my office and the city and county child care committees.  The introduction of the preschool year in early childhood care and education is an historic step in the development of Ireland's early childhood care policy and, that this step is being taken at this time of economic crisis and budgetary constraint, makes it all the more remarkable and demonstrates the recognition which is being given to the importance of investing in our children's futures.The early child care supplement was introduced under Part 4A of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, as inserted by section 28 of the Social Welfare Law Reform and Pensions Act 2006.  Section 8 of the Social Welfare Bill 2009, which amends Part 4A of the 2005 Act, provides for the reduction of the early child care supplement to half-rate, that is €41.50 per month, with effect from 1 May 2009.  As the supplement is paid monthly in arrears, this means that the first payment to be affected by the change will be the June payment.  Section 8 also provides for the abolition of the payment from the end of this year.  Section 8(2) of the Bill provides that Part 4A of the 2005 Act shall cease to have effect on 1 January 2010.  However, as the supplement is paid in arrears, and as the provision in Part 4A of the 2005 Act refers to the period in which a person qualifies for the payment, the appropriate date on which to terminate the supplement is 1 December 2009.  This will result in the termination of payments under the scheme with effect from 1 January 2010.As the Bill as initiated incorrectly provides for termination from 1 January 2010, I wish to advise the House that a technical amendment to amend that date to 1 December 2009 will be introduced on Committee Stage.  It was the Government's decision that payments of early child care supplement would cease in 2009, to be replaced by the free preschool year from January 2010.  This amendment will give effect to the Government's decision and provide that the final payment of the supplement will be made to parents in December 2009.

#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	269	A number of figures jump out at us from the Minister's speech.  One in particular that is a cause of concern is that the revised live register figures showed an initial estimate last October of 290,000, a figure that has now been recalculated to 440,000.  We now face extra costs of €1.97 billion for social welfare payments this year.  This is horrendous.  One thing that seems to be missing from the Government's strategy and thinking is the area of job creation and incentivisation.  This should be our priority.The changes in the back to work enterprise allowance are interesting.  People who are self-employed are, obviously, people with initiative.  The back to work enterprise allowance is designed to encourage such people to set up their own businesses, which is welcome.  Other speakers have mentioned some of the issues in that regard, but I will not go into them now.  However, I would like to draw attention to the plight of those people who were self-employed until recently, but who have now lost their work and businesses.  I understand these people are not eligible for the jobseeker's benefit payment because of the rate of PRSI they paid.  Neither are they eligible for the jobseeker's allowance because of their income in the previous years.  They may have children in college, but because of their previous income these are not eligible for maintenance payments.I have met some such people who now have absolutely no income.  Their business is gone and they have no income.  In many cases, this has happened through no fault of their own.  These people worked hard all their lives, set up their businesses and toiled at them and paid their dues and taxes.  They have paid their way, but are now left hanging out to dry.  I see no provision in the Bill to assist these people.  The least the Minister should consider should be to make the jobseeker's allowance available to them, which would mean a change in the legislation.  At least they would then be able to claim that allowance.  Currently, these people have no income and when any savings they have are gone, they are left with nothing.  I appeal to the Minister to make provision for these people straight away.The early education and care area is also of interest.  We were told the early child care supplement was introduced to cover child care costs.  Child care costs include early education and as studies have shown, the quality of early education is important and has a profound impact into the future.  I suggest that even if early education costs are paid, high child care costs still remain.  Many families have got used to the availability of the supplement and have budgeted for it.  It might, therefore, have been a good idea to means test for it so that it could be continued for people on lower incomes.  The Minister should consider that.  When the supplement was introduced we were told it was being introduced to cover child care costs.  I criticised the measure at the time because due to the fact it operated under European legislation, it was also paid in respect of children in other countries whose parents were working here.  These were often in countries with highly developed child care and early education systems anyway.  I understand this payment will probably not continue, but I suggest we should consider keeping a payment for people who need it.  There were also issues raised in the House at the time about trying to ensure that stay at home parents were supported, as well as working parents.  This was a significant issue and was one of the reasons the Government brought in the €1,000 per annum payment at the time.With regard to changes in the back to education allowance, in her speech the Minister equated the payment third level students get from the State through grants with the payments received by the same age cohort of people who do not attend third level and said the payment for all of these should be the same.  She also spoke about incentivising people to go to work and said that was the reason she was reducing the payment.  She suggested if they received less money, they might be inclined to take up courses.  I agree young people should be encouraged and helped to take up work.  I would like to hear what additional resources the Government intends to put in place to help young people to avail of these courses or to take up work.Often, a youngster who leaves school goes straight into work.  That quite a number did so in recent years might have been a down side of the Celtic tiger.  They are now out of work.  If they are younger than 20 years of age, their payments will be halved.  If the Government does not put FÁS courses, educational opportunities and the requisite guidance in place, I would worry.  Many young people need to be guided, to have someone sit down with them to tell them what is available and how to get there, but this was not mentioned by the Minister.  In some ways, the Minister was trying to say that we should try to turn the cutbacks into a positive.  Social engineering is being brought in.The rent supplement was introduced as a short-term payment.  However, the Government's social housing policy has failed.  According to the Minister, the number receiving rent supplement has increased by 40% in 18 months and 84,000 households are in receipt of it, although we do not know how many people are involved in respect of the latter.  The payment was introduced in 2005 as a means for the State to provide long-term rental accommodation via the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, to households in receipt of rent supplement payments for 18 months or longer.Despite a budget allocation of €114 million between 2005 and 2008, only €87.5 million has been spent.  In January, I was advised that the €87.5 million has only secured private rental accommodation for approximately 9,400 households and has little impact on rent supplement costs.  However, the Minister noted that the number of transfers to RAS will increase to 9,000, given her agreement with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on a further 1,000 transfers.  Will she clarify the total number on RAS?  When RAS was introduced, the initial target for 2005 was to move 5,000 households away from long-term rent supplement dependence into permanent rental accommodation.  Five years later, not even twice that number have been moved.Trying to control rents is useful.  The State probably indirectly owns a great deal of housing that has been lying idle, given the nationalisation of one bank and our support for other banks.  Could it be used for social housing?  We need this type of imaginative movement.Reverting to my initial point on job creation, the last thing that we need is for hundreds of thousands of people to be sitting at home, staring at the wall with nothing to do.  This is bad for people's mental health.  Some commentators have even cited an increase in burglaries, claiming that people with little money and nothing else to do might decide to turn to that business, which we would not like to see occurring.  Unless we get to grips with this situation, I am concerned about social unrest.  Let us see what we can do to create and incentivise jobs and to get people back into work or training, even if it involves some type of social employment scheme.  This would be crucial.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	270	I welcome the opportunity to comment on the Bill.  I listened to a number of Fianna Fáil backbenchers, one of whom asked why anyone would want to do the Minister's job.  He sympathised with her.  There is one way to get out of both of their jobs, though, and that is to let the people speak.  The public would soon tell those on the Government side whether they should be doing those jobs.  The Bill is a far cry from the promises of two years ago.  While we were canvassing, the public was being told that the only people who could maintain the economy and do things right were those in Fianna Fáil and that no one else had the knowledge or ability.There are two vacant seats behind me, one of which belongs to the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Healy-Rae.  Neither he nor Deputy Lowry were present for the last vote.  I hope that they will return for the vote at 3.30 p.m., as it is important to know where they stand.  They were willing to support the Government after receiving written commitments from the then Taoiseach concerning the goodies that they would get.  Now that the harsh reality of a broken economy is hitting them, they are far away from where they should be.It is easy for the Government to claim that the situation is outside its control.  Where the banks are concerned, though, it has sympathy and has been able to find €7 billion to let them off the hook.  Ordinary people find it difficult to understand what an amount of €7 billion looks like.  Given the fact that those running the banks were getting between €3 million and €6 million per year in pay and bonuses and that the regulators and Ministers were working with them hand in glove, one must question who is in charge of the country and what has occurred.That the Tánaiste has discussed the need for competitiveness is interesting.  Had the issue been examined during the past 12 years, we would not have our current problems, including a social welfare bill of €21.5 billion.  If we do not turn our minds away from taxation towards returning people to employment, we are going nowhere.  While I welcome the minor changes in the back to work and educational provisions, there is no new thinking that can bring about real change and opportunity.The Government consistently says that Fine Gael and the other Opposition parties have nothing to offer.  Fine Gael tabled a detailed and realistic proposal on how 100,000 people could be returned to work during the next four years.  To say that we are not trying to develop initiatives is less than honest.  That the Government should accept this fact is important.  It is vital that our proposals be utilised by the Government, which we would gladly watch occurring.The Tánaiste and others should apologise, as they have only just realised that competitiveness is important.  Those of us who live in the Border region have known this for a long time.  We have seen opportunities north of the Border and elsewhere.  Three years ago, I highlighted in the House the problems facing Wellman International Limited.  At its factory on the Cavan-Meath border, it is paying twice as much for electricity as it does at its factory in France.  This may sound simple, but it is a difference of €2 million per year in running costs.  This situation must be evaluated in terms of jobs.It is time that we examine how to create jobs and minimise numbers on social welfare.  If we do so, we will be able to pay the Christmas bonus and maintain social welfare payments for those who need them.  However, there is no point in tinkering with the edges and refusing to deal with the real problem, namely, the regulator.  Recently, he stated that he would reduce the prices of gas and electricity.  He reduced the price of gas by 10% whereas the actual world market price has decreased by 30%.  Such a reduction would mean a great deal to the creation of jobs.Since the Bill comprises many different issues, it is more like a Finance Bill.  It addresses the early child care supplement matter.  The early child care supplement was brought in just over two years ago to much fanfare as to how it would help people to pay for child care or allow mothers to stay at home — all this sort of jazz — as it was so vital and important.However, as far as the Government was concerned and as the former Taoiseach noted, all that mattered was to stay in office.  The Government paid out the supplement under false pretences and with no intention of continuing the scheme, with the sole purpose of having the cheques in people's hands on the day before the election in order that it would be elected.
#KieranODonnell	unknown-#KieranODonnell-party	unknown-#KieranODonnell-dob	unknown-#KieranODonnell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	271	I wish to contribute to the debate by referring to a number of highly relevant comments made this morning by the Minister for Finance.  He stated that no one had come up with proposals on where the €223 million in savings could be found.  Clearly, he is not familiar with the Fine Gael document.  I can find €300 million from direct measures that could have been taken and which would not entail pursuing the vulnerable.  The use of generic, rather than branded, drugs in prescriptions would save €50 million while a carbon windfall tax on the ESB and other power generators would save €250 million.  Members should recall that ESB charges comprise one bill that hits the vulnerable and the elderly who live on their own.  While it receives free carbon credits from the State, it also charges hard-pressed people who are in receipt of social welfare or who have low incomes.  These constitute measures the Government could have introduced, rather than going for the soft touch.The Minister for Finance also claimed that Opposition Members were living in a bubble.  The only bubble was the property bubble, which was created by the Government in recent years.  It blew up the balloon, which burst like a water balloon and its tsunami effects on ordinary people include cutting the Christmas bonus to save €223 million.  My constituency colleague in Limerick East, the Minister for Defence, Deputy O'Dea, will be aware that old people living on their own and lone parents will be obliged to go to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul or to moneylenders.  The Christmas bonus allowed those in receipt of long-term social welfare who have children to buy presents for them, as well as allowing the elderly and people living on their own to afford the additional costs of fuel.  Only this week, the queues at the social welfare office on Dominick Street, Limerick, extended as far as Parnell Street.  Huge numbers of people now are queuing to claim social welfare, many of whom are in receipt of long-term social welfare, and they are being penalised for mistakes made by the Government in the past when it allowed the construction sector to run unchecked.  The IMF has stated that stabilising Ireland's banking sector will require the highest percentage of gross domestic product, of the order of €24 billion, of any developed country.I ask the Government to see reason and reinstate the Christmas bonus.  I suspect it will be obliged to so do.  It is morally wrong and, from a financial perspective, will affect the most vulnerable.  I know this from visiting people who live on their own.  While I acknowledge that people are abusing the social welfare system, others are barely getting enough on which to live.  The Government must reverse this measure and shame on it for doing away with the Christmas bonus.
#MJNolan	unknown-#MJNolan-party	unknown-#MJNolan-dob	unknown-#MJNolan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	272	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Social Welfare Bill 2009.  It is unfortunate that Members must debate such a Bill at this time of the year, but the background is the extremely difficult economic climate we are experiencing at present.  It does not affect this country alone as the world economy also is highly depressed.  However, due to our dependence on world markets, this affects us more severely than some other small countries.In her contribution on Second Stage yesterday, the Minister set out in great detail the reasons and purpose of this Bill.  One can but stress that social welfare payments constitute such a large component of the Government's expenditure.  Such payments now cost more than €21 billion of a total Government spend of €53 billion to €54 billion.  However, the figure is even more startling in the context of the percentage of the revenue stream available to the Government devoted to the cost of social welfare payments.  For this reason, it is difficult for any Minister for Social and Family Affairs to be obliged to outline savings that must be made in that Department and in the administration of social welfare payments in particular.  The Minister must look with envy at some of her predecessors who, two or three days after the Budget Statement, were able to come into the House and herald great improvements in social welfare payments and benefits.  Regrettably, matters have turned very quickly and the Minister is left with the unenviable task of ensuring that the best value for public moneys can be achieved from her Vote.I am encouraged by one aspect of the Bill in particular, which I am sure strikes a chord with many Members and with the public.  I refer to the changes the Minister proposes to make in the jobseeker's allowance that are designed to incentivise 18 and 19 year old jobseekers and to ensure that such young people, many of whom Members encounter during their work as public representatives, are not led into welfare dependency.  I have been around for long enough to have experienced this during the 1980s, when young people left school with no chance or hope and went on to social welfare straight away.  Many of them remained in that position and some have not worked since.  As a country, a nation or as a community, we cannot afford to fall back into that trap and the changes proposed in the Bill go some way towards addressing that problem.A person who is under the age of 20 who receives the maximum €204.30 rate of jobseeker's allowance at present will have that amount reduced to €100 per week henceforth.  While reducing the amount is fine, I wish to emphasise the incentives the Minister has outlined in respect of encouragement and the carrot provided at the end of it.  The full rate of the relevant scheme will be paid to 18 and 19 year olds who participate in a full-time Youthreach course for young or early school leavers.  Alternatively, those who get involved in post-leaving certificate courses also will benefit from the positive aspects of this change.The single aspect about which I am a little concerned is that, to qualify for a back to education allowance, such people must have been out of formal education for at least two years.  This creates a problem for those who have completed their leaving certificates, are 18 years old and who then apply for jobseeker's allowance.  We must ensure there is no margin for error and that individual students are encouraged at the first opportunity to undertake further education, retraining and upskilling.  There is a bonus at the end of this in that they will be entitled to the full jobseeker's allowance.I ask the Minister to examine the length of time it takes to process asylum applications, which has been brought to my attention.  Perhaps savings can be made in this regard.  I refer to the time it takes to process appeals following decisions against applications.  A number of cases have gone on for years and during that time payments are being made from the Exchequer to individuals who must be repatriated.  It is not just the cost and time of administration and processing applications and appeals.  At the end of the process the cost of flying individuals to their countries, many of which are African states, is inordinate.  I saw figures of up to €100,000 to charter a plane to bring individuals back.  At a time of economic difficulty we must examine every aspect of our expenditure and see where we can economise.  This is an area for the Minister to examine in consultation with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and savings may be possible.I welcome the announcement on the free preschool year for families, on the basis that €1 billion has been expended by various Departments on the provision of preschool places over the past number of years.  The Minister is confident that most, and I hope all, families who wish to avail of the free preschool year can do so.  It is a welcome addition.Previous speakers referred to the difficulties encountered by self-employed businesspeople in accessing social welfare.  Through no fault of their own, because of the downturn in the economy and the difficulties in accessing credit lines, self-employed people carried out work and now find it difficult to get paid.  I know self-employed carpenters and other individuals in the construction industry who are owed €70,000.  They cannot get paid because the builders and developers in question are unable to sell houses.  There is a chain reaction involving these business people who have traded profitably for up to 15 years and have never sought to access help from the State during their working lives.  They now have no option but to seek assistance.  They do not know what they are entitled to or what is available.  They have great difficulty and perhaps a section of the Department could identify and educate these people on what to seek and how to make applications.This brings into question the interdepartmental transfer of staff because of the pressures on the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  The departmental officials in Carlow are most helpful and do their best in difficult circumstances.  They are dealing with a major increase in the number of requests for assistance and inquiries about social welfare payments.  In that climate they are working hard and are courteous and helpful.  In consultation with human resources sections in various Departments, perhaps there could be an easier way to transfer staff.  Within some Departments, where pressures are not so great, there may be a surplus of staff that could assist the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  In the private sector it is a matter of form that this will happen.  In Carlow a large company is rationalising and staff are obliged to move in order to retain posts.  They are doing so at a lower income and it is timely that all Departments examine this.I wish the Minister well in her proposals, some of which are enlightening.  We cannot lose sight of the context and climate in which this Bill is debated.  Hopefully the measures will be short-term rather than long-term.
#PaulConnaughton	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-party	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-dob	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	273	In my long experience in this House I have never seen a more vicious Social Welfare Bill.  There are reasons for part of it because the Minister found herself in a difficult position.  Some of the measures are most unfair.  I refer to those trapped in social welfare and those who can be kept out of the social welfare net if a small amount of imagination is used in the Department of Social and Family Affairs and other Departments.It is of great importance that at a time when the country is on its knees, we try to be reasonably fair to those who cannot get a euro anywhere else but from social welfare.  This comment is more relevant now than any time in the past.  Anyone on the average social welfare payment of approximately €200 does not have a great quality of life, in good times or bad.  In this assembly, we must ensure that those who genuinely depend on social welfare are looked after through disability or illness payment.  I refer also to the aged and the carers.  Anyone bleeding the system unnecessarily and unjustly must be penalised.  I heard the Minister refer to this recently.For the teeming thousands losing their jobs, we had better understand, from a psychological point of view, that step from the last day they were in employment.  This applies irrespective of how many levies were imposed on wages, which we will all know about in a couple of weeks.  The baseline of social welfare is a very dark place to be.  However it could be organised, it is not fair or reasonable to deny people the Christmas bonus.  It has been a traditional high point over the years. Even when we did not have it as good before the Celtic tiger there was a bonus at Christmas for most recipients of social welfare.  This applied not alone to the elderly but to the unemployed, people with disabilities, etc.  The payment was usually made at the end of November.The bonus had two or three beneficial effects.  It was very satisfying for the recipients and was an indication of a kind of Christmas box from the State, which demonstrated the recipients should be treated in this way.  Every euro of the payment was spent locally, with businesses in cities, towns and villages being the direct beneficiaries of what was quite a lot of money.Given the history we have and even with the financial straitjacket we are currently in, one would think the principle of the payment would have been adhered to.  Even if the Government and Department could not come up with all the payment this year, why was half of it not paid?  A half a loaf is better than no bread.  It would give a signal from Government to those elderly people that it is thinking of them even in an hour of great national need.  Instead, the whole payment has been scrapped, which is despicable conduct.  I hope that if savings are found in the Department between now and next October and November, something will be done to provide the people with some type of Christmas bonus.  Even if the payment was halved, it would be some way of saying that the State appreciates what pensioners have done for the country over the years.I have another issue I wish to discuss which relates to social welfare.  It is reasonable to raise it on an occasion such as this.  It concerns the new administration of the medical card applications.  Two or three weeks ago I got an opportunity at a meeting of the Oireachtas health committee to raise this issue with the Minister for Health and Children and Professor Drumm.  I cannot understand why 1.5 million people across the country would have to apply to an office in Finglas in Dublin for a medical card.  Whatever bureaucracy that may have existed in counties or headquarters hitherto, a person now has to deliver all the information to an office in Finglas in Dublin which has just one freefone number.  I will give anybody €100 if he or she can get through to that number in one day, let alone one call.  The freefone number is there because it means nobody can get through.

#PaulConnaughton	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-party	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-dob	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	277	No, and there is not even any background music.  The tragedy is, those over the age of 80 are trying to contact the office in Finglas.  The process has just started and there will be much more about this in the next six months.We all saw the letter from the Department which indicated that if people over 70 believed they had more than €700 per week in income, the medical card would remain.  I met several people in the weeks after who got a contradictory letter which stated that the medical card must be applied for again.  Those people had to go to their doctor to get the application signed and they had to go to the post office if they were in receipt of their pension by way of a book in order to verify that the pension was being received.The Department has done its best over the years to get people's pensions paid directly to their banks, which is right.  In order to verify the pension, which is going directly to the bank, pensioners need to go to the bank and the personnel in the local banks need to go to headquarters in Dublin to get proof that people are in receipt of a relevant pension.  Another two or three weeks are gone in this process.  On top of this, pensioners must get another verification from the bank regarding the bit of money they have to bury themselves, as they say down the country.That is fine for able-bodied people but if we are to subject people up to the age of 90 and 95 to that carry-on, who would we be kidding?  What sort of a country would that be?  This will save no money at all because up until now, when applicants for medical cards went to headquarters in Newcastle in Galway or elsewhere around the country, the process went through the community welfare officer.  Those people were able to help out and advise applicants.  They got all the necessary information and nobody ever got a medical card to which they were not entitled.There will be thousands of applicants who have problems such as illness and will not be able to communicate this to the office in Finglas.  It means that the discretionary element of this medical card has been removed for good.

#PaulConnaughton	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-party	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-dob	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	279	Of course they do not.  This process was put in place in the full knowledge that such consequences would come about.  What is going on is nothing short of pure skullduggery and it is only a matter of time before the majority of the 1.5 million people affected realise what is happening.  It will then be too late.  The Minister for Defence is present but they all sit around the same Cabinet table.  Whatever the Government argues in terms of cost and cutbacks, there is nothing from a cost perspective involved in this.  It is bureaucracy gone daft.In answer to a question I raised with him, Professor Drumm of the HSE stated that his problem was whether they would be able to get necessary IT equipment up and running to make the process efficient.  If the Department does so, it will be the first time it has.  We can imagine the flood of 1.5 million applications into one office.  We might have thought the debacle with the voting machines was bad but it will be nothing beside what will happen in Finglas in the next year or two.The Minister referred to the back to work enterprise scheme and I hope she will act as she said she would.  We should enact any law or make any provision, if that is possible, to allow people an opportunity to work, irrespective of how low paid it is at the outset.  I understand there were two schemes, the back to work allowance scheme and the back to work enterprise scheme, and these will be amalgamated.  One of the schemes had an eligibility rule where the applicant had to be unemployed for two years before he or she could apply for it.  Surely in this recessionary period any two-year period should be cut.  People may have an idea to create a job for themselves so why would the Government commit them to two years on the dole unnecessarily?Officials from the Department of Social and Family Affairs indicated to me this morning that they expect to be informed on 1 May of the new rules governing the back to work enterprise scheme.  I sincerely hope the scheme will be workable, practical and, above all else, sensible.  By sensible I mean that after six months persons who believe they can create employment for themselves, either individually or as part of a collective, should be allowed to enter the system.  Under the old scheme, applicants who were successful would receive the full amount of the jobseeker's allowance for the first year, 75% of it in the second, 50% in third and then the payment would finally be phased out.  This provided people with a great guarantee and peace of mind because they knew that while they were testing their new projects, some form of payment that would allow them to survive would still be coming in.  There is nothing new in that because similar schemes operated 20 years ago.  In the good times, however, there was no great need for such schemes.By the time the Bill is enacted — irrespective of what might be said during the various debates on it — I hope people will be encouraged to take up the scheme because they will know they will be guaranteed to receive a certain proportion of their social welfare payments while trying to get projects off the ground.  Nothing could be more sensible than that and I do not know how the Government could argue against it, particularly when so many people are out of work.  However, in light of my past experience with regard to matters which should have been put right in this House but which were not, I will bet someone will throw a spanner into the works.  The eligibility rules will probably be framed in such a way that many people will be excluded from the scheme.  It will be nothing short of a disaster if that proves to be the case.There is another aspect of the Bill on which I wish to comment.  As stated earlier, I hope we will do the best we can for the recipients of social welfare and that we will do everything possible to keep people out of the social welfare net by working with the Departments of Finance and Enterprise, Trade and Employment to put in place initiatives to ensure these individuals will not be obliged to draw the dole.  As I am sure other Members did, in recent weeks I met a number of young married couples who have young children and who also have extremely large mortgages.  Some of them informed me that they had the opportunity a couple of months ago to transfer to fixed rate mortgages.  Regardless of whether what they did was right or wrong, the advice they received was that it would be better to switch to fixed rate mortgages — 5.9% in a couple of cases — because interest rates might rise.  In the interim, interest rates have continued to fall.The people to whom I refer went back to their banks and building societies and stated that they were finding it more difficult to meet their mortgage payments each month because they had lost their jobs and due to the fact that they are now paying rates that are 2% or 3% higher than those which apply in respect of tracker or variable mortgages and asked if they could switch.  I do not know who is running the banks but if what I have been told is true, then what is happening is nothing short of scandalous.  In three or four cases, the people involved were informed that because they had signed up to fixed rate mortgages only three to four weeks ago they could not switch.  In one instance, a person with a mortgage of €200,000 was informed that it would be fine to switch to another bank or building society but in order to do so a penalty of €12,500 would have to be paid.At a time when taxpayers are on their knees trying to ensure the banks remain in business, would it not be in everyone's interests if the banks and the building societies applied the lowest possible interest rate to these families' mortgages to give them the opportunity to pay their way out of their difficulties?  The family with the €200,000 loan informed me that the difference between the repayments that apply in respect of the fixed and variable rates is approximately €200 to €300 per month.  Why would the building societies, the banks and the Government not want what I have outlined to happen in order that people might pay their way out of the depression in which we find ourselves?The Government should take this matter seriously.  In view of everything that has happened with the banks — the bringing in of outside directors, etc. — is it not time we took an imaginative approach to this matter?  If, five months ago, a bank could grant a loan to a young man and his wife or partner on the basis that it believed they could meet the repayments, why would it not be possible for it to reduce the rate of interest that applies without imposing huge penalties?  Who do the banks and building societies think they are kidding?The banks are saying that individuals may pay only the interest on their mortgages for the next six months.  However, that is merely a case of passing the buck because people's financial problems will remain at the end of that period.  The people to whom I refer require assistance and it should be provided.

#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	287	I am not surprised at the Ceann Comhairle's hesitation in calling me to speak, particularly when one considers this is a Government slot.  Nor was I surprised by the Minister of State's reaction when he looked behind him and discovered that there was no one present on the Government side to contribute to the debate on this crucial legislation.The position was the same last evening, which is understandable because people might not have expected the debate to run late and they may have gone home or left to attend meetings.  However, the fact that this has happened twice seems to indicate that it is a deliberate attempt to collapse the debate on the Bill.  Were it not for the efforts of Deputy Michael D. Higgins last night, the debate would have collapsed.  If that had happened, there would have been newspaper headlines to the effect that the Government could not even provide a speaker to ensure the debate on this crucial legislation, which will shape people's lives for the next 12 months, did not collapse.  All this takes place despite the fact that a guillotine is due to be applied to the Bill at 3.30 p.m.  There are members of my party and others in opposition who would have relished the opportunity to contribution to this debate.  The Government has set out to stifle debate on this legislation in the same way it deliberately did not send in speakers on the Private Members' motion on the same subject.  That is a dangerous precedent and if it lies within the remit of the Ceann Comhairle, he should speak to the Government Chief Whip about it.  It should not be allowed to continue without at least the Opposition being told that the Government wants the debate to collapse unless the Opposition supplies speakers.  Hopefully that will never happen because usually enough of us want to speak.For many years the story about social welfare was that the Government threw money at it without looking at the underlying structures.  Every time there was a problem or a group became disgruntled, the Government put more money into it.  Now, when huge numbers need support, the Government is withdrawing funds from social welfare.I always maintain that budget day is a day for headlines and not news.  The detail is in the Finance Bill and the Social Welfare Bill.  This Social Welfare Bill contains one of the sneakiest cuts I have ever seen and we have had enough of them from different Fianna Fáil Governments.  This cut means the Government has decided that people who have worked for years, and who have paid their contribution to the social fund so that it would be there to support them when needed, will no longer get jobseeker's benefit for 15 months, but only for 12 months.  Coupled with the removal of the Christmas bonus, it means there are people who have recently become unemployed who will be long-term unemployed by November and not alone will they have lost three months jobseeker's benefit, they will also lose the Christmas bonus.  It is outrageous.  That attitude to social welfare must be addressed.  Social welfare is not a discretionary payment, it is a system to support those who cannot support themselves.The health levy has been doubled.  For a family on €40,000, not a large amount these days, it will mean €66 a month less, on top of losing mortgage interest relief, income levies and all of the other things coming down the road.  The early childhood supplement is to be halved this year and removed entirely next year.  People do not know what is coming next.  These measures are included in this legislation, for which the Government chooses not to supply speakers, ensuring the collapse of the debate, bringing it to a vote as soon as possible.  What is the point in talking about it?When the early childhood supplement was first introduced, the Labour Party said the money should have been used to establish a system to give every child a place in preschool education.  The Government disagreed.  People were offered a choice between money in their hands or a system where children were given preschool places and naturally the popular thing to do was to give people the money.  The right thing to do, however, was to put in place a system whereby every child in the country received preschool education.  Now the Government is taking away the early childhood supplement but says it will put in place preschooling.  It will not happen because the preschool places do not exist and the money does not exist to invest in them.  Such tricks will not work.The unemployment figures are not true.  There are tens of thousands more who are unemployed but who are not registering because they were forced by their employers to take out C2s and C35s.  They were told they were to become self-employed.  The employer would continue to give them jobs and supply them with materials but they were to employ themselves.  The employer as a result had no responsibility for any of the protections, such as pension, PRSI or health and safety, and employees were forced into the position because they were told they could find work elsewhere if they did not want to do that.  That was how the construction industry was structured, leaving nowhere else for employees to go.  All of those people, because they did not pay contributions, are not entitled to a penny.  These are not the massive developers who bought land in Ballsbridge for €54 million an acre, they are people who worked on building sites, doing the work the Government drove them to do.  They have no nest egg, there is no villa on the Costa Brava for them and there are no assets.  These people do not owe €30 million to Anglo Irish Bank.  They have been left penniless and the Government must do something to rectify that.  It is outrageous that they have been pauperised.  They have families and commitments but now they have no work and no entitlements.  It was an outrageous scheme in the first place and we must pick up the tab now.When the Government decides not to allow Deputies to speak on this legislation, it is saying to those who find themselves in a queue outside the labour exchange or queuing to see overworked community welfare officers that it is not interested and it does not want to discuss the issue.  It is telling them to go away.  The Government failed these people when they were working and it is failing them now when they are unemployed.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	288	I have also spoken to significant numbers of people caught in the trap described by Deputy Kathleen Lynch.  We call it the C2 trap, where people did not appreciate they would not be entitled to welfare benefits if they did not pay PRSI.  People did not know this was a cost saving exercise on the part of contractors.  Unfortunately these people were not given adequate advice on what they were doing.This Bill is another example of the Government placing the burden for the economic crisis on the backs of low income families.  Poor families throughout the State are paying dearly for this Government's mistakes.  The biggest problem is that after 12 years of mismanagement of the economy and social policy, the Government still has not copped on.  The entire focus of its reign continues to be on bailing out the banks.  It is not just the banks, of course, because the national asset management agency will bail out the speculators as well.  Meanwhile, this Bill places the entire burden on low income families.The Government missed a significant opportunity in the budget to deal with two of the cornerstones that must be put in place if we are to build our way out of this Government-created economic crisis job retention and job creation.  There is little or no mention of them in the budget, which is most unfortunate.  Yesterday, there was a change in the number of Ministers of State.  Although that is welcome, government reform is not taking place, even at a token level.  Ministers and Ministers of State still have up to six civil servants working in their constituency offices, while Ministers have two fully qualified gardaí to drive them around instead of those gardaí being out on the beat or engaged in crime detection and prevention.I could continue on that issue but I wish to focus on the features of this Bill that cause me considerable concern.  The first is the rent supplement, which is to be reduced by approximately 8%.  That will create extreme hardship for low income families.  The Government says this cut is aimed at reducing the cost of rent.  If the Government wishes to reduce rents, there are other ways of doing so, such as through legislative or regulatory reform.  It is not necessary to cut the rent supplement to people who cannot afford the full rent for the house in which they are living.  My concern is that the reduction in rent supplement will result in additional under-the-table payments.  Every Member knows, as do the community welfare officers, that almost everybody in receipt of rent supplement is making under-the-table payments to the landlord.  Otherwise, the landlords would not tolerate them.  I am worried because the under-the-table payment will increase due to this capping of the rent supplement.There is also the issue of people who have been told they qualify for rent supplement being unable to move into the property because they do not have the deposit being sought by the landlord.  A number of local authorities have stopped paying deposits to landlords on behalf of people approved for rent supplement.  This causes huge problems because community welfare officers will not pay deposits either.  I have a suggestion which the Minister might discuss with her colleagues.  I have no wish to see local authorities or community welfare officers paying such deposits to landlords as I do not believe public money should lie in a landlord's bank account.  However, perhaps a letter of comfort could be given by the local authority.  It could state that in the event of a default or where the tenant moves on and the deposit is required, the local authority would make the payment.  That is a more efficient way of dealing with the matter than what is happening at present.I received a letter this morning from a constituent.  She tells me that, to her horror, what she describes as our reverend masters — I believe she is referring to the Minister and the Government — have decided in their wisdom to deprive the elderly of their guardian angels, namely, personal alarms.  She says she is not asking for this service to be restored, but demanding it.  She asks me what I will do about it and tells me to answer immediately.  She signs herself as Nuala Early, secretary of Drogheda Senior Citizens Interest Group.  Nuala is a very straight talking person.She probably thinks the decision will be overturned because this Government, and it is the one thing I admire about it, has the capacity to do U-turns.  We have seen how that happens.  Issues are teased out in the Chamber, a few Government backbenchers huddle in the Dáil bar, contact the Minister and, lo and behold, a U-turn takes places.  We have seen this happen on a significant number of occasions.  I hope there will be a U-turn in respect of the €2.5 million scheme, which provides old people with additional locks on their doors and alarm pendants.  I hope the Government will restore that miserly sum for the benefit of these people.  Approximately 10,000 people were benefiting from the scheme annually.  It is a significant and laudable scheme.I mentioned Government backbenchers but I should have mentioned the Green Party.  I must say I am quite jealous of Fianna Fáil being in government with the Green Party.  I would love to be in government with the Green Party because it is a cake walk, a gift.  The party is a walkover on every issue that arises.  Fair play to the Fianna Fáil side of the Government for getting away with it.Section 5 of the Bill refers to putting in place a system that will require recipients of jobseeker's allowance to participate in a course.  I am a little concerned about that and am anxious to hear the Minister explain it.  Does that mean the jobseeker will lose his or her benefit if he or she does not participate on the course?  Is it aimed at young people only or at all age groups?  Will additional courses be put in place?  If I were in that category, I would not be attracted to many of the courses currently available through FÁS.  I received representations about this during the week.  A constituent told me he had been seeking a course in FÁS and had applied a number of times.  On two occasions he was told he could not get the course because, as there were not enough participants for the course, FÁS could not run it.  FÁS needs to examine how it is presenting these courses and the nature of the courses.  Some work must be done in that area.The back to education scheme is welcome.  There is a reduction in the amount of time a person must be in receipt of jobseeker's allowance to qualify for it.  However, there is a difficulty in that it does not cover a person who wishes to do a master's degree.  I received a representation this week on this issue.  The young man had been in a reasonably senior management position with a local business that unfortunately had to make him and a number of other employees redundant.  He wishes to go back to college to do a master's degree but that is not covered in the back to education allowance scheme.  It is people in that category whom the Minister should want to benefit from the back to education scheme.  These are people who wish to upskill themselves and be prepared for the upturn when it will inevitably come, although that probably will be after a change of Government.  Nevertheless, we need such people on such courses now.  I am surprised it is not provided for in the Bill.With regard to carer's allowance, I am aware of cases where people are appealing the decisions on their applications for the allowance.  The authorities are currently processing appeals that date from December.  There is a four-month overhang for appeals.  Everybody knows that carers provide a significant saving for the State because people who are being cared for are not in nursing homes.  Keeping them in their own homes is more beneficial.  I hope something can be done to shorten the backlog.

The officials are always extremely helpful and very understanding when dealing with individual cases.  They deal with people empathetically within the regulations.  If they can, they err on the side of the applicant, which is a good approach by a Department of State.One issue that has come to my attention is the question of social welfare for people who were self-employed.  They find themselves with no support services.  This is a serious problem because many of them have nothing.  Whatever savings they might have had during the boom disappear very quickly.  We should impart education and knowledge to the self-employed through public information campaigns.  Where we can identify people who are self-employed or as they become self-employed — please God there will be more of them than there are at present — we must make them aware of the entitlements they do not have.  If possible, we should have an information campaign for people who are self-employed, to tell them how they can protect themselves and their savings or what funds they can avail of in the private sector that would assist them when times turn bad.  I refer in particular to people who were involved in the building industry, many of whom are ordinary people with a basic education.  Some of those people may not have spent too much time in secondary school and they are going through a very lean period currently.  I would like to think that the support services available to them would be improved.  An information campaign would be most important in that regard.Nuala Early was mentioned by Deputy Morgan.  I endorse what he said.  Senior citizens around the country are especially concerned that the funding for personal alarms has been withdrawn.  I accept the matter comes under the remit of the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  I found the statement by the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, on the Department's website to be particularly sickening.  He is effectively saying the system is now in limbo and that it will take two or three months to review it.  Anybody who has received a personal alarm will keep it but, in effect, the scheme has been discontinued.The scheme must be restored, as many elderly people have no hope of support in isolated communities.  A person may be unable to get to a telephone if he or she falls and if nobody lives with him or her a personal alarm is of the utmost importance as a near neighbour or whoever is the designated person can be alerted in time of difficulty.  That scheme was most helpful to the elderly and its discontinuation is a significant blow to elderly people, especially those with a disability or who are isolated and have nobody living with them.In many counties the housing aid for the elderly scheme has been discontinued, which again, is a withdrawal of services to senior citizens, this time through the local government system.  That creates a serious problem for persons in acute hospital beds in need of discharge.  They can only go home if a home help is in place but also if their homes are adapted for their needs.  People who suffer from serious heart disease can no longer climb stairs and they need toilet and shower facilities downstairs.  It is a retrograde step that those works will no longer be provided.  That means those people who are most at risk in society, those who are most likely to need help in their homes, will have to do without.  That is a negative development.Older people are most concerned about the Christmas bonus because they have traditionally looked after their grandchildren at Christmas and the opportunity will no longer be there.  One elderly person put it to me that it is as if his or her wages have been cut by €4.50 a week.  That is upsetting and annoying for people.  The Minister will be aware of the strong feelings that exist on the matter.  I hope the Government can do its sums in another way and restore the Christmas bonus for the elderly.The charge is often laid against Fine Gael that it took a shilling off old age pensioners in the 1930s.  The removal of the Christmas bonus from people who need it and who have no other source of income will be the historic legacy of the Minister.Níl an Teachta Ring anseo.

#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	292	This is an important debate.  I share many of the sentiments expressed in the worthy statements of my colleagues, Deputies Shortall and Kathleen Lynch, to which I listened carefully.There is a Victorian attitude to social welfare in this country, and that has been the case for many years.  More money is spent on pursuing and supervising people to ensure that they do not work rather than on focusing efforts to ensure people get work and to provide adequate training in technological skills, construction and other trades so that people can get work.  We must get rid of the Victorian attitude that is prevalent within Departments.The Department of Social and Family Affairs is an excellent Department.  The Minister's senior official, who is present, has been an old sparring partner of mine for the past five years.  He probably thought he had seen the last of me today but I have come back to haunt him.  I acknowledge that he and other officials have been helpful to me since becoming spokesman for social and family affairs.  The same is true of people working in offices throughout the country.  They are only implementing the law and no blame to them for that.  We need to change the law.There is too much centralisation.  One related example is from the health service.  Medical card assessments is one area that could be transferred from the Department of Health and Children to the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  They should be done locally.  Those assessments are centralised now in Finglas in Deputy Shortall's constituency.  However, people knew the circumstances in Mullingar, Athlone, Longford or wherever else.  Community welfare officers, CWOs, knew the circumstances and with a quick visit could assess or analyse a person's priority for a medical card.  Persons with cancer or other diseases should be sure they will get a medical card.  Medical cards should be automatic for anybody suffering from cancer.  Such people should not have to go through the additional burden or trauma of having to be assessed.  I have always held that view and, if in government, I would like to see such a scheme implemented.I do not understand why services are centralised and taken away from the very people who have the expertise and who have dealt with people through the years.  Decentralisation was supposed to be Government policy but it has been abandoned for medical card assessments.  Now assessments will take months and people will have to wait a long time for an outcome.  No expedition will be achieved.  I do not see where the cost savings will occur as a result of centralising the assessment process.  That is something the Minister can bring back for consideration.I fought vehemently the attempt to subsume CWOs within the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  I note the regulation has not been enforced yet, but it should be thrown in the dustbin.  CWOs have discretion and once they are subsumed within the Department they will be strangled with bureaucracy and red tape.  They will not be in a position to make decisions.  We often contact CWOs at weekends to ensure that those people who are less fortunate than ourselves and who are in need of temporary accommodation or money to secure the basic necessities for their families are looked after.  Subsuming CWOs into the Department of Social and Family Affairs will do away with the very ethos that led the late Frank Cluskey to introduce the discretionary payment scheme, which is extremely important in this context.  I hope in this difficult time for her that the Minister will throw that regulation into the bin and never take it out again.The Minister indicated she wants an 8% reduction in the rent supplement.  Most tenants have legal agreements with their landlords.  Whatever about prospective tenants dealing with landlords, how are we going to protect existing tenants?  Many of them are in a vulnerable position, suffer illnesses or are barely literate.  Illiteracy is a big problem in this country and one has to be on the ground to realise that.  What will happen to a person who may not be in a position to renegotiate?  The landlord can say "Get lost Willie.  You made your agreement and you are bound by its terms and conditions".  What will happen when a person is told to get lost and they are put out?  What body will undertake to ensure that people will be secure in their accommodation?  How will the Minister provide security for them?  An additional 1,000 rental accommodation scheme, RAS, places are no use.  We would be building houses and providing employment for people.  That was always a fundamental Labour Party ethos and policy.  We would build houses and give labour-intensive employment and ensure social houses would be available to people rather than filling the pockets of landlords.Cutting the dole is all very well for people under 20 if they have somewhere to go such as college or access to one of the schemes we advocated such as bridging the gap, the back to education allowance and the back to work allowance.  We advocated that the qualifying periods for those schemes should be reduced.  It would be great to enhance the eligibility for community employment schemes but what will happen if the young people do not have a place to go?  Who will look after them?  What does a 19-year old do with €100 if he or she has nowhere to go?  It is very fine in theory and it would be laudable if ancillary services were available and people could seek the necessary retraining and skills to ensure they would get a job.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	293	I agree with Deputy Penrose on medical cards.  I spoke about this two weeks ago on a Private Members' motion and I also tabled the matter for a debate on the Adjournment.  I agree with Deputy Penrose that it would be a big mistake not to process applications locally.  Government policy was to decentralise bodies from Dublin to the regions and now we are going in the other direction, from the regions to Dublin.  This is wrong and should not be allowed to happen.While I am sometimes very critical of the way officials work, I realise community welfare officers are under awful pressure at present.  They are finding circumstances very difficult and many are out sick with stress because of their workload.  The Minister was to supply extra staff; in some cases she did so and in others she did not.  It is impossible for the officers to work under the present conditions.Consider the position of farmers who will be seeking farm assist payments.  A major milk producer contacted me some days ago and stated he had been producing milk for the past few years and was never on social welfare.  He asked to be assessed for a farm assist payment and was told he would have to be assessed on last year's income.  Circumstances have changed in this country so fast that one should no longer carry out a means test based on last year's income.  Those days are over.  A year ago, every business in the country was flying while today they are all in difficulty.  Builders, businesses and farmers are in difficulty.I ask the Minister and her officials to adopt a different line on farm assist payments such that accounts from last year or earlier will not be sought.  Those days are over.  Whatever money the farmers had last year is gone today.  I ask the Minister and her officials to talk with the staff and make life easier for farmers who are going through difficult times.  I refer to farmers who never drew social welfare payments and who depended solely on the land.  They are now finding matters difficult because the milk prices they received 20 years ago were higher than those they receive today.The Minister made some minor changes regarding the back to work and back to education allowances.  We need new thinking and ideas in the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  There is no point adhering to the old rule that one must be unemployed for 12 months before going on a FÁS scheme.  This period has now been changed to nine months.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	294	It should be three months.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	295	If someone wants to participate on a FÁS scheme or other training scheme, he should be allowed to do so.  It is better to have people in these schemes than drawing social welfare.  At least they are being retrained and re-educated and may re-enter the workplace when the economy picks up.With regard to the Christmas bonus, the Minister will have a big test next December when the budget is announced.  The easy target in the last budget comprised the recipients of the Christmas bonus.  They have no lobby group to fight for them and will not be able to protest outside the Dáil because some will not have the resources or money to come to Dublin.  They are located all over the country and there is great anger over the stance on the Christmas bonus, in respect of which the Minister has failed.  In the December budget, the Minister must protect the most vulnerable, including people on social welfare.  While an increasing number of people is joining the live register, representing a draw on the Exchequer, we must look after the most vulnerable and ensure their income, livelihoods and families are protected.The recent budget was anti-family.  There seems to be an attack on the family in this country all the time, particularly since the time of the former Minister for Finance, Mr. Charlie McCreevy.  The trend has continued under the present Government.  Our Constitution stipulates that children and families should always be treated equally but they have not been looked after.The jobseeker's allowance has been decreased from €200 per week to €100 per week, which is wrong.  When the son or daughter of parents already on social welfare is given €100 per week in social welfare, he or she finds it inadequate.  If young people go out at night to a disco or make a contribution to the household, this sum is not enough.  It is wrong that they are being treated in this way.  They do not want to be on social welfare but want to have a job.The Minister has a difficult job and must get funding.  The budget in December will test her mettle and she should ensure she looks after the most vulnerable.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	296	I thank the Deputies for contributing to this Social Welfare Bill, which takes into account not only provisions that need to be implemented regarding social welfare but also other provisions, particularly from the Department of Health and Children.  The Department of Finance must also be considered in this regard because of the timely nature of this Bill.  As I indicated last night, a number of legislative changes are still necessary but were not ready in time for this Bill.  In the interest of clarity and so Members will be prepared, I will indicate the amendments I intend to introduce on Committee Stage, one of which I have not mentioned yet.I am conscious of the impact the current global recession is having on the value of Irish pension funds.  It is estimated that in excess of 90% of defined benefit schemes are in deficit.  This is presenting trustees of pension schemes with significant challenges in their efforts to optimise the benefits for pension scheme members.  Deputies will be aware that we put a number of measures in place last December to ease the funding pressures of these schemes.  While these were helpful in the shorter term, I must indicate my intention to introduce further measures that will support the job of the trustees of the schemes in meeting the challenges that confront them and provide greater flexibility and regulatory support to improve the affordability and viability of defined benefit pension schemes.  With regard to a separate but related issue, I will also be amending the National Treasury Management Agency Act.I propose to introduce amendments to protect 18 and 19 year olds leaving the care of the HSE to ensure their additional needs can be met.  I will be making a technical amendment to section 7 dealing with the supplementary welfare allowance.  I will be making some technical amendments to section 12 of the Bill.  I will deal with amendments to the Health Contributions Act and provide a saver provision to ensure that health contribution deductions made on redundancy payments received on or before 30 April 2009 will be made at the old, lower rates.As Deputies will be aware, the Bill provides that the rates at which health contributions are to be made are to be increased from 1 May.  As these changes are being made in the middle of the contribution year, provision must be made to average the new rates over the year.  This is provided for in the new section 4A(1).  However, one of the consequences of the provision would be that an individual who received a redundancy payment prior to 1 May and who paid health contributions at the rates in place until then would be caught for the extra payment due in accordance with section 4A(1).  It is proposed to address this by providing a saver provision that will ensure the health contributions deduction made on any such payments made on or before 30 April would be made at the old saver rates.I will be introducing an amendment to the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009 to provide for the changes announced in the supplementary budget regarding the public service pension levy.  The Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, indicated that as the Bill, as initiated, provides for the termination of the early child care supplement from 1 January 2010, it will be necessary to make a technical amendment to the Bill to amend that date to 1 December 2009.  This will not affect the payment in December because the payments are made a month in arrears.  People will continue to get the payment in December.  This clarifies the Committee Stage amendments I intend to make next week.  I am sure Deputies will have amendments also.A number of different issues arise in the Bill.  Quite rightly, Deputies have focused on the desire of all Members in the House to have people return to work and to support those who have lost their jobs.  The size of the social welfare budget, €21.3 billion, is such that our focus must be and is on having people return to employment.  Doing so not only supports the unemployed and respects their contribution to society, it also helps to reduce the social welfare budget.  At a time when €6 of every €10 entering the Exchequer is spent on social welfare, we would much rather have the burden reduced so as to be able to target resources at the most needy.We should not lose sight of the fact that there are still 1.8 million people working in Ireland and they continue to make a considerable contribution.  Our aim is to help those who do not have the correct skills and training or who need to be upskilled to return to work.  This was the principle behind the initiative regarding 18 and 19 year olds.  In fairness, many Deputies who spoke appreciate the importance of ensuring that an 18 or 19 year old does not become dependent on welfare.  We all know of cases where the 18 year old is trotted into the social welfare office by the family almost on his or her birthday and told "Sign here, I have done it and your grandfather has done it".  There is this intergenerational dependency on welfare.  Unfortunately, those young people, because they are the most likely to have dropped out of school and not to have training or education, are those who are destined to remain on welfare for the rest of their lives, and none of us wants to see that happen.  As I indicated, however, unless there is some financial incentive for them, our evidence is that the cohort of people to which I refer, in particular, will not participate off their own bat.There are thousands of places available for these young people, probably 5,000 on a weekly basis, and maybe rising to 9,000 next year.  Already in the budget we indicated additional places that are being provided between the training initiative strategy where 12,000 places are to be provided on short-term and on long-term courses, transition courses, certificate courses, full-time third level places and additional ones being provided.Many Deputies asked whether there will be enough places.  As an indication, the VTOS schemes provide 5,000 places and a number of these would suit that.  The post-leaving certificate courses, if these young people have their leaving certificates, provide 31,688 places.  There are plenty of places around the country.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	307	There are additional places, as I have indicated.  As announced at the time of the budget, between the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Education and Science, it is proposed that an additional 23,500 places are being provided and this provides more than enough scope to facilitate such 18 and 19 year olds.Bearing in mind there are a number of these young people who will not want to do this — there is more than a mere financial incentive and they will need particular care — I genuinely believe this is a way of ensuring that people at an early age will not just take the €204 a week and see it as a long-term measure, which, unfortunately, has happened.As I outlined last night, the back to education changes are also important.  More people will be able to access the scheme.  The reform of the back to education allowance at second level, where one can access it now at three months instead of at six months, is important.  As the second level option includes the post-leaving certificate courses due to the way they are organised, additional access will be available.Also, eligibility for access to the third level option is being reduced to nine months.  Deputies asked why I cannot make it any earlier.  It is really important that this is targeted at those who would genuinely be able to benefit from it because they have been unemployed.  We need to avoid — Deputies have agreed with this in the past — a typical leaving certificate student who wanted to go on to third level using this as the vehicle to get the allowance.  As I indicated, the back to education allowance, at over €10,000 a year, is far more generous than the third level grant would be.

There was a little confusion on the back to work enterprise scheme.  In fact, there are now two separate schemes that can be accessed.  This is an important development.  There are many people, particularly those who, unfortunately, have lost their jobs in the technology area in companies such as Dell or SR Technics, who have good ideas and good initiative.  They no longer, as soon as they lose their jobs, need to wait a particular time and they need not be actively seeking work.  If they show they have a good viable idea — we can work closely with such bodies as the partnerships and county enterprise boards — then they will be given the back to work enterprise allowance which will allow them to develop their ideas.  This is an exciting proposal because it does not involve a waiting period.  I accept there must be nothing more soul destroying for somebody who is well educated and who has a great commitment to the workforce to have to wait to access a scheme, and now that will not happen.  I look forward to seeing how that works.Deputies also asked about the position of those claiming benefit who were self-employed in the past.  Undoubtedly the case used be that one's projected earnings were based on one's earnings in the previous year.  We have long since accepted that such is no longer viable because, for many, projected earnings this year are far less than those of last year.  The policy and the practice, as stated to the Department's offices throughout the country, is to look at such persons' current situations because we must appreciate these people are in particular difficulties.The rent allowance scheme is one to which a number of changes have been introduced in the Bill but there is probably considerable scope as well to ensure that we get the best use and value from this scheme.  The numbers availing of it have grown significantly, understandably through those who have already been in rented accommodation who now find that their circumstances have changed and who obviously need support, but also through the formation of new households.  This has been a bit lax, with the local authority merely signing off and recording that somebody has applied for local authority housing without a full assessment taking place.  Where new households are to be established the Department needs to know that they have a genuine housing need; it is important that this function would be carried out by the body which, ultimately, will have the responsibility for providing that housing which, of course, is the local authority.  Then we can ensure that we support them through rent supplement.The scheme was always meant to be a short-term measure.  That also can be brought about by ensuring that the local authorities do not provide for long delays between offers of housing.  There is evidence of people who turned down the offer of social housing on the basis that they prefer living in the private accommodation.  Although it does not give them the security of the social housing, they might prefer the area or whatever else, and they buy time.  It is important that there be more co-ordination in that regard and we are working closely with the local authorities to ensure that we are getting this.The measures being introduced to the scheme in the Bill are reasonable.  While the household contribution towards the rent is being increased,——

In Dún Laoghaire the figure is €25 and in other counties around the country it is even more.  It is important to align the two more closely.When I mentioned the rent reductions I indicated that different percentages would be applied.  Of course the rents for different types of accommodation have not all reduced to the same value.  As was mentioned last night, rents for bed-sit accommodation for the single person have not come down as far, for example, as those for a family house.  In looking at the different new rent levels, we will average them out over different percentages.  Naturally, we do not want to place anyone in jeopardy.  However, this is regular and guaranteed money for the landlord.  A landlord will be very glad to have a guaranteed rent these times.  Other rental accommodation is also available.I appreciate there will be further debate on the Bill on Committee Stage.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	320	The total official development assistance budget for 2009 will be €696 million.  It is anticipated the aid budget will amount to 0.48% of GNP.  This will mean that Ireland will most likely remain the sixth largest aid donor in the world as a percentage of GNP.  This remains an enormous achievement in the current economic circumstances.  The reduction in the aid budget will necessitate modification in planned expenditures across the programme.  I want to ensure to the maximum extent possible that projects and programmes which are focused on the most vulnerable and those which are daily saving lives, such as emergency feeding, will be maintained.In practical terms, the revised aid budget will mean slower disbursement of funding in regard to longer term development programmes.  However, this will not affect the final outputs, such as the number of schools built or teachers trained.  We are in continuous contact with our partners on all aspects of programming, including budgets.  Adjustments amounting to approximately €118 million will need to be made across the bilateral co-operation element of the aid programme.  Support to programme countries and civil society will amount to €313 million, which is about €45 million less than anticipated.  This will necessitate the lengthening of timeframes for programme completion.  In 2009, Irish Aid will provide well over €100 million to NGOs and civil society.Our programmes of strategic co-operation with key larger UN development agencies will be maintained, but with lengthened timelines and some reductions in 2009 allocations.  We also remain ready to assist in sudden natural disasters and emergencies.  Funding of €56 million has been set aside for humanitarian activities, which represents an adjustment of €24 million.  Our pre-positioned emergency supplies remain in place and will be replenished as necessary.In respect to the quality of our aid programme, we have just been reviewed by the OECD development assistance committee.  I am extremely pleased to note that the report refers to Ireland as a "champion in making aid more effective" and to Irish Aid's "strong cutting edge programme".  We can be pleased to hear these views from an independent, objective and critical international aid organisation.Our aid programme reflects our core values and commitment to supporting the world's poorest.  The decisions we are taking in order to adjust the aid programme are framed in the context of this commitment and our determination that, once the Irish economy has returned to a pattern of sustainable growth, we will resume the expansion of our aid programme.
#LucindaCreighton	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-party	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-dob	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	321	It is somewhat misleading to state that a cut of €255 million in the aid budget over a period of 12 months reflects the core values of this country.  It does not in any way reflect our core values.  We have a commitment under the millennium development goals, as the Minister is aware, of achieving a 0.7% of GDP target by 2012.  Our GDP has fallen by 8% in the past year but our aid budget has been slashed by 20%.  There is a disproportionate and swinging affect on our overseas development aid budget in terms of how it is being cut and targeted, and treated as a soft option.My concern is that overseas development aid may be considered by some in Government as an optional luxury, which it most certainly is not — it is a fundamental core of this country's foreign policy.  The Minister appears to be rolling back on this, from what I can understand.  A 20% cut is totally disproportionate——

We still do not have clarity and all the aid agencies are completely confused as to how their budgets will be affected and what specific programmes will be affected.  They need clarity because they cannot plan.  We have a targeted and professional system in how our agencies give assistance through various programmes and they cannot plan or operate on this basis.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	326	The Deputy rightly points out that we have had a significant reduction in GNP in 2008 and 2009.  While I do not want to go down that road, we are dealing with a net reduction of €80 million from a very substantial budget if we factor in the 2008 reduction and the expected 8% reduction in GNP in 2009.  That is the context.  We were aiming for 0.54% in 2009.  Owing to the reduction in GNP we actually achieved 0.58% in 2008, which puts us fifth in Europe and sixth per capita across the globe.  Even though we are going back to 0.48% for 2009, we will probably still be the sixth largest in 2009.We do not take any pleasure from this.  We did not want to be in this position.  Across the board there have been significant cutbacks in all programmes.  There has also been a very significant drop in revenues resulting in a very tough series of budgetary decisions which affects everyone in our society and unfortunately has affected the aid programme also.However, the underlying objective is to create a sustainable pathway for our public finances which ultimately is the best guarantee of being able to achieve our target of 0.7%.  That was an Irish target.  The EU target was to achieve 0.7% by 2015.
#LucindaCreighton	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-party	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-dob	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	327	While we can argue over the figures, the reality is that there has been a 20% cut, which does not reflect the drop in GNP.  The NGOs, including Trócaire and GOAL are all reeling in confusion.  They cannot plan because they do not know which programmes will be cut.  If the Minister could clarify that, it would be very beneficial for them.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	328	The NGOs will know very soon and we will be communicating with them directly.  I point out that we have one of the best records of any donor countries in assisting NGOs and missionaries in that approximately 20% of our aid programme is delivered via civil society organisations with more than €200 million being provided in 2008.  No other donor allocates such a high proportion of its aid programme in that manner through civil society.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	329	In my reply to the previous question I set out in some detail the important issues the Government is facing in implementing the adjustments to the aid programme which are now required.  As I pointed out, with an overall allocation of €696 million in 2009, Ireland will again be the sixth most generous aid donor internationally in per capita terms.  We will deliver on our commitment to resume the expansion of the programme once we have got our economy back into a pattern of sustainable growth.  In the past six years alone Ireland has contributed in excess of €4 billion in ODA.  By any standard this is a very significant achievement and one of which we should acknowledge and for which we should take some credit.In reducing the aid budget for this year there will inevitably be an impact on funding across the programme.  We are at present identifying the necessary changes, consistent with the central priority of our aid programme, which is the reduction of global poverty and hunger in the poorest countries in the world, especially in Africa.Ireland provides assistance to more than 90 developing countries and we have a commitment to long-term strategic assistance in nine programme countries.  Although funding adjustments will be required and the timeframes for the disbursement of some funding will need to be extended, we will maintain the overall commitments we have entered into with these countries.As I have mentioned, an important report on Ireland's aid programme will be published shortly by the OECD development assistance committee.  It states clearly that the concentration of Ireland's development assistance on a limited number of poor countries is one of its main strengths and that the programme's attention to local priorities is appreciated by developing country partners.  It confirms that the proportion of bilateral spending devoted by Ireland to the poorest countries has been both high and remarkably constant over the years, and very significantly higher than the average for all major international aid donors.This independent, international recognition of Ireland's record is well earned, not just by the official aid programme, but also by the consistent generosity shown over the years by the Irish people.  The changes, which we must now make, will be implemented in a manner that sustains the Irish record in the developing world and our commitment to a disproportionate Irish contribution to the fight against global hunger and poverty.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	330	Arising from the Minister's replies to these two priority questions, how does he square what he has said with what the Taoiseach said in response to Pope Benedict's new year message?  The Taoiseach said:I welcome the commitments made in the Declaration that issued at the Doha Conference in December and note that, despite serious economic difficulties, Ireland remains on course to achieve the target of spending 0.7 per cent of GNP on Overseas Development Aid.  In this time of global economic crisis, His Holiness' message is a timely reminder of the obligation that we in the developed world have to assist those in greater need.This is the fourth cut in overseas development aid and three issues arise, which I want to put to the Minister.  How can he justify the disproportionate cuts in overseas development aid?  If one were to talk about a cut of 8%, which other Departments and sections suffered, €71 million would have been taken out.  What was taken out was €195 million.The second issue relates to the impact.  When one considers for example the campaigns against AIDS and the health impact, while the NGOs have received an allocation of 70% of their budget, it is still unclear whether life-threatening programmes will be able to continue.  Going back on solemn commitments given several times at the United Nations by previous Taoisigh, most recently by the present Taoiseach, does serious damage to Ireland's reputation.  We never fell back and rationalised by comparing ourselves with the poorer performers.  We always claimed a lead role and now that would appear to be sacrificed.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	331	I would not accept that we were always claiming a lead role.  It was only in the recent past that we have been claiming a leading role.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	333	Back in 2000 we contributed approximately €220 million and we have made dramatic progress since then.  Of course our GNP grew dramatically over the same period and the linkage of the amount of aid allocated with GNP was a significant factor in that and agreements we made in that regard.  Now that the GNP has reduced very significantly, people are very reluctant to factor in that decline in GNP to any reduction in aid at all.  They seem to be suggesting that we ignore that aspect of it and just take the totality of the figure without any connection to the reduction in GNP.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	334	So the target is set.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	335	I am simply saying that there clearly is a cut in the aid programme.  Some relates to the reduction in GNP and some relates to additional amounts that have been cut.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	337	The key issue for us is to create a sustainable pattern of finances that will ensure continued sustainable allocations for aid into the future.  We are borrowing very significant amounts of money this year to support this programme and other programmes across Government expenditure generally.  We are very keen to maintain our relationships and fulfil our commitments to the nine programme countries.  We have undertaken to spend €100 million a year on HIV-AIDS and other communicable diseases, and we will continue at this level.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	338	The OECD has given a favourable report on the Irish aid programme, which is welcome.  However, one would find it strange that the only increase, an increase of 240%, in the allocations in Vote 29 is in value for money and policy reviews.  When there is consensus about the value of the programme and when we have had to cut back good elements of it, why embark on value for money studies at this stage?  One would have thought the Government would be seeking to sustain the programme in terms of where the impact of cuts might be most negative with regard to life-threatening issues. I welcome the cut of 61% for consultancy services.  Following on from Question No. 1, the Minister needs to give an assurance with regard to funding.  If the major NGOs have been given an indication they will receive 70% of what they had been receiving, they cannot be left without direction on the remaining 30% across their programmes if they are to plan effectively.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	339	We will get in touch quickly with the NGOs.  The 70% was an up-front contribution allocation early on.  It was acknowledged that it was important to make such a commitment in advance of the budget.  I am surprised at the Deputy's comment on value for money.  The programme has grown rapidly in a short space of time and any Government expenditure programme that increases so rapidly requires careful monitoring.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	346	Ireland claims continental shelf extending beyond the standard 200 mile entitlement to both the west and south of the country.  Under international law these claims must be examined by the UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf.  For the purposes of our claims, we have divided the extended shelf into three sectors.The first sector is to the south west of the country near the Porcupine Abyssal Plain, an area which is approximately half the size of the State's land territory and which was the subject of Ireland's first submission to the Commission.  The Commission issued recommendations in 2007.  These confirmed Ireland's entitlement in this sector and set out details of where the new outer limit there should be established.  The area involved is approximately 39,000 sq km, which is a very satisfactory outcome.  The Government made an order under the Continental Shelf Act 1968 on 31 March last which formally establishes the area concerned as Irish continental shelf.The second claim is in the Celtic Sea, where there are unresolved boundary issues with the UK, France and Spain.  The four countries made a joint submission for this 80,000 sq km area in 2006.  The Commission last month confirmed this claim and negotiations on its division between the four will begin in due course.Ireland also claims part of the Hatton-Rockall area of the north-east Atlantic, which extends up to 500 nautical miles from the coast.  There is an agreed Ireland-UK boundary here, but it is not accepted by Iceland or the Færoe Islands, which make their own claims.  The four have met regularly since 2001 in an effort to resolve the overlapping claims issue, but to date have been unable to reach agreement.  In view of the ten year deadline for the making of submissions to the Commission, which for Ireland expires in May, Ireland lodged its own claim for this area last month.  It is not possible at this stage to say when the Commission will examine it, but the four countries concerned intend to keep the matter under regular review.

What is being done at Government level to fight for and make the case for Ireland at UN level in this regard?  It is reasonably widely accepted that the Irish case is stronger than that of Iceland or Denmark.  It is, therefore, essential that we put forward a strong challenge.  The talks, which had been ongoing since 2001, have now broken down.  This presents an opportunity to have the situation resolved once and for all within the United Nations.  Will the Minister inform the House what he and the Government have been doing to ensure we see a successful outcome for Ireland?

With regard to the Porcupine Abyssal Plain, we have now achieved a successful outcome as a result of our submission to the Commission.  The second claim relates to the Rockall area of the north-east Atlantic.  We are not talking about Rockall itself, as the rock is of no relevance to this at all.  Our concern is the area around it.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	358	The Foreign Affairs Committee of the European Parliament has put forward an interesting set of proposals, which are currently being studied in my Department.  Nobody can dispute that the relationship between the European Union and the US is our most important strategic partnership.  This remains the case, whatever the personalities or political forces on either side.As regards the idea of a transatlantic political council, I point out that relations between the EU and the US are already structured through a number of institutional arrangements.  The most important of these, in political terms, is the EU-US Summit where the Presidency, European Commission President and High Representative meet the President of the United States.  The next summit will take place in June and will pursue some of the issues raised at the informal summit which took place in Prague earlier this month with the participation of all members of the European Council, including the Taoiseach.  Given the time and resources devoted to the summits, it is essential that they should be events of substance, leading to significant outcomes for both sides.  It is important to bear in mind that any changes in structures would require the assent of the US side.  There is no evidence at present that they see a need for additional summit meetings.The Transatlantic Economic Council, established in 2007, also has an important role to play in strengthening economic and commercial relations between the EU and the US.  It can play a particularly useful role in the current international economic climate.  I am confident that council has an important role to play in promoting transatlantic economic integration to the benefit of both sides.As regards a joint parliamentary committee, contacts and institutional arrangements between the European Parliament and the US Congress are a matter for those bodies to agree between themselves.  Nevertheless, I am conscious of the important role which inter-parliamentary contacts can have in promoting understanding of international issues and raising awareness among parliamentarians.  I appreciate there is scope for development of the transatlantic legislators dialogue and would welcome efforts of parliamentarians on both sides in this direction.

That eight-year period saw significant difficulties in the traditionally co-operative EU-US approach to many aspects of foreign affairs.  Given our opportunity with the new US Administration, it is essential we get that relationship back on track.  Economically, the logic in the arguments is self-evident, in that 60% of global GDP is accounted for by the EU and US economies and 14 million people are employed through transatlantic economic activity.  Co-operation is important, not just to the EU and the US, but to the rest of the world.I do not accept it is a matter for the European Parliament and Congress to decide.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	362	My point was that it is a matter for both parliaments.  Let us not presume that we, the governments, can dictate to parliaments.  Congress is conscious of its role as a Legislature independent of the US Executive.  Likewise, the European Parliament has increased its status as a legislature, including its co-decision responsibilities with the Council.  There is a need for contacts at that level, which we support.  For it to be successful at the parliamentary dialogue level, the initiative and enthusiasm to carry it forward must come from both parliaments.Regarding the broader issue, the relationship between the US and the EU is strategically important.  We are satisfied with the quick, warm relationship developed by the new Administration of President Obama and the EU.  An effective informal summit was held in Prague.  The G20 process involved significant collaboration with EU Heads of Government and the US Presidency prior to the G20 meeting, which focused on the global financial and banking collapse, how to resurrect the global economy and how to develop a coherent set of policies that would lead to a resumption of growth and employment.The structures exist, such as the Transatlantic Economic Council, the annual summits and the significant series of bilateral meetings between the US and EU member states.  In Ireland's case, that meeting occurs in March every year and presents a considerable opportunity for us to engage in a substantive bilateral contact with the US Administration at the highest level.

Ireland, as one of only two English-speaking EU member states, has an opportunity to be the pioneer.  I do not know whether the Minister has considered Fine Gael's 2004 proposal of a transatlantic foundation based in Shannon.  There would be an added bonus for Ireland and new economic activity, but it would also strengthen Ireland's role as the United States of America's gateway into Europe.  It is a major opportunity, but it does not seem to have been considered by the Minister.

The Taoiseach launched it during St. Patrick's week, thereby highlighting the strategic relationship between Ireland and the US while setting it in an EU context.We have been clear in our strong support for a progressive and warm relationship with the US, not only in terms of economics, but also regarding the Middle East peace process, for example.  We welcome the prioritisation of that issue by President Obama and the appointment of Senator George Mitchell and stand ready to provide our support.  The strong, strategic partnership between the US and the EU in terms of the suppression of piracy can be effective.  The EU-US axis is pivotal to the peaceful resolution of a number of international disputes.  There is no disagreement in terms of the importance of the——

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	371	Ireland enjoys good diplomatic relations with both Israel and the Palestinian Authority through our Embassy in Tel Aviv, representative office in Ramallah and their respective missions in Dublin.  The representative office in Ramallah is accredited to the Palestinian Authority, including in respect of Gaza.  The EU likewise engages directly with the Government of Israel and with the Palestinian Authority, including on issues relating to Gaza.It is a matter of regret that the Palestinian Authority is currently unable to exercise control of Gaza.  Discussions between the Palestinian factions have been under way since January, brokered by the Egyptian Government, with the aim of ending this division and restoring a united Palestinian Government.  I would welcome such a development.Ireland believes that the EU should be ready to engage with Hamas once previously stated requirements are met and the movement indicates readiness to renounce violence and be part of the search for a solution in the area.  There have been some indications that its position may be evolving, but the ball is in Hamas's court.The idea of an EU-Israel summit meeting was one of the possibilities for deeper political exchanges connected with the idea of an overall enhancement in EU-Israel relations, the so-called upgrade.  I have spoken on this topic many times in the House and have made clear our opinion that the decision in principle last year to upgrade should be reconsidered in light of subsequent developments, including both the Gaza conflict and the stance of the new Israeli Government.The Czech Presidency had indicated that it hoped to be able to hold an EU-Israel summit during its term, but it does not now appear that this will take place.  More positively, the Obama Administration continues to be actively engaged in the search for peace, with Senator Mitchell paying his third visit to the region last week while President Obama will meet Prime Minister Netanyahu and Presidents Abbas and Mubarak in the coming weeks.  Renewed US engagement and co-operation with the EU in the region is critical, a point I heavily emphasised in my intervention at the recent EU-US summit in Prague.

I assume the Government supported this position at the time.  Claiming that the proposed EU-Israel summit should not proceed is flawed logic, as we need to engage.  Since I do not understand, what is the Minister's logic for refusing to upgrade the bilateral relationship with Israel?  There would be a carrot effect in terms of incentivising better co-operation with the EU and the US.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	375	The Czech Presidency's intended summit is not likely to go ahead.  Our position at the December Council meeting was clear.  We wrote to the Presidency and stated that were there to be any upgrade or any summit with Israel, there would need to be a summit with the Palestinian Authority.  The Presidency was going down another route.Ireland's position has always been consistent in that we have linked progress on the Middle East peace process with any upgrade in relationships.  The Israeli Government has not been happy with our position, but that strong linkage between upgrading relationships with any player in the region and sensible progress and commitment to key principles is important.While a good relationship already exists between Israel and the EU, upgrading it further, in the absence of any commitment from the new Prime Minister of Israel to——

I also refer to the Israeli Foreign Minister's recent comments that Israel no longer is bound to the Annapolis process.  The Government does not wish to be awkward in this regard and wishes to creates space to allow momentum develop for peace because it believes the ultimate solution is a two-state solution in which both states live in harmony and peace with each other.  I am not encouraged by recent events, such as the failure to open crossings to facilitate the access of humanitarian aid for reconstruction.  The news the Department receives from the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, UNRWA, is continually and frustratingly depressing.  It pertains to how people are being left in situations of dire need and want, particularly in respect of supplies for primary education and so on.We are in a very difficult environment in the wake of the Gaza conflict.  It should be remembered that a horrific conflict took place in Gaza that also has coloured the minds and has changed views within Europe and across the European Union on this issue.  Clearly, it has created a scenario in which it is neither optimal nor the right time to consider the upgrading of relationships.  That said, the prioritisation that President Obama courageously has accorded this issue is important and we stand willing to help and assist in any way possible all the players in the region towards a lasting and sustained settlement.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	382	Members also should recall that in the past, Mr. Netanyahu has proved capable of reaching pragmatic agreements.  On the face of it, given all the rhetoric and articulation of ideas, one does not draw hope from some of the rhetoric that has been articulated.  However, we have been through this in Ireland in respect of our peace process and behind that, perhaps movement can take place.In the Government's view, it is of strategic importance to Israel that there would be a resolution of this issue, as obviously it is to the Palestinians.  Moreover, the Arab states have played a highly constructive role in this regard through the Arab peace initiative and it is important not to allow that to wither.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	383	I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 13 and 66 together.The humanitarian situation across the enormous expanse of Sudan continues to be tragic and complex.  Although rich with oil, Sudan is placed 146th out of 179 on the UN's human development index.  Despite recent talks between the Sudanese Government and rebel groups, hostilities on the ground in Darfur continue.  As a result of the ongoing violence, there has been forced movement of civilians, increasing the number of internally displaced persons, which currently stands at more than 2.7 million.In early March the Government of Sudan announced its decision to expel 13 international humanitarian organisations and to suspend the operations of three Sudanese non-governmental organisations, NGOs.  The 13 agencies expelled accounted for 40% of all humanitarian aid in Sudan.  Between them, they provided food and safe water to 1 million people and basic health care to 1.5 million people.  At the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 16 March, European Union Foreign Ministers called on the Government of Sudan to urgently reconsider the decision to expel these organisations and to ensure that the most vulnerable people in Sudan are guaranteed humanitarian assistance.  The European Union has emphasised this position to regional and international partners who may be in a position to influence the Sudanese Government.There are continuing difficulties in responding effectively to the humanitarian needs of so many people.  Vital supplies are not being pre-positioned ahead of the rainy season, which starts in June, and this will make the distribution of aid significantly more difficult.  There is a grave risk that the situation could further deteriorate in the months ahead.  Aid organisations working in Darfur face dangerous working conditions on a daily basis.  The threat of armed attacks, banditry, theft and kidnapping are a constant menace which has a direct impact on their ability to carry out successfully their life-saving work.My officials are in regular contact with the agencies that the Department supports in Darfur and have discussed security matters with some of them on several occasions.  The Department is in discussions with a number of NGOs with regard to facilitating their staff to attend the security training offered to the members of the rapid response corps.  It will continue to liaise with those agencies present in Darfur to provide whatever support it can in helping them carry out their work in the safest way possible.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	384	I am grateful for the Minister's reply and I share the Government's concern regarding the safety of personnel.  I wish to ask a number of directly-related questions.  It appears to me that both the present Minister and his predecessor laid great stress on the evolution of thinking at the United Nations, particularly in respect of the duty to protect.  The duty to protect was a key block in the thinking of the former United Nations Secretary General, Kofi Annan, whereby sovereignty could not be used to frustrate the right of a vulnerable population to life itself.  It posed a great number of questions for those who had, for example, revised views on neutrality, sovereignty and so forth.  I articulated the policy of the Labour Party to the effect that sovereignty could not be used as a shield to prevent the implications of the duty to protect.  Does the Minister agree this has been fundamentally challenged by events in Sudan?Two matters have been set in tension in this regard.  I refer to the decision to refer President Bashir to the International Criminal Court, which is regarded by the representative bodies in the region as possibly unhelpful and which is being used as a trading pawn with regard to the question of allowing humanitarian organisations to return.  One is left with a terrible choice, which is that to save 1 million people directly, 1.5 million people from immediate threat and 2.7 million displaced people, one must either suspend the conclusion of the International Criminal Court or resile from a commitment regarding a duty to protect at the level of the United Nations.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	385	I understand fully the Deputy's remarks underlying the question he has put and the dilemma he has highlighted.  One would hope the choice was not so stark.  I agree with the clear view of the international community and the European Union that one cannot pull back from the decision of the court or indeed pressurise the court to rescind or reverse its decision.  Therefore, the alternative is to put as much pressure as possible on the Sudanese Government to facilitate the return of the NGOs and to facilitate the unhindered activities of those NGOs which still operate at present and which have not been expelled.I believe the Deputy is correct to identify the issue of the duty to protect and the degree to which Governments can hide behind sovereignty, whereby unspeakable atrocities are committed against people, people die of starvation and so forth.  The dilemma arising from the two issues the Deputy has put against each other is not easily reconcilable.  In my view, there must be full respect for the international process regarding war crimes and bringing people to justice ultimately.  On the other hand, at what stage should the international community intervene in the best interest of the people involved?
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	386	The Minister's response has illustrated the point that when developing this concept, Kofi Annan developed a parallel notion of devolving certain functions of the Security Council to regional bodies, including the African Union.  The Minister's reply has revealed that the idea of a movement from an absolutist version of sovereignty has not been accepted fully either by the African Union or in the region.  Therefore, the flaws in respect of that practice flow back and raise a fundamental question as to whether anything was achieved regarding this fundamental concept in human rights or United Nations reform.Regarding the International Criminal Court, there is a grave danger it is seen as an institutional spin-off that has no connection with the realpolitik of the security council.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	387	I take Deputy Higgins's point on the African Union.  In the context of Zimbabwe there were elements of this, where the situation was allowed to continue in an unacceptable way and the regional power, the African Union, did not do enough to ensure the right outcome.  It did not intervene effectively in that situation.  The outcome was appalling as a result.We have urged all parties to engage with the UN and the African Union mediator to achieve a sustainable peace.  The political will does not exist to make the peace and the civilian population is suffering to a horrific degree.  I am not in disagreement.I do not necessarily accept that the International Criminal Court is an irrelevant spin-off or a spin-off that is becoming increasingly distant from the realpolitik of the UN Security council.  There may be some positives in that if it worked in an independent way in calling certain situations.  That has implications but it has achieved significant outcomes in other parts of the globe, not least in the Balkans.

The will is significantly lacking and there is a role for the EU.  Perhaps the Council of Ministers with responsibility for foreign affairs could discuss this at the next GAERC meeting.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	391	We have discussed it, and it will be discussed at the next GAERC meeting.  I am not in disagreement with the points articulated by the Deputies.  The international community is endeavouring to put as much pressure as possible on the Sudanese Government to move on the situation.  We have applied a range of UN sanctions, including an arms embargo, a travel ban and an asset freeze on certain individuals but these are of limited value in certain respects.  A general embargo would affect civilians more than anyone else.  Short of intervention, there are limits to what the international community can effectively do.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	392	There have been a number of allegations by NGOs relating to the supply of cluster munitions to the Government of Sri Lanka in the conflict with the Liberation Tamil Tigers of Eelam, LTTE.  In February this year, press reports cited UN sources in Sri Lanka in reporting that cluster munitions were used in an attack on a hospital in which 52 people were killed.  However, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs later confirmed that it had no evidence of the use of cluster munitions in this incident.There is no evidence currently available to confirm the possession or use by Sri Lanka of cluster munitions.  The Government of Sri Lanka has denied that it possesses or has used cluster munitions.  What seems probable is that we will be able to ascertain the full facts only when the conflict is over and technical experts can be deployed to the scene.In line with the commitment in the Programme for Government, the Government has worked to achieve a complete ban on the use of cluster munitions.  The diplomatic conference in Dublin in May 2008 adopted the Convention on Cluster Munitions and Ireland ensured it was among the first to ratify the convention when it opened for signature in December 2008.The convention has to date been signed by almost 100 countries.  Signatories commit themselves to an immediate and unconditional ban on all cluster munitions that cause unacceptable harm to civilians.  Each State party undertakes never in any circumstances to use, develop, produce, acquire, stockpile, retain or transfer cluster munitions, or to assist another party in doing so.  I urge all states that have yet to sign the convention, including Sri Lanka, Israel, the Russian Federation and Pakistan, to do so.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	393	I was very happy to attend the signing ceremony of the international convention banning all forms of cluster munitions but the relevance of that to the question I asked is not so clear.  The three countries to which I referred, Israel, the Russian Federation and Pakistan are not signatories.Regarding the NGO reports, the Minister says it is only when the conflict is over that we can establish the facts.  What is taking place in Sri Lanka is almost in the category of genocide, a phrase I use carefully.  The Government there has announced that a military conclusion to the conflict is now possible and has given an ultimatum of 24 hours for civilians to leave the area of Vanni.  What is happening is appalling and is an indictment of the international community.  Cluster munitions are being used.  I am not a spokesperson for the Liberation Tamil Tigers of Eelam but the human loss of life in Sri Lanka is outrageous and is an indictment of the international community.  We know these three countries produce and sell cluster munitions and I believe they have supplied them to the Sri Lankan army.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	394	I agree with Deputy Higgins on the horrific nature of the conflict in Sri Lanka.  We brought that to the attention of the Sri Lankan Government.  I spoke to the ambassador, who is based in London, in Dublin and we conveyed our views on the undesirable nature of a purely military solution to this situation.  Equally, the Liberation Tamil Tigers of Eelam and their methodologies are to be condemned in their use of civilian populations as shields.  It is an appalling situation and a humanitarian catastrophe has arisen as a result of the conflict.  The UN has a presence on the ground and has accepted the denial of the Sri Lankan Government that it is using cluster munitions.  No victims have come forward with injuries consistent with cluster munitions.

Establishing the truth can be a slow process.  We must establish the truth and, in the spirit of the convention, along with the EU we will seek to establish the truth of the use of cluster munitions and to provide humanitarian and development assistance to the civilian population.  Some €12 million was allocated in 2008 from the UN central emergency response fund.  Ireland is the seventh largest contributor to that and has contributed some €5.3 million for humanitarian needs in Sri Lanka.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	397	I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 39 together.The conflict in Gaza has had devastating humanitarian consequences for the civilian population.  It should also be recalled that, even prior to the recent conflict, Gaza was experiencing a serious humanitarian crisis due to the economic blockade by Israel and the effective isolation of the territory from the outside world.At the international conference in support of the Palestinian economy for the reconstruction of Gaza, which was held in Egypt on 2 March, I pledged €2.5 million in funding to meet immediate humanitarian and recovery needs of the people of Gaza.  Some €500,000 of this pledge was disbursed at an early stage of the conflict to a humanitarian response fund administered by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.  Since the beginning of the year, this fund has supported 19 emergency response projects in Gaza, operated by both non-governmental organisations and UN agencies, in sectors such as health, food and psychosocial support.  Following the ceasefire and in response to a flash appeal co-ordinated by the UN, Irish Aid provided a further €1 million in support of the humanitarian activities of the UN Relief and Works Agency, UNRWA.  UNRWA is the UN agency charged with responsibility for the welfare of all Palestinian refugees and it has been at the centre of the response to the Gaza crisis, where over 70% of the population are refugees.I have earmarked a further €1 million in support of Gaza's recovery and reconstruction.  The timing of disbursement will depend on the extent to which recovery programmes can be adequately implemented.  Unfortunately, the closure of Gaza's border crossings continues to impede recovery and reconstruction programmes — a concern I have consistently highlighted, including to the Israeli authorities and in discussions with EU colleagues.The support I have outlined is in addition to Irish Aid's broader programme of assistance for the Palestinian people.  This includes support for a number of partners working specifically to promote and protect the human rights of the people of Gaza, including the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights and Gisha, an Israeli NGO which seeks to protect freedom of movement for Palestinians.  Total Irish Aid funding to the Palestinian people in 2008 amounted to over €8.6 million.  During the first four months of 2009, more than €6.2 million in assistance for the Palestinian people has already been disbursed or allocated.Irish Aid has taken a deliberate strategic decision to support the people of Gaza in the current challenging circumstances through well-established and experienced partners.  Working through organisations with existing field capacity, a comprehensive understanding of the local context, and a proven track record in delivering assistance to the most vulnerable is the most effective way of ensuring that aid can reach those most in need.Officials from my Department have already met with representatives of the group under reference by the Deputy and have explained to them the strategic rationale for providing assistance to the people of Gaza through our pre-existing network of partnerships.

I congratulate others who have tried to ensure aid gets to Gaza, which is still under a siege imposed against international law.  There was a humanitarian crisis in the area prior to the recent onslaught by Israel, which the attack has worsened.Does the Minister agree that it would be appropriate for some government to make a gesture towards a group such as the Free Gaza Movement, which has organised siege-breaking trips from Cyprus on boats, one of which was rammed in December to a great cost for the charitable organisation?  Would it not be appropriate for the Government to fund the fuel for one of those trips or even encourage the Irish Naval Service to escort the vessels when they go in a flotilla in May?  When I and a colleague of the Minister's, Deputy Chris Andrews, travelled on one such boat, the Israeli navy shadowed us most of the way in.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	399	I have already indicated that it is not the core programme of Irish Aid to support such a movement.  In essence, it seems the Free Gaza Movement is an advocacy group that engages in very high-profile events such as the flotillas identified by the Deputy.The preponderance of our aid goes through the Palestinian Authority, with aid supporting its governance functions in the West Bank and Gaza.  Much of our aid goes to UNRWA, which targets education and health centres in Gaza itself.  There are also a number of NGOs, which I outlined.We must be careful that we allocate aid in a strategic and focused way and do not spread our wings too far, giving out minute grants to everybody.  We must get greater value for money and better outputs and outcomes by working with strategic partners.

In a recent visit by Mr. John Ging, the leading UNRWA specialist, to the foreign affairs committee, he mentioned that in the pledging conference that took place, the issue was not money but rather that less than 10% of what had been pledged could get through.With regard to the Minister's reply on aid which has been facilitated by Ireland, it is right to use the word "siege".  UNRWA has stated the need and secured commitments and pledges.  UNRWA has cement and so forth but it is being denied a border crossing.  What is that if it is not a siege?

He was a very important touchstone for us during the conflict as he was on the ground.  The investigations are ongoing with regard to the shelling near or approximate to the UNRWA schools.What he and Karen Koning AbuZayd of UNRWA have raised is the fact that in some instances, even stationary has not been allowed into schools, which defies any comprehension in my view.  I do not understand any of this logic which prevents badly needed materials for schools.  It is not in anybody's long-term or strategic interest.  There is no excuse for that.  The Deputy is correct in that the issue is not so much the volume of aid but getting the aid in.Written Answers follow Adjournment Debate.

#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	415	I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this very important issue again in the House.  Three weeks ago, on Friday, 3 April, 600 workers from approximately 1,200 were absolutely devastated upon losing their jobs at the world class SR Technics operation at Dublin Airport.  What made it even more unbearable was the fact they left what they knew well was a very viable aviation engineering operation.Last Friday, on 17 April, more than 100 disheartened and shattered workers were also let go.  I was also shocked last week to learn that 26 senior SR Technics aviation engineering apprentices were being let go as well by the Zurich-based company.  When I heard the news I described it as another savage breach of faith by the corporate affairs director of SR Technics, Stephanie Kennett, the chief executive officer, Bernd Kessler, and their Middle East master, Sheikh Mohammed al Maktoum.More than six weeks ago, in a lengthy telephone conversation with Mr. Kessler, I asked him specifically to bring the apprentices to Zurich to finish their training and he said it would be under consideration.  After meetings facilitated by the Labour spokesperson, Deputy Willie Penrose, myself and my colleagues, Deputies Roisín Shortall, Joe Costello and Joan Burton and Senators Dominic Hannigan and Brendan Ryan, it was believed that arrangements had been put in place to ensure that these young men and women made redundant last Friday would have been allowed to complete their college and practical training with FÁS, DIT Bolton Street and the remaining SR Technics operation at Dublin Airport.  The 26 young apprentices are in their third year, or phase five, of the new apprentice FETAC system.  They had hoped to be allowed to continue their academic education and work on the SR Technics line maintenance facility up to 31 August.Last week I called on the director of FÁS, the CEOs of IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland to immediately provide facilities for all the SR Technics apprentices who have not been catered for to date.  I reiterate that call now.  I also asked the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to urgently report to the Dáil on efforts to save the aviation engineering facility at Dublin Airport.  I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, will provide a full report on the invigilation process relating to the various expressions of interest and management buy-out proposals for the Dublin SR Technics operation.  Is the Minister of State in a position to indicate the number of proposals and expressions of interest that are currently deemed viable or worthy of progressing?  Will he outline what is likely to be the timeframe for progressing these proposals?  Will he indicate the current position regarding the leases for the SRT hangars at Dublin Airport?  Is IDA Ireland confident that all the essential aviation engineering equipment has been protected for any viable successor business at the SRT facility?Time is passing and I regret to say that the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and her colleagues do not appear to be displaying the urgency necessary to protect jobs in this vital industry.  The Labour Party has stated since the beginning of the crisis that everything possible must be done to ensure that the almost 1,200 jobs in aviation engineering at Dublin Airport will be saved.I have, on the Labour Party's behalf, been in contact with the various players in this saga in Europe and the Middle East, including SRT corporate management in Zurich, the head of the Mubadala Development Company in Abu Dhabi and the ultimate beneficial owner of SR Technics, Sheikh Mohammed al Maktoum, Prime Minister of the United Arab Emirates and King of Dubai.  I understand the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment visited Abu Dhabi recently.  Will the Minister of State indicate if she received any assistance from Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed Al-Nahyan or Khaldoon Khalifa Al Mubarak, chief executive of Mubadala? I also understand that the chief executive of IDA Ireland visited Bernd Kessler in Zurich last week.  What was the outcome of these meetings?  What information can the Minister of State provide with regard to the future of this company?The pension and redundancy arrangements for the two thirds of the workforce who have been let go are disgraceful.  In that context, the Labour Court judgment in respect of this matter has not been upheld.The devastating events at SR Technics were closely followed by the crisis at Lufthansa Technik Automotive Ireland in Rathcoole on the Naas Road, where 465 staff were put on protective notice.  This will come into force from 27 April.  I understand that, following the rejection of the Labour Court recommendations, unions at the Lufthansa facility have appealed directly to the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to intervene in respect of this serious matter and to draw up new proposals or a rescue package.  The Lufthansa facility is located close to the Minister of State's constituency.  Will he indicate the actions that are being taken to resolve the crisis at Lufthansa Technik and outline the contact the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has had with management at the plant in respect of this matter?One media commentator observed yesterday that, following events at SR Technics, the loss of Lufthansa would sound the death knell for the heavy aviation engineering and maintenance sectors in Ireland.  This industry was painstakingly developed over 75 or 80 years and it is now going to be wiped out.Many families on the northside of Dublin have suffered greatly and a threat hangs over families in the area the Minister of State represents.  Will he outline the developments that have taken place in respect of these two important plants?
#ConorLenihan	unknown-#ConorLenihan-party	unknown-#ConorLenihan-dob	unknown-#ConorLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	416	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter on the Adjournment.On 12 February SR Technics announced that it would close its operation at Dublin Airport and enter into consultation with the trade unions representing the 1,135 employees at the facility.  The company cited the recent loss of major contracts from primary load customers in Dublin, current business and economic forecasts, as well as the high cost base of the operations, as the primary causes in this regard.  It also indicated its view that it would not be possible to fill the resulting capacity gaps with sustainable business in the medium term.In the interim, IDA Ireland and the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment have had numerous meetings with the company to express the Government's concern regarding the impact the closure will have on the economy of north Dublin and the effect the loss of 1,135 highly skilled jobs will have on the Irish aviation sector.  IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland established a team to market the operation internationally through their overseas office network and have held discussions with more than 15 companies to encourage them to put forward investment proposals to take over all or part of the operation.  Following receipt of proposals, a full evaluation will take place and each proposal will be considered on its merits and long-term viability.The company has indicated that it has received up to 30 expressions of interest in parts of the operation and has stated that any approach or proposal would be considered in detail and evaluated in full on its merits and potential long-term benefit.  At this stage, SR Technics has received five bids from interested parties for parts of the business and is currently assessing these.  Following the assessment process, SR Technics will select a successful bidder.  In tandem with this process, the agencies are in discussions with the interested parties on an ongoing basis to assess the viability of the bids so as to be in a position to offer appropriate support to the successful bidders to maximize the level of sustainable employment in the resulting operations.Lufthansa Airmotive currently employs some 460 workers at its Rathcoole facility and has been planning to introduce a new engine facility, which would both secure the future and lead to an increase in employment at the plant.  As part of this process, the company has been seeking agreement with the workforce regarding the introduction of flexible working arrangements and work practice reforms.  Following failure to agree, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment discussed the situation with both management and unions and the full services of the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court have been provided to assist in finding a way forward.  Following six LRC hearings and a full Labour Court hearing, I understand staff at the plant yesterday voted against the proposals drawn up by the Labour Court by a margin of 17 votes out of a total of 279 cast.  In a statement last night, the company said it had now halted the planned investment in the new engine line and has also issued protective notice to all workers.The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment remains seriously concerned for the future of the company and activities relating to it in Ireland.  As a further and perhaps final opportunity to try to resolve the problem, the national implementation body, which consists of Government, employer and union representatives, is also meeting to try to provide assistance.  There is no doubt that if the current impasse in Lufthansa Technik Airmotive Ireland is not resolved swiftly, these highly skilled jobs will be lost.  The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment is also of the view that this will have a disastrous impact on other parts of the aviation sector in Ireland which depend on business from the company.  She urges the parties to re-engage immediately in order that a solution to the current impasse might be found.

Tá an tionscal seo lonnaithe i nGaoth Dobhair le beaganch 30 bliain.  Tá fostaíocht iontach curtha ar fáil aige i rith an ama sin ag déanamh táirgí bia ar nós sceallóga crisps agus mar sin de.  Tá taithí ag na hoibrithe ar an tionscal sin agus bhí rudaí ag dul ar aghaidh go maith.Anois, áfach, tá athstructúrú á dhéanamh ar an gcomhlacht seo agus dá bharr sin, tá 170 duine á ligint chun bealaigh.  Daoine iad seo atá ina gcinn teaghlaigh, an t-aon duine b'fhéidir atá ag obair sa teach agus bíonn freagrachtaí móra orthu, morgáistí agus mar sin, cionn is go bhfuil a gclann ag dul le hoideachas.Mar sin féin is buille seo don eastát freisin.  Seo an tionscal is mó agus is faide lonnaithe ar an eastát ansin sa pháirc ghnó i nGaoth Dobhair.  Tuigim nach bhfuil an tAire féin anseo ach ba mhaith liom go gcuirfeadh an tAire Stáit in iúl don Aire, agus go gcuirfeadh seisean in iúl d'Údarás na Gaeltachta go mbeadh sé iontach tábhachtach go ndéanfaí gach iarracht cuid de na poist seo a choinneáil agus a chosaint.  I gceantar beag Gaeltachta tá 170 post cosúil le 2,000 anseo i mBaile Átha Cliath nó sna bailte móra eile.  Mar sin, is buille mór é seo don tionscal agus don eacnamaíocht sa cheantar.  Cuirfidh sé isteach ar na siopaí, ar na tábhairní, ar na tithe ósta agus ar sheirbhísí de gach cineál.  Mar sin, tá mé ag fiafraí den Aire agus den údarás gach dícheall a dhéanamh oiread agus is féidir chun na poist seo a chaomhnú.In one form or another, Largo Foods has been operating in Gaoth Dobhair for over 30 years.  During the difficult times, between 2000 and 2005, when 900 jobs were lost on the Gaoth Dobhair industrial estate, Largo Foods — or, more correctly, its predecessor, Smailc Bhia — provided alternative employment for many of those who were made redundant.  One could say that it was the anchor employer on the estate.For the 170 people being made redundant now, many of whom are their families' sole bread winners and who have financial responsibilities and commitments, there is, unfortunately, no such alternative employment available.  The company maintains that the redundancies are necessary as a result of the need to restructure the industry.  When the restructuring is complete, I hope the company will adopt a forward-looking and constructive plan for the plant in Gaoth Dobhair.  The facilities there are first class, the workers are highly motivated and skilled, there is a demand for the product and there is no economic reason why the facility in Gaoth Dobhair should not have a viable future.I ask the Minister to urge the relevant agencies, particularly Údarás na Gaeltachta, to ensure that the current level of employment — that is, post redundancy — will be maintained and that every effort will be made to increase the level of employment when the restructuring is completed.  There will be no future for those who will be made redundant, particularly in light of the current economic crisis that obtains in Ireland.  The only alternatives for them are the dole queue or emigration.  However, these alternatives are unacceptable.
#ConorLenihan	unknown-#ConorLenihan-party	unknown-#ConorLenihan-dob	unknown-#ConorLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	418	The Minister would like to thank Deputy McGinley for raising this important issue today.  He would like to emphasise that the loss of any jobs in any Gaeltacht industry is a cause of concern for him and for Údarás na Gaeltachta, and that he can understand the Deputy's concern.Both the Minister and Údarás na Gaeltachta very much regret the decision taken by Largo Foods Exports Limited to lay off a total of 123 full-time equivalent jobs in its subsidiary companies on the Gaoth Dobhair Business Park.  The company has had to take this decision due to increased competition in the market, the unfavourable euro-sterling exchange rate and high production costs. Certain production activities carried out by the Largo Foods subsidiary companies on the Gaoth Dobhair Business Park will be transferred to its automated production plant in Ashbourne, County Meath.  Údarás na Gaeltachta understands that this decision is necessary to secure the business into the future.The Minister welcomes the decision by Largo Foods Exports Limited to continue its development and production of high value-added products on the Gaoth Dobhair Business Park.  This will leave 129 full-time equivalent jobs in Largo Foods or its subsidiaries in Gaoth Dobhair, which the Minister believes shows the commitment that the company has in this Gaeltacht area.  Údarás na Gaeltachta will work with the company on a continuous basis in its efforts to develop and sustain its business.  Arrangements will be made with employees who are to lose their jobs to register with Údarás na Gaeltachta if they are interested in receiving information on employment opportunities or improving their skills.While these job losses have been a great blow to the area, an t-údarás will continue its efforts to attract new investment to the area, and the Minister is confident that it will do so.  A lot of investment is being made into Gaoth Dobhair Business Park, including Áislann Ghaoth Dobhair, which includes a multi-use cultural and community centre at a cost of more than €8 million.The Minister would like to assure the House that his Department is working with Údarás na Gaeltachta in its ongoing work to generate and sustain employment in the Gaeltacht.  In this context, his Department has provided €35 million to Údarás na Gaeltachta for its works programme in 2009.  The Minister is confident that through the full co-operation between himself, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Údarás na Gaeltachta, the IDA and Enterprise Ireland, that these great efforts will be rewarded with the provision of worthwhile, sustainable employment for the people of the Donegal Gaeltacht.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	419	I am seriously concerned about the Government's plans to roll out digital terrestrial television.  At the start of the week, the company that was due to roll out the commercial element of the DTT programme, Boxer, pulled out of the deal.Last summer the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland went through a long process of selecting a preferred tender and then granted a 12 year contract to Boxer to provide DTT across the country.  It offered three multiplexes which would have been able to provide 30 channels on a digital platform.  The other multiplex is controlled by RTE but RTE is rolling out the masts and infrastructure required to allow digital terrestrial television to work.  It must roll it out anyway to provide free to air digital services by the end of the year.  In reality, RTE can only afford to do this on the back of the revenue it was to receive from the commercial operator that was going to use the same infrastructure.  That commercial revenue is now gone.  The public service broadcaster, having spent €40 million rolling out infrastructure to facility the roll out of DTT, still needs to spend €60 million to complete the job because we are switching off analogue television services in 2012 so we must have a DTT to fill the gap.  A revenue stream that would help to finance the roll-out of the infrastructure has now gone.No one in their right mind will want to switch to free to air digital terrestrial television.  Why would they bother switching from an analogue service to a digital service if it is going to cost them money in terms of purchasing a set top box if they are only getting the same or fewer channels?  Why would someone switch from a Sky or cable subscription if he will only receive five channels?  The DTT programme is now a shambles.  RTE is being exposed to enormous costs to continue the roll-out but it does not have the money needed.The Broadcasting Commission of Ireland and the Minister have responded by saying there were three companies interested in rolling out commercial DTT in Ireland so we will go to the second preferred tender, One Vision, a joint venture involving TV3, Setanta and Eircom.  It does not take a genius to work out these three companies face financial difficulties at present and are not in a position to spend the kind of money needed to roll out a DTT service across the State.  The structure that has been put in place is not the Minister's fault but the Minister must get involved and recognise that the structure is broken.  The public service broadcaster has been left holding the baby and the State must concede that a new tendering process is required.  The Minister must sit down with the BCI to figure out a new way to deliver digital television to Irish people on a free to air basis, as well as on a commercial basis.  The current plan is broken and we must recognise that and fix it.  Time is of the essence if we are to reach the deadline of switching off analogue television by 2012.    We cannot do that unless we find a way forward, and quickly, for the three multiplexes and their management for commercial DTT.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	420	The Broadcasting (Amendment) Act 2007 puts in place a flexible framework for the licensing of digital terrestrial television, DTT, into the future.  The Act provides for the establishment of a free to air DTT service to replace the existing analogue terrestrial services offered by RTE, TG4 and TV3.  The Act also provides for the development of commercial DTT services, which are anticipated to provide further choice to those who wish to avail of additional channels to the Irish free to air channels.  The current model proposes that RTE operate a single public service multiplex which provides access to the free to air Irish TV channels and that the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland, BCI, will offer licences for three commercial multiplexes.Under the Act, RTE, BCI and the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, have obligations to provide for the roll-out of DTT and to assist in the development of a plan for analogue switch off.  The public service multiplex, being provided by RTE, will carry the existing RTE One, RTE Two, TV3 and TG4 channels and will have the potential to carry a further four public service television channels.  RTE has already significantly progressed the roll-out of the public service multiplex and has indicated that services can be launched on a phased basis starting in autumn this year.  It is expected that the first phase of DTT services will provide coverage of about 85% of the country.On 7 March 2008, the BCI issued a call for applications for the award of a contract or contracts in respect of the operation of three national commercial DTT multiplexes and received applications from the following three consortia: Boxer DTT Limited, a consortium comprising a Swedish company, Boxer, Communicorp and BT Ireland; One Vision — a consortium comprising Eircom, TV3, Setanta and Arqiva; Easy TV — a consortium comprising RTE and UPC's parent company, Liberty Global.  On 21 July 2008 the BCI announced its intention to enter into contract negotiations with Boxer DTT Limited for the award of the three national commercial DTT multiplexes.On 20 April 2009, the BCI announced that Boxer DTT Limited had withdrawn from contract negotiations.  Boxer cited prevailing and anticipated economic circumstances, in addition to challenges in agreeing the terms of a contract with RTE Networks Limited, to the satisfaction of both parties, for the provision of transmission services by RTE Networks Limited.  The BCI has now approached the One Vision consortium with a view to entering into contract negotiations for the award of the three national commercial DTT multiplexes.The BCI has confirmed that it is committed to pursuing the development of DTT services in Ireland and will continue its work in that regard.  The Minister has no plans, at this time, to re-evaluate the process by which a commercial DTT licence is granted and expects RTE to deliver on its public service obligations.  The switch off of the national analogue broadcasting system is planned to take place by 2012 and will bring major benefits by the reallocation of valuable wireless spectrum for other use.  In this regard the Minister is closely monitoring the progress made by RTE, ComReg and the BCI in relation to the development of Irish DTT services.A working group has been established — comprising representatives from the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, RTE, BCI and ComReg — to begin work on planning the steps necessary to achieve analogue switch-off.  The Minister is cognisant of the fact that most European countries expect to switch off analogue services by 2012 and he remains committed to meeting this deadline so that Ireland can continue to compete at an international level in the broadcasting and broader communications markets.  Both RTE and the BCI are also aware of the importance of meeting this deadline.

A new school was constructed in Croghan, County Roscommon.  Croghan is a small village between Boyle, Carrick-on-Shannon and Elphin.  The population in the area is growing rapidly and the new school was a big attraction, with an increased number of pupils enrolling.  A fourth teacher will join the staff in September.  What was originally a two-teacher school is now a four-teacher school.Through a tax back scheme and church donations the board of management has received €50,000.  The local church fund has loaned the school another €50,000.  An outstanding amount of between €200,000 and €250,000 is required from the Department of Education and Science.  The school building has been completed and the staff are ready to move in.  However, the builder will not hand over the school until he receives payment.  If the new school is not operational, the school will have to rent another prefab.  There are two in place already.  The old school is for sale but due to the economic downturn, it cannot be sold.  It has a prime site of 0.75 acres on the main road.The proceeds from the sale of the school will be given to the Department of Education and Science, and a letter has been sent by the board of management to the Minister stating that.  The parents, staff and board of management have done everything possible to satisfy the Department's guidelines.  I commend them on their initiatives and co-operation with the Department.  I ask the Minister to release the funds necessary to enable the school children and their teachers to move into the new school.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	422	I am replying to this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, Minister for Education and Science.  I thank the Deputy for raising the matter as it gives me an opportunity to outline to the House the Department's position regarding the allocation of funding for Croghan national school, County Roscommon.This school was approved for funding under the 2006 small schools scheme.  A grant of €820,000, including VAT and fees, was sanctioned to enable the school to provide a new three-teacher school building.  Due to the condition of the old school the board of management decided to provide a complete new building on a new site.  The Department moved towards a model of devolving funding, responsibility and authority as appropriate for smaller building projects-refurbishments directly to school management authorities in 2003 with the introduction on a pilot basis of the devolved small schools and permanent accommodation schemes.  Due to the positive feedback from schools the schemes were extended to include additional schools in subsequent years.The small schools scheme allows boards of management to address their accommodation and building priorities with a guaranteed amount of funding and gives boards of management control of the building project.  The intention of the scheme is to provide funding to schools to enable them to undertake wanted building projects.  The scheme is not intended to leave schools with significant fund-raising needs but for the school to tailor the scope of capital works commissioned to the available funding.A central tenet of the scheme is that the schools, granted discretion and funding, must equally accept responsibility for prioritisation, adherence to statutory regulations, control of costs and ensuring value for money.  The decision on whether to continue participating in the scheme or to drop out, if the scope of build is more than the funding envelope permits, is a matter for each school authority.  The authorities of the Croghan school accepted the grant offer and returned a form of undertaking in March 2007 agreeing to comply with the requirements of the scheme.A letter and project cost details were received in May 2008 indicating that the total cost of the school's building proposals, for a three classroom school building with a large general purpose room, resource room, staff room and principal's office, would amount to €1.4672 million, an excess of €647,214 over the €820,000 grant on offer to the school.  The school submitted an appeal in October 2007 for increased funding of €333,347 from the Department and indicated that it would sell the old school building and site and come up with alternative sources of funding to cover the balance of the cost.  Following detailed consideration of the appeal the Department approved an additional grant of €330,000 bringing the total approved grant to €1.15 million. A total of 70% of the grant issued to the school in February 2008 following confirmation that the builder had commenced work on the project.  During the course of the construction an additional classroom was added to the new school building to cater for increasing enrolments.  Additional funding of €120,000 was approved by the Department in respect of the extra classroom.  The final cost of the project is in the region of €1.65 million.  The Department had approved funding of €1.273 million.The school appealed for additional funding to cover the shortfall as the downturn in the economy resulted in no demand for the old school building.  However, in line with the original intention of the small schools scheme, it was considered that the school should be encouraged to complete the project within the funding envelope provided and, accordingly, the application for additional grant aid was not granted.  It was considered that in the current economic climate and with considerable demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to entertain such significant increases in the amounts grant aided to the school, especially as it had already two increases in grant aid.  It is the responsibility of the school authorities to manage the resources allocated to them to ensure maximum value for money and to control costs.  A further appeal has been received from the board of management for additional funding and the Department will process it and a decision will be conveyed to the board in due course.I thank the Deputy again for giving me the opportunity of outlining the current position to the House.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	423	I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 11, 22, 31, 43, 140 and 141 together.The Government remains steadfast in its commitment to developing our bilateral migration arrangements with the United States, including finding a solution for our undocumented citizens.The Taoiseach and I emphasised the importance of this issue in our engagements with the US Administration and Congress during our visit to the United States for the St Patrick's Day period.Our support for the undocumented and for a new E3 bilateral programme was highlighted during our meetings with President Obama, Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Patrick Leahy. In addition, I raised the issue at my meeting with Secretary of State Clinton and in my discussions with Senator Chuck Schumer and Congresswoman Zoë Lofgren, the respective Chairs of the Senate and House subcommittees on immigration.At each of these meetings, the Taoiseach and I outlined how, in the absence of comprehensive immigration reform, the Government has been actively pursuing a bilateral approach, aimed at facilitating greater legal migration between the two countries. We recalled our three-pronged strategy: a reciprocal Working Holiday Agreement (now operational); new bilateral arrangements to provide reciprocal long term E3 working visas; and a solution for our undocumented.The provision of long term working visas similar to the E3 visas available to Australian citizens has already formed the basis for detailed discussions with senior members of Congress over the past twelve months. The inclusion of Ireland in an expanded version of the E3 programme would provide extensive new opportunities for Irish people to work in the United States and help ensure that a new generation of undocumented Irish does not develop. I am pleased to report that we received an encouraging response to this initiative during our meetings in Washington. Discussions on the detail will continue, in the first instance through our Embassy in Washington.The clear advice we received from both the Administration and Congress is that the position of undocumented residents continues to be a matter of considerable political sensitivity in the US. Those to whom we spoke were clear that it will not be possible to address the situation of the undocumented through an E3 visa facility and that the issue can only be tackled in the context of comprehensive immigration reform. We received no encouragement that it would be possible to address the situation of undocumented Irish immigrants in isolation from other ethnic groups.As the Deputies will be aware, President Obama and other senior members of the new Administration, including Secretary of State Clinton, have been strong supporters of comprehensive reform. While mindful of the considerable challenges ahead, indications over the Easter period that the Administration is about to begin an extensive consultative process on this issue are encouraging. The fact that the two main Labor Unions have recently announced a common approach to the issue is also considered helpful.The Government is determined to continue to highlight the difficulties facing our undocumented citizens and to press for reform.  I doing so, we will continue to work closely with our many friends in the Administration and on Capitol Hill, and with Irish community organisations in the United States, including the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform, with whom I met in New York in the course of the recent visit.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	424	The Euro-Mediterranean Partnership was established in 1995. At the Paris Summit for the Mediterranean, held on 13 July 2008, the process was formally re-launched as the Union for the Mediterranean. The Taoiseach attended the summit. The Partnership now includes all 27 Member States, along with sixteen Southern Mediterranean States. Libya remains outside the Partnership.Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Mediterranean Union met in Marseille on 3-4 November 2008 and discussed possible fields for cooperation. Among these are economic and trade partnership, maritime safety and migration matters.In the declaration from Marseille, the Ministers noted that the growing number of transit vessels, the increasing risks of accidents, the threat of terrorist actions and the rise in organised crime and illicit trafficking could jeopardise maritime trade flows. The Ministers considered that a forum of Mediterranean Coast Guard Services and, as appropriate, Maritime Services could be organised as an opportunity to exchange experience in these fields. The first meeting of the Forum will take place in Genoa on 6-7 May. It will provide an opportunity to create a framework for effective collaboration between the countries concerned.The Foreign Ministers noted that migration matters should be an integral part of the regional partnership and that issues such as legal migration, the fight against illegal migration, and the link between migration and development needed to be addressed. They underlined their commitment to facilitate legal movement of individuals and orderly-managed legal migration in the interest of all parties concerned.Illegal migration and people trafficking are amongst the most difficult problems facing the EU and its Mediterranean partners. Any solution to these problems must involve addressing their causes, in close cooperation with the Mediterranean partners.Libya, through which much illegal migration transits, is not a member of the Union for the Mediterranean. The European Union has been cooperating with Libya on migration for a number of years and is engaged in separate talks on a future Framework Agreement with Libya.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	425	I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 27 and 44 together.The regime governing the exploration and exploitation of the continental shelf in international law is set down by the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.  Under that Convention a coastal state is entitled to a continental shelf 200 nautical miles (approx. 370 km) in breadth regardless of whether its continental shelf physically extends that far, subject only to the similar rights of its coastal neighbours.  It may also claim a broader shelf where it can show that the natural prolongation of its land territory under water actually extends beyond that limit.  A claim to extended shelf must be supported by scientific and technical data and be established to the satisfaction of the UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf, which was created by the Convention for this purpose.Ireland's shelf naturally extends beyond 200 nautical miles both to the west and to the south of the country.  For the purposes of our claims we have divided the extended shelf into three sectors.The first sector is to the south-west of the country on the edge of an area known as the Porcupine Abyssal Plain.  This sector (which is approximately half the size of the State's land territory) is not disputed by any other state and was therefore the subject of Ireland's first submission to the Commission, made in May 2005.  Having considered this submission, in April 2007 the Commission issued its recommendations.  These confirmed Ireland's entitlement to extend our continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles in this sector and set out details of where the outer limit of the shelf should be established there.  The recommendations permit Ireland to designate extended shelf of approx. 39,000 square kilometres in area.This is a very satisfactory outcome and, accordingly, on 31 March last the Government made an Order under section 2 of the Continental Shelf Act 1968 which designates the additional seabed enclosed by the recommended limits as an area to which the 1968 Act applies.  The Order will shortly be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas in accordance with section 14 of the Act.  The effect of the Order is formally to establish the area concerned as Irish continental shelf.The second sector of claimed extended continental shelf is in the Celtic Sea and the Bay of Biscay, where there are unresolved boundary issues with the UK, France and Spain.  This sector was the subject of a joint submission made by the four countries in May 2006.  It covers an area of approximately 80,000 square kilometres, which is slightly larger than the State's land territory.The joint submission was examined by a subcommission established to consider the evidence submitted in support of it.  The four states met with the subcommission on a number of occasions, following which it formulated draft recommendations on the entitlement of the four to extend the continental shelf in this sector and setting out details of where the outer limit should be established there.  These recommendations were transmitted to the full Commission, which in turn adopted them on 24 March last.The recommendations will now be examined by the four states concerned, after which the question of division of the area between them will also be addressed.Ireland also claims continental shelf in the part of the North-East Atlantic Ocean known as the Hatton-Rockall Area, which extends up to 500 nautical miles from the coast.  Ireland and the UK agreed a maritime boundary on the continental shelf here in 1988 but this is not accepted by Iceland or Denmark, which is acting on behalf of the Færoe Islands, both of which also make extensive overlapping claims.  The four countries have met regularly since 2001 (most recently in London before Christmas) in an effort to resolve the issues arising from overlapping claims but to date have been unable to reach agreement.In view of this, and in consideration of the deadline of May 2009 applicable to Ireland for the making of submissions, the Government last month authorised the making of a national submission to the Commission in respect of the Hatton-Rockall Area. This submission was lodged with the Commission in New York on 31 March.  While the Commission's rules of procedure prevent its consideration of a submission concerning an area of disputed continental shelf without the consent of the states concerned, submission at this time preserves Ireland's position in advance of the expiration of the deadline.  In the meantime, the four states intend to keep the matter under regular review and we will continue to work for the creation of conditions that will permit consideration of the submission by the Commission.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	426	I propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 51, 53, 55, 154, 156 and 157 together.The total Official Development Assistance (ODA) budget for 2009 will be €696 million. €571 million will be administered by the Department of Foreign Affairs with the balance of €125 million being contributions to development co-operation by other Government Departments and through Ireland's allocation to the EU Development Co-operation Budget.  This represents 0.48% of estimated GNP for this year which should mean that Ireland will retain its position as the world's sixth largest donor on a per capita basis.I very much regret the fact that the Government was obliged, in response to budgetary pressures, to make short term reductions in the development assistance budget.  However, I do not consider this temporary reduction to be disproportionate to the long term need to return the economy to the pattern of growth necessary to fund further sustained expansion of the aid programme.Adjustments will be implemented across the programme in such a way as to minimise the impact in any one area.  Given the range, diversity and geographical spread of the aid programme it is necessary to look in detail at all aspects of our aid expenditures.  This work is under way.  The continuity and quality of our programmes will be maintained, but funding timeframes will have to be extended and disbursement rates modified.For example, I expect that the programmes and projects in our priority countries will be modified to adapt to the new budgetary reality.  In practical terms this will mean slower disbursement, but will not affect the final outputs, such as the number of schools built or teachers trained.  There will be no reduction in the enormously valuable technical expertise that Irish Aid officials continuously bring to their work with our partners.We will maintain our position as one of the most generous donors internationally to the non-governmental sector.  This year, notwithstanding the budget adjustments, Irish Aid will provide well over €100 million to NGOs and civil society.  This is a very large sum and will make an enormous difference to the lives of millions in the developing world.Our programmes of strategic co-operation with key UN development agencies such as UNICEF and UNHCR and others will also be maintained, but within lengthened timelines and some reductions in 2009 allocations will be implemented. These adjustments must be seen in the context of historically high contributions to the UN system.  We expect to deliver over €100 million to address HIV and AIDS and other communicable diseases. We also remain ready to assist in any sudden onset of natural and man made disasters. Funding of over €75 million has been set aside to address humanitarian emergencies, fragile states and conflict resolution.  Our pre-positioned emergency supplies remain in place and will be replenished as necessary.While the cut in the ODA allocation for 2009 is significant, it should be noted that it follows a period of unprecedented increases in ODA volumes.  In 1999, for instance, total ODA was just over €230 million.  The allocation of €696 million for 2009 represents a trebling in the volume of ODA delivered over the last ten years.  This is an achievement of which all Irish people should be proud.The difficult decision to reduce the ODA budget for 2009 will make it somewhat more difficult to achieve the target of spending 0.7% of GNP on ODA by 2012.  We will continue to work towards the target and a full assessment of our capacity to achieve the target will be made in the context of the preparation of the 2010 Budget.  It is important to note that Ireland remains the sixth largest donor in the world on a per capita  basis, and well ahead of most of our EU partners for the EU target of 0.7% of GNP by 2015.Our aid programme has just been reviewed by the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC).  The OECD DAC is the pre-eminent international body in relation to benchmarking donors such as Ireland against aid quality.  This key report will be published shortly.  I am gratified to know that the report will state that "Ireland is a champion in making aid more effective" and that "Irish Aid is a strong cutting edge development programme".  These are the views of an independent, objective and critical international aid organisation from which we can draw pride.  The Government will be working to ensure that these high standards are maintained.Our aid programme remains one of the best in the world.  We retain our core values of supporting the world's poorest in a way that builds capacity and addresses the fundamental causes of poverty.  Our growth trajectory will recommence as soon as our economic circumstances permit.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	427	At the meeting of the European Council in December, the Taoiseach briefed his colleagues on the issues underlying the outcome in the referendum on the Treaty of Lisbon last June.  He did so based on the extensive research and analysis commissioned by the Government in the wake of the vote, and on the excellent report of the Oireachtas sub-Committee on Ireland's Future in Europe.He highlighted a number of key issues of concern to voters, and, in response, the European Council collectively agreed that these concerns "shall be addressed to the mutual satisfaction of Ireland and other Member States".  Specifically, the European Council agreed that, provided the Treaty of Lisbon enters into force, each member state will continue to have the right to nominate a Commissioner.  It agreed that legal guarantees will be given to Ireland in the areas of taxation, defence and the provisions of the Constitution on the right to life, education and family.  It also agreed that the high importance the EU attaches to social issues, including workers' rights, will be confirmed.Detailed work is now under way to give effect to these commitments.  This work should be finalised by mid-2009.  If the Government is fully satisfied with the outcome, as we expect to be, we are committed to seeking ratification of the Treaty by the end of the term of the current Commission, which is expected to leave office at the end of October.Our work has been taken forward at a number of different levels with our EU partners and with the EU institutions.  Throughout, we have stressed the need for the guarantees to be legally robust.  In this we have the firm understanding and support of our partners.  As recent events have underscored, the European Union remains a key vehicle for the promotion and protection of Ireland's national interest.  The Government attaches utmost priority to securing our future by ensuring that Ireland remains at the heart of the Union.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	428	The coalition government led by Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek lost a vote of confidence in the Czech Parliament on 24 March, resulting in the automatic resignation of the Prime Minister, who continued in a caretaker capacity, pending the appointment of a Prime Minister by President Klaus.  Negotiations between the two government parties and the Social Democrats, led by Mr. Jirí Paroubek, have led to agreement that the current head of the Czech Statistical Office, Jan Fischer, will lead the interim government to rule from 10 May until early elections, set for 9 and 10 October.In the meantime, the business of the European Union has continued, with Mr. Topolánek representing the EU at the G20 meeting in London on 2 April and the EU-US Summit in Prague on 5 April. Council meetings chaired by the responsible Czech Ministers have also continued and I expect that the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 2 7 April will conduct its business as usual under the able chairmanship of Deputy Prime Minister Vondra and Foreign Minister Schwarzenberg.A change of government during an EU Presidency has occurred in the past (for example during the Danish Presidencies of 1982 and 1993, the French Presidency of 1995, the Italian Presidency of 1996 for example), but the uncertainty which arises is clearly not the optimal situation.  Indeed Deputy Prime Minister Vondra has himself suggested that while the first three months of the Czech EU presidency were proof that small countries can lead the EU, the fall of the Czech government is an argument for bringing an end to the practice of a rotating EU presidency, something that is foreseen in the Lisbon Treaty.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	429	I am aware of the report of the visit to Spain in May 2008 by the Special Rapporteur on the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism, Mr. Martin Scheinin, which was presented to the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva on 10 March 2009.The Special Rapporteur noted that Spain has a vibrant democracy albeit with a continuing presence of domestic terrorism and a threat of international terrorism.  He found that the basic legal provisions in the Spanish Penal Code regarding the combating of terrorism were sound.  The representative of the Czech Republic, on behalf of the EU, thanked the Special rapporteur for his report.Spain is confronting a serious terrorist threat in the form of continuing ETA violence.  Since the breakdown of the 2006 ceasefire, there have been various acts of violence by ETA including killings of police officers, a former politician and a contractor involved in the Madrid-Bilbao rail link.The Spanish security forces and legal system have dealt with this situation within the framework of the Spanish penal code and their Law on Political Parties.  This Law allows inter alia for parties which promote or legitimate violence to be declared illegal.  Throughout the EU, the rules on the registration of political parties are determined at national level. Indeed, this principle is specifically recognised in Regulation (EC) 2004/2003 which sets out the funding regulations for European-level political parties.I understand that the Spanish Government has rejected a number of the views put forward by the rapporteur.  In particular, it does not accept that its legal framework could impact on its human rights obligations.  Nevertheless the Spanish Government has expressed readiness to continue dialogue on points which could strengthen its existing framework.Finally, I would recall that ETA has been included on the EU list of terrorist organisations since December 2001.  By a unanimous decision of the EU member States, Batasuna was added to this list on 4 June 2003.  In taking this decision, the Council was satisfied that Batasuna was a terrorist organisation and that it was an alias of ETA.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	430	The situation of members of the minority Baha'i faith in Iran has long been a matter of serious concern to the Government and to members of the Oireachtas.There is in Iran no tolerance of the Baha'i faith, which is regarded as a heretical or apostate offshoot of Islam.  In recent years, there has been a serious and progressive increase in harassment of individual Baha'is, and worrying indications that these are part of a concerted effort by the Iranian authorities to destroy the Baha'i faith and community as a whole.  I have replied in detail to Parliamentary Questions about these issues on a number of occasions.Particular concern has arisen in relation to the group of Baha'i the Deputy refers to, five men and two women, who were detained in March and May 2008, and held in Evin Prison in Tehran, without any charge, for nine months.  During this period their only outside contact was a family visit of ten minutes approximately once per month, and the five men are understood to have been held in a single cell with no bed.We understand that these seven people constitute an informal leadership group, attempting to maintain links among the Baha'i communities throughout Iran.  Their arrest gives rise to particular concern because of the fate of the previous Baha'i leadership, who in 1980 in the early days of the Islamic Republic were arrested and never seen again.  The successor leadership were also arrested in 1981 and executed.The seven Baha'i currently in custody have been charged with a number of offences, including; running an illegal organisation, anti-regime propaganda, insulting religious values, and espionage on behalf of Israel.  These are obviously very serious charges, which could lead to the application of the death penalty, and the basis for which must be seriously questioned.  My concerns are heightened by the fact that the lawyers for the accused have been unable to see them at all, have been denied access to the case files, and have themselves been subject to public criticism and harassment.  There seems very little prospect of even a semblance of a fair trial in these circumstances.I have directly raised my concerns regarding the treatment of the Baha'i with members of the Iranian Government, including with Foreign Minister Mottaki at the United Nations General Assembly in September 2008 and with Deputy Foreign Minister Safari in Dublin in June 2008.  In December 2008, I wrote to Foreign Minister Mottaki on human rights concerns in general, and I raised the issue of the Baha'i and the case of these seven representatives in particular.  I said in that letter that I have directly raised my concerns regarding the treatment of the Baha'i with members of the Iranian Government, including with Foreign Minister Mottaki at the United Nations General Assembly in September 2008 and with Deputy Foreign Minister Safari in Dublin in June 2008.  In December 2008, I wrote to Foreign Minister Mottaki on human rights concerns in general, and I raised the issue of the Baha'i and the case of these seven representatives in particular.  I said in that letter that : "It is difficult in these circumstances to avoid the conclusion that the Government and authorities of Iran are actively trying to suppress a religious faith."I recently received a lengthy response from Foreign Minister Mottaki, which I am studying closely.  However, his reply would not appear to go beyond previous statements by the Iranian authorities on human rights issues or provide the necessary assurances in relation to the specific treatment of these seven detained Baha'i.The European Union has repeatedly drawn attention to the oppression perpetrated against the Baha'i faith and its members by the Islamic Republic of Iran.  This has taken the form of communications to the Iranian authorities, public statements, and action in other forums such as the UN.  Officers of my Department met with the Iranian Ambassador to Ireland just last month, to reiterate my concerns, and members of my Department's Human Rights Unit have also met recently with representatives of the Baha'i community here.  I will continue to follow this case with great concern, and to bring our views to the notice of the Iranian authorities.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	431	I propose to take Questions Nos. 19, 23 and 47 together.I am very concerned by the situation in Somalia, which has been without an effective government since 1991.  Since it was established in 2004, the UN-backed Transitional Federal Government (TFG) has made little headway in establishing effective control over the country's territory and restoring peace and security.  Continuous instability and conflict, as well as deepening drought, have caused a huge humanitarian crisis.  The number of people dependent on international aid almost doubled in the course of 2008 and now stands at more than three million.A change of leadership at the head of the TFG in January 2009 has been welcomed as a potentially positive step in Somalia's decades-long political crisis.  With this political progress has come some slight alleviation of the humanitarian situation; so far this year, 60,000 displaced persons have returned to the capital Mogadishu.  The office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Mogadishu, which had been closed since July 2008, has now reopened.  However, instability in other areas of Somalia continues to cause new displacements.  A change of leadership at the head of the TFG in January 2009 has been welcomed as a potentially positive step in Somalia's decades-long political crisis.  With this political progress has come some slight alleviation of the humanitarian situation; so far this year, 60,000 displaced persons have returned to the capital Mogadishu.  The office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Mogadishu, which had been closed since July 2008, has now reopened.  However, instability in other areas of Somalia continues to cause new displacements.  The new administration faces enormous challenges, not least the fact that it controls little of the country's territory, and that some significant armed groups remain opposed to the President.Despite this recent progress, Somalia remains one of the most dangerous environments in the world for humanitarian workers, who face random violence, kidnapping, extortion, landmines and banditry. Most international agencies base their operations in neighbouring Kenya, with only occasional visits to Somalia, as it is too dangerous to operate full time in-country.  Even so, two international aid workers visiting Somalia from Kenya were kidnapped as recently as 19 April.  Of course, it is the Somali people who suffer most from the lack of an effective system of law enforcement or justice — whether they are aid workers trying to help their fellow citizens, human rights defenders or journalists who may have offended one of the many armed groups, or ordinary people just trying to survive.The absence of any effective law enforcement has also allowed crimes such as piracy to flourish unchecked off the Somali coast.  The waters around the Horn of Africa and the Gulf of Aden are the most dangerous in the world for piracy.  In 2008, this region accounted for 37% of all global incidents reported to the International Maritime Bureau.  The area affected covers more than 2 million square miles and more than 24,000 ships pass through the Gulf of Aden in a year.Piracy off the Somali coast threatens the delivery of assistance, with many people dependent on the World Food Programme's maritime supply line for food aid.  Furthermore, the threat of attacks on ships headed for Mombasa in Kenya presents a significant danger, since Mombasa port is essential to humanitarian operations in Somalia and the wider region.  The EU's first ever naval ESDP mission, EUNAVFOR Somalia, is playing its part in international efforts to combat piracy, including facilitating the escort of World Food Program (WFP) ships into Mogadishu.  The EU operation is designed to improve safety at sea, accompanying ships of the WFP and monitoring territorial waters.  Its activities have resulted in a significant decrease in incidents of piracy and are an ongoing contribution to the free use of the seas in this zone.Ultimately, both the piracy problem and the insecurity, poverty and humanitarian crisis which affect Somalis are consequences of the fact that Somalia remains a failed state.  The only long-term solution would be the restoration of effective government, and the gradual building up of adequate justice and policing systems.  The EU is strongly supportive of efforts to restore peace to Somalia, and is the largest humanitarian donor to the country.  But peace cannot be enforced from outside, and the Somali people themselves must find a solution.  The new President has made a good start by reaching out to all parties and by his openness to dialogue, and I very much hope that his efforts will be rewarded with success.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	432	Turkey has had a perspective towards membership of the European Union since the conclusion of the Association Agreement of 1963, although negotiations on accession did not open until 2005.Negotiations with Turkey are proceeding, albeit at a slow pace.  Of the 35 negotiating chapters, ten are now open, of which one has been provisionally closed.  In its 2008 assessment of Turkey's preparations for accession, the Commission calls on Turkey to reinvigorate the process of political reform.  It states that significant further reforms are needed, in particular on amending the rules governing political parties; freedom of expression and freedom of religion; and to establish an ombudsman function.  In the Commission's view, further progress is also needed in other areas such as judicial reform, the fight against corruption, gender equality, minority rights and the civilian control of the military and to bring the legislation on trade unions into line with ILO and EU standards.The Progress Report makes it clear that the pace of the accession negotiations will reflect the pace of reform as well as Turkey's fulfilment of the necessary conditions for membership.  Following the start of full fledged negotiations between the leaders of the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities, the Commission also encourages Turkey to support a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus issue.  Turkey has not yet fulfilled its obligations of full non-discriminatory implementation of the Additional Protocol of the Association Agreement by opening its ports and airports to vessels and aircraft from the Republic of Cyprus.  Eight specific negotiating chapters cannot be opened, nor can any more chapters be provisionally closed, until Turkey fulfils its commitments under this so-called Ankara Protocol.Ireland continues to support the accession negotiations with Turkey, while insisting that Turkey fulfil its obligations, including supporting a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus issue and fulfilling its obligations under the Additional Protocol.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	433	On 19 February, the Kyrgyz Parliament approved a government order to close the Manas air-base operated by the United States.  Manas, which is the only US base in Central Asia, is a key transit point for supplies to US operations in Afghanistan.While the timing of the current announcement was a surprise, there have been question marks over the base's long-term survival since July 2005, when the Shanghai Co-operation Organisation (SCO), which includes among its members the countries of Central Asia along with Russia and China, passed a resolution calling for all non-SCO bases to be removed from Central Asia.  Kyrgyzstan is also host to a Russian airforce base located a few miles from that operated by the US.  The Russian Federation has made it clear that it does not favour a long-term US presence in Central Asia.  The possible closure of the US base has been raised on several occasions, and the US has had to re-negotiate its arrangement with the Kyrgyz Government previously to enable the base to continue to operate.I do not, of course, have specific information on the precise effects the closure of the air-base would have in operational terms on US activities in Afghanistan and Pakistan.  However, I do not expect the closure of the base to diminish the importance attached by the new US Administration to a resolution of the conflict in Afghanistan.  As the Deputy will be aware, President Obama on 27 March announced the results of the US Strategy Review on Afghanistan and Pakistan in which he committed additional military forces to the region but also outlined a shift in emphasis towards training and increasing the size of the Afghan security forces which would allow the Afghans to take responsibility for their own security.  There is also strong emphasis in the new US Strategy, and in the conclusions of The Hague International Conference on Afghanistan held on 30 March, on the importance of stepping up international support for reconstruction and other non-military interventions in order to improve the daily lives of the Afghan people.I welcome and support the changes of approach which the US and international community have agreed to adopt.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	434	The meeting in Prague was an informal summit arranged by the Czech Presidency to enable the Heads of State and Government of the European Union and the President of the European Commission to meet President Obama on his first visit to Europe since taking office.  The meeting in Prague on 5 April in Prague took place immediately after the G-20 Summit held in London on 2 April and the NATO Summit held in Strasbourg in France and in Baden-Baden in Germany on 3-4 April.Although no formal agreements were reached at this informal meeting, it did provide a very valuable opportunity for discussions on a wide range of political and economic topics of global concern.  I believe that the meeting helped to strengthen relations between the European Union and the new administration in Washington.  A strong transatlantic partnership based on shared principles and values can only be of benefit to both sides and to the global community at large.  It is intended the issues discussed in Prague and other issues will be taken up at the regular EU-US Summit in June.In the economic area discussions in Prague focused mainly on the current global financial situation.  Both the EU and the US had contributed to the successful outcome of the G20 summit in London and both remain determined to work closely together to ensure implementation of the decisions reached there.  Both sides are committed to strengthening the Transatlantic Economic Council so as to strengthen and develop transatlantic and international trade and investment.  Both the EU and the US remain committed to reaching a balanced and ambitious outcome to WTO Doha Development Round.Discussions on climate change focused on the need for transatlantic cooperation in the lead up to UN conference to take place in Copenhagen in December, which is aimed at bringing about a global and comprehensive climate agreement.  Discussions also took place on regional issues including the Middle East Peace Process, Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan.  The Taoiseach spoke on behalf of the EU at the meeting with President Obama on the situation in the Middle East, with particular reference to Syria and Lebanon. I also spoke for the EU on the current state of the Middle East Peace Process at the Foreign Ministers' lunch with US Secretary of State Clinton.The EU side welcomed the US decision to close Guantanamo and indicated that it stood ready to cooperate with the US administration in that regard.  The EU looks forward to working with the US in the fight against terrorism, in full respect of human rights and international humanitarian law.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	435	The Embassy in Washington, in close co-ordination with the state agencies, has been monitoring all proposals for policy initiatives, under the new Administration, which could potentially impact on the Irish economy.  The Embassy has been engaging with US policy makers on relevant issues as they arise.  These include proposals in relation to taxation.One important issue in this regard is proposals to make changes to the current ‘deferral' system for US international corporation tax.  We wish to make sure that our very positive experience of substantive investment by US companies competing globally using Ireland as a base feeds into consideration of these issues by the Administration and Congress.The Taoiseach and I made this a strong theme of our meetings with relevant policy makers during our visit to Washington on St Patrick's Day.  The Taoiseach raised the specific issues of potential changes to US tax policy with President Obama.  I also raised the issue with Secretary Clinton, emphasising the strong and very mutually beneficial economic partnership facilitated by the current tax framework.  It was also the subject of discussion with key members of Congress with whom we met during our visit.The Tánaiste has also just returned from a visit to Washington DC where she addressed these issues with the Administration and relevant members of Congress.  The Embassy in Washington, working in full co-operation with the IDA, will continue to monitor these issues very closely as they develop during this session of Congress.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	436	The issue of the establishment of the North-South Consultative Forum, provided for in the Good Friday Agreement, has been discussed with the Northern Ireland Executive within the framework of the North/South Ministerial Council on a number of occasions.At the first plenary meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council since the re-establishment of the Northern Ireland Executive, which took place in Armagh in July 2007, the Council noted that the Government would consult with the social partners on the matter. It also noted the review of arrangements for consulting civic society in Northern Ireland and agreed to consider the matter once that review is complete.At its plenary meeting in Dundalk in February 2008, the North-South Ministerial Council noted the completion of the Government's consultation with social partners on the subject of the North South Consultative Forum and noted the position as previously outlined for reviewing the Civic Forum in Northern Ireland.The North-South Ministerial Council most recently considered the matter at its plenary meeting in Derry on 23 January last, which I attended.  The plenary meetings are co-chaired by the Taoiseach and the First and deputy First Minister and attended by Government and Executive Ministers.  On that occasion, the Council noted the Government's proposals on the role, format, membership and operation of such a North-South Consultative Forum, which were prepared following the Government's consultation with the social partners and various cross-border and North/South groups in 2008.  The Council also noted the progress made in reviewing the Civic Forum in Northern Ireland and agreed to return to consider the matter of the Consultative Forum once the review of the Northern Ireland Civic Forum is complete.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	437	I propose to take Questions Nos. 28 and 49 together.I am aware of the case of the three Saharawi prisoners, Khallihanna Aboulhassan, Ali Salem Ablagh and Brahim Baryaz, who are understood to have been on hunger strike since mid-February. My Department is closely monitoring developments in relation to this case through our Embassy in Portugal which is also accredited to Morocco.  We are liaising closely with EU partners as regards what scope there may be for common action in relation to this case while our Embassy in Lisbon has also brought this matter to the attention of local human rights organisations in Morocco.The situation of the Saharawi hunger strikers was also discussed at the conference on global resources, human rights and the environment organised by Ethical Development Action which I was pleased to be invited to address in Cork earlier this month.  The Conference focused on raising awareness and renewing public attention on what has, regrettably, become a frozen conflict in the Western Sahara.  I was privileged to meet with a number of delegates who had travelled from Western Sahara to tell their personal stories of hardship and deprivation.The Government strongly supports the continuing engagement of the United Nations in the search for a political solution in the Western Sahara based on the principle of self-determination.  We have consistently supported the right to self-determination of the people of the Western Sahara. Ireland has not taken a position on the future of the Territory, be it full independence, autonomy, or integration under Moroccan sovereignty, so long as it is decided in a genuine exercise of self-determination.  UN Secretary General Ban has appointed former US Ambassador Christopher Ross as his new Personal Envoy for Western Sahara.  I wish Mr. Ross well in his new role, and we will give him our full support.Under the auspices of the United Nations, representatives of the Government of Morocco and of the Polisario Front have held a series of four direct meetings in Manhasset, New York, to discuss the future of the Territory of the Western Sahara.  The most recent meeting was held in March 2008.  There has unfortunately been no substantive progress at these talks so far. Morocco has set out its vision of an autonomous Government in the Territory, operating under Moroccan sovereignty.  In response, the Polisario Front has set out its position in favour of the creation of an independent State in close association with Morocco, and with protection for Moroccan vital interests. Morocco has refused, however, to discuss any proposals which include independence as one of the possibilities for the Territory.  This is the same impasse on which previous UN plans to organise a referendum in the Territory foundered.  It is difficult to see how genuine self-determination can be exercised without a referendum in which the people can freely choose between all of the possible options, ranging from full integration with Morocco to full independence.  Such a referendum was also recommended in the Baker Plan.Although there is clearly a broad gap between these two competing visions of the parties, I regard it as a positive and helpful development that both sides have set out their proposals for the future, and the measures they can envisage to accommodate the concerns of the other side.  The most recent round also agreed some extension of confidence-building measures in relation to family links between Saharawi people in the Territory and in the refugee camps in Algeria.  The parties have agreed to meet again, at a date to be decided.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	438	I refer the Deputy to my replies to Priority Question No. 5 and Question No. 42 today, in which I dealt with relations with the new Israeli Government and our expectations of it.I have no immediate plans for a meeting with Foreign Minister Lieberman, although the next meeting of the EU-Israel Association Council on 18 May might provide such an opportunity.  However, I look forward to working with the new Israeli Government, to impressing upon them our concerns, to encouraging them to act positively to bring about a lasting settlement in the area and to improving our bilateral relations.
#PeterPowerFF	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-party	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-dob	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	439	I propose to take Questions Nos. 30, 63 and 143 together.The Government's aid programme, Irish Aid, provides assistance to over 90 developing countries.  The programme is recognised internationally for its strong focus on the least developed countries in the world, with a particular emphasis on some of the poorest countries in Africa.  Nine countries have been designated as Programme Countries for Irish assistance, seven of them in Africa, with a commitment to long term strategic assistance.  These are Tanzania, Zambia, Lesotho, Mozambique, Uganda, Ethiopia, Malawi, Vietnam and Timor Leste.Support to Programme Countries is framed in agreed country strategies, which are focused on poverty reduction through the implementation of each country's own national development plan.  In addition to this programme funding, Irish Aid provides assistance under emergency and humanitarian subheads, through its funding of the activities and programmes of NGOs and through our contributions to UN and other international agencies.In 2007, programme funding amounting to over €185 million was provided to our nine programme countries.  In 2008, this programme funding amounted to almost €220 million.  The breakdown of these figures is as follows:CountryAmountTanzania€32 million was provided in 2007 and €38 million in 2008.Zambia€22 million was provided in 2007 and €23.5 million in 2008.Lesotho€9.4 million was provided in 2007 and over €9 million in 2008.Mozambique€31 million was provided in 2007 and €34 million in 2008.Uganda€35 million was provided in 2007 and €42 million in 2008.Ethiopia€32 million was provided in 2007 and €36 million in 2008.Vietnam€19 million was provided in 2007 and €21 million in 2008.Timor Leste€4 million was provided in 2007 and €5 million in 2008.In Malawi, which became Irish Aid's ninth Programme Country in 2007, almost €10 million was disbursed in 2008.I very much regret that it has been necessary to reduce funding to the development programme for 2009 in the context of the extremely difficult economic situation that the country now faces.  The overall allocation for overseas development assistance in 2009 will now be €696 million.  This should leave Ireland as the sixth most generous donor in the world on a per capita basis.We are at present working on the adjustments which will be required to the programme.  Given the size of the overall reduction, there will inevitably be adjustments across the programme, including some reductions in our bilateral assistance to programme countries.  However, the Government is determined that the continuity of our programmes will be maintained. In some cases, funding timeframes will be extended and disbursement rates modified. Irish Aid's clear focus on the reduction of poverty and hunger, and on the least developed countries, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, will be maintained.Decisions on the adjustments to the aid budgets for each of the nine programme countries have not yet been finalised. Discussions are continuing with the Embassies in our programme countries on how best to manage these adjustments.  As part of this process, we are engaging in dialogue with our partners on the budgetary situation and its implications.  We will maintain the high standards of Ireland's development co-operation programme and its credibility and transparency at home and abroad.    We have also given a clear assurance that once the Irish economy has returned to a pattern of sustainable growth, we will resume the expansion of our aid programme.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	440	As the Deputy will be aware, the relationship between the Russian Federation and Georgia was seriously affected by the conflict which broke out on 7-8 August 2008 in the Georgian separatist region of South Ossetia and by the decision by the Russian Federation to recognise the separatist regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia as independent states.  Direct contacts have been limited since that time, and neither country retains an Embassy in the other's capital.In response to the fighting in August, a number of international actors — principally the EU and also the UN and OSCE — have been working to achieve a lasting and peaceful resolution to the conflicts in South Ossetia and Abkhazia.  In this regard, Ireland has supported the conflict- resolution efforts of the EU by providing four persons to the EU Monitoring Mission (EUMM).  The EUMM, together with the UN and OSCE missions, is part of the international mechanism for monitoring the 12 August ceasefire. Ireland and the EU also provided humanitarian assistance to those affected by the fighting.Under the terms of the ceasefire, four sessions of peace talks have been held in Geneva under the co-chairmanship of the EU, the UN and the OSCE.  This process is an essential part of efforts to implement the agreements reached on 12 August and 8 September between the EU and Russia on Georgia, and I am pleased that some progress has been achieved on the important humanitarian issue of internally displaced persons. During my visit to Georgia on 20-21 November last, this was one of the issues which I particularly highlighted.  The fifth round of the Geneva talks is scheduled for 18/19 May 2009.I am sure the Deputy will share my hope that more recent international developments, and an improved atmosphere between Russia and other international actors, including the EU, will help with continuing efforts to achieve a lasting solution to the situation in Georgia.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	441	The Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) has long been notorious for gross human rights violations it has committed in its insurrection against the Government of Uganda over the last two decades, including murder, abduction, sexual enslavement, mutilation and kidnapping of young children to use as fighters.  Several leading LRA figures, including its leader, Joseph Kony, have been indicted by the International Criminal Court on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity. Ireland fully supports the work of the Court in relation to such grave offences.The LRA fled northern Uganda some years ago under pressure from the Ugandan army, and has since based itself in particularly remote, unstable and inaccessible areas of south Sudan, the Central African Republic, and especially the north-east Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).  Since these areas have little contact with the outside world, it is difficult to estimate accurately the current strength of the group.  Most observers believe it currently has between 600 and 1,000 fighters.The strength of the LRA is known to have been diminished following a December 2008 joint offensive against it by the Ugandan and Congolese armed forces.  The Ugandan-led Operation "Lightning Thunder" was launched following the LRA's failure to sign a peace agreement, amid fears that it could resume its campaign of violence, destabilising the wider region.LRA positions in Garamba National Park in north-eastern DRC were attacked, and Uganda has declared that as a result of the operation, 85 LRA fighters were killed, 385 people were rescued or escaped, the LRA's food supply was destroyed, and its command structure severely disrupted.  Tragically, LRA fighters fleeing the offensive launched brutal attacks on the civilian population, in which up to 1,100 civilians were killed. In March 2009, following a meeting between the Ugandan and DRC Presidents, the Ugandan Army began a phased withdrawal of troops from north-eastern DRC, with DRC forces to assume full responsibility combating LRA activity inside DRC's borders.There have long been allegations that, during the long-running north-south Sudanese civil war, the LRA received support from Khartoum to act as a proxy force against Southern Sudanese forces.  Following a 1999 agreement between Uganda and Sudan to cease supporting rebel groups on each other's territory, and subsequent improvements in diplomatic relations, Khartoum denies giving any further support to the LRA; however, the allegations persist.  The LRA may also receive support from some members of the ethnic-Acholi diaspora from northern Uganda.The situation in the border regions between Uganda and DRC remains unstable.  In addition to the LRA conflict, a number of other rebel militias are active in DRC's North and South Kivu provinces, where severe violence erupted in August 2008.  The situation in the Kivus is significantly calmer now, but a lasting solution is yet to be found, and civilians remain vulnerable to attack, including by some members of the DRC army.  Increased cooperation between the governments of the region in combating the causes of instability is an encouraging sign, but an early return to stability is not to be expected.Ireland strongly supports the work of the former President of Mozambique, Joaquim Chissano, who serves as the UN Secretary-General's Special Envoy for the LRA-affected areas, in his efforts to bring a lasting peace to the region. Ireland has provided significant financial support for negotiations between the Ugandan Government and the LRA in the context of the Juba Peace Process.  We have also provided €12.4 million in support to the DRC in 2008, most of it for humanitarian purposes, including for the Kivu provinces.  To date in 2009, Irish Aid has allocated over €4.1 million in emergency funding for DRC.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	442	The Government welcomes the strong indications from the Obama Administration of its intention to engage with the international community, and to work co-operatively to address a range of issues of concern to countries around the world.  Both President Obama and Secretary of State Clinton have made clear their readiness to bring a fresh perspective to many of the issues on the international agenda.  This has already been reflected in new approaches to various foreign policy problems, and in greater openness to working with others to address global challenges.As a long-standing and close friend of the United States, Ireland attaches high importance to developing further its co-operation with the United States on areas of mutual interest.  The Deputy will be aware that the Taoiseach's meeting with President Obama at the White House on St. Patrick's Day offered an invaluable opportunity for detailed engagement with the President and his new Administration.  The discussions with President Obama covered a wide range of issues, including in the foreign policy field, of interest to Ireland and the United States.Also in Washington, I had a very useful meeting with Secretary of State Hilary Clinton.  We discussed a broad range of foreign policy issues, including the Middle East, Afghanistan, Cuba, developments in the European Union and immigration reform.  We also discussed the scope for co-operation on development issues and in the area of conflict resolution.  I welcomed the emphasis which the Secretary of State has placed on using "smart power" to address the various global challenges before us, and we agreed that there was scope to expand our cooperation in this regard.With regard to the overall development of links between Ireland and the United States, the Deputy will be aware that the Taoiseach last month launched the Strategic Review of Ireland-US relations.  Among a wide range of recommendations aimed at strengthening ties between the two countries, the Review highlights the value of a strengthened dialogue between Ireland and the United States on foreign policy issues.  My Department is at present working to advance this and other recommendations contained in the Review.Ireland and the United States enjoy close political, economic and cultural relations.  Successive Presidents and their Administrations, and Ireland's many friends on Capitol Hill from both sides of the aisle, have made an enormous contribution to bringing peace and economic prosperity to this island.  The Government attaches the highest importance to strengthening the unique relationship between the two countries and will continue to work with the United States on issues of common concern.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	443	Elections are currently under way in India, the world's largest democracy.  With 700 million Indians eligible to vote (including some 43 million who will be voting for the first time), this will be the largest electoral exercise ever undertaken in any country.Given the scale of India and the size of the electorate, the elections are taking place in five phases.  The first of these took place on 16 April, the second is taking place today (23 April), and there will be three more phases, culminating on 13 May.  Ballots will be counted on 16 May and the 15th "Lok Sabha" (India's lower house of Parliament) will be sworn in on a date in early June, when a new Government will also be established.  The elections are an enormous logistical exercise and a most impressive and powerful demonstration of democracy in action in the world's second most populous country.I very much welcome the vibrant democratic process which is in evidence in India and I condemn the actions of terrorist groups which have sought to subvert this process by violent means during the first phase of voting.  Regrettably, these actions have caused the deaths of some 17 people, including electoral officials and security personnel.Ireland has a strong, multi-faceted relationship with India which has deep historical roots and we look forward to developing this further with the next Indian Government.
#PeterPowerFF	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-party	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-dob	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	444	The Government remains seriously concerned about the humanitarian situation in Zimbabwe.  Through the aid programme, we are providing significant assistance for humanitarian purposes and specifically for the treatment and prevention of HIV and AIDS.  Irish Aid is working in partnership with Non-governmental Organisations, missionaries and international organisations in order to provide assistance to the people of Zimbabwe.  Ireland does not provide funding to the Government of Zimbabwe.In 2007, total funding allocated to Zimbabwe under the aid programme amounted to € 9.4 million.  In 2008, total funding increased to some €11.4 million.I am not in a position at this stage to specify the total amount of funding which will be allocated for Zimbabwe during 2009.  However, so far this year the Government has provided €2.25 million in emergency and recovery funding in Zimbabwe, €1.8 million for the humanitarian operations of a number of Non-governmental Organisations, and a further €1.5 million to support HIV and AIDS programmes in the country.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	445	The Government strongly supports the process of developing strict controls on arms and works actively to promote the objective of strengthening arms controls globally, particularly to areas of concern such as the Middle East.  The Programme for Government commits us to supporting a binding and comprehensive global treaty on the arms trade, covering all weapons and ammunition.  To this end, Ireland is working hard at the United Nations towards our goal of achieving such a binding and comprehensive treaty.In order to exercise the highest possible level of ‘responsibility, transparency and restraint' with regards to arms exports and to encourage other States that export weapons to do the same, the EU agreed a legally binding Council Common Position 2008/944/CFSP in December 2008.  This defines common rules governing control of exports of military technology and equipment and ensures that every application for a licence to export items on the EU Common Military List is assessed against eight criteria.These criteria take into consideration a number of factors including matters such as respect for the international obligations and commitments of Member States, in particular the sanctions adopted by the UN Security Council or the European Union; respect for human rights in the country of final destination as well as respect by that country of international humanitarian law; the internal situation in the country of final destination — existence of tension or armed conflict; preservation of regional peace, security and stability; national security of Member States and of friendly and allied countries; terrorism and respect for international law; the risk of diversion, either within the buyer country or by re-export; the compatibility of the particular equipment with the level of development of the country in question.I am satisfied that the EU Common Position ensures that the export of military technology and equipment from the EU to the Middle East and elsewhere is carried out with the highest possible standard of conduct and I will cooperate with my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, to ensure that Ireland continues to implement fully the Council Common Position.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	446	The political situation in Zimbabwe remains fragile, despite the formation of a power-sharing government in February involving President Robert Mugabe's Zanu-PF and the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC).  This new Government faces enormous challenges in delivering real progress for the people of Zimbabwe, including securing political freedoms, a return to the rule of law and economic development. While some progress has been made, the continuation of land seizures is not a hopeful sign.  The retention of Gideon Gono as Governor of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe seems to undermine the Government's commitment to economic stabilisation and reform.While there has been a slight improvement in the humanitarian situation in Zimbabwe since early 2009, I remain deeply concerned by the plight of Zimbabwe's people.  Although the rate of infection has slowed, the cholera epidemic which began in Zimbabwe last year continues to be a major problem, and the World Health Organisation reports that 92% of districts are still affected.  The death toll exceeded 4,000 by the end of March, with the number infected approaching 100,000.  Water provision and hygiene promotion remain key problems.  In addition, more than half of Zimbabwe's population has depended on food aid for survival over the past number of months.Ireland has been working hard with its EU partners to keep the issue of Zimbabwe high on the international agenda.  We have repeatedly stated our willingness to re-engage with a Zimbabwean government which returns to respect for human rights, the rule of law and sound economic management. International donors, including Ireland, have agreed to work with the transitional government to achieve specific goals set out in the power-sharing agreement, including the restoration of the rule of law, economic stabilisation and full access to humanitarian assistance.  We intend that progress in our relationship with Zimbabwe will be dependent on concrete achievements in these areas, and the demonstration by the new government of a commitment to real reform.Ireland has worked with its partners in the EU and with other partners to develop a consistent international approach which seeks to ensure that the needs of the Zimbabwean people are given priority by the international community.  Our position is very well known and we will continue to raise our concerns in appropriate bilateral and multilateral fora.Ireland does not provide funding to the Zimbabwean government, but supports vulnerable people in Zimbabwe through multilateral and non-governmental organisations.  Thus far in 2009, Ireland has committed funding of over €5 million to a range of humanitarian programmes in Zimbabwe, focused on food security, tackling HIV and AIDS and supporting civil society organisations providing essential services for the population.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	447	I propose to take Questions Nos. 40, 50 and 52 together.As stated on many occasions in this House, most recently on 24 March and 22 April, I remain deeply concerned about the on-going conflict in Sri Lanka and in particular about the grave humanitarian situation there.Thanks to the efforts of the UN Secretary General and the Under Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs, the Government of Sri Lanka announced a two-day ceasefire on 12 April.  While this was less than the full humanitarian pause of several days which the Secretary General had pressed for, it was nevertheless seen as an opportunity to try to relieve the horrendous suffering of the local population trapped in the conflict zone by providing them with some opportunity to evacuate and to access humanitarian assistance.Some civilians succeeded in escaping from the conflict zone during the temporary ceasefire period agreed to by the Sri Lankan Government but not as many as expected.  There were reports that the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) were preventing civilians leaving the area. Since then, however, over the last few days, there are reports that up to 40,000 civilians have succeeded in escaping through breaches in barricades, bringing to over 100,000 the number who have now fled the zone.  Although there are no reliable figures at present for the numbers still trapped in the rapidly-shrinking zone still under the control of the LTTE, it is clear than tens of thousands of civilians are at grave risk as the war moves into what may well be its final, most intensive, phase.  Earlier this week, the LTTE rejected a call on them from the Sri Lankan army to surrender within 24 hours to prevent further bloodshed, so the current indications are that they intend fighting this out until the bitter end.  Army operations have since then intensified and gained significant ground.Together with our partners in the EU, Ireland welcomed the temporary ceasefire but called for it to be extended in order to facilitate humanitarian operations in the affected parts of the country and to ensure the physical safety of all civilians.  I very much regret that this did not happen. I remain gravely concerned about the plight of the many thousands of innocent men, women and children — many of them wounded or ill — still trapped in the war-zone.I welcome the fact, however, that up to 100,000 of those who have fled the zone now have increasing access to humanitarian support and commend the excellent work being undertaken by organisations such as the ICRC, UNHCR, and Médecins Sans Frontières, whose activities Irish Aid have been supporting.  I welcome the recent visit by the UN Secretary's General's Chef de Cabinet, Vijay Nambiar to Colombo last week, and hope that the UN will be able to engage more pro-actively with the Sri Lankan government while this appalling humanitarian tragedy continues and beyond.In this context, I welcome the informal meeting of the Security Council held yesterday at which the Chef de Cabinet gave a briefing on his visit to Sri Lanka.  Following the meeting, the Mexican President of the Council noted that Council members had expressed deep concern at the humanitarian situation, condemned the LTTE for the use of civilians as human shields, and called on them to surrender arms, end violence and enter political dialogue with the Government. He said that Members of the Council also called on all parties to abide by international humanitarian law and to allow humanitarian access.I continue to take the firm view that there can be no military solution to Sri Lanka's political difficulties.  A lasting peace settlement will require serious reconciliation efforts and a negotiated political process aimed at protecting the interests of all the citizens of Sri Lanka and enshrining the principle of parity of esteem among its divided communities.  Ireland would welcome further activity by the international community, in particular by the UN Security Council, to assist in bringing about a swift resolution to the conflict, with minimum loss of life, and in supporting a negotiated peace process and reconciliation.  Should the relevant parties seek our advice in relation to a negotiated peace process, we would give consideration as to how we could best help.I am strongly supportive of all efforts that have been made, and are continuing to be made, to persuade the Sri Lankan government and representatives of the Tamil people to engage in serious efforts to resolve their differences through negotiations rather than warfare and to seek a sustainable peace based on the principle of parity of esteem among the divided communities.  Norway, the United States, the European Union and Japan — the members of the ‘Tokyo Co-Chairs' group supporting the Sri Lankan peace process -, in addition to senior UN officials, have all been engaged in diplomatic activities in relation to the humanitarian situation, with some also focusing on the broader political context. Regrettably, following an attack on the Sri Lankan Embassy in Oslo on 12 April, the Sri Lankan government has indicated that it no longer sees it as feasible for Norway to act as facilitator in its engagement with Sri Lanka.Since 2005 the Government has provided more than €5.3 million for humanitarian and development activities in Sri Lanka.  Over US$12 million was allocated to Sri Lanka in 2008 from the UN's Central Emergency Response Fund, to which Ireland is currently the seventh largest donor.  The International Committee of the Red Cross and the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) — two of the key organisations at the centre of the response to the humanitarian crisis — also receive regular un-earmarked funding from Irish Aid.  In view of the perilous situation in the affected areas, a decision has been taken to offer additional Irish Aid funding of €170,000 to Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) which is treating large numbers of civilians affected by the conflict.  The Government will continue to monitor closely the humanitarian situation in northern Sri Lanka and the possible provision of additional emergency funding is being kept under review.
#PeterPowerFF	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-party	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-dob	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	448	I propose to take Questions Nos. 41 and 67 together.The EU is currently negotiating a series of trade and development Agreements, known as Economic Partnership Agreements, with the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) group of countries.  Historically, ACP countries benefited from unilateral trade preferences with the EU. However, these were deemed to violate World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules, on the basis that they established unfair discrimination between developing countries and placed those countries outside the ACP Group at a disadvantage.  The Cotonou Agreement of 2000 provided for the negotiation of new Agreements with ACP States, which would be acceptable to the WTO.  On this basis, the WTO agreed in 2001 to grant a waiver to the EU to continue unilateral preferences until January 2008.The negotiations for these Agreements are being carried out by the European Commission on behalf of the European Union. Following protracted and difficult negotiations, only one of the regional groupings, representing the 15 countries of the Caribbean region, initialled and signed a full Agreement with the EU before the January 2008 deadline.  This Agreement was signed by Ireland on 16 July 2008.A further 21 ACP countries initialled interim Economic Partnership Agreements with the EU.  The interim Agreements with Ghana, Ivory Coast and Cameroon have been signed by the European Commission and the Member States.  The Agreements were signed by Ireland on 18 December 2008, following Dáil approval. Negotiations between the Commission and the remaining ACP countries are continuing with a view to finalising signature of the interim Agreements during 2009.Throughout this negotiating process Ireland has consistently maintained in discussions within the EU that the objective must be to finalise Agreements which are supportive of ACP countries' development needs and their poverty reduction efforts.  We have been to the fore in ensuring that a partnership approach is maintained between the Commission and its ACP counterparts.Neither New Zealand nor Israel is a party to these negotiations.  I have had no discussions with the Government of New Zealand in relation to Economic Partnership Agreements, although the European Commission has briefed them on the negotiations with a number of countries in the Pacific region.EU relations with Israel, including trade relations, are governed by the EU-Israel Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement which entered into force on 1 June 2000.  The Agreement provides for the progressive development of a free trade area between the EU and Israel. At the most recent meeting of the Association Council to review the operation of the Agreement, in June 2008, the EU agreed in principle to further develop these relations when the current Action Plan under the Agreement became due for renewal in April 2009.The Government has made clear Ireland's view that the question of an upgrade in relations should be revisited in the light of negative developments since then.  It should be noted, however, that the proposed upgrade relates primarily to political contacts under the Association Agreement, and not to trade links.  The Government is opposed to the use of trade embargoes or other boycotts in relation to the Middle East question.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	449	I propose to take Questions Nos. 42, 58, 59, 148 and 149 together.In the wake of the conflict in Gaza and the ceasefires of 18 January, progress is urgently needed on a number of fronts both to relieve the effects of the conflict and to try and ensure it is not repeated.Firstly, it is frankly unacceptable that three months after the conflict we are still not seeing full and unimpeded access for humanitarian and reconstruction relief to Gaza.  There continue to be frustrating and often baffling restrictions in the type and volume of materials Israel will allow into the territory, and large quantities of aid material remain backed up in storage in Israel and elsewhere, which itself is an expensive drain on aid agencies' resources.  Families must be allowed to rebuild their homes, schools and workplaces.  The economic blockade of Gaza and its people which has effectively been in place for almost two years is completely unjustified and should be brought to an end.There remains a strong risk that the separate ceasefires declared in Gaza could break down, leading to a renewal of violence.  I share the concern that the continuing albeit much reduced level of ongoing rocket attacks into Israel, and Israeli military actions in Gaza, could lead to an escalation of retaliation and the resumption of full scale fighting.  Efforts had been under way, conducted by Egypt, to reach a more definite and durable ceasefire between Israel and Hamas which might provide a more stable context for reconstruction and for political progress.  Regrettably, those talks became deadlocked in the last weeks of the previous Israeli Government. I hope that the new Israeli Government will continue, and that Egypt will continue to promote, those efforts.I have spoken before in this House of my view that there must be thorough investigation of possible human rights abuses or contraventions of international law in the course of the recent conflict.  An initial investigation into some incidents targeting UN facilities by a panel appointed by UN Secretary General Ban is due to report to the Secretary General shortly, and he will then decide what further action to take.  A commission appointed by the UN Human Rights Council, including a former Irish Army officer, has also recently been established.  It is important to stress however that the investigation into these events must look at the actions of both sides, not just at those of Israeli forces.  In this regard, we have seen credible reports in recent days by reputable human rights organisations of serious human rights violations committed by Hamas in Gaza, both during and since the recent conflict.Looking further ahead, there are two further imperatives.  Efforts to stabilise the ceasefires in Gaza can be no more than temporary solutions so long as the substantive blockade of the territory is continued. An understanding between Israel and Hamas, involving a ceasefire, prisoner releases and the release of Corporal Shalit, could be helpful in leading to a relaxation of the restrictions on Gaza, as could a Fatah-Hamas agreement on the involvement of the Palestinian Authority on the Gaza side of the crossings.  But I would stress to the Israeli Government that, for as long as economic activity in Gaza is strangled, unemployed youth in a heavily overcrowded area will remain vulnerable to pressure from militant factions.Finally, the urgent necessity of these issues relating to Gaza must not detract from the priority of restoring momentum and credibility to the negotiations for a comprehensive overall settlement, which made some progress last year but have been in limbo now since December.  I have stressed all of these issues in my meetings in recent months with the Israeli authorities, with my EU colleagues and during my visit to the region.  I will be discussing them again with our partners next week at the General Affairs and External Relations Council.Finally, it is only fair to note that an important element in the disappointing progress on these issues since January has been the political changes and uncertainty in Israel.  With a new Government now in place with a substantial majority, I look to the Israeli Government to take clear and constructive positions on these questions.  It is particularly important, in this regard, that the Netanyahu Government give a clear and early indication of its willingness to abide by previous commitments and international agreements entered into by Israel.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	450	To date, twenty-three Member States have ratified the Treaty of Lisbon. Ireland is among the four Member States not to have done so. The others are Germany, Poland and the Czech Republic. Of these, Germany and Poland have both completed their parliamentary procedures.Germany is awaiting the outcome of a legal challenge to the compatibility of the Treaty with its Constitution. The decision of Germany's Constitutional Court is expected next month. If the Court does not find difficulties with the Treaty, the German President will sign the necessary instrument of ratification.In Poland, parliamentary procedures were completed in April 2008, and all that is required is signature by President Lech Kaczynski.In the Czech Republic, the lower House voted in favour of ratification in February. The upper House, the Senate, is expected to debate ratification early next month. Once the Treaty has been approved by both Houses, the signature of President Klaus is required to complete the process.The Treaty cannot enter into force unless and until it is ratified by all Member States. At its meeting in December, the European Council confirmed its wish to see the Treaty of Lisbon enter into force by the end of 2009.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	451	I remain deeply concerned by the situation in Tibet, the ongoing security operations there, the treatment of demonstrators arrested during protests in March 2008 and since, the wider human rights situation and issues relating to the preservation of the religious and cultural identity of Tibetans.This year marks the 60th anniversary of events leading to the departure of the Dalai Lama from Tibet in March 1949. The anniversary has prompted new security operations in the capital Lhasa and in other Tibetan areas.The Government continues to convey its concerns about the situation in Tibet directly to the Chinese authorities in regular contacts with them both in Dublin and Beijing and in the context of regular bilateral discussions on human rights issues.    Ireland also strongly supports, and engages actively in EU action in relation to Tibet, including in the context of the EU-China Human Rights dialogue.While committed to a One China policy which accepts Tibet as part of China, we have long advocated dialogue between the Chinese Government and the Dalai Lama to peacefully resolve the issue of Tibet. We believe this remains the most sustainable way to achieve the protection of Tibetan culture, identity, religion and human rights, and a greater measure of autonomy for Tibet within China. We welcome the Dalai Lama's long-standing endorsement of dialogue as a means to resolve issues relating to Tibet and his clear reiteration on 1 April that Tibetan demands for the protection of their culture, language and spirituality must not involve the use of force or calls for separation from China. I was pleased that the meeting of Tibetans in exile held in Dharmasala in November 2008 endorsed the principles promoted by the Dalai Lama of autonomy rather than all-out independence, and non-violence rather than physical confrontation.I regret that the current pace and substance of the dialogue that has been taking place has been unsatisfactory to date. In our bilateral contacts with the Chinese government, including during Political Consultations with senior Chinese officials in Dublin earlier this week, we have strongly encouraged engagement in an accelerated and upgraded dialogue process with the Dalai Lama and his representatives as very much in the interest, not only of the Tibetan people, but also of China.The Government will continue to monitor carefully the situation in Tibet. It will remain high on our agenda in contacts with China and with the EU and the international community, and we will continue to support efforts to find a sustainable solution, acceptable to both sides.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	452	The most recent General Affairs and External Relations Council (GAERC) took place in Brussels on 16 March 2009.The Council focussed on preparations for the Spring European Council. The agenda also featured the European Economic Recovery Plan (EERP), the Western Balkans, Belarus, Afghanistan, Sudan and EU-US relations.The Council examined proposals for spending €5 billion on energy projects and other infrastructure investments under the European Economic Recovery Plan. This was subsequently agreed at the Spring European Council on 19 and 20 March. Ireland expressed strong support for the European Economic Recovery Plan which includes funding to tune of €110 million for the Ireland-Wales electricity interconnector.The Council also discussed the Eastern Partnership as part of the preparations for the Spring European Council, which adopted a Declaration on the subject. Ireland takes a balanced view of the Union's European Neighbourhood Policy which we value as a means of bringing the countries concerned, whether on the Union's eastern or southern borders, closer to the norms and standards of the Union.The Council also adopted conclusions on EUFOR Tchad/RCA, welcoming the fulfilment of the operation's mandate and underlining the exemplary cooperation between the EU and the UN from the launching of the operation to its successful hand-over.During the External Relations session, the Council discussed Bosnia and Herzegovina, reiterating its full support to the European perspective of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It called upon the local political leaders to engage thoroughly and with greater determination in the necessary reform agenda with a view to advancing the country's European perspective. The Council appointed Ambassador Valentin Inzko as EU Special Representative in Bosnia and Herzegovina and welcomed his appointment as High Representative in BiH.The Council evaluated developments in Belarus and decided to extend its existing restrictive measures for one year and to continue the suspension of visa ban sanctions on certain officials of Belarus. The Council discussed the situation in Afghanistan, adopting conclusions stressing that the challenges facing the country and the broader region require a renewed international engagement, and that the EU will play a major role in this. The humanitarian situation in Sudan was also discussed following the expulsion of NGOs by President Bashir.Over lunch, there was a brief discussion of EU-US Relations in preparation for the Heads of State and Government meeting with President Obama on 5 April.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	453	Ireland established diplomatic relations with Venezuela on 29 November 1980 and is accredited on a non-residential basis through our Ambassador to Mexico. Ambassador Dermot Brangan presented his credentials to the then Venezuelan Vice President, Mr Jose Vicente Rangel, in Caracas on 8 May 2006. On 13 January 2009, Dr. Samuel Moncada, Ambassador of Venezuela in London, who is also accredited to Ireland, presented his credentials to President McAleese   at Áras an Uachtaráin.Ireland's relations with Venezuela are conducted primarily in the multilateral context, in particular through the framework of EU-Latin America and Caribbean relations (EU-LAC), as well as the EU-Rio Group Strategic Dialogues.  The most recent Government level contact in the multilateral context took place at the Fifth EU-Latin America and Caribbean Summit in Lima on 16 May 2008. Ireland was represented at the Summit by Minister of State Peter Power.  Regular meetings at senior official level are held between the EU and representatives of all the Latin American and Caribbean States, most recently in Buenos Aires on 19-20 March 2009.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	454	I attach the highest importance to the work of Ireland's Embassies and Consulates in promoting Ireland as a trading partner and as a location for foreign investment. In the context of the current economic crisis, this work is more important than ever.In order to give greater support to Embassies and Consulates in the promotion of the Irish economy in January 2009 a special unit was established in the Promoting Ireland Abroad Division of my Department.The role of this unit is to improve the flow of information to and from our Embassies and Consulates and to ensure that our Missions are fully equipped to promote Ireland's overseas economic interests in the current difficult conditions. A particular focus has been placed on providing accurate information to economic policy-makers and commentators in major markets and to countering inaccurate negative reporting in the foreign media.The St Patrick's Day period provided a particularly important occasion to promote Ireland and the Irish economy. Overall, the emphasis on economic promotion and business media was the strongest of recent years, and the presence of the Taoiseach and other Government representatives opened doors and provided leadership to the activities of Embassies and Consulates to showcase Ireland.To ensure that the Embassies and Consulates continue to be well equipped in this area, officials of my Department taking up diplomatic postings abroad this year will receive intensive training in economic and trade-related matters. This is a continuation and expansion of the training in this area provided to diplomatic officers on an annual basis.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	455	The Programme for Government includes a commitment to support "a binding and comprehensive global treaty on the trade of arms, covering all weapons and ammunition". In line with this undertaking, I am working hard to bring this about.At the United Nations, Ireland has been actively promoting the proposal for an Arms Trade Treaty to secure agreement on common international standards for the import, export and transfer of conventional arms. In October we co-sponsored a resolution at the General Assembly which led to the establishment of a Working Group to consider the elements that might be included in a legally binding Treaty. The first meeting of the Group took place in New York last month. Officials from my Department played an active role in proceedings, and took the opportunity to explain to other UN Member States both the high priority which Ireland attaches to achieving an Arms Trade Treaty, and the specific elements which we believe it should take account of, including the impact of arms transfers on conflict.The Group is scheduled to meet again in July and we will maintain our engagement. The Group will submit a report to the next session of the General Assembly in the autumn.Ireland is not alone in pushing for a comprehensive global treaty on the arms trade. The EU is preparing to hold a number of regional seminars, in different parts of the world, to highlight the necessity of securing an effective Arms Trade Treaty.      As I explained to the House in questions to me on this issue in February, negotiation of this Treaty is likely to be complex and protracted. I would like to assure the House that we will continue our efforts on this front, in close cooperation with our partners in the EU and in the NGO community, until a Treaty has been agreed.
#PeterPowerFF	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-party	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-dob	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	456	Ireland's aid programme is internationally renowned for its strong focus on the least developed countries in the world, in particular in Africa. The reality for all international donors is that the promotion of sustainable development in some of the poorest countries requires a determined effort to address corruption and weak governance. Corruption affects the lives of the poorest people. Across the aid programme, we are committed to addressing it by improving transparency and accountability, supporting public oversight institutions, promoting parliamentary reform and independent media, and building the capacity of civil society to influence public policy decisions.Uganda is one of nine priority countries for Irish Aid, with a commitment to long term strategic assistance. The Government has followed closely reports on issues of governance and corruption in Uganda and takes account of these issues in the formulation of its aid programme. Through the aid programme, Ireland is supporting a range of specific measures to tackle corruption. We are helping to create robust and independent legal and judicial systems and supporting anti-corruption legislation. We are supporting the reform of public financial management in central and local government, increasing transparency and reducing the opportunities for corruption. We are strengthening the oversight functions of Parliament, the Office of the Auditor General, the Director of Public Prosecutions, and the Uganda Human Rights Commission. Crucially, we are also actively promoting citizen participation in the policy process, through support for civil society organisations and independent media.It is important to acknowledge the steps taken by Uganda to address the issue of corruption. It has established institutions to improve transparency and accountability, including the Auditor General, the Inspector General of Government, and the Public and Local Government Accounts Committees in Parliament. The legal and institutional framework to combat corruption has also been strengthened. Uganda has signed up to international instruments against corruption. In 2004 the Ugandan Government launched a National Strategy to Combat Corruption and rebuild integrity in public office. These measures are delivering results, but it remains essential that, as donors to Uganda, we continue to monitor the situation very closely, through our Embassy in Kampala and in cooperation with our international partners.With the assistance of international donors, including Ireland, Uganda has made very significant progress in recent years in improving the lives of its people. For instance, the prevalence rate of HIV and AIDS has fallen from 18% in 1992 to 6.4%. Poverty levels have been reduced from 56% in 1992 to 31%. The introduction of free secondary education in 2007 resulted in a 17% increase in enrolments. The number of children attending primary school has increased from 2.4 million in 1996 to over 7.5 million in 2008.Irish Aid will continue to ensure that the fight against corruption is prioritised, that the harmful effects of corruption on the poor are mitigated, that Ireland's development assistance has maximum direct impact on the lives of the people of Uganda, and that Irish taxpayers' money is safeguarded.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	457	I visited New York and Washington over the period from 15 to 18 March.On St. Patrick's Day I accompanied the Taoiseach at his meeting with President Obama at the White House, and at other engagements. The meeting offered an invaluable opportunity for a broad exchange of views with the President and his team at the start of the new Administration. The discussions with President Obama covered a wide range of priority issues for Ireland and the United States.As has been widely noted, President Obama was most generous with his time and hospitality during the visit, hosting the traditional Shamrock Ceremony and bilateral meeting at the White House. He also attended the Speaker's Luncheon on Capitol Hill, as did Vice President Biden. In the evening, President and Mrs. Obama hosted an evening reception at the White House which was also attended by Vice-President and Mrs. Biden.On 16 March, I had a very useful meeting with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. We discussed a broad range of foreign policy issues, including the Middle East, Afghanistan, Cuba, developments in the European Union and immigration reform. We also discussed the scope for cooperation on development issues and in the area of conflict resolution.As will be appreciated, the Secretary of State, given her close familiarity with the issue, was particularly interested in having an assessment of the situation in Northern Ireland, including in light of the murders of the two British soldiers and the PSNI officer the preceding week. I assured her of the steadfast determination of both Governments, and of the political parties in Northern Ireland, to ensure that the peace and stability already achieved would not be compromised by the cowardly acts of an unrepresentative few. Both the President and Secretary of State, and our many friends from both sides of the aisle on Capitol Hill, made clear that the United States would remain a stalwart friend of the process. I also had the opportunity in Washington to meet with the First Minister and deputy First Minister when I attended an event hosted by the Northern Ireland Bureau.In New York I participated in the trade mission organised by Enterprise Ireland as part of the St. Patrick's Day programme, and met with a number of companies announcing significant investments in Ireland. I took the opportunity to raise the issues of the immigration reform and the undocumented with Senator Chuck Schumer, Chair of the Senate Subcommittee on Immigration and had a meeting with representatives of the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform (ILIR).

My Department is at present working to advance the key recommendations contained in that Review.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	458	Croatia hopes to conclude its accession negotiations in 2009. The European Commission has produced a road map for their conclusion, but this depends on Croatia making the required progress on the outstanding issues. These include privatising shipyards; judicial reform; organised crime; minority rights; and cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY).To date, Croatia has opened 22 of the 35 chapters of the negotiations, of which 7 have been provisionally closed. A dispute with Slovenia over maritime and land borders has blocked the opening of a further eleven chapters to date. Unfortunately, an Intergovernmental Conference on accession scheduled for 27 March could not proceed as a result of the dispute and has been postponed until 24 April. I hope that the two sides can find a way to resolving the issue so that the accession negotiations are not adversely affected. When the negotiations with Croatia are completed, the Accession Treaty will need to be ratified by all 27 Member States.Given the progress still required on a number of outstanding issues in the accession negotiations and the Government's intention to seek the approval of the Irish people to ratify the Lisbon Treaty subject to specific guarantees, thereby allowing the Treaty to enter into force by the end of 2009, I would hope that Croatia's accession will not be delayed by considerations related to ratification of the Lisbon Treaty.
#PeterPowerFF	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-party	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-dob	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	459	The report of the Hunger Task Force, which was published in September 2008, recommended that Ireland can contribute to tackling the root causes of hunger by increasing the productivity of smallholder farmers in Africa, by implementing programmes on maternal and infant under-nutrition and by ensuring that there is committed political action at national and international levels to give world hunger the priority it deserves.I have welcomed this focused approach by the Task Force on these three thematic areas and have also announced that the eradication of hunger will become a key component of the Irish Aid programme.With the aim of moving the recommendations of the Hunger Task Force forward, I have established a special Hunger Unit in my Department to coordinate the implementation of the Hunger Task Force recommendations across Irish Aid's programmes and policy areas. I have also established a managerial task team to bring together the full range of expertise available within the Development Co-operation Directorate (Irish Aid) in the area of food security and related disciplines and also including representatives from other Departments, including the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, to oversee the implementation of the recommendations.A Special Envoy for Hunger, Mr. Kevin Farrell, has been appointed. He will assess the national and international response to the global food security crisis. We will use his enormous experience with the World Food Programme to support our hunger reduction interventions.I am keen to see the development of a new international partnership that puts hunger at the top of the political and development agenda. Ireland is actively working with the UN Secretary General's High Level Task Force on the Global Food Security Crisis. We were the first country to provide funding to this key UN Task Force.Irish Aid is currently supporting, and will continue to support, a whole range of hunger related interventions in our priority countries in Africa. We are supporting smallholder agriculture — most notably in Tanzania, Malawi, and Mozambique and in our new programme in Sierra Leone. We are supporting agricultural research and crop and livestock improvement. We are providing safety net programmes — to catch those vulnerable communities before they fall into destitution and hunger through food-for-work or money-for-work programmes. We are supporting ground-breaking initiatives on nutrition such as Concern's Community Based Therapeutic Feeding initiative. In our most recently established programme country, Malawi, Irish Aid is currently supporting, and will continue to support, a whole range of hunger related interventions in our priority countries in Africa. We are supporting smallholder agriculture — most notably in Tanzania, Malawi, and Mozambique and in our new programme in Sierra Leone. We are supporting agricultural research and crop and livestock improvement. We are providing safety net programmes — to catch those vulnerable communities before they fall into destitution and hunger through food-for-work or money-for-work programmes. We are supporting ground-breaking initiatives on nutrition such as Concern's Community Based Therapeutic Feeding initiative. In our most recently established programme country, Malawi, we are developing a new programme that is fundamentally influenced by the recommendations of the Hunger Task Force.   We are working towards spending up to 20 per cent of our aid programme on hunger and hunger related projects and programmes as recommended by the Hunger Task Force. I expect that we will reach this target by the end of 2010 and additional funding is being provided for hunger related programmes.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	460	As the Deputy will be aware, on 22 January, President Obama issued an Executive Order announcing that the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay should close within one year, which I warmly welcomed at the time.  The US has sought the support and assistance of EU partners in bringing about its closure. Work is proceeding at the EU level for a co-ordinated approach on the issue.  The Presidency and the Commission visited Washington in mid-March for discussion with the US Administration regarding the practical and legal issues which have to be addressed in such cases.  These discussions are ongoing.  EU Ministers for Justice and Home Affairs have considered the issue at JHA Councils on 26th February and 6th April 2009.While the question of whether Member States might accept former detainees remains a national decision, the Member States are agreed that the EU-level discussions with the United States Administration on this matter should take their course.I had a useful discussion with Secretary of State Clinton on the issue when we met over the St Patrick's Day period. At that meeting I reiterated that we had long called for the closure of the facility at Guantanamo Bay, and that we would wish to be helpful in facilitating its closure.  This position was confirmed by the Taoiseach in a television interview shortly afterwards when he argued that it is incumbent on those who called for the closure of the Guantanamo detention centre to assist the United States in ensuring that certain prisoners be relocated elsewhere and expressed Ireland's readiness to take a small, proportionate number of detainees.

The Observation Mission indicated that the ‘electoral process was transparent and there were no relevant irregularities, enabling an outcome which reflects the will of the Salvadorian people'.I welcome the affirmation of the democratic process in El Salvador, reflected in the manner in which these elections were held, as well as in the smooth transition of power that has followed.  I also welcome the early outreach shown by President-elect Funes towards the social partners in El Salvador as well as his commitment to maintain and develop El Salvador's relations with its neighbours.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	462	The commitment to develop a joint parliamentary forum, which would bring together members from the Oireachtas and the Northern Ireland Assembly, is contained in both the Good Friday and St Andrews Agreements.In July 2007, at the first meeting of the North South Ministerial Council following restoration of the Institutions, the Council "recognised that any development of a joint parliamentary forum is a matter for the Northern Ireland Assembly and the Oireachtas".  At that time provision was also made for officials from the two administrations to make contact with the Oireachtas and Assembly and to report back to the NSMC at the earliest opportunity on the prospects for the development of such a forum.I have therefore had discussions on this matter with members of the Northern Ireland Executive within the framework of the NSMC, bearing in mind the primacy of the Oireachtas on this issue.  I can advise the House that at the last NSMC Plenary in January, the Council "noted the ongoing discussions between the Houses of the Oireachtas and the Northern Ireland Assembly on the North South Parliamentary Forum and noted the agreement to establish two working groups to develop proposals for such a body".I have not had discussions with the British Government on this issue.It should be emphasised that, as work continues toward the setting-up of a North South parliamentary forum, contacts between members of the Oireachtas and Assembly also continue in other fora.  I am aware, for example, that several Oireachtas Committees have had useful exchanges with their Assembly counterparts.  In addition, the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and the British Irish Parliamentary Assembly also provide valuable opportunities for parliamentarians North and South to engage on issues of mutual interest.
#PeterPowerFF	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-party	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-dob	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	463	The overarching goal of the Government's aid programme, administered by Irish Aid, is the reduction and eventual eradication of global poverty and hunger.  Our partnership with development Non-governmental Organisations (NGOs) and missionaries represents a very important element of this effort, reflecting the broad support among Irish people for the development programme. The Irish aid programme is one of the strongest supporters of the non-governmental sector internationally.Irish Aid engages with development NGOs through the innovative Multi-Annual Programme Scheme, the Civil Society Fund and a number of Emergency funding schemes.  It provides significant additional funding to NGOs under the development programmes in the nine priority countries for Irish Aid, where we have a commitment to long term strategic assistance.  Irish Aid also cooperates closely with Misean Cara, representing the range of Irish missionaries working with the poor in the developing world.Last year, the total funding provided by the Government, through Irish Aid, to development NGOs and missionaries amounted to just over €200 million.  In 2007, we provided over €180 million.  This funding supported the work of NGOs in livelihood and food security, rural economic development, health, education, gender equality and the fight against HIV and AIDS.  In total, Irish Aid supported over 280 NGOs and missionary organisations last year.  Irish Aid also provides multi-annual funding to organisations in the development education sector in Ireland, through the Development Education Grants Funding Scheme.Following the supplementary Budget on 7 April, the total allocation for overseas development assistance in 2009 will be €696 million.  We are at present examining the adjustments which will be required to the aid programme, and are committed to ensuring that it retains its clear focus on the reduction of poverty and hunger and on the least developed countries in the world, in particular in Africa.  Inevitably, there will be some reduction in the funding provided to civil society organisations across the different subheads.  However, the Government is determined to strengthen its partnership with civil society.  That partnership goes beyond funding arrangements, and involves continuous policy dialogue across a range of vital issues.  We will continue to develop the dialogue so that we can achieve our shared goals for development and ensure that the overall Irish contribution has the maximum effect on the lives of the poorest people in the world.
#PeterPowerFF	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-party	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-dob	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	464	Through the aid programme, administered by Irish Aid, the Government is supporting over 1,300 long term development workers, volunteers and missionaries in the developing world.  Their contribution is an important, and valued, element in the overall Irish contribution to the reduction and eventual eradication of global poverty and hunger.The Government has directly supported the work of volunteers in development since the official aid programme was established over thirty years ago, initially through the Agency for Personal Service Overseas, and since 2003, directly through Irish Aid.  In 2007, specific funding from Irish Aid to volunteer-sending agencies amounted to €8.7 million.  Last year, the total level of such funding amounted to €10.4 million.  Many of the Non-governmental Organisations which receive funding from Irish Aid also devote a proportion of this support to the participation of voluntary workers in their programmes.Following the supplementary Budget on 7 April, the total allocation overseas development assistance in 2009 will be €696 million.  We are at present examining the specific adjustments which will be required across the programme, including to the different subheads under which Irish Aid provides support to voluntary workers.  The Government is determined to maintain the programme's clear focus on the reduction of poverty and hunger, and on the least developed countries especially in sub Saharan Africa.I can assure the Deputy that the Government will continue to provide substantial support to the volunteering sector.  I strongly welcome the great interest among Irish people in pursuing volunteering opportunities in developing countries.  The Irish Aid Volunteering and Information Centre was established in 2008 to promote responsible volunteering and to facilitate and harness this public interest in a constructive and positive manner.  I was very pleased that over 400 people attended last week's Volunteering Fair organised by Irish Aid in the Centre.  This level of interest reflects the high level of public support for development and for the commitment to fighting global poverty.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	465	According to reports available to me, Sulim Yamadayev was killed by a group of men in a parking lot outside his apartment in Dubai on 28 March 2009.  I understand that Mr Yamadayev was for several years a military commander in Chechnya and served under Russian federal command, before being relieved of his duties late last year.On April 5, the Dubai police identified Adam Delimkhanov, a Chechen member of the Russian State Duma, as one of the suspects in his murder.  They have indicated that two men are being held in connection with the attack, and that international warrants will be issued for four others, including Mr Delimkhanov, who has denied any complicity in the murder.  The Foreign Minister of the Russian Federation, Sergei Lavrov, stated on 10 April that an official report is awaited from the Dubai authorities.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	466	Our ongoing dialogue with our fellow EU members, including those that joined in 2004, is conducted at a number of levels.  I have regular bilateral discussions with my EU Ministerial counterparts as do my colleagues in government. Our Embassies in EU capitals undertake intensive contacts with their host administrations in support of Irish interests and report on relevant developments in those countries.  Ireland's Permanent Representation to the European Union also plays a central role in Ireland's engagement with our EU partners.  There is also intensive contact between the Member States within the institutions of the Union, especially the Council of Ministers where the Member States work together to arrive at decisions that serve the shared interests of our peoples.As a result of this intensive engagement within the Union, the Government is fully aware of the serious economic challenges currently facing the Member States, including those that joined during Ireland's EU Presidency in 2004. EU membership has taken on a heightened significance for all Member States in the current climate.  It has been a great asset for the Member States to be able to combine their efforts in developing a collective strategy for coping with this unprecedented global economic and financial crisis.From the start of the crisis in September last, the EU has been actively engaged in efforts to mitigate its effects.  In December 2008, the European Council agreed an EU-wide stimulus package valued at €200 billion.  This included funding of €5 billion mainly for energy and broadband projects, including an allocation of €110 million for the Ireland-Wales electricity interconnector.The Spring European Council on 19-20 March 2009 renewed the commitment of Member States to work in a coordinated manner to restore financial stability and growth within the European economy.  It noted that the European Economic Recovery Plan now has a fiscal volume of around €400 billion and that this would be a major instrument in stimulating investment, boosting demand and promoting employment to the benefit of all Member States.The Spring Council also welcomed a proposal from the EU Commission to double the ceiling, to a level of €50 billion, for the Union's support facility for Member States which need balance of payments assistance.  This measure is designed to provide support for Member States that joined the Union in 2004, some of which are facing particular economic difficulties on account of the current global crisis.

More than half of this total was provided to the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), which is responsible for the delivery of humanitarian aid and basic services to Palestinian refugees who account for 40% of the total population of the Palestinian Territories.  Support was also provided, inter alia, for payment of public service salaries to employees of the Palestinian Authority through a mechanism administered by the European Commission; for a rural development programme run by the UN; and to a range of civil society organisations for human rights and democratisation initiatives.In 2008, Irish Aid funding to the Palestinian people increased to over €8.6 million.  While UNRWA remained a major partner, a significant level of funding was also provided to the Palestinian Authority, through a European Commission administered mechanism, to support payment of public service salaries and to buy urgently-needed fuel for Gaza's power plant.During the first four months of 2009, more than €6.2 million in assistance for the Palestinian people has already been disbursed or allocated.  This includes €3.8 million in core funding to UNRWA, as well as an emergency contribution of €1 million to support the agency's response to the crisis in Gaza.  A further €500,000 was provided for emergency response projects in Gaza through a Humanitarian Response Fund managed by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).  Meanwhile, over €800,000 in Irish Aid funding allocated to non-governmental Organisation (NGO) partners during 2009 has been designated for programmes in the Palestinian Territories.Further funding allocations to the Palestinian people for 2009 will be determined as the year progresses and will be informed, inter alia, by an Irish Aid programming visit scheduled for later this year.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	468	Developments in Madagascar over the past number of months are a matter of concern.  The deposition by force on 17 March of Marc Ravalomanana, the democratically-elected President was clearly unconstitutional, and the regime led by opposition leader Andry Rajoelina lacks democratic legitimacy.  The suspension of parliament by the self-proclaimed transitional administration on 20 March is a worrying sign which seems to confirm a lack of respect for democracy and for the constitutional order.  Tragically, more than 100 people have lost their lives in the political upheavals in Madagascar since January.The international community has been paying close attention to the situation in Madagascar since the crisis there first developed.  A process of mediation between the government and opposition, supported by the United Nations, African Union (AU) and Southern African Development Community (SADC), broke down at the end of February.  The AU has called for a rapid return to the constitutional order through an inclusive process involving all political stakeholders in Madagascar.The European Union, for its part, has urged the parties in Madagascar to comply fully with the provisions of the constitution, and to overcome their differences through dialogue and in accordance with the law.  We have also stated clearly our condemnation of all attempts to seize power through undemocratic means.  The unconstitutional change of power is likely to have implications for the delivery of EU aid to Madagascar.  EU Ambassadors in Antanarivo are following the situation closely, and will clarify the EU's position and our expectations in dialogue with Madagascar.The people of Madagascar, who are among the poorest in the world, have suffered greatly from the climate of fear and uncertainty generated by this crisis, as well as from disruptions in basic social services.  Madagascar urgently needs a stable and democratic government which can fulfil its people's need for peace, security and economic development.  I particularly welcome the active engagement of the African Union in this crisis, and the clear condemnation by the AU of unconstitutional transfers of power.

The company have announced that there will be 130 redundancies.  I understand that the redundancies will take place between June and December this year with 15-20 jobs to be lost by June.  In many cases, such company announcements are as a result of global conditions and/or global decisions, over which we have little influence.  In this case the proposed redundancies are in the Manufacturing and Test operations which are being transferred to Asia.  Xilinx has said that it has based its decision on cost competitiveness.The remaining 220 positions are to remain in Dublin.  These jobs are in R&D, Engineering, IT and other corporate and customer facing activities.  I understand that the job outputs in these cases are of significant higher value and are seen by Xilinx's management as a base for future growth.  The company has confirmed that Ireland will remain its European HQ and that there is a corporate commitment to all other activities.Xilinx will be entering into a full consultative process with its employees where details of redundancy and options for employees will be outlined.  The State development agencies under the aegis of my Department have adopted a co-ordinated approach in response to the announced job losses, which includes relevant interventions from all of the agencies, including FÁS which will offer its full range of services to workers being made redundant.IDA is conscious of the implications of job losses in the economy as a whole and in this respect the Agency's main focus is on securing investment from new and existing clients in the areas of High End Manufacturing, Global Services (including Financial Services) and Research, Development and Innovation. Within these areas the key sectors IDA focuses on are Life Sciences (Pharmaceutical, Biopharmaceutical and Medical Technologies), Information Communications Technology (ICT), Engineering, Professional Services, Digital Media, Consumer Brands and International Services.  New opportunities are emerging in areas such as Clean Technology, Convergence and Services Innovation.

My Department does not operate such accounts.However, in the interest of transparency, I wish to advise the Deputy that my Department facilitates the issue of charge cards to staff who travel abroad on official business on a regular basis.  This arrangement is intended to obviate the need for staff members to use their personal credit cards to cover costs such as hotel accommodation and other official expenses necessarily incurred in the course of their official business.  Staff who are issued with charge cards under this arrangement hold individual accounts with the issuing credit card company.  Each card holder is responsible for paying any balances due on his/her account directly to the credit card company.Staff are entitled to reclaim travel, subsistence and other official expenses incurred in connection with their official duties from my Department strictly in accordance with Department of Finance regulations and applicable rates.  Reimbursements of this nature are paid directly to the officers concerned who may use the refunds to settle their charge/credit card accounts.  At present, 42 staff of my Department hold charge cards under the arrangement outlined above.  Some other staff choose to use their personal credit cards for business related transactions.  My Department pays Government Stamp Duty on charge/credit cards used for official transactions.  The total cost of Stamp Duty paid on these cards from 2004 to date is set out on the following table:YearAmount€20044,761.7420056,697.7420064,700.0020073,976.8220081,944.502009 to date30.00

Subject to certain eligibility criteria new and developing enterprises may qualify for financial support from the CEBs in the form of feasibility, employment and capital grants (details supplied below).  In addition, the CEBs deliver a range of non-financial supports to improve management capability development within micro-enterprises designed to help new and existing enterprises to operate effectively and efficiently so as to last and grow. All of the CEBs operate to the same criteria in relation to the assistance which they can offer i.e. they can support the establishment and/or the development of enterprises provided that the projects have the capacity to achieve commercial viability and which over time may develop into strong exporting entities.However, I would stress that priority is given to projects in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sectors.  It is considered inappropriate to support other areas such as retail enterprises, personal services (e.g. hairdressers, gardeners, etc), professional services (accountants, solicitors, etc), construction, as it is considered that these enterprises generally give rise to unacceptable deadweight (where projects would have proceeded anyway) and/or displacement (where the projects simply displace business from other players in the market) concerns.Anyone with a business idea would be best advised to contact their local CEB to discuss the matter further. Contact details for individual CEBs can be found by accessing the following website: www.enterpriseboards.ie.

All Reports since 1994 were duly laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and the information sought by the Deputy is also contained in the respective Annual Companies Reports, which were also laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.The ISE was obliged to furnish a report to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment under the European Communities (Stock Exchange) Regulations 1984 (S.I.

No. 67 of 1997) and doubt arose as to the extent and scope of the exemption which these sections provided. In particular, the exemptions in the 1997 Regulations were only available to a particular type of subsidiary company — a directly controlled subsidiary constituted as a limited liability company — and did not specifically disapply sections 32 and 60 of the Companies Act, 1963. Separately, section 224 of the Companies Act, 1990 imposed conditions regarding prior approval of an acquisition and post notification to the Companies Registration Office and the Stock Exchange, which made the provision unworkable for professional dealers in securities dealing in the shares of their listed holding companies.The uncertainties that arose were essentially a feature of the interplay between the national law on this area and developments at EU Directive level.Section 111 of what became the Company Law Enforcement Act 2001 was drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel in conjunction with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. As the section was introduced at Report Stage my Department's records indicate that a briefing note was not prepared for circulation to Deputies.

However, because of the small prospective yield at the time, the capacity of such a regime to discourage artists visiting Ireland and the administrative burden associated with collecting a relatively small yield, it was decided not to proceed.  I have asked that the matter be reviewed given developments since the last review.I understand that while many countries have arrangements for the taxation of foreign artists it is not universal.  For example I am informed that Denmark and the Netherlands do not have such arrangements.

Therefore, the annual rates come into play to ensure they pay their fair share.The position is that before the budget, some firms were being advised to bring forward salaries and other payments simply to avoid the impact of increases in income tax levies.  The composite rate contained in the financial resolution prevents these manipulations and ensures fairness in the system.

Head to head transfers have been in place and continue to be available for locations that are not part of the current decentralisation programme.  In addition, in Budget 2009 I announced the Government's commitment to the allocation and redeployment of staff in the Civil Service to areas of highest priority.  I have already made additional staff available to the Department of Social and Family Affairs to meet the needs of the growing numbers on the Live Register and I will use the same approach to redeploy staff to other priority areas in the future.  I will ensure that the redeployment of staff will take place with due consideration to geographical constraints and in a consistent and fair manner.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	494	I propose to take Questions Nos. 108 and 109 together.Following enactment of the Health Act 2008, the Health Service Executive (HSE) wrote to all medical card holders aged 70 years and over in January 2009.  Persons who were in receipt of a medical card on a non means tested basis were requested, if over the income limits set out in the Act, to make a declaration to the Executive, on or before the 2nd March 2009.To-date, 19,954 medical cards for persons aged 70 and over have been returned or removed from the medical card register.  10,690 of these cards were returned to the HSE by persons aged 70 or over whose weekly income was in excess of the specified thresholds and a further 9,264 medical cards were removed from the medical card register as part of a data quality exercise, where for example, the HSE had been advised that the card holder is deceased or the card holder was not known at the address, etc.  The vast majority of people in the over 70's age group (343,499 — as at 1st March 2009) retained their medical cards.Doctors have been advised by the HSE regarding clients that have been notified to the Primary Care Reimbursement Service (PCRS) as deceased, gone away or where duplicates exist. In circumstances where a card holder has been removed from the medical card register and they are still entitled to a medical card, the person or their GP should advise the HSE immediately and as soon as the details are confirmed, the client's medical card eligibility will be restored.  The HSE has received contact from a number of doctors and individuals in this regard and these cases are being worked through.The introduction of the new over 70s medical card scheme has resulted in a high number of telephone calls and enquiries to the PCRS.  The Executive reports that while there can be delays experienced at certain times of the day, over 94% of callers speak to a customer service representative on the day that they call. The new central office has dealt with in excess of 80,000 telephone enquiries in the first quarter of 2009, and has processed in excess of 7,000 new medical card applications.The Executive reports that Local Health Offices continue to deal with queries of a general nature about the medical card scheme and will provide any assistance needed with the application process, and along with the National Helpline (1850 24 1850), will deal with enquiries from clients in respect of their medical card entitlements and completion of application forms. The HSE has not instructed its Local Health Offices to refuse assistance in relation to medical card queries.

The change is being implemented on a phased basis and is designed to deliver a better and more cost effective service.Under the new arrangements, the HSE will be aiming for a turnaround time of 15 days or less for all medical card applications. Emergency applications will be dealt with immediately with a card issuing within 24 hours. There will be no affect on the assessment of people whose income exceeds the income guidelines but have a case to be considered on medical or hardship grounds.Local Health Offices will continue to provide advice and necessary supports to people applying for medical cards. They will also deal with queries of a general nature about the medical card scheme and, along with the HSE National Helpline (1850 24 1850), will handle enquiries from clients in respect of their medical card entitlements.The new arrangements will also deliver significant efficiencies by making greater use of shared services for both internal administration and direct service delivery.This is a good example of the type of innovation signalled in the Transforming Public Services Programme announced by the Taoiseach last November. It demonstrates how the HSE can deliver improved services within the more limited resources available in a way which meets the needs of citizens in a modern society.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	501	Under the Health Act 2008, automatic entitlement to a medical card for persons aged 70 or over ceased on 31st December 2008, and with effect from 1st January 2009, the income thresholds for entitlement to a medical card for those aged 70 or over is €700 (gross) per week (€36,500 per year) for a single person and €1,400 (gross) per week (€73,000 per year) for a couple.Any savings and similar investments up to €36,000 (single)/€72,000 (couple) will be disregarded when assessing means and only interest from savings or similar investments above these figures will be considered as income.  The relevant portion of savings and similar investments will be assessed on the income calculated at a notional interest rate (currently 5%), based on the prevailing interest rates at the time of application.  The Health Service Executive's (HSE) Central Application Unit will review the notional rate on a quarterly basis.Alternatively, where an applicant wishes to have the actual interest from savings/investments considered, then the HSE will apply this approach and use the most beneficial option in favour of the applicant, subject to submission of the appropriate certificates from the relevant institutions.  In the case of "longer term" investment accounts, where the interest is only applied at the end of a fixed period, if the applicant so wishes, the HSE will only take account of the interest earned on the date the investment matures. Any calculation of interest is inclusive of Deposit Interest Retention Tax.

The credit limit on the card issued to me as Minister is €50,000 and that of the card issued to my Private Secretary is €10,000.   The two remaining cards are charge cards with no specified limit and are issued to a nominated officer in my Department's Finance Unit and the Registrar of the Adoption Board.  These cards are used to cover a range of costs such as publications, seminar and conference fees, annual membership fees, transport costs and software purchases where payment by credit card is required.  In the period 2004 to 2007, cards were issued to a number of other nominated persons, including the Ombudsman for Children, the Chairman of the Post Mortem Inquiry, the Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction and the National Children's Office.  The total paid between 2004 and to date in 2009 on all cards amounts to €115,543.  During this period the annual amount charged on a single card exceeded €5,000 three times in respect of the cards issued to both the Finance Unit and the Registrar of the Adoption Board and once in respect of the card issued to the National Children's Office.  In each case the grade of the nominated officer is Assistant Principal.

However, these are temporary and  thousands of test appointments have successfully been made in the last few days, including for cars which were due to be tested in 2007 and 2008.In all cases, penalty points are applied to existing offences, and with the aim of improving road safety through driver behaviour, and in the case of the most recent penalty point offences, improving vehicle standards.  For example, the use of a vehicle without a test certificate (where applicable) is already an offence which on conviction carries a fine of up to €2,000 or imprisonment for up to 3 months or both.The number of test appointments made by cars due for testing in 2007 and 2008 underlines both the road safety message and the effectiveness of the penalty point system.

The line is currently under construction.Passengers from Saggart wishing to travel to Tallaght and vice versa will change trams at Belgard and the Belgard Luas stop will be upgraded to facilitate this interchange.I am informed by the RPA that there has been no change in the planned service pattern to and from Tallaght and Saggart since the grant of the Railway Order.  Contrary to the newspaper article referred to by the Deputy, and as stated in the EIS, the initial peak services pattern envisages five services per hour departing Saggart directly for the city centre and a further five services per hour operating as a shuttle service to Belgard Stop.  This represents a service frequency of 6 minutes between trams and is considered more than sufficient to meet demand.Construction of the new Luas line to Citywest and Saggart is expected to be completed by the end of next year with services operating on the line in early 2011.

However, six senior members of staff are supplied with credit cards of the type where outstanding balances are paid directly by the Department to enable them to procure some goods and services as part of their official responsibilities. The expenditure limit of these cards is approximately €8,000.Accurate information on detailed expenditure on these cards, prior to February 2008 is not readily available, but since then to March 2009, the total amount charged to them was €48,800, giving an average charge of approximately €8,000 on each card.As the deputy will no doubt be aware, credit cards of this nature are no more than a tool which facilitates the efficient discharge of business; in many cases it is not possible to procure goods and services without a credit card where for example suppliers insist on advance payment.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	524	I visited New York and Washington from 15 to 18 March.On St. Patrick's Day, I accompanied the Taoiseach at his meeting with President Obama, and at other engagements. The discussions with the President covered a wide range of priority issues for Ireland and the United States.President Obama was most generous with his time and hospitality during the visit, hosting the traditional Shamrock Ceremony and bilateral meeting at the White House. He also attended the Speaker's Luncheon on Capitol Hill, as did Vice President Biden. The President and Mrs. Obama later hosted an evening reception at the White House which was also attended by Vice-President and Mrs. Biden.In Washington, I had a very useful meeting with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. We discussed a broad range of foreign policy issues, including the Middle East, Afghanistan, Cuba, developments in the European Union and immigration reform. We also discussed the scope for cooperation on development issues and in the area of conflict resolution.In relation to Northern Ireland, I took the opportunity to assure Secretary Clinton of the steadfast determination of both Governments, and of the political parties in Northern Ireland, to consolidate the progress already made, and to ensure that the peace and stability achieved would not be compromised by the cowardly acts of an unrepresentative few. I also met with the First Minister and deputy First Minister when I attended an event hosted by the Northern Ireland Bureau in Washington.In New York, I participated in a trade mission organised by Enterprise Ireland and met with a number of companies announcing significant investments in Ireland. I also raised the issues of the immigration reform and the undocumented with Senator Chuck Schumer, Chair of the Senate Subcommittee on Immigration and met with representatives of the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform (ILIR).While in Washington, I called on Congresswoman Zoë Lofgren, Chair of the House Subcommittee on Immigration.Also in Washington, I joined the Taoiseach in meetings with Senators Dodd and Leahy, and with Congressman Richie Neal and other members of the Friends of Ireland group.While in New York, I participated in the launch, by the Taoiseach, of the Ireland-US Strategic Review. My Department is currently working to advance the key recommendations contained in that Review.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	525	I strongly condemn the recent launch of an experimental communications satellite conducted by North Korea in breach of UN Security Council Resolution 1718. This was a provocative act, undertaken in defiance of warnings from the international community, including those made by our then Ambassador to North Korea during a visit to the country in February.I am also deeply concerned by the subsequent decision of North Korea to expel International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors from the country and recommence activity at its nuclear facilities. These actions place additional strains on regional stability at a time when the unresolved nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula requires mutual confidence building. Such actions are also a matter of more general concern due to their global proliferation implications.I urge North Korea to comply with the UNSC Resolution 1718 and to immediately suspend all activities related to its ballistic missile programme as well as abandon all nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programmes in a complete, verifiable and irreversible manner. I also fully endorse the call on the North Korean government made by the EU to reverse its decision to expel IAEA inspectors as well as the decision to restore the nuclear facilities which have been disabled, to maintain its cooperation with the IAEA, to allow an early resumption of the Six-Party Talks, as demanded by the UN Security Council's Presidential Statement, and to take such steps as will facilitate lasting stability and denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula.Apart from the issue of its nuclear armaments programme, many other issues in relation to North Korea remain of concern. While the North Korean regime continues to invest precious resources in its nuclear and military programmes, the country is suffering chronic food insecurity and high malnutrition rates, and remains reliant on external food assistance to meet the needs of its population. Equally, the human rights situation is deeply troubling, reflective of one of the most repressive regimes in the world. Other issues of concern include the regime's complicity in trans-national crime, such as trafficking in people, especially women.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	526	The Department of Foreign Affairs operates a limited system for the use of corporate credit cards for official expenditure. There are currently 10 official credit cards issued by the Department in Ireland. A list of office holders issued with these official credit cards; details of credit cards which are no longer in use and the credit limits on the cards are set out in the following table.The Department issues official credit cards to Ministers, Ministers of State and a limited number of senior officers who, because of the nature of their work, need to make official payments on credit. Credit cards are used to make flight and hotel bookings, for representational purposes and for making sundry payments, at short notice, where cash may not be acceptable or where the cost involved would otherwise be too great to be met from an officer's own resources. The issue of a credit card to the Department's librarian is to facilitate the purchase on-line of books and information materials relevant to the work of the Department.In regard to the credit limits for each card, the credit limits which apply to the Visa credit cards are detailed in the table. However the arrangement with the American Express credit cards are that no set limit applies but that the account must be settled in full every month. I understand that this is normal practise for American Express cards.While it has not been possible in the time available to provide details of credit cards held by Irish Embassies or Consulates abroad, all items of expenditure incurred by Irish Missions, whether paid by credit card or other modes of payment, are subject to the same financial controls which operate at Headquarters.Current Credit Limit200420052006200720082009 (to date)VOTE 28 (Foreign Affairs)€€€€€€Minister for Foreign Affairs832287

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	527	My Department is fully committed to promoting and supporting the employment of people with disabilities, as set out in Part 5 of the Disability Act (2005). The Disability Act also obliges public service bodies to meet a target of 3% of their staff being employees with disabilities. My Department has met, and exceeded, this 3% target.Given the current restrictions on the recruitment of staff to the public sector, the scope for providing further employment opportunities is clearly limited. However, my Department continues its efforts to employ and accommodate people with disabilities in other ways. For example, it has participated in the Willing, Able and Mentoring (WAM) programme each year since 2006. The purpose of this programme is to provide work placement opportunities for graduates with disabilities in the Civil Service.My Department also participated this week in the Job Shadow Initiative, a special work experience scheme administered by the Irish Association of Supported Employment, which enables people with disabilities to shadow a workplace mentor for a day.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	528	I propose to take Questions Nos. 146 and 147 together.At the outset, I would like to take this opportunity to express again my deepest sympathy to the family of the Irish citizen who lost his life in such tragic circumstances in Bolivia.My Department are in ongoing contact with the family and have liaised with them on securing the release and repatriation of his remains. I understand that his remains are due to return to Ireland later this week.As the Deputy will be aware, after hearing of this person's death, I immediately instructed the Irish Embassy in Argentina, which is also accredited to Bolivia, to send a diplomatic officer there to represent the Government and also to look after the concerns of the family. He initially travelled to Santa Cruz, where the death of the Irish citizen occurred, and then to the Bolivian capital, La Paz.While in Santa Cruz, the Irish Embassy representative had extensive contact with local officials, who were helpful and cooperative. As a result, it was possible to secure the timely release of the remains and for arrangements to be put in place for the body to be repatriated to Ireland for burial.The Embassy representative also had meetings with the Bolivian Vice President, the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Vice Minister of the Interior, the Investigating Attorney in charge of the case, and the Investigating Officer from the Anti-Crime Special Force (FELCE), who is in charge of the police investigation. He expressed the Government's concern at reports on the circumstances surrounding the death and enquired from the Bolivian authorities as to the steps they were taking to discover the facts of the case.Conflicting reports have emerged from Bolivia as to whether the authorities would welcome foreign participation in the investigation of the incident. I have made clear that the Irish Government is ready to assist with and cooperate in any enquiries.I spoke to Acting Foreign Minister Quintana by telephone last night and emphasised that our interest in this case relates entirely to protecting the consular rights of our citizens abroad. The Irish Government has a duty to seek the facts in a case where one of our citizens was killed in a violent incident by the security forces in another country.I made clear that the Irish Government had no involvement in or sympathy with any attempt to destabilise Bolivia or in any attempt to attack the democratically elected President of a friendly State.Mr Quintana indicted that the Bolivian Government will provide the Irish authorities with all reports on the events in Santa Cruz and will cooperate fully in establishing the truth. I will be writing to Minister Quintana to reiterate our consular interest in the case and to welcome his commitment to working with the Irish Government to establish the full facts of the case.I can assure the Deputy that this Department through our Embassy in Buenos Aires and the Consular Section will remain in direct contact with the family of the person referred to by him and will provide all possible consular assistance to them.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	529	Tackling human rights abuses, genocide, ethnic cleansing and terrorism in Africa are among the most important tasks facing the international community in the 21st century.  These problems have many causes and manifestations, but poverty, inequality and lack of opportunity have all played a significant role.  The risk of such abuses is greatest where political, economic and administrative systems are weak.  Ireland is committed to addressing these underlying problems. In our dialogue with partners in the EU and the UN, Ireland is a strong advocate for the developing world and for international peace, human rights and tolerance.  Africa is, of course, at the heart of Ireland's programme of official development assistance.Ireland has played a committed and active part in the EU's efforts to address these problems on the continent of Africa.  The EU is the largest donor of development aid in the world, and its development approach to Africa works to address the root causes of instability.  The EU's regular political dialogue with African states provides a forum for human rights issues to be raised where necessary.  The EU-Africa Strategy, agreed at the Lisbon Summit in 2007, has as fundamental objectives the promotion of peace, security and human rights on the continent of Africa, and the development of strong international responses to concerns such as human rights abuses and terrorism.  It commits the EU and African states to ensure that the most serious crimes, including genocide, do not go unpunished.  The EU is also a strong supporter of African peacekeeping, and is committed to assisting the development of African capabilities in this area through the African Peace Facility.The work of the UN in addressing the root causes of human rights abuses, genocide and terrorism in Africa is also strongly supported by Ireland.  UN peacekeeping missions in Africa have a major role in stabilising former and current conflict zones where such abuses have been all too frequent.  Members of the Irish Defence Forces have participated in numerous UN peacekeeping missions in Africa, including in the Congo, Eritrea, Liberia and currently in Chad. The UN Human Rights Council provides an important forum for human rights abuses to be highlighted and addressed.  UN agencies play a vitally important role in bringing development and humanitarian aid to various parts of Africa, and Ireland as a donor gives significant support to their work.  Ireland has also been a consistent and strong supporter of the International Criminal Court, a key part of the international community's efforts to ensure that serious crimes, including genocide, do not go unpunished.In developing a sustainable approach which properly addresses the root causes of human rights abuses, genocide and terrorism, African leadership and responsibility are crucial.  This is recognised by the EU and UN, which are both working to build the capacities of African states and the African Union to respond to these challenges.  Ireland is committed to playing its part in this work, and I believe that our comprehensive and inclusive approach to the challenges of poverty, conflict and security stands the best chance of facilitating real and positive change in the lives of millions of people in Africa.
#PeterPowerFF	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-party	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-dob	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	530	The international community has demonstrated commitment to combat HIV and AIDS and its consequences through a number of high profile agreements that include the Millennium Development Goals universally supported in 2000, the commitment signed by 189 UN Member States following the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on HIV and AIDS in 2001 and the special commitment made in 2005 by the G8 grouping to support universal access to treatment. Ireland, through Irish Aid, is supporting actions to address HIV and AIDS through expenditures of more than €100 million a year to address that disease and other communicable diseases.Progress towards these commitments has been impressive. The UNAIDS world report for 2008 points to a six-fold increase in funding available for HIV and AIDS in this decade so far and describes a remarkable boost in delivery of important HIV and AIDS services and activities at global, regional and country levels, with very particular emphasis in those countries most affected.  A notable and valuable development has been the unprecedented number of civil society groups that have become active in HIV and AIDS work and have joined hands with their government counterparts to more effectively tackle common challenges through partnerships.Sub-Saharan Africa remains the worst affected region in the world with about two thirds of global cases (about 22m out of a 33m total of people living with HIV and AIDS in the world), and three quarters of the deaths (1.5 million out of a total global figure of 2 million in 2007).  Five of Irish Aid's priority Programme Countries are located in this most heavily affected region, namely Zambia, Malawi, Tanzania, Mozambique and Lesotho.There is clear and encouraging evidence of progress in this region. HIV prevalence in most southern African countries is either approaching or has reached a plateau.  However deaths from the final stages of AIDS remain a major concern.  There are country examples of success offering hope that it will be possible to get ahead of this infection.In Zimbabwe, for example, and despite the well recognised difficulties, HIV prevalence in pregnant women attending antenatal clinics has declined significantly in recent years, from 26% in 2002 to 18% in 2006. Key reasons for this are related to safer sexual behaviour including avoiding sex with non-regular partners, and consistent condom use if sex with a non-regular partner occurs.Another example is Uganda.  It was the first country in sub-Saharan Africa to register a drop in national HIV prevalence amongst adults.  Starting in 1992, significant decreases in HIV prevalence were observed alongside evidence of substantial behavioural change.  This has been due to widespread condom use, delay of first sex and avoidance of casual partners.  Whilst there are concerns that gains are under threat, the strategies that need support are well documented and with strong international partnership and effective national leadership, progress can be sustained.It is possible to sustain and replicate the gains we see today with effective global and national leadership and with commitment by donors to support HIV & AIDS services and activities.  Ireland continues to promote the need for leadership and engagement at the highest political level internationally, in order to push back this pandemic.  At country level, Ireland works closely with and supports national leadership to hold the ground already gained and to continue to make further progress.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	531	Ireland has offered, through the UN Standby Arrangements System (UNSAS), to provide up to 850 military personnel for overseas service at any one time.  This figure equates to some 10% of Ireland's standing Army (excluding Reserves) and demonstrates Ireland's commitment to the cause of international peace.  Ireland is currently contributing 780 Defence Forces personnel to 13 different missions throughout the world.The main overseas missions in which Defence Forces personnel are currently deployed are the UN Mission to Chad and the Central African Republic — MINURCAT — with 420 personnel, the NATO-led International Security presence (KFOR) in Kosovo with 232 personnel and the EU-led operation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Operation ALTHEA, with 44 personnel.  Ireland also has 27 personnel serving with EUFOR Tchad/RCA in the Operational Headquarters in Paris and Force Headquarters in Chad.  A number of personnel are serving as monitors and observers with the United Nations, the European Union and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).My Department routinely receives requests from the UN to provide individual officers to various peacekeeping missions.  These requests are considered in the first instance by my colleague, the Minister for Defence, on a case-by-case basis. When considering any particular request, a number of factors are taken into account, including the existence of realistic objectives and a clear mandate, which has the potential to contribute to a long-term solution; consideration of how the mission relates to the priorities of Irish foreign policy; and the degree of risk involved.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	532	I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 15 of today.As the Deputy will be aware, for the Treaty of Lisbon to enter into force, it must be ratified by all Member States.  Ireland is currently one of four Member States that has not done so as yet.  The others are the Czech Republic, Poland and Germany.Following the agreement of our EU partners to offer Ireland legal guarantees and other assurances in a number of areas of concern to the Irish people, the Government's energies are now directed towards giving effect to that commitment.  It is expected that this work will be completed by mid-2009. If the Government is fully satisfied with the outcome, as I expect that we will be, we are committed to seeking ratification of the Lisbon Treaty by the end of the term of the current European Commission, which is due to leave office at the end of October.  That means seeking the approval of the people in a referendum.It is not helpful to speculate on the outcome of a referendum that has not yet been called.  However, as recent events have underscored, the European Union is a key vehicle for the promotion and protection of Ireland's national interest. The Government firmly believes that ratification by Ireland of the Treaty of Lisbon would send a strong signal to our EU partners, and to the wider world, of our determination to remain at the heart of that enterprise.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	533	I have regular discussions with my colleagues, particularly in an EU context but also bilaterally and at UN fora, on issues relating to international peace and security. The monthly meetings of the General Affairs and External Relations Council provide regular opportunities in which to consider crises which may arise and the response of the European Union and the wider international community. The Council is also the body which takes decisions in relation to the EU's crisis management actions, such as the launching of new EU missions or significant changes to the 11 existing European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) missions — 9 of which are civilian operations.Officials of my Department and the Department of Defence also hold discussions, from time to time, with like-minded countries, including in relation to the 13 different UN-mandated peace-keeping and peace enforcement missions on which members of the Defence Forces are currently deployed.
#PeterPowerFF	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-party	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-dob	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	534	The Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) was agreed by the G8 Countries at their Summit in Gleneagles in July 2005, with a focus on the cancellation of the heavy debt burden on developing countries. It was intended to supplement the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative which was launched in 1996 to reduce the debt burden of qualifying countries to sustainable levels.The MDRI, which came into effect on 1 July 2006, provides for 100% relief on eligible debt from the World Bank, the African Development Bank and the International Monetary Fund for many of the poorest countries in the world, most of them in Africa. In 2007, the Inter-American Development Bank agreed to provide similar debt relief to the five poorest countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. The aim is to relieve these countries from the burden of servicing debt and assist them in making progress on the UN Millennium Development Goals, with the overall objective of halving global poverty by 2015.Up to the end of March 2009, debt relief has been delivered to 26 countries under the MDRI. In addition, eleven countries have made good progress towards qualifying for MDRI relief, and another six have been identified by the World Bank as potentially eligible.A recent review of debt relief by the Independent Evaluation Group at the World Bank concluded that it has enabled higher spending on countries' social programmes and poverty-reducing investments. However, it also noted the need to manage expectations of what debt relief can realistically achieve. The key lesson is that long-term debt sustainability ultimately relies on a country's broader success in building the institutions to support sustained economic growth.The Government has strongly supported initiatives to ease or cancel the debt burden on developing countries. We are encouraged by the extent of the relief granted under both the HIPC and MDRI Initiatives. Importantly, Ireland's bilateral assistance to the developing world is exclusively in the form of grants rather than loans. Ireland's share of the total cost of debt relief provided by the World Bank under the MDRI is €58.64 million. The Government contributed this amount in full in 2006. Ireland has also contributed over €20 million towards the cost of implementing the HIPC initiative.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	535	The most recent ministerial meeting held in the framework of the current round of WTO negotiations ended inconclusively in Geneva on 29 July 2008, although progress was achieved on many of the issues covered by the negotiations. In the end, the breakdown came as a result of disagreement, primarily between the United States and India, on a special safeguard mechanism (SSM) for agricultural producers in developing countries: in effect a mechanism to protect farmers in developing countries from surges in imports of agricultural produce.Ireland had wanted to see an ambitious, fair and balanced outcome to the negotiations, one which would respect Ireland's national interests and reflect adequately the aim of the Doha Development Agenda to give greater prominence to development issues, especially the needs of the poorest developing countries. Ireland regretted the failure to conclude the WTO negotiations and we retain a clear interest in the evolution of fair and sustainable international frameworks to facilitate trade.WTO rule making and multilateral trade liberalisation has had a profound impact on Ireland's development. Against that background, the Government's position with regard to the WTO negotiations has been balanced and consistent: we have always wanted to see a successful outcome, but not at the expense of unfair and unrealistic provisions in respect of agriculture. Ireland's view is that the EU had made very significant contributions to the negotiations and that the other WTO negotiating partners should make equivalent contributions.   However, it is most unlikely that the negotiations will be resumed before the summer. The question of holding a regular Ministerial Meeting of the WTO is still under consideration, but even this would not take place until November or December.

This was done with a view to affording my Department the opportunity to review its operation over the next few months and re-launching it later in the year.Earlier this week, I met with representatives of organisations involved with issues affecting older people and I have agreed with them a process that will set the broad parameters for the review and for the necessary consultation to be undertaken as part of it.  I am hopeful that the review process can begin in May and be completed by mid September.I would like to re-assure the Deputies that all applications received up to the suspension of the Scheme will be processed and approved, as appropriate, in line with the current eligibility criteria.  In addition, it is important to note that the suspension of the Scheme in no way affects those who already have received a monitored alarm device.

This is a standard provision in legislation and applies equally to a range of other schemes operated by the Department.Exceptionally, Disability Allowance may continue to be paid where the claimant is resident away from the State and pursuing an approved second or third level course of education under the Back to Education Allowance Scheme or while receiving medical treatment which is not available in the State and where the person concerned has been referred for treatment by the HSE under the National Treatment Purchase Fund.It is intended to introduce changes governing the scheme in order to provide formally for such exceptions. The Deputy will appreciate that it would be imprudent to introduce open-ended provisions in this area, but if he has specific proposals in this regard, they can be taken into consideration in the course of the preparation of the planned legislative changes.

The purpose of these meetings was to discuss the direction and content of authorities' proposed housing investment programmes and particularly to consider the prioritisation of projects and the reconfiguration of the Social Housing Investment Programme as a whole, so that it can be sustained and consolidated in the changing economic and budgetary circumstances.On foot of information furnished in the course of this round of Action Plan meetings, and taking account of the final Estimates position for 2009 announced in the recent Budget, I am finalising this year's Social Housing Investment Programme allocations, which will issue shortly.Individual projects or proposals for the Tallaght area will be considered in the context of South Dublin County Council's overall Social Housing Investment Programme.

Separate funding is also provided to local authorities from the Environment Fund to co-finance anti-litter and anti-graffiti education and awareness-raising activities and I recently announced that the allocation in 2009 for South County Dublin under this scheme is €42,000.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	553	Under the Carbon Fund Act 2007, the National Treasury Management Agency has been designated as purchasing agent for the State.  In 2008, the Agency purchased some 3.5m certified emission reduction units at a cost of €53m. To date in 2009, they have purchased 1.8m units at a cost of €21.6m.  No credits were purchased in 2007.In January 2007, prior to the designation of the National Treasury Management Agency as purchasing agent, my Department committed €10 million each to the Carbon Fund for Europe and the BioCarbon Fund operated by the World Bank.  Management of these investments is a matter for my Department and, since enactment of the 2007 Act, payments are made by the Agency through the Carbon Fund process as they arise. In 2008, my Department refunded €3.72m to the Carbon Fund in respect of these investments in the World Bank. No further payments to the World Bank have been made to date in 2009 but periodic drawdowns are a feature of these investments. The amount to be paid each year is not predetermined and in general payments will be made as purchasing transactions progress.In December 2006, my Department entered into an agreement with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development to invest €20 million in the Multilateral Carbon Credit Fund. The investment was made in 2006 on foot of a once-off provision from the Department's vote.These investments with the World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development are expected to yield some 3m carbon credits at a projected cost of some €27.6m during the five-year Kyoto Protocol commitment period 2008-2012.The National Climate Change Strategy signalled the possibility of supplementing greenhouse gas emission reductions with the purchase of up to 3.6 million carbon units on average each year in the five-year Kyoto Protocol commitment period 2008-2012 or 18m units in total costing €270m, at a projected unit price of €15.  The economic downturn has implications for the purchasing programme. The most recent EPA projections suggest that with full implementation of all announced emission reduction measures the purchase requirement for carbon units will now be between 1.3 and 1.8m units per annum or around 7m units in total over the 2008-2012 period.  In the circumstances, the National Treasury Management Agency has been asked to put its purchasing programme on hold for the foreseeable future.Purchasing requirements to ensure Kyoto compliance are being kept under review and will be revised as necessary in the light of future projections. There are no proposals to sell credits, as, if it transpires that more credits have been bought than are needed in 2008-2012 period, they can be carried forward for use after 2012 in the next commitment period.

This programme includes a range of energy efficiency initiatives for which some €50 million has been set aside in 2009.  The range of energy efficiency improvement initiatives includes a programme of Towards Carbon Neutral demonstration projects, focussed on the construction of dwellings to a minimum BER standard of A2, as well as a number of demonstration projects for the retrofitting of insulation and other energy efficiency measures in the existing stock of local authority housing to achieve minimum B2 standards.  It is our intention that the experience gained from these projects will inform our approach to both new construction and remedial works schemes in the future to ensure a viable and energy efficient stock of local authority housing into the future.Under the national programme, some €20 million will be provided in 2009 for an ambitious programme to improve the energy rating of dwellings due to be re-let during the year to a BER rating of C1, as well as to address energy deficits in apartment complexes.   In addition, €14 million has been set aside within the range of initiatives to complete the National Central Heating Programme, which will deliver the installation of central heating and associated thermal insulation improvements in some 2,100 units in 2009.Finally, local authorities may also use their internal capital receipts, subject to approval by my Department of an annual improvement works programme under which they may direct resources to projects which are deemed most meritorious of funding in their authority, including the installation of insulation, the replacement of windows and doors, and other measures to improve energy efficiency in their stock.

As the Deputy will be aware, in February, I announced details of 43 major building projects to proceed to tender and construction and 25 high priority projects to commence architectural planning.The project to which the Deputy refers was not included in this announcement.  Therefore, it is unlikely that it will be progressed in 2009.The progression of all large scale building projects, including the project in question, from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in the context of my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme. However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project at this time.As the Deputy may be aware, the school has already received a total of €910,000 under the Summer Works Scheme in 2005, 2006 and 2007 for improvement works to the school.

I am advised that my Department has and will continue to consult with the Chief  State Solicitors Office on the draft Memorandum given their role as the Department's legal advisers on property related matters.  I understand that my Department has not sought clarifications from the Attorney General in relation to these discussions.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	576	In light of the Budget 2009 decision my Department has now published a circular for schools which sets out how the new arrangements will operate for the allocation of language support teachers from September 2009. The circular sets out a structured and transparent approach for the operation of the alleviation  measures that were announced in the budget for schools that have a significant concentration of newcomer pupils. The alleviation measures mean that these schools can qualify for up to 4 language support posts with the possibility of additional post(s) also being approved through the independent staffing appeals mechanism.Schools can now apply to my Department in the normal way for language support posts. These posts are approved on a provisional basis initially and will be confirmed in September 2009 following receipt from the schools of actual enrolments of pupils requiring language support. It is estimated that notwithstanding the budget measures there will be over 1,400 language support teaching posts in our primary and post-primary schools in September 2009 and up to about 500 other teachers in part-time posts. By any standards this is a very significant resource and the challenge will be to ensure that it is used to maximum effect.

Factors under consideration include population growth, demographic trends, current and projected enrolments, recent and planned housing developments and capacity of existing schools to meet demand for places. Having considered these factors decisions will be taken on the means by which emerging needs will be met within an area.

It has been assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria of my Department and assigned a Band rating of 2.2.  The progression of all large scale building projects, including the project in question, from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in the context of my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme. However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project at this time.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-23 00:00:00	Prelude	580	As part of my Department's current review of prefabricated accommodation, contact is being made with all suppliers of prefabricated accommodation in relation to existing rental contracts.  Therefore, I am not in a position to provide information on payments to individual companies, as requested by the Deputy, due to commercial sensitivity.  I can say, however, that a total of almost €27m was approved and paid by my Department to schools for rental of pre-fabricated accommodation for the period 1 January 08 to 31 December 08 and that a total of 37 providers were involved.I should explain that the position generally in relation to rental of prefabricated accommodation in schools is that the Department provides grant-aid towards the provision of temporary school accommodation (not limited to prefabs) to the management authorities of education providers where it is established that a need for such temporary accommodation exists. Such grant-aid is paid at a rate of 95% for schools with permanent recognition and 75% for schools with provisional recognition. Schools are expected to pay a local contribution of the balance, with an annual threshold on the local contribution of €3,175.The Board of Management of a school is the contracting authority and is responsible for acquiring temporary accommodation. Where approval is given by my Department for the rental of such accommodation, the Board is required to seek at least three tenders and, in compliance with Public Procurement procedures, must usually accept the lowest tender. If, for any reason, the  Board wishes to accept a tender that is not the lowest, it must consult with my Department. If, following examination of the tender, the Department is satisfied with these tender details, approval is issued to the school. As the contracting authority in these cases is the school, it has been the practice for temporary accommodation to be procured on an individual school basis.

This Act, which is regulated by the Health and Safety Authority, sets out the main provisions for securing and improving the safety, health and welfare of people at work which includes the control of safety and health at work, the management and organisation of systems of work necessary to achieve these goals and the  responsibilities and roles of employers, employees and others.Under the Act, school authorities are responsible for managing safety, health and welfare in schools and for having a safety statement in place in their schools, to identify possible hazards, assess the risks to health and safety and put appropriate safeguards in place.  In practical terms, individual school authorities are best placed to assess the detail of their own health and safety requirements and there are many information sources such as Codes of Practices, guidelines, legislation and standards available to support them in this task.  It is a matter for schools to decide whether or not to employ an expert to carry out this work on their behalf and to meet the cost of so doing.My Department is currently involved in developing health and safety guidelines to support post-primary schools in meeting their obligations under the prescribed legislation.  This project is being undertaken in collaboration with the Health and Safety Authority, the State Claims Agency and the School Development Planning Initiative.  The aim of the guidelines is to reduce the administrative burden on schools by assisting them in:The planning and operation of an effective health and safety systemThe evaluation of current policies and practices according to the highest standards of health and safetyWriting or up-dating their safety statements.

Accordingly schools must immediately cease any arrangements to fill such posts.It is a matter for the school authority to re-organise and prioritise the appropriate duties for post of responsibility holders in the context of implementing this moratorium.

This Circular 0022/2009 is available on my Department's website.It is a matter for the school authority to re-organise and prioritise the appropriate duties for post of responsibility holders in the context of implementing this moratorium.Under the revised arrangements schools may continue to fill posts of Principal and Deputy Principal. The Government decision provides for an exception in respect of the first allocation of posts of responsibility in new schools. My Department will be in direct communication with new schools in relation to their entitlements to fill their first allocation of posts of responsibility.
