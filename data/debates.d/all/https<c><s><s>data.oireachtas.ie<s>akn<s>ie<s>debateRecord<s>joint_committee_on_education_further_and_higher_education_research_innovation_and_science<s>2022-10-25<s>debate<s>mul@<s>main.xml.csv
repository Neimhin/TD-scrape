If their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks and it is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  I invite Ms Ní Chéileachair to begin and ask all of our guests to be brief as possible with their opening statements so that committee members will have as much time as possible to interact with them.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	2	Tá Cumann Múinteoirí Éireann thar a bheith buíoch as ucht an deis labhairt os comhair an chomhchoiste.We ask the committee to note that over the years the INTO has highlighted the topic of mental health. At its annual congress in 2022 a comprehensive motion was passed on the mental health of primary school children. Our education consultative conference in 2021 had a focus on well-being and mental health. Mental health was included as a topic at our equality conference in 2013. We want the committee to note that the culture in which Irish primary schools operate is one that strives to be safe, healthy and inclusive for all pupils regardless of social background, race, self-identity and learning needs. Primary teachers are profoundly aware of the importance of the well-being of their pupils. The challenge of protecting the mental health and well-being of primary school children must not be underestimated. National research carried out with children and young people by the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland in 2013 suggests that approximately one in three young people will have experienced some type of mental disorder by the age of 13. This rate rises to more than one in two by the age of 24 years when intervention does not take place. This is more than 50%. Research conducted by Dublin City University in 2017 found that the psychological well-being needs of children in primary school are complex. This research identified a range and severity of difficulties that children present with in primary schools. It also focused on the varied family and cultural contexts that are a feature of their daily lives. Critical incidents of a serious nature that schools deal with include separation, divorce, marital breakdown, anxiety, bullying, cyberbullying, self-harm, suicidal ideation, eating disorders and sexual identity issues. All of these impact on the mental health of children. Ireland's child and adolescent mental health services are experiencing significant difficulties. These have been well publicised and include a lack of services at community and school level, difficulties in recruiting qualified staff and excessive waiting lists for specialist mental health treatment services. School principals have reported wait times of up to four years in some cases. This is unacceptable and cannot continue.  The service that engages with children on an almost daily basis is the school. Schools and school personnel must be supported by all other services when nurturing the positive mental health of pupils. It is acknowledged that our mental health is influenced by our daily lives and that the foundation of good mental health starts in our youth. In other jurisdictions, schools are recognised as the optimal venue for youth mental health promotion and prevention programmes as they are the only venue where all children and adolescents in society can be reached. In those jurisdictions mental health professionals work in schools, alongside teachers, to support the mental health of pupils. The Covid-19 pandemic has exacerbated stress and anxiety among children. During school closures some pupils regressed not only in their learning but also in their social and emotional well-being. Guidance published by the Department of Education in September 2020 advised that well-being be prioritised in our schools. Teachers recognise the impact the trauma of the pandemic has had and seek increased resources for primary school teachers to adequately support children's mental health in the months and years ahead. At its congress in April 2022 the INTO noted the dearth of mental health support services for primary school children. During the debate on children’s mental health delegates reported that more and more children present in primary school classrooms experiencing anxiety, poor mental health and poor emotional well-being. The congress called for increased National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, provision for schools and clarity regarding the level of provision that schools can expect, a national framework to inform the development of counselling services for primary school children and resources to introduce on-site school counselling in primary schools in line with international best practice. We are delighted to welcome the Minister's recent announcement of €5 million to fund a pilot programme of counselling supports in primary schools. We look forward to her engagement with stakeholders on the matter. We note that Government policy dictates that all mental health and other professional services are provided in the community. There is extensive international research to indicate that services co-located in schools experience a higher level of engagement and success. We would argue that schools are an integral part of the community of children and families and ask the Government to re-examine and redefine "community" in this context. The INTO recommends that schools are provided with adequate, age-appropriate supports for children presenting with mental health difficulties, increased NEPS provision for schools, the development of a national framework to inform the development of counselling services for primary school children and funding and resources for this. It also recommends increased funding for child and adolescent mental health services and sufficient up-to-date professional development supports for teachers. The INTO recognises the urgency in providing mental health supports for primary school pupils, especially at school level.They must be properly resourced and meet the needs of the school community. We remain committed to the support of the pupils in our care. Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis an gcomhchoiste as ucht éisteacht liom inniú.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	3	To clarify, Ms Sarah Behan is unwell today. I am Sarah Hughes, the mental health programme manager. I thank the Chairperson and members of the Oireachtas committee for the opportunity to speak to the committee today. I am the mental health programme manager for the Union of Students in Ireland, which is the national student representative body for students in third level education. I want to draw the committee's attention to the current issues we are facing with regard to mental health funding in higher education institutions, HEIs. The current funding allocated to mental heath support in HEIs is not core or multi-annual. While the extra funding provided for mental health during Covid is greatly welcomed, it only brought the student-to-counsellor ratio to 1:2,500, rather than the best standard practice of 1:1,000. This funding also only refers to core counselling clinics and does not take other staff, such as GPs, health nurses, disability support staff or administrative staff, into account, although they may be needed to fully support student mental health. A whole-of-campus approach is recommended by the national framework, and this cannot be achieved without core multi-annual funding. While international researchers are loath to speak to an increase in mental health problems and suicide levels post-Covid-19, data from within Ireland, such as from the My World Survey 2 study, indicate that within this cohort mental distress was increasing prior to the pandemic, and appears to have continued to increase throughout. Without core multi-annual funding, additional staff can only be hired on short-term contracts. This not only makes it difficult to hire appropriately-skilled staff, but also makes any kind of planning beyond the short term almost impossible. In addition, there is currently no information on how the mental health funding from the recent budget will be allocated. This is resulting in campuses not knowing whether they can keep staff on, or if they need to cut services. Ring-fenced multi-annual funding is needed to ensure that the mental health of students is seen as an integral aspect of college life. Mental health staff are struggling to deal with the current demand of students presenting themselves in distress. Recently, on a campus visit, I saw the strain that is being put on services, as there was only standing room left in the waiting room for an emergency counselling drop-in clinic. It is important to note the fact that counsellors are expected to take on additional work related to the roll-out of various welfare-related policies. We have recently seen funding being allocated to allow for appointed roles to help with the roll-out of frameworks relating to ending sexual violence and harassment. We need to see similar funding being allocated to help with the roll-out of welfare-related frameworks. Without it, it may come down to a counsellor having to choose between rolling out a framework or dealing with students in counselling sessions. Increased multi-annual targeted funding for student counselling services and other student support services must be put in place to allow for the continued roll-out of services to meet demand on an ongoing basis, and in line with recent publications such as the National Student Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Framework, Healthy Campus and 3Set reports. We are seeing an increase in students who are registered as having a mental illness in higher education institutes. That does not include students with sub-clinical needs but who may need mental health supports throughout the year. We all have mental health and should be able to access supports easily when they are needed. While the launch of initiatives such as Togetherall is helpful, it should be in addition to core funding. After all, the aim of Togetherall is to meet a sub-clinical need. A requirement of students applying to college through the disability access route to education, DARE, scheme is the provision of diagnosis by a consultant psychiatrist only. Ireland does not maintain an adult mental health service waiting list. However, it is widely accepted that were such a list to exist, it would be long and growing. This would be something similar to the child and adolescent mental health service, CAMHS, waiting list, which is exceptionally long. Many young people who are already engaged with psychology services are forced to join the end of psychiatry waiting lists because their current treatment provider is not permitted to verify their diagnosis. Allowing psychologists to certify diagnoses for the purposes of DARE would not only reduce psychiatry waiting lists, but would also allow the higher education sector to take a step closer to being more inclusive, and is something that Union of Students in Ireland, USI, would fully endorse. USI supports the Psychological Society of Ireland, PSI's call for equity of funding for all trainee psychologists, including educational psychologists, and for an increase in places available on trainee courses to increase the number of mental health professionals in Ireland to a level that can meet demand, both on campus and across the country more broadly. USI calls for a change to DARE and in-college accommodations through disability services to move from only accepting a diagnosis from psychiatry to allowing a diagnosis from a PSI-accredited psychologist. Best practice recommends increasing peer support to increase both mental health supports on campus, and to support student engagement, thus reducing drop-out levels. Work has also begun, both nationally and internationally, in examining the prospect of embedding well-being into the third level curriculum.However, the issue to date here is that the majority of this work has been at local level in an ad hoc way, not always centring the student voice in the development of such programmes. The Union of Students in Ireland recognises the continued work to increase student participation and the student voice in student mental health work across the sector is vital and must be done in a non-tokenistic co-creation approach. National co-ordination, collaboration and funding is needed to help these programmes to grow in a way that works for each campus. The recommendations in the 3Set report, including, but not limited to, the National Student Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Framework, should be fully implemented and sufficient funding allocation to allow for this must be provided.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	4	The Irish Federation of University Teachers, IFUT, is the only union in Ireland that exclusively represents workers in higher education. We represent many grades of workers, including lecturers, researchers, tutors, teaching fellows, librarians and administrators. IFUT understands quite rightly that much of the focus of this round-table discussion on mental health supports in schools and tertiary education will be framed in the context of student needs. Therefore, we will focus on issues for employees in this sector that adversely impact on their mental health. In recent months, IFUT welcomed the opportunity to appear before the Joint Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science in relation to the funding requirements of higher education. The committee published the report, The Future Funding of Higher Education, in July 2022. In relation to today's topic, that report contains many contributions from parties who operate in this sector which are as relevant now as then. In particular, Chapter 8 "Mental Health and Well-being Supports” considered the current demands for mental health support in higher education. There is a recommendation 9 there that I am sure members of the committee are interested in. IFUT is of the opinion that recommendation 9 adequately and succinctly addresses the core issues in the university sector which negatively impact staff, students and the quality of education and, indeed, the causes of mental health issues, namely precarious employment, the continued application of the employment control framework and the failure of staffing levels to keep pace with the expansion of student and programme numbers thereby resulting in the Irish staff-to-student ratio being one of the largest in Europe. Precarious employment and a high staff-student ratio create an unmanageable workload culture on the mental health of the people working in the sector. A 2017 study into work-related stress within the higher education institutions, HEI, sector, the Foy report, found that unrealistic demands, lack of resources and constraints on employees lead to stressful workplaces and ultimately lead to a deterioration in mental health. The report concluded that tackling the causes of work-related stress also makes business sense as doing so leads to reduced absenteeism, higher productivity and lower employee turnover. A 2015 study which examined precarity and casualisation in the Irish education sector noted that "Many casual workers encapsulated how they felt about their situation with negative descriptors like 'depressed', 'frustrated', 'worried'’, 'despondent and hopeless', 'disillusioned', 'demoralised ...". In an article in The Irish Times on 12 October this year about university rankings, TCD Provost Professor Doyle states:The poor staff-student ratio is directly related to the underfunding of the higher education sector in Ireland. It is vital that Government honours the commitment made earlier this year in 'Funding the Future' [report] and increase annual core funding by €307 million for the higher education sector in Ireland.While university rankings are something that may appear to be arbitrary at times, the issue of student-staff ratios are a very serious matter. IFUT has concluded that there is no systematic effort being made in Ireland to act on the recommendations contained within this report. In the workplace IFUT is responding regularly to new precarious posts and roles being created for members on fixed-term contracts for years, and even decades. Members' contracts run for nine months of the year but they are expected to mark examinations, engage with students and prepare for the next semester during their three months without pay. Many of these workers are completely invisible. They are not on staff lists, email lists or invited to staff meetings. No one truly knows the extent of the problem of precarious employment in this sector in Ireland. Figures which are gathered on headcount tend to count full-time equivalents, FTEs. In the case of part-time or hourly workers, one full-time equivalent could include ten or more real suffering workers.The committee recommended that the staffing levels of universities "be reviewed urgently or by end of 2022 at the latest". We are fast approaching the end of 2022, but we in IFUT are not aware of any process involving any trade union for examining this issue. IFUT members report a significant difficulty in making time to provide the pastoral care to students that they deserve and require. Students may not realise that the lecturer standing before them is on a contract for three hours per week. When a student requests a one-to-one discussion on the course content or difficulties he or she is experiencing, the student should expect support to be forthcoming. Little do students know that their lecturers might have to run off after a class to work a second or third job to make ends meet. This disastrous employment culture is bad for the employee, but also for the students they teach. The unavailability of lecturers to students will contribute to stress and anxiety for the students. With daily demands on their time, the ability of some employees to conduct research is curtailed. This will have longer-term devastating consequences for the quality of the research and education that the institutions provide. Burnout is real among academics in higher education. We all know that trade union-organised workplaces are safer workplaces. In higher education, though, there is a limit to what trade unions can do to impact the work environment without national policy supporting the workers in these institutions. Conversations about mental health in higher education need to look not just at the supports for workers when they experience mental health problems, but at the causes of workers' suffering in the first place. IFUT wants to be centrally involved in agreeing decent work, fair workloads and adequate staffing levels across universities and other higher education institutions. We want to be part of shaping the solution with this committee.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	5	The Teachers' Union of Ireland, TUI, thanks the committee for the opportunity to make this opening statement on the topic of mental health supports in schools and tertiary education. The prevalence of mental health difficulties is a significant issue, not just for the education system, but for society as a whole. The two education Departments and the wider State have a duty of care not just to students, but also to staff, to support their mental health and well-being. Education settings, whether post-primary, further education or higher education, can play a vital role in supporting students, staff and families in terms of mental health. However, education settings cannot do this on their own. They need support from those same families, the wider community and taxpayers if mental health is to be addressed satisfactorily. It is also essential that support services, both inside and outside the education system, be resourced to provide specialist assistance as required. Mental health difficulties existed long before the Covid-19 pandemic, but the pandemic has made matters worse. The TUI is committed to supporting meaningful measures that support students who experience mental health difficulties and their teachers or lecturers who educate them but who can also experience mental health difficulties of their own. Schools and colleges require support from relevant agencies with expertise in mental health if they are to support the affected students adequately and appropriately. Cuts to pastoral care supports in schools, such as in guidance provision and middle management posts, have also made it difficult for schools to support students in these demanding situations. The loss of pastoral supports such as assistant principal positions is a situation that the Department of Education has described as "unsustainable". These posts of responsibility are essential in building relationships and identifying issues, especially as a mainstream post-primary teacher usually sees approximately 250 students every week. Mental health support services in tertiary education are significantly understaffed in terms of counsellors, pastoral staff and those with special responsibility for supporting students. This is even before we take into account the expected increases in student enrolment in further and higher education. Additional staffing is vital. Mental health can also become an issue for staff themselves. Staff may encounter such difficulties in either their personal or professional lives and it is essential that adequate support be available to them too. The TUI would like to make a number of recommendations to the committee. Mental health in education settings should be taken seriously and appropriate investment of resources, provision of time and training should be made in it for both students and staff. It is essential that vital support services within schools be restored.This includes, but is not limited to, guidance support and middle management posts. Significant investment is needed in out-of-school and out-of-college supports such as child and adult mental health services. An inclusive support structure should be set up in schools and colleges with access to all the necessary professionals and referrals in a timely manner. Staffing in NEPS should be expanded to allow for greater one-to-one direct support for students from NEPS psychologists. We note that some additional staffing has been provided. A trickle-down model on its own simply is not enough. The number of counsellors and psychologists in tertiary education support services should, as my colleague from USI said, be increased to the international recommendation of one per 1,000 students. Training should be provided to teachers and lecturers in how best to refer on students and how to interface with the appropriate services. The HSE should allow students to access community mental health services in their local community during holiday periods and to access education settings for mental health support during term time and vice versa. Significant additional staffing should be provided to the adult education guidance service. Learners in further education and training, FET, such as Youthreach should have access to a broad range of guidance and counselling supports, as required. All education staff should have access to mental health support programmes for themselves and for the support of their students. There should be access to dedicated support teams who work directly with staff and students focusing on prevention over cure. I thank the committee for listening to this opening statement. The TUI would be happy to answer any questions members may have. The TUI would also like to direct the committee to the more extensive written submission we made in August, which provides more detail on the issues I have outlined.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	6	Gabhaim buíochas leis an gCathaoirleach, na Teachtaí Dála agus na Seanadóirí. Táim thar a bheith sásta a bheith anseo inniu chun meabhairshláinte a phlé. Anjelica Foley is ainm dom agus is mise an t-oifigeach leasa d’Aontas Daltaí Iar-bhunscoile na hÉireann. The Irish Second-LeveI Students’ Union, ISSU, is the national representative body for second-level students in Ireland. Our core aims are to provide a collective voice for second-level students and to fight for a fair education system that values each individual and allows them to reach their full potential. Access to adequate and integrated mental health supports in schools and throughout the education system are crucial to allowing students to achieve their full potential. The ISSU is fully committed to working alongside stakeholders to find solutions to the issues students face. It is in this spirit that I am before the committee today. As we are all keenly aware, the Covid-19 pandemic has had a catastrophic impact on students’ mental health. While schools are no longer closed and mask-wearing is no longer enforced, the repercussions and aftershocks of the Covid-19 pandemic are still being felt by many students around Ireland. This is not the only challenge students face. There are countless other factors that affect their mental health and students' mental health is undoubtedly suffering in an increasingly online world. If we are to provide adequate mental health supports for students we must also investigate the causes of mental health difficulties among students. Students' lives can be stressful enough outside of school, but the fact of the matter is that our education system is actively damaging students’ mental health. The reformed junior cycle has developed a more holistic approach to education. The recently released draft social, personal and health education, SPHE, short course curriculum is evidence of this. Recently, Department of Education inspectors found that only one in five schools timetable SPHE at senior cycle. As per our submission, the ISSU recommends the creation and integration of modules within the SPHE curriculum in both junior and senior cycle to educate students about dealing with both their own mental health and how to support their peers. Year after year, the leaving certificate and the CAO cause immense anxiety and stress among students. In 2016, the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child made "a very strong recommendation" for reform of the leaving certificate, citing the severe stress it places on students’ mental health. The role of guidance counsellors in helping students has not gone unnoticed; as outlined in our submission, we recommend the introduction of a direct referral route for guidance counsellors when a student avails of one-on-one counselling and the provision of funds to schools to introduce an on-site psychologist.A persistent stigma surrounds mental health in Ireland, particularly among boys and young men. It is crucial, therefore, that student engagement and peer support be improved to further support the mental health needs of young people. Initiatives such as Jigsaw's One Good School programme engage students as partners in the creation of a better environment for mental health in their school communities. Further development of such programmes must happen in collaboration with students to ensure the student voice is represented. Furthermore, it is important to acknowledge schools and places of education are often the first port of call when addressing any mental health difficulties a students may have. To this end, it is vital we invest in early invention and at the same time introduce mandatory mental health training for teachers and all school staff during their initial training. This is important in ensuring we have a proactive whole-school approach to mental health. Unfortunately, as with many other educational issues, mental health does not affect all students equally. Students from the Travelling community, students of colour and those from other minority groups, including the LGBTQIA+ community, are at a much higher risk of developing severe mental health difficulties. Alongside further mental health training, we must introduce mandatory anti-discrimination training to tackle the increased prevalence of mental health difficulties among students from minority groups. Currently, mental health supports in schools are far from perfect. Some students will require mental health supports outside their schools. Increased investment in pre-existing services to expand capacity is therefore vital. Students going through a mental health crisis should not be placed on a months-long waiting list to access services. We recommend an independent report and review of CAMHS and better integration of mental health supports between the Departments of Health and Education. I welcome any questions the committee may have.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	7	I welcome the opportunity to discuss mental health supports in schools and tertiary education at this roundtable discussion. It is a complex issue as the supports available to both students and staff are unfortunately quite varied. According to a recent report in The Irish Times, a study by Maynooth University, National College of Ireland and Trinity College Dublin found more than 40% of Irish adults have a mental health disorder. However, the people most likely to have a mental health disorder were younger and likely to have suffered a traumatic life event. In respect of the members we represent, SNAs are specifically affected. When a traumatic event occurs in a school community the first response is the arrival of NEPS at the school. When NEPS leaves, however, it is the SNAs who assist the students in their times of need. Often, the traumatic event is compounded for these students by their additional needs. We must have a holistic approach to tragic events, one that encompasses the entire community, including management, teachers, SNAs, secretaries, caretakers, parents and siblings. They all need to have access to a community-based mental health service as a tragedy is a tragedy. There must be a more structured approach. We have heard many personal accounts many months after a tragedy, up to eight months later. For example, when a student passes away, a student under the care of an SNA may pull out a book or toy that happened to be the favourite of their deceased classmate and that child is brought back to the grief and loss of their friend. While NEPS provides a valuable service, it unfortunately only deals with students in the moment and at a particular point in time. It is vital that SNAs are given access to appropriate training and support that allow them to support the mental health needs of the students they work with. SNAs are often overlooked in this regard, which is unfortunate given the close bond and rapport that exists between SNAs and the students they work with. There is a lack of recognition for SNAs as a professional grade, for example, in comparison with social workers. Social workers have a defined career hierarchy and support structure, with senior and principal social workers, which encourages reflective practice and child-centred interventions based on the individual child's needs. Sadly this type of professional infrastructure does not exist for SNAs, but it should. Through the introduction of school-based mental health supports at primary level, there is an opportunity to strengthen and protect the mental well-being of children while also supporting their parents, teachers and SNAs. This could also lead to a reduction in the number of children who require specialist mental health treatment. Staff members can have mixed experiences when dealing with their employers on the subject of mental health and well-being.According to Mind, a UK-based mental health charity, more than one in five or 21% agreed they have called in sick to avoid work when asked how workplace stress had affected them; 14% agreed they had resigned and 42% had considered resigning when asked how workplace stress had affected them; 30% of staff disagreed with the statement, "I would feel able to talk openly with my line manager if I was feeling stressed"; and 56% of employers said they would like to do more to improve staff well-being but do not feel they have the right training or guidance. As regards the Department of Education, while it has extensive policies on the well-being and health of children and young people, which are to be commended, for those policies to be realised it must support the workers who in turn will support the students and young people they work with on a daily basis. It has fallen to the trade union movement to provide employee assistance programmes to its members, whereas this should be provided as a matter of course by the Department for all of its staff. Furthermore, as I mentioned earlier, appropriate training and support must be afforded to special needs assistants who are working at the coalface in schools along with their teaching colleagues. However, a disparity exists in this regard as teachers can avail of extra personal days, EPV days, or as they are more colloquially known, "course days", whereas special needs assistants, SNAs, cannot. As well as that Mental Health Ireland only offer their “Mind-out” course to teachers and youth workers. The Mind-out programme that was developed by the Health Promotion Research Centre at NUI Galway and the HSE’s health promotion and improvement department has been proven to strengthen young people's social and emotional coping skills and improve their overall mental health and well-being. It is a question that Fórsa raises here today as to why SNAs have not been included in the roll-out of this programme?  Barnardos children’s charity who work with some of Ireland’s most vulnerable families have a saying that every childhood lasts a lifetime. SNAs want to support the totality of a child’s and young person’s development, but they must be given access to training and support to allow them to acquire and develop the skills to protect, nurture and support the mental health and the well-being of the students that they work with. The Department of Education needs to recognise the valuable contribution that SNAs can make in preventing poor mental health and ensuring that all of our children and young people thrive in the school community. I thank the committee for their time today and Fórsa are happy to answer any questions that the committee may have.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	9	I thank the Chair. I am conscious colleagues that I am the seventh speaker in a row and, therefore, I will do what I will call a little mop-up operation and the committee has the Association of Secondary Teachers Ireland, ASTI, submission which they can consult for a refinement of the policies. I wish to make three remarks. Number one, we welcome the opportunity. I love that concept developed by Maureen Gaffney - "Flourishing". Well-being is something that is more than just an individual matter. Failure to flourish at school or college is never an individual problem it is a societal problem and as Maureen has said schools are the optimal sites for responding to mental health difficulties for young people. We have not mentioned the extent of the problem and the prevalence of the problem around the table and I think it is important. Two major pieces of research are referred to.  In 2013, research by the Royal College of Surgeons demonstrated that by the age of 13, one in three children had experienced a mental health difficulty. By the age of 24, that had increased to one in two. It is clear that youth and adolescence are times when significant life and health challenges are addressed and that is the optimal time to intervene. As Mr. Honer said, recent research by NUI Maynooth found that young people aged 18 to 24 are eight times more likely to have mental health difficulties than the older population. It is a bit like the housing crisis talk about the "squeezed youth" they are really facing a barrage of life challenges. Of course, the impact of Covid-19, anxiety, stress, depression are beginning to surface and manifest.  We have not mentioned around the table, and I think it is kind of important, the extent of the problem and the prevalence of the problem. There are two major pieces of research that are referred to. First is the 2013 Royal College of Surgeons research which found that by the age of 13 one in three children had experienced a mental health difficulty. By the age of 24 that had increased to one in two. It is very clear that youth and adolescence are times when significant life challenges and health challenges are addressed and that is the optimal time to intervene. As Mr. Honer said, recent research by NUI Maynooth hsa found that young people aged 18 to 24 are eight times more likely to have mental health difficulty than older populations. It is a bit like the housing crisis we talk about the 'squeezed youth'. They are really facing a barrage of life challenges and of course the impact of Covid-19 anxiety, stress, depression are beginning to surface and manifest. We are here today because committee members are legislators and they inform and make policy. I always think it is good to come with a shopping list because the committee needs to know how it can help given it is genuinely concerned about these social problems. From ASTI's perspective, there are a number of core areas that the committee needs to intervene in quickly. First, the committee needs to address the situation as regards guidance counselling in schools. Teachers are contracted to teach 22 hours, the allocation ratio for guidance counsellors in a school of 500 pupils is 18 hours so they are not even getting a full-time guidance counsellor.The allocation ratio has to be changed in light of that as it has been around for the past 30 years. Second, according to research I picked up this morning from the Institute of Guidance Counselling that they conducted this year, in 10% of the schools they surveyed the guidance counsellor was not practising as he or she was too burned out. Some 22% schools had unqualified internal staff filling the role and 26% of schools had external advisers coming in to fill the role. We have a crisis in the guidance counselling service that has to be addressed. The other crisis is in area of the child and adolescent mental health service, CAMHS. CAMHS is a brilliant service if one gets into it. It is a bit like the health service. The waiting list is absolutely critical. We have waiting lists for up to 18 months. That is completely not the way to sort out the problem of a child with a mental health issue. There is also the variability across the regions and there was a dreadful incidence of other issues in the service last summer.  I like to think politics works and I was impressed by the way this committee heard from Dr. Paul Downes from the Dublin City University, DCU, Disadvantage Centre last year. He made a compelling case about the need to supplement the guidance counselling service in schools with emotional counselling and therapeutic supports to address the mental health issues manifesting among young people. I urge all Oireachtas Members to look at Dr. Downes's 2017 research on a sample of young men who are homeless in Dublin and the reasons for their homelessness and as someone who works for teachers and is very proud of our education system, how they fell through the gaps in the system at second level. It is truly sad but can be remediated and I urge committee members to look at that and at the recommendations he has in it. Mr. Duffy had made the point in respect of school leadership that we need more posts. Teacher training is essential and we have a further crisis in teacher training in that teachers are now not able to get a day out of school to go to necessary training because of the supply issue. When these crises are not addressed, they become much more complex to solve. Mr. Jones addressed a topic that is under-addressed when we talk about well-being and mental health, which is the whole area of teacher well-being. The 2015 guidelines for well-being in the junior cycle make the point that student well-being starts with staff. They are on the front line of the work and it is hard for them to be genuinely motivated to promote emotional and social well-being if they feel uncared for or burnt out themselves. Perhaps this is an area the committee may wish to look at into the future. We need to address the issue of well-being among our teaching workforce, including at third level. It is at a really serious level. Naturally I would have lots of other things to say but I will conclude on that. We did not get around to curriculum, which is a vital area for intervention for youth mental health but we are not just here to talk; we are here to listen and to respond to the committee.

Táimid an-bhuíoch as an deis caint leo. Is fíor go bhfuil géarchéim inár gcuid scoileanna ó thaobh an brú atá ar ár ndaoine óga. The mental health pressures faced by young people cannot be dealt with in schools alone. There is no question of that. The pressures they face come from all aspects of society and we could have a big discussion about whether it is the loosening of the binds of community, the pressure of exams and whatever perceived success is, all kinds of other things and social media. This is beyond the remit of the committee but the fact is our CAMHS system is so profoundly under-resourced and struggling so badly. To give an example that I think the speakers will be familiar with it but for anyone listening in who is not, I have come across instances where there are young people who are self-harming but are believed to have inadequate suicidality to be admitted to CAMHS. That is a person with a severe crisis who is very much at risk and cannot access CAMHS. That is the situation we have and it is important to put that on the record. There are challenges and pressures but we do have opportunities in schools. Every child should be attending school so there are opportunities there and a lot of good work happening.There are challenges and pressures that go with schools but we have an opportunity. Every child attends or should attend school so opportunities are available. A lot of good work is happening and is welcome. This is not a question. I agree with the point Ms Hughes made about the inequality that exists for educational psychologists. That needs to be addressed because a lot of labour by educational psychologists is not being adequately recognised or properly supported. I also agree with the point Mr. Honer made about SNAs not having the flexibility or opportunity to take additional days. My questions are primarily for the INTO and the ISSU. I will ask the INTO about the new programme which I welcome. Has there been any engagement directly with the INTO about how this will be rolled out and what it will look at or are we at the early stages? Dúirt Máirín rud éigin faoi féachaint arís ar conas mar a dheantear cur síos ar phobal sa comhthéacs seo. We talk about re-examining and redefining community in this context. What does Ms Ni Chéileachair mean by that? Will she flesh that out? I am conscious that dealing with mental health in schools is not only about crisis intervention and counselling. Is there any scope for early intervention or emotional well-being resources or do those perhaps exist? I am looking at the time and conscious I need to allow some for responses. Ms Foley is the person here representing those currently in the school system. There are already many excellent guidance counsellors. Will Ms Foley give the committee an insight into the experience of the members of the ISSU of how the guidance counselling system is working and perhaps where she feels it is not working? I ask Ms Leydon of the ASTI to expand on the point made as to why this is not being considered for the post-primary sector. Guidance counselling is available at post-primary level but that is perhaps a different animal from what is being talked about in this pilot. I will leave it at that. There is plenty to respond to in that. I ask the three witnesses to respond.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	12	There has not been any formal engagement with the INTO to date on the pilot programme. That is the short answer to that question. We look forward to it. I will flesh out an choncheap faoi phobal. When we engage with the special education section and others in the Department of Education and look for services to be co-located in schools we are told that Government policy is to provide services by the community, in the local health service or via GP practices. My experience as a primary school teacher and as a principal is that if we had something co-located in schools children who are at huge risk are more likely to engage. Most children come to school every day. Their parents bring them to school. It is valuable for an at-risk child and an at-risk parent to have somewhere they can come to do both and where the child does not have to be moved out of the building. There are models of good practice from the UK, Iceland and other countries where we have seen this working well. We would like to re-examine the concept of community. For many pupils community is the school. The school is at the centre of the community in many rural areas. Our official definition of community is too narrow in this context. The school should be central to that definition of community. There are certainly many programmes running in schools that are hugely beneficial. We are at an exciting stage of the development of a new curriculum at primary level and there will be opportunities under the wellbeing specification and a lot of good work will be done, but a therapeutic service cannot be replaced for a child who needs it. Teachers are not psychiatrists, psychologists, counsellors or therapists and while they can create, as I was told 40 years ago, an atmosphere of psychological safety in their classroom, they cannot recreate a therapeutic setting. They need support to do that.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	13	The provision of guidance counselling in schools varies, as my colleagues pointed out previously. Guidance counsellors have different working hours. Not every school has the same capacity for students to be able to talk to their guidance counsellors about their mental health because the role of guidance counsellors is primarily to offer students guidance they need and they simply do not have time. It is difficult to get an appointment with a guidance counsellor. I know that from my own experience as a student. That lack needs to be addressed.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	14	I do not see any logic to the Minister for Education not extending it to post-primary. It is almost a default mechanism to do a pilot. The problem is that our experience of pilots in this country is that they can last for 20 years. We are a bit cynical. I am sorry; it is never a healthy political attitude to have. We will call on the Minister to extend it. I referenced the prevalence of mental health difficulties. Adolescence is the prime time for these difficulties to manifest. If we are not in a space where adolescents can get early intervention and support, that is a failure to help because that is when they need it. They also need it later on, but getting in there now we have remediation, as distinct from dealing with a much more serious problem. We will be going formally to the Minister for Education and talking about the model and what the plans are for second level. Going back to Dr. Downes's work, the key points are not that radical. They are about the transition from primary to second level, the gaps that exist and the staff in schools being unable to deal with challenging behaviour. Therefore, there is a vicious cycle of suspensions and expulsion. They are also about students who have no self-belief or self-esteem and therefore are poor learners and failing. Many of these issues can be addressed with appropriate resources in schools. We come before the committee all the time and we say that we want more resources, but this is the nub of the problem. There is an under-investment in schools. Teachers are not mental health workers. We are not putting other professionals in place in the school setting to address the holistic needs of young people. I am paraphrasing what Ms Ni Chéileachair said.
#AodhanORiordan	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-party	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-dob	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	15	I thank all of the speakers for coming. I will make some comments before Ms Foley expands on some of the issues she raised. Much of what she said has resonated with many of us here. The Irish education system is almost uniquely set up to have mental health challenges within it. We separate children on the basis of religion and income and we separate them more than any other European country seems to. From my own experience, I know that children are coming to the school gate hungry and possibly having not slept the previous night or witnessed things that they probably should not as children and then facing the scenario of an oversized class with a teacher trying to balance all the needs of those children. We have one of the largest class sizes in Europe. It is coming down however and that should be acknowledged. It is a reality in the classroom. The SNA, as Mr. Honer rightly said, is under-appreciated in the system and is struggling for respect. There is an absolutely traumatic change at the most vital time, as Ms Leydon rightly said, in their formative years when going from the primary school setting to secondary school, with a complete change in the ethos and the exam-driven atmosphere. You are trying to tackle issues like homophobia or transphobia in a school. You have to worry about what the patron body has to say about those matters because we have a disproportionate number of schools under religious patronage. Ms Foley made a point about the new junior certificate being a welcome development. The resistance to that change was something the Department had to grapple with. When we speak about leaving certificate change, I hear resistance to that and a determination to go back to where we were. Within all of that we must pay tribute to teachers, SNAs and those working in schools who do their absolute best to mind the mental health of the students in front of them. There are gaps between what the HSE provides and what the Department of Education provides. Often, children fall between those gaps. I would like to focus on one thing with Ms Foley, namely, exams at second level because many issues have been raised. There is a focus on exams. The teacher has 40 minutes to deliver the programme and there can be pressure from parents about what the teacher is doing and how the targets are being met. Everything seems to come down to the junior certificate results and then, of course, the leaving results and the pressures associated with that.Can Ms Foley expand on that and maybe feed into what we all hope, certainly from my point of view, will be a changed leaving certificate and a changed system at second level that allows the space for a young person to be themselves and not to fit into this very rigid old exam that suits some people? Of course, one knows that people that it suits tend to make the rules when they move on from second level but those who it does not suit do not tend to make the rules. Can Ms Foley expand on that and use the opportunity the committee presents to tell us from her organisation's perspective how she feels the exam system impacts on mental health and how it could be changed?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	16	I thank Deputy Ó Ríordáin for his question. It is really important that I frame my response in light of the current situation of the leaving certificate. I sat my leaving certificate this summer and, as I am sure the committee is aware, all of us here have sat our exams. At the moment, due to the pandemic and the changes, it is more stressful than ever. Students, whether they are high or low achievers, are always stressed. Right now there are students around the country who scored maximum number of points and still did not get the places they wanted. They still did not get their first choice. Can one imagine the stress those students face? Can one imagine the stress a student faces when it comes to the Central Applications Office, CAO, and waiting for those results as well as for junior cycle students who until last week did not know when they would get their results? Exams will always be stressful but there is so much we can do to make them less stressful. It is really important that we do not just consider the students. It is also really important that when we are making these changes, we speak to the teachers too. In Ireland we have one of the best education systems in the world and it is not just because of what we are teaching students but because of the relationships that teachers and students have. Students and teachers and the pastoral care system mean that students can build a real connection with their teachers and vice versa. That is really important with mental health supports, that is, that students can trust their teachers and vice versa. Reform is important but it is really important that when we talk about reform, we talk to everybody to encourage positive change so we do not have to reform it again so drastically in 20 years' time.

I want to focus on two things. The first is the resources. It is important that every time witnesses come before us that they raise the importance of resources so that it gets into our reports. Nobody wants to hear that schools are not funded enough and that teachers do not get the kind of training they need. The second thing is training. There was a real call for further training for teachers from today's witnesses and the witnesses who came before the committee last week. That has come through loud and clear from all of the opening statements today. I have come from a National Women's Council briefing on education around relationship sexuality education, RSE, and healthcare. The call there was for further training and professionalisation for social, personal and health education, SPHE, teachers, for instance, in order to be able to deliver what is now quite complex. Society has become really complex and young people are dealing with that. As Fórsa pointed out in its opening statement, 40% of adults have mental health challenges and that starts out somewhere. That starts when people are really young. Do witnesses think it is about focused teacher training for some subjects like SPHE or do they think it needs to be across the board? As I said last week, teachers are sometimes a little like GPs. Everyone comes to teachers although they might not be the people qualified to deal with a particular issue. They are the conduit to send people in the right direction. Should mental health training be provided to all teachers? Second, I will focus on the lack of services for teachers to direct pupils to. It is all very well to understand that someone is experiencing a mental health crisis but everyone in this room will recognise if there is no one for teachers to refer pupils to, they will be left carrying the can because of the relationships they build with young people. I welcome any thoughts the witnesses might have on that.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	24	What I will say is similar to some extent to my answer to Deputy Ó Laoghaire's question earlier. The three main issues the Senator hit on are vitally important in the area. One is being able to access CAMHS and adult mental health services as we are also talking about tertiary education. Any comments I make of CAMHS, adult mental health, NEPS or any other service, is not the fault of the staff. They are simply dealing with waiting lists that are utterly unmanageable, but timely referrals are needed. Pastoral staff in both colleges and schools are vitally important as the Senator rightly referenced. We have many reports of guidance counsellors in schools doing a fantastic job often in difficult circumstances. My colleague from the ASTI mentioned that some schools do not have a whole-time-equivalent guidance counsellor. Many cases are referred to us of guidance counsellors holding on to students who have levels of need that the guidance counsellor knows she or he cannot manage. There is nowhere to refer the student to so it is the case that holding on is better than doing nothing. This is not a criticism of the staff in NEPS who do a fantastic job but they are swamped. NEPS staff members need to be on the ground with individual students. A trickle down model serves a purpose but it does not solve the problem. Third, as the Senator stated very well, training needs to be available to all teachers. There is a teacher supply crisis and releasing people for training will be difficult but it must be available to all teachers. Continuous professional development, CPD, is vital, but no matter how much CPD we do in this area, teachers will still not be psychiatrists or psychologists. In the past few days we encountered an issue about assessment of needs. No matter how much training teachers do, they will not be occupational therapists. Therefore we still need to be able to refer students to experts and as many services as possible need to be close to schools so students can be referred, but I must re-emphasise that services must be available in a timely manner. Telling students that the local service will help them in 18 months time is not ideal.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	25	At primary level we have a generalist rather than specialist model. I made the point the other day to someone that initial teacher education takes between four and six years depending on which model a student follows. Some people are in a classroom for 40 years after qualifying. We must provide our teachers with CPD. It should be available at all stages of their careers, kept up to date, based on best practice and on evidence-based models. I reiterate what Dr. Duffy said about needing specialist help. Schools and teachers cannot solve all of the ills of society. We must have services. The INTO ran a webinar recently with CAMHS about mental health services and resources that are freely and widely available, but almost nothing is available for children under 12 years old.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	26	I thank the Senator for her questions and for reading over the submission as well. First, the earlier the intervention, the better the outcome. The earlier that the intervention is made and the younger the child is, the better the outcome will be. I am here to represent my members who are special needs assistants, SNAs. Training needs to be provided for SNAs as well as for our teaching colleagues. It should be provided for all colleagues in the school setting. As I said in my presentation, this is not a criticism of Mental Health Ireland, but it is just a fact. If one goes on to Mental Health Ireland’s website to access the MindOut programme, there is a tab for teachers and a tab for youth workers, but there is no tab for SNAs. SNAs should be able to avail of the training if they want it. If they are armed with that skill set, they will be better equipped to deal with students in their times of crisis. I would agree with the Senator completely in terms of training. That needs to be provided to all colleagues in schools - not just teachers, but SNAs as well.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	27	Under Sharing the Vision, which is the new vision for mental health services, the implementation plan specifically makes that recommendation that all teachers will have access to training. This is actually in the plan. However, making the plan work is the challenge.
#EileenFlynn	unknown-#EileenFlynn-party	unknown-#EileenFlynn-dob	unknown-#EileenFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	28	Sharing the Vision is just this nightmare in my head at the minute. Anyway, moving on. It is always important for people who have experience, even as a politician or whatever, to draw on that experience and say that they know what they are speaking about. When I was just 11, I was in a very bad accident. I lost my mother a few days before that accident. There were no supports around counselling or trauma in school, which led on to some anxiety and depression that still exists today because it was not dealt with when I was a young person. Those supports are well needed for young people today. In one sense, we are moving as a society because of the teachers, the SNAs and the professionals that we have now within our education system, who see that we should not be taking part in shaming people with mental health and trauma issues. I know that in its investment for the budget, one of the INTO's recommendations was to invest in mental health. We are doing much talking around mental as a society, but we are doing very little action around young people and mental health. Again, we talk about some of the organisations. Some areas such as Ballyfermot, Crumlin, Inchicore and Cherry Orchard do not have the same level of mental health services as other more upper-class areas, if you want. I am aware that mental health does not have a class. However, there are different levels of pressure around people from, say, communities such as mine, namely, the Traveller community from Ballyfermot. One of my questions is directed at Fórsa and the INTO. Would it be fair to say that DEIS or disadvantaged schools would need more mental health services than non-disadvantaged schools? The SNAs are lifesavers to a certain extent in our schools. Sharing the Vision states that the training is there for teachers. For example, if there is a young child in a wheelchair in a school, he or she has an SNA. The SNA is the carer and educator. They take on so many roles, as well as the teacher. It is important that we include our SNAs in the training. There are so many different levels of training that are expected for our teachers, for example, training in Traveller culture, other cultures and mental health. SNAs are carrying out the job on very low wages as well. They did not go to school to be professional psychologists; they went to be educators. There is a difference. That was the one question about disadvantaged schools. I have a question around the barriers of being diagnosed with a mental disorder or any kind of disorder that young people would have in primary or secondary school.What kind of positive impact would a diagnosis at a younger age have on a young person's life? I am sick to the teeth of pilot programmes that do not work or even if they do work, do not get implemented. I know the witnesses have the answers but how do we implement those answers? It is not about reinventing the wheel. We are not geniuses saying this is what we need to do. The answers are already there. Obviously, money is a big part of it. How do we turn them into actions?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	29	I thank the Senator for her comments and her support for SNAs. As someone who went to a DEIS school - I am from Crumlin - it would be an established fact that there would be a significant increase in mental health issues in DEIS schools. That is an established fact. Recognition for SNAs as a professional grade is something Fórsa feels very strongly about and it has been campaigning on this for quite some time. In respect of the comparison in my presentation to a social worker where there would be reflective practice, this is something we have been campaigning on for quite some time. I thank the Senator for her comments and support for our members.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	30	The INTO has always supported extra funding for DEIS. If extra funding and resources were put into all schools, we feel it would correspondingly happen in DEIS also. I taught in a disadvantaged area so I realise the problems that are there. SNAs are our colleagues in schools. We work with the same children during the day every day. The partnership there is really strong. I would support Fórsa's call for the same access to CPD and training. It can only improve what is happening in our classrooms if we all operate as co-professionals in that space.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	31	I thank the Senator for her question. We need support inside and outside the education setting and we need CPD. In a quote from a European Commission report a few years ago, a lecturer stated that a student emailed them 11 days on one day because the student had nobody else to talk to. That is the day-to-day reality with which staff in education settings are dealing. They need support.
#RoseConwayWalsh	unknown-#RoseConwayWalsh-party	unknown-#RoseConwayWalsh-dob	unknown-#RoseConwayWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	32	I thank the witnesses for their presentations. We hear them time and time again. We cannot hear them often enough but very little happens in terms of implementation. It is frustrating from our point of view so it must be frustrating from the witnesses' point of view when they see so little movement yet they present all the solutions here today. We do not need enormous reports or pilot projects. Like everybody, I am tired of pilot projects. It is not just a case of me being tired of them, it is the money we waste when we do not use what we learn from the pilot projects. It is very frustrating when there is no in-built evaluation and streamlining of those projects. I have been involved in some of them around mental health, bullying and other topics and I think we need to think long and hard. I know it is an attractive proposition if somebody gets some money to do a pilot project but I wonder whether we are all colluding in keeping things where they are. Those were some of the ethical questions - even for myself - around working in community development. To what degree were we colluding in that system? My first question is directed to Ms Behan. Obviously, the solution is core funding. Core funding in third-level education has to be fixed. It also relates to what Mr. Jones was saying about staffing as well but without the core multi-annual funding, we are just not going to fix this problem. There is no skirting around it.While it might be politically expedient to announce one project or one pilot project after another and to get the headlines for a couple of days and then go off on our merry way, if we do not fix what is under the bonnet then we are not going to fix this at all. When Ms Hughes said that there was "standing room only" on the waiting list, how many of those people standing there could not wait or did not wait to get the supports and services they needed? We are dealing with people's lives here, as all of the witnesses know. Ms Hughes said the total funding for on-campus mental health supports was €5 million in 2020-21 and again in 2021-22; for the past three years, the mental health budget has stayed the same. However, €3 million is announced each year as additional funding. There are figures being played around with, which is nonsense. That needs to be called out. We are a cross-party committee. Mental health for young people is more serious than any political party on its own. We need to call it out, whether within our own parties or whatever to stop this from happening. While the ability to announce the funding each year as if it is new money is politically beneficial, how disruptive is it to providing a proper service on-campus when they cannot be planned properly and organisations do not have the resources on a year-on-year basis?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	33	I thank the Deputy for her question. It is exceedingly disruptive. The money that was provided last year for Covid-19-related additional supports went unspent in a number of colleges for one of two reasons. First, because it was one-time funding, only a year's contract could be offered. There is a dearth of people who can apply for these jobs and that is not an attractive job posting. It is hard to fill a position like that. On top of that, many campuses do not have space to ad hoc hire two or three more counsellors for a year and then have them go off again. That was a situation we were faced with last year. Regarding the campus I referred to where there was standing room only on the waiting list, the head of counselling there told me they have two sessional staff they do not know if they can keep on beyond the end of November. If that happens, they have five staff, I think, so that is almost half of their staff gone. That has an obvious knock-on impact not just on the number of students that can be seen but also on the roll-out of things like the national suicide prevention framework. It does not have a specific staff member allocated for the roll-out, so it falls onto staff like counselling staff, who have to juggle their session loads and the roll-out of multiple frameworks at this stage. To sum up-----

What impact are the challenges of student accommodation and the financial pressures having on mental health? Will Ms Hughes describe that?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	35	The college experience for many students is a melting pot for mental health issues. It is a pivotal time of life. There are a number of risk factors for every student. When financial pressures are added to students having to get perhaps multiple jobs or accommodation issues leading to students having to commute ridiculous amounts of time or register as homeless, which some students are, that places an untold amount of additional pressure on their mental health and on mental health services that are overstretched. We also see that students are reluctant to seek that help because they know the waiting lists are so bad. They say to themselves, "I was able to stand up out of my bed this morning so there is somebody worse off that needs that slot so I will not seek the help myself."

Gabhaim buíochas leo as ucht an méid atá ráite acu. I thank the witnesses for their submissions and presentations.I endorse various things I heard, including what Mr. Honer said about the important work and role of SNAs and the need to put more structure and recognition into their situation. I will especially mention what Ms Foley had to say about the stress caused by the leaving certificate examinations and I will speak about that in a moment. I also endorse what Ms Leydon said about pastoral supports and the role of guidance counsellors and what Ms Ní Chéíleachair said, which was also a point made in the INTO submission, about family and marriage breakdown. That is an issue that needs to be talked about. There is a crisis in that area and in our society, which lies behind much of what we are talking about today. We do not speak about it often. I will begin, however, with the issue that worries me most, namely, the Maynooth University study that states that 40% of Irish adults have a mental health disorder. If we really believe that, I wonder if any amount of resources can deal with the problems we face because that would be indicative of a society in a state of breakdown. We advert to these statistics, as we should, because they are published by researchers. We need to interrogate that figure and what it means for our society. I read up a little on it and it states that insomnia is one of the main issues. How long can a society continue to function if 40% of people have mental health challenges? I mentioned to the group who attended the committee meeting last week that while I support and endorse the various calls for resources, I ask people to focus on whether changes to the system can help. I would be grateful to hear the witnesses' views on whether, given the shortage of experienced staff in the system, including in psychology, speech and language therapy and medicine, the shortage of people available to work in Ireland will bedevil the entire effort no matter what resources are in place. Would the witnesses support a policy that reserved 50% or 60% of college places in the areas of psychology, pharmacy, speech and language therapy, medicine, etc., for people who are ready to work in Ireland for a defined period? That is the kind of serious measure that is needed. Is that something that is under discussion? Is it on people's radar?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	37	I can speak from the perspective of a psychology graduate. When we consider clinical psychology in particular - because that is the one being funded - there is a bottleneck. Many undergraduate psychologists would love to go on to study for specialist qualifications but the places are not available due largely to funding issues. Although clinical psychology training is funded, only a small number of spaces - I believe there are approximately 36 in the country - is available. It was even harder for undergraduates to access those courses that were not funded until the recent budget as they had to self-fund. I know the Psychological Society of Ireland feels the same way. Many undergraduate psychology students have to move on to different career paths because they cannot access specialist training. The solution is less about reserving spaces and more about increasing spaces.

That might apply in that area, but perhaps the question remains valid for other areas or even in that area to some degree.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	39	I am not sure whether I understand the policy the Senator is proposing but certainly my instinctive or political reaction is that many graduates are leaving Ireland because of the socioeconomic situation. Graduates tend to be young people. They cannot get homes. We have a crisis of supply and affordability and therefore emigration is exerting a pull. Over the generational cycle we see it operating in a defined sense. There has been discussion in the media recently about the number of health graduates emigrating. It is a complex issue. We need to know more about why they are emigrating. Why are conditions in our health service seen as so unattractive that they lead people to decide to emigrate? We have not given sufficient support to the national plan for equity of access to higher education which is now in its second iteration.We tend to base our projections for entering into higher education on school leavers but as a society, particularly for the human sciences like the therapies, health, social services etc., we need to see how we can encourage more workers who have experiential knowledge of problems in real-life settings to go into further learning, particularly at higher education level. It is very expensive, particularly if you are not earning and have a family to raise. While I would perceive there being a problem out there, we need to see what are the pull factors, including those of other economies and jobs, and what we can do as a society to make sure we get more people into these jobs. The Minister, Deputy Harris, made a successful pitch recently - he said we should stop looking at school leavers going into third-level education as a solution to all of the skills problems in this country. We need to start thinking about other post-school destinations in order that people have a spectrum of skills and life experiences and can then, if they wish and have sufficient financial security to do so, move on to third level. That is my trade union reaction to the question.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	40	I thank the Chair and the Senator. I will be brief. The Irish Federation of University Teachers does not have this discussion about reserving places for particular professions or restricting access to particular courses. We would like more courses, places and employment and better conditions of employment. This would cause a difficulty. Our view on universities and university education is that it is not a development ground for particular professions or employment; it is much wider than that, as the Senator knows. While we do not discuss the suggestion of particular courses geared directly towards employment with restrictions then on progressing or advancing or on leaving the country or that sector, we would not be in favour of such a proposal.

It is important to recognise that society has been imposing extra responsibilities on teachers and educators over the past 20 to 30 years. I acknowledge that although the witnesses recognise they have an important role in identifying mental health challenges children and young people face, they emphasise they are not qualified medically to respond to that appropriately or in the way the student requires. I commend them on appreciating that mental health issues can arise and generally do, as Ms Leydon said, in people who are adolescents. It is an unusual illness in a way. Most of the time, illnesses are encountered later in life, but with mental health, it appears that many young people encounter it in their adolescence. I commend the witnesses on appreciating and acknowledging that they have a role to play, albeit not a clinical one. Mr. Honer referred to the MindOut programme operated in Galway in his submission. I want to look at this because it appears to be a preventative mechanism, as opposed to treating people who have a mental health issue; this is a process of trying to make them more resilient. How does it operate? Does Mr. Honer think it is something that should be recommended more broadly?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	42	It is something that should be recommended more. I thank the Deputy for his comments. The programme arms staff with the skills necessary to identify issues as they arise.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	48	Most students have good mental health literacy overall when they get to third level. We did a pilot project with Jigsaw the year before last which indicated that but the transition to third level adds extra things young people have to cope with and often they are doing so for the first time without family or parental support. Many have moved across the country or from a different country and might need to adopt new coping mechanisms.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	50	There is no particular appropriate age. It should start as early as possible and continue throughout the education cycle.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	52	I thank the Deputy for his question. Resilience is very important. When we consider the factors that contribute to mental health difficulties for students, it is interesting to look at students with enduring mental health. By that I mean students who have not encountered a mental health difficulty. There are many factors at play. When we look at schools, we should consider them not only in an educational context but also in the context of other experiences of schools, which can lead to students being more resilient in their mental health. Factors such as sport, being on the student council and the friends a pupil makes at school are all part of the support circle that will build resilience. That is important because we cannot focus on trying to stop students developing mental health difficulties without trying to actively address the cause. That is crucial if we want students to have positive experiences in life and not develop severe mental health difficulties.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	54	There is no minimum age at which we can start to build positive mental health. One of our issues, and Ms Foley referred to it, is that only one post-primary school in five is delivering an SPHE curriculum. In primary school, we have 30 minutes per week dedicated to SPHE. That will change in our new curriculum framework. We can certainly build on skills and give skills to the children and pupils in all our classrooms. We can probably save people from waiting lists they do not need to be on by using other interventions but that still does not get away from the fact that services do not exist for people who have a mental health difficulty which cannot be coped with in the normal circumstance of life.

I welcome that we have been able to bring so many of the representative groups and unions to speak to the committee about mental health. A number of the members of this committee also sit on the education committee and like me, on the mental health committee, which is a brand-new sub-committee of the health committee. We see many concerns being raised, especially during the two years of lockdowns during the Covid-19 pandemic. I have a few questions which I will pose and hopefully allow some time for a short response. I agree with a point mentioned by the witnesses in their submissions that the transition phase is crucial, especially going into first class, first year and from secondary school to third level. I agree that transition period is a huge issue and note that Ms Leydon of the ASTI also mentioned it. I have a few questions about the summer programme. It is about the investment we are now seeing coming from the budget into education. Some €9.6 billion is going to education with almost €2.6 billion going to special education. We will have almost 40,000 new staff, that is almost 20,000 SNAs and almost 20,000 special education teachers coming into the system. Mr. Honer is representing SNAs at the committee. I want to see the courses that UCD is rolling out being rolled out around the country. We will tackle getting 20,000 people their well-deserved qualifications. That has to happen. The Minister is aligned with how we see that being rolled out. As I represent the Roscommon-Galway area, I want to see much of it in the west.I refer to the number of people who are coming into the school system and how that has been managed as a teaching staff. There is a cohort of teaching staff working with the special education teachers, including the mainstream teacher in the classroom and the SNA support. I would like to see it being more streamlined and I see that in schools I deal with in my area on that level. Does Mr. Honer have any more comments on that? I might ask our guests from the ASTI and the INTO some questions about the summer programme. We have just announced funding on that and we are seeing one quarter of schools taking part. I have contacted schools in my area and I have good feedback from a number of principals about the impact of those two weeks, particularly for those schools. Are there any other challenges? We have a budget and we have this extra capacity coming to schools. They have also opened up the possibility that student teachers and different cohorts could be involved. Will we see anything with schools coming on board this year? It would be great to see a real increase in that. Are there any other challenges in that which we need to be conscious of? That bringing students in over the summer period helps with the transition piece. The funding models, pilot programmes and so on are crucial because most initiatives we see come from pilots. The initiatives we have seen at third level came from pilot programmes. We are seeing technological universities being rolled out, which has been amazing in delivering excellence to the regions. We have spoken about mental health supports here but we have to look at how we deliver health in a different way. Much of this is now coming through telehealth and is being accessed in a virtual way for early intervention. We need to look at changing how we deliver healthcare at an early stage sometimes. I would be interested to hear comments on that as well, because the 50808 text number is a 24-7 one that is crucial for anyone going through anxiety or any type of stress. The changes we see in the roll-out of the leaving certificate programme are something else we have been fighting for. It should not all be pinned on one exam and that does not deliver for all students and for all capacities and capabilities. We have the action plan on bullying and this committee did a report on that, which was one of our first reports. The Minister for Education has taken on board a number of elements of that. There has also been €5 million rolled out for that for primary schools. There has been an increase in NEPS with about 54 more psychologists coming on board in that. My questions begin with the summer programme, particularly the transition and how we increase the number of schools taking on that programme this year when we have the funding available for it. I also invite comments on the engagement with CAMHS and community teams that has been mentioned. How do we set up a structure where the secondary school system can engage with our new disability teams in the community space, particularly in the community healthcare organisations, CHOs? On the counselling supports and the action plan on bullying, each school has an ethos and parents sometimes have to look at what the ethos of each school is. In the inspector's annual report, reference is being made to how bullying is being managed in each school. With this new recommendation from the action plan, we will hopefully see this. What are the witnesses’ comments on that? How will schools engage in that action plan on bullying and how will they manage it? These are the matters I see as being of interest. I might start with the transition and I invite Ms Leydon to speak on that from ASTI's point of view. Mr. Honer might come in on the SNAs.

There are a number of schools and we are seeing that one in four schools that access supports are DEIS schools. They are not just accessing supports for numeracy and literacy but for supports: to engage with this transition period; in well-being; in communication; in isolation; and in all the challenges we have seen over the two years of lockdown that we have all spoken about today. Therefore, why do secondary schools not want to take on the summer programme?

The successful delivery of the examinations annually depends on a broad coalition which includes school managers and leaders; teachers, including retired teachers, who are fulfilling critical roles; and the education stakeholders. The SEC recently announced Wednesday, 23 November as junior cycle results day. We acknowledge that candidates and their families may be disappointed that the date is later than might have been expected. We hope to provide the committee with details of what is behind the delay in issuing results and of the efforts made, in collaboration with stakeholders, to address the most significant issue, which is a shortage of teachers to mark the examinations. This meant that marking in all subjects was not completed during the normal summer marking window. The results of the leaving certificate issued on 2 September, with the appeals issued five weeks later on 4 October. The deferred leaving certificate ran until 16 July for candidates who missed their examinations due to bereavement, serious illness or Covid-19. Additional time was also needed to give effect to the commitment that the results on aggregate would be no lower than in 2021, which was achieved through a post-marking adjustment. The later leaving certificate results issue date has had an impact on the junior cycle timeline. Changes to the leaving certificate appeals timeline in 2019 saw an October date for the junior cycle results for the first time, by agreement of all of the stakeholders. This year, if the marking had been completed, the junior cycle results would have been due to issue to candidates at the end of October. Turning to the issue of examiner supply, pre-pandemic, the SEC had been experiencing significant difficulties in attracting, recruiting and retaining sufficient numbers of teachers to undertake this vital work. Up to and including 2019, it was necessary to put in place a range of remedial measures to complete the marking within expected timeframes. The challenges we are faced with are evident from the statistics; the SEC traditionally recruited 4,000 examiners to mark the written examinations. This year, fewer than 3,000 examiners marked the work of 130,000 candidates. Allied to demographic increases, candidate numbers are 12% more than they were ten years ago. The number of examiners involved in marking the examinations is almost 19% lower than it was ten years ago. Junior cycle candidate numbers have increased by 5% since 2019, while the number of examiners has decreased by 30% this year. With the support of stakeholders, the SEC has made repeated and extensive efforts to recruit examiners in sufficient numbers for the 2022 examinations. These efforts included online advertising and marketing to teachers and schools including in teacher union publications; appeals to principals to take on a leadership role in encouraging and supporting this work; appeals to subject associations and support services such as the professional development service for teachers, PDST, and junior cycle for teachers, JCT and thousands of direct telephone calls and emails to teachers who had examined previously. Significant increases to payment rates were approved in recognition of the co-operation, flexibility and support needed. Leaving certificate rates increased by between 17% and 50% per script, while junior cycle rates increased by between 48% and 57% per script marked. A recruitment campaign called "Earn, learn and understand" highlighted the many professional and financial benefits of this work. Despite these efforts, the numbers fell short and a range of interventions was needed to complete the marking of most subjects during the summer, which included marking well beyond the normal marking window and examiners agreeing to take on additional scripts. These measures, while necessary, put pressure on the examining teams and contribute to a poor examiner experience and impact retention. Unfortunately, it was not possible to complete the marking in all subjects. Further contingency arrangements have been made to ensure that the marking will be completed in the coming weeks. Unlike in the summer marking period, most of the teachers now marking are in schools during the day and only available at evenings and weekends. The commission has an absolute responsibility to examination candidates to ensure that their work is marked to the highest standards of quality and integrity. Over the past three years, due to the circumstances created by the pandemic, delivery of the State examinations has been extremely challenging with many changes required to ensure delivery of the service. The ending of Covid-19 restrictions and the return to examinations as normal have exacerbated an issue which existed before the pandemic, one which challenges the management and completion of the marking and the ability of the SEC to issue the results. The SEC is extremely grateful for the co-operation it receives from thousands of teachers each year to undertake critical work in the State examinations, noting that this is voluntary, subsidiary employment which teachers undertake during their school holidays.Recruitment and retention of teachers as examiners is not only a whole of organisation issue for the SEC, it is a major and urgent whole of system issue at second level. Addressing the issue requires regular engagement with key stakeholders and the active support and involvement of all the players, especially school management and teachers' unions, as well as the continued support of the Department of Education which has already provided improved examiner rates. The SEC will be reviewing with stakeholders how best to ensure the availability of teachers in the required numbers to engage in this critical work in the future. Our objective is to substantially increase the number of teachers involved so that the experience is a positive one which greatly enhances teacher professional competence as well as earning power. On a positive note, the rate increases which were introduced on a once-off basis in 2022 have now been assured for 2023 with the assignment of an additional €11 million on budget day to maintain these increased examiners' pay rates. My colleagues and I are happy to respond to any questions the committee may have.

The other members might want to read the statement while I am asking questions. As a result of the situation, can Ms Feeney repeat some details? I think she said it was the pressure of the number of papers and so on that caused a negative experience. Did I understand that correctly? What did she ascribe the negative experience to?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	83	The fact fewer teachers are involved in marking the work than are actually necessary to complete the work in the time allowed. That means we ask the examiners we do have to take on more scripts to mark. They have to agree to take on those scripts but we ask them to take on more scripts to mark than might have been the case up to a number of years ago.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	85	Our vision for the future is that we would have more teachers involved and that they would be able to complete the work in the normal marking timeframe without the intense pressure to get scripts marked because of the sheer numbers.
#DonnchadhOLaoghaire	unknown-#DonnchadhOLaoghaire-party	unknown-#DonnchadhOLaoghaire-dob	unknown-#DonnchadhOLaoghaire-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	86	Unfortunately it is a bit of a chicken and egg situation, similar to how one might attract nurses into a healthcare system that is on the point of collapse. Their experience of it is bad. More nurses are needed to improve it and, somewhat like that, we have a circular situation here as far as I can see. While it is welcome that we have a date now for the junior cycle results, the delay is unfortunate. Stress and anxiety are involved for all students. There are material considerations for two categories of student that occur to me - those who are starting fifth year and are trying to make decisions about what subjects to take and what level they will study them at; and those who are leaving school to do apprenticeships. Will Ms Feeney comment on the latter case, including whether the SEC has direct engagement with students in that situation about how their qualifications are being credited? I appreciate the SEC cannot do the miracle of the loaves and fishes and only so many people are available. It is unfortunate. Clearly we need to make this more attractive as it is obviously not attractive enough. Ms Feeney mentioned increased rates of pay. Has the SEC directly engaged with the two teachers' unions to examine whether any additional measures could be considered? For example, will the public pay deal have an impact on it if that is approved?Are there other things such as additional leave or other incentives? I have a further question but will Ms Feeney respond to that much first?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	87	On the junior cycle results and the adult learners and early school leavers who might need these results for onward employment or apprenticeships, which was the first part of Deputy Ó Laoghaire's question, he will recall in 2020 and 2021 the junior cycle examinations did not run as normal. Later examinations were held for adult learners and early school leavers. They were held in November with the results issuing in February. Arrangements were made through SOLAS in order that those students could progress in the absence of their results. We have been in contact with SOLAS to see if a similar arrangement can be put in place for this year. That is a work in progress at the moment. In regard to further engagement with both teacher unions, yes the examinations over the past number of years build on a strong relationship that the SEC had with stakeholders including the teacher unions and the school management representative bodies. We have engaged through the advisory group on examinations planning and in bilateral meetings with the stakeholders just before Covid-19 and during Covid-19 and on these particular issues over the past year. We have had much support from the teacher unions in terms of encouraging and supporting the campaigns that the SEC has put in place such as advertising in the teacher union magazines and directly reaching out to branch representatives on behalf of the State examinations system to try and increase the numbers getting involved. In regard to the other measures that need to be put in place, the rates are quite significantly enhanced this year. That has had an impact. There are other factors in play. It has recently been announced that there will be a comprehensive review of the factors underpinning issues with supply of teachers to undertake these critical roles with the State examinations. We need to look at all of the factors in collaboration not only with the stakeholders but also in direct engagement with teachers to ask them what are the disincentives, what might assist them in making the decision to undertake this vital work with the SEC.

The challenges could continue if generally speaking we have something of a challenge in the next few years in regard to ensuring that the leaving certificate has adequate integrity which I believe it has. That could continue while we ensure that forthcoming cohorts doing the leaving certificate are not disadvantaged compared with the others. I have spoken to people in secondary schools and they talk about, to use that dreadful phrase, "a soft landing", in regard to the adjustments that might have to be made. Can Ms Feeney give an account in that regard? Will the complications with regard to how long it takes to deliver the results continue if the State examination continually needs to incrementally adjust the curve? Is that something that we can anticipate? Is the intention to incrementally adjust the curve to what it was heretofore?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	89	The results of the leaving certificate over the past three years have been substantially different from what would have been the case up to 2019 because in 2020 we had calculated grades and in 2021 we had the combination of accredited grades and examinations. We had a return to examinations this year but with a post-marking adjustment in order to ensure that the results on the aggregate were no lower than they were in 2021. What the Minister has said in regard to 2023 is that there will be no cliff-edge in terms of a return to previous years. We take from that there will be some form of an incremental change but the final decisions on the shape of what 2023 will look like have not been taken at this point in time.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	91	Without saying whether there will be a delay there is a reality that if there is a post-marking adjustment of any description it requires additional time after the marking. This year while we were able to do a significant amount of initial exploration and analysis of how we would impact on the grade profile in 2022 the final decisions could not be taken until all of the marking was done because we needed the real data coming through from the marking process in order to evaluate what had come through from the marking and what adjustment was necessary at that point in time. There is no doubt that time is needed after that process. There may be things we can look at in terms of processes for future years.If there is to be an intervention subsequent to marking, it presupposes that all the marking is finished before that adjustment can happen.

I understand, I hope, that it is going to be rectified. I thank Ms Feeney, Mr. Dolan and Ms Sheridan who are before the committee today from the SEC.

#AislingDolan	unknown-#AislingDolan-party	unknown-#AislingDolan-dob	unknown-#AislingDolan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	98	It has been challenging for the last year or two. The SEC came with the figures around the increase in the number of students and the decrease in the number of examiners. Each year that there is a decrease in examiners, the experience of the examiners gets only more difficult, making it more challenging year-on-year to get new examiners in. Where I come from, there was a leaving certificate student who, due to the timing of the leaving certificate results, was not able to access a place in a UK university. The Minister, Deputy Harris, has been working with the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service, UCAS, on some of those issues. That is a huge challenge in general for students accessing places. That student has now taken a year out and will, I hope, be able to apply and be eligible - because they are eligible - for a place in that university. That was due to the timelines we have here. That is an issue. The SEC has multiple steps and is looking at incentives. What are the qualifications for examiners? What are the qualifications for an examiner for junior certificate, leaving certificate, applied and mainstream programmes? What is the future? If we are dealing with more students and getting fewer examiners, what is the role of digitalisation within the State Examinations Commission? What is the SEC looking at in terms of automating some processes? How is the SEC looking at it for students in terms of doing their exams? Is there a way to streamline? Has a budget been allocated? We have seen the largest budget ever in education, some €9.6 billion. How much of that goes to the State Examinations Commission? Will the witnesses tell the committee what budget has been allocated? How much has been allocated for future development and digital strategies to support how we are going to manage this in the future? If the SEC is having challenges and we cannot open up the pool of teachers to do the examination process, how are we going to streamline and accelerate digitalisation to support the elements which can be digitalised? I understand there are elements that cannot be. Surely, there is a way to streamline processes to support the capacity challenges we have at the moment, using technology to support that.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	99	I thank the Senator for her questions. In a moment, I will ask my colleague Ms Sheridan, our head of examinations and assessment division, to deal with the teacher qualifications and questions on the examiner supply. Our budget and allocation for 2022 is €77.395 million. In a normal year, we would collect an additional €10 million in fees, but there are no fees for the examinations this year. On technology and what we have done, the figures we shared are quite stark as regards the increase in candidates and the more than matching decrease in the number of examiners. We have invested in digitisation of the examinations over the last number of years. Some 410,000 results were issued this year at leaving certificate level. Of those, 389,000 were either fully or partially marked using our online marking system. There is no doubt that the online marking system and that transition to online marking has assisted us in managing the challenge of a decreased examiner supply. It makes the experience of examining much more straightforward and streamlined for the teachers involved. That is one aspect of digitisation. We made continuous improvements across all of our services in the last number of years with greater use of our candidate self-service portal. We also have a school portal for the transaction of electronic and digital course work from schools to the SEC. All of those things have greatly enhanced our capacity and efficiency as an organisation. Given what we as an organisation have been asked to do over the past number of years with the considerable changes each year since 2019 due to the pandemic, we have responded in an agile fashion to meet those challenges. On what the future will hold in relation to senior cycle reform, there is a mandate within the senior cycle reform announcement to look at opportunities for digital assessment.We already have an element of digital assessment in computer science, digital course work as I mentioned, and computer-aided design that is used for design and communications graphics coursework. It is not that there is nothing, but certainly more work can be done. We have had some engagement with international jurisdictions as to what they do and how they manage the challenge of e-assessment. Do we see a time when all students will sit down in June and do their examinations online? We are somewhat away from that, but certainly as part of the research that is needed into senior cycle reform, we can envisage some changes into the future. I ask my colleague Ms Sheridan to deal with the question on teacher qualifications.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	100	Examiners are appointed on the basis of the information they provide on their application forms. Generally, a degree or qualification in the specific subject and a qualification in education are the minimum requirements, but on top of that we also look at whether they have relevant experience of teaching the subject or a related discipline or teaching that subject in another jurisdiction. We publish our criteria for the appointment of examiners on our website. It is transparent and open. All of those details are set out on the website. It depends on the nature of the subject. If a new specification or subject is introduced at leaving certificate level or in the junior cycle, we may not have a specific qualification in that subject but we look at and review the application in the context of what other relevant information is provided. The key issue, as Ms Feeney mentioned earlier, is that we were prioritising the leaving certificate examinations this year. They are the appointments we make first. We take all our application forms and fill our teams at leaving certificate level first. We then work to fill our junior cycle teams and assign our most experienced examiners to mark the leaving certificate examinations.

How will the SEC increase capacity? Where else can we look to bring in people with relevant qualifications who can do this job?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	102	We are working through that with the various stakeholders. We are liaising with third level, postgraduate teacher qualification courses. We have links with various concurrent degrees, for example, so recently qualified teachers are a pool we can tap into.
#AislingDolan	unknown-#AislingDolan-party	unknown-#AislingDolan-dob	unknown-#AislingDolan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	103	Is it layered? The SEC looks at the application. The paper comes in. Is there any assistant examiner position? I would love to know, perhaps not now but another time, how that online marking system works. Where is the digitisation coming in for a junior certificate paper from beginning to end? What is the roll-out of that? Is there an assistant person who could look at the papers initially and then a senior examiner with a different set of qualifications who could look at them? Is there such a role? Can anything be done to speed this up?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	104	The move to online marking in terms of digitisation of our marking system has been significant in delivering results in a timely fashion, as much as we can with the examiners we have and delivering a high quality. The benefit of online marking is its instant nature. In respect of what the Senator is describing, we can provide more immediate and direct support to new and inexperienced examiners through the online marking system. We are not waiting for hard copy material to move in the post. That is where it will become a much more positive experience for examiners who come in. It is having a positive impact on retention. We are rolling it out on a phased basis. The reporting on the examiner experience since our proof of concept and our pilot in 2017 has been phenomenal. It has all been positive.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	106	There is a step change in the numbers this year. We need to be conscious of the impact the Covid-19 pandemic has had and of a pent-up demand in the summer of 2022, when teachers could go on holidays for the first time since 2019 and made the choice to do so. That context needs to be borne in mind, but there are things we need to do. The other thing we have going into 2023 is certainty from the initial part of the recruitment process about the rates of payment. A decision was taken in budget 2023 about the money that will be provided and be available next year which empowers us from the beginning to be able to advertise the pay side of the equation. The other side of the equation is the experience and what it brings to a teacher. We highlight to teachers the professional benefits of engaging in work with or marking the State examinations for their knowledge of their subject.It is also useful in terms of what they can bring back to the classroom in terms of their professional practice.

I am very concerned about students who are going directly into the leaving certificate cycle without knowing what their results are, which has an impact in terms of choices. As has been said, we obviously have an ongoing issue in terms of late results, which reduces students' ability to take up opportunities across the island and in Britain. This is not something that has just happened. It is something that has been there all of the time. What efforts have been made to bridge that gap so people have their results on time, and how come other countries can do it and we cannot?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	109	I think the example Senator Dolan gave was in relation to a particular student, but generally the timeline for the release of the results this year tied in to the UCAS process. My understanding is the UCAS cut-off was 7 September. The date of issue of the leaving certificate results was 2 September. There were some individual cases highlighted to the Department. I know colleagues in the Department of Education and the Department for further and higher education engaged with their counterparts in the UK to ensure students could take up those places.

What efforts have been made in recent years to have the results provided in a more timely manner, or are we always stuck with 15 August or around that time in terms of leaving certificate results?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	111	It would be nice to get back to 15 August from my perspective, given where we have come from.

Are the witnesses looking at any way the results can be brought forward so we do not have to wait until after others have released their results?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	113	Looking at other jurisdictions and how quickly results are available, there is an element of comparing apples and oranges. They do things differently in those jurisdictions. I know the comparison is usually made with France, where results usually issue in July, but a lot of the examinations on which those results are based are held in March. A very small number are held in June, but most of them are held in March, in springtime, so things are done differently. Within those jurisdictions, particularly France, marking examinations is part of the teaching contract. It is something examiners as teachers do, not every year, but they rotate and have an obligation to do it every three years. It is done differently, so I think we need to look long term at our processes. If I think back to 2019, which was the last time results issued in the middle of August, it is an extremely tight timeline, even at that. Getting results out from the end of June, when the examinations finish, to the middle of August was exceptionally challenging, even up to 2019.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	115	I do not know about earlier than normal, but certainly to a normal timeline would help. However, we need to think about what happened this year. There was a deferred series of examinations and all of us agreed it was a very positive move for candidates to have a further opportunity to sit an examination if they missed that because of bereavement or serious illness, and this year because of Covid. That has a consequence. Those examinations did not finish until 16 July.

When did the Department start recruiting for examiners last year?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	117	We started recruiting for examiners in January and February 2022. In a normal year that would have started in early January instead.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	119	We have already started our recruitment for 2023. The 2023 examinations have already started. We are holding our first marking conference next week. Home economics examiners are going to be marking at leaving certificate, and their conference is next week.We have also started the recruitment of our practical, task and oral examiners for the leaving certificate applied. We will be advertising shortly for the recruitment of our oral and practical examiners, and from then we will move into our examiners and our superintendents. That process is under way.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	121	With respect, there is a bigger system issue that needs to looked at in terms of solving the problem. It is not a problem that I or my colleagues can actually solve. As the State Examinations Commission, we need the assistance and the co-operation of all of the stakeholders acting in concert to encourage teachers to undertake this work. It is very strong to have the increased rates we have, but the numbers are not there. There is a whole-of-system issue. It is not a simple operational or logistical challenge that the SEC can solve, unfortunately.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	123	Again, there is this whole-of-system effort that is required to address this issue. There is an SEC role and we need to lead out on that. We will be undertaking a review, along with stakeholders in the education system, to review all of the issues that are behind this challenge to address it for future years.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	125	While it is not a measurement in terms of a formal review or measurement, my colleague Ms Sheridan has mentioned the feedback we have had from the examiners. For some examiners currently marking on paper, they have a very different experience. They are dealing with physical scripts. They have a lot of physical administration and paperwork to do. That is not there and we would love the opportunity, if Senator Dolan is interested, to show what the online marking system looks like from cradle to grave, essentially, from when we receive a script to a result issuing at the end. It is a very different and a much better experience for the examiners involved.
#RoseConwayWalsh	unknown-#RoseConwayWalsh-party	unknown-#RoseConwayWalsh-dob	unknown-#RoseConwayWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	126	That is the future. Maybe that will address some of the other problems I was talking about. It has been identified as an issue right across the third level sector in terms of the accessibility of opportunities across the island. I would very much like if that could be looked at as well.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	127	We will certainly take that on board.

I corrected for the SEC for two or three years back in the day when I was a newly qualified teacher, when I was enthusiastic and thought of all the advantages it would give to me, going onto my CV as I searched for that elusive history and geography job. There lies the problem. Many younger teachers in particular probably see it, or did see it, in terms of the advantages of it and why they might have to do it. The teacher shortages we have mean fewer people are inclined to think they have to serve their time doing this in order that schools might take them more seriously or see they have experience built up in this area. That is reflective of the general teacher shortages we have across the board in various subjects. In what subjects in particular are we experiencing a significant shortfall? Is it typically the sciences, home economics or the usual suspects? Do the witnesses have any numbers on this? 
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	129	We do not have numbers but, across subjects, the supply shortages are reflective of where there are pinch points. Home economics and the marking of the practical examinations have been challenging for a number of years, particularly at junior cycle. The subjects in which marking is ongoing at the moment at junior cycle are not those subjects. We have marking happening currently in English and in religious education. They are the two subjects that are continuing to be marked and there are small amounts being marked in others as well. The challenge has been trying to manage the resources and the numbers we have and assigning the work in order that we can get it completed within the timeline. I am delighted to hear the Deputy corrected for us previously in the subjects of history and geography, which are Ms Sheridan's background, and found it to be very positive work. We would like to reflect those benefits to teachers, get them in from an early stage in their career and retain them in the work. Their work is vital to us and to their students. In terms of making a contribution to society and the education system as a whole, it is vital work that is done by thousands of teachers each year.

That is to be welcomed, but my experience was that half of your money was going on tax while you lost the majority of your holidays. That was the disincentive. It was not all rosy either. Is it the case that certain subjects are holding up the production or release of the entirety of the junior certificate results? Was any consideration given to early release of results if, for example, four or ten subjects were ready to go?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	131	The junior cycle results are a consolidated set of results. They are not just the results of the examinations but are tied in with the classroom-based assessments. Under the reform measures introduced a number of years ago, the junior cycle is a consolidated assessment process. It does not just depend on those terminal examinations but also on classroom-based assessment. It would not be fair on the students or the system to have a phased release of examination results. With regard to the money and what is lost in tax, we unfortunately do not have any control over that. There is an issue with regard to the holidays. We have seen the impact of teachers wanting to go on holidays this year. We would like to find a balance in respect of the amount of time required of individuals in correcting to ensure an equilibrium between the time, money and effort required to fulfil roles with the State Examinations Commissions and people feeling they still have time for a holiday at the end of the process.
#PadraigOSullivan	unknown-#PadraigOSullivan-party	unknown-#PadraigOSullivan-dob	unknown-#PadraigOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	132	To go back to my own experience, I remember I had cleared my desk and had done all of my examinations when I was landed with another 200 or 300. Does Ms Feeney have any figures on the number of examiners who are in that situation as it is now almost inevitable that people will get additional scripts?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	133	The numbers we have shared this morning probably demonstrate that is the case in a lot of subjects. I do not believe that applies to all subjects but I will ask Ms Sheridan to comment on that.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	134	We do not have that situation in all subjects but, because of the increase in the candidature and the reduction in the number of examiners, there have, as Ms Feeney referred to in her opening statement, been situations in which the marking window has had to be lengthened. However, we generally have the co-operation of the examiners in that. We also put contingency measures in place. This is the cycle. Deputy Ó Laoghaire mentioned the cyclical nature of this. We need to break that cycle so that we are not taking for granted the goodwill of examiners, such as Deputy O'Sullivan himself, who mark what is called the "full bunk" and are then asked to take on some more. We need to look at possible opportunities. The Deputy mentioned that, like me, he marked to help in his teaching but also to help get an appointment in a school. What we now need to look at is curricular reform. That is where we are at the minute. We need teachers to see the new junior cycle subjects and the senior cycle redevelopment that is coming along as being of benefit to them and that engaging in the marking process provides a whole-system benefit to their teaching and learning, to their students and to the State Examinations Commissions more broadly
#PadraigOSullivan	unknown-#PadraigOSullivan-party	unknown-#PadraigOSullivan-dob	unknown-#PadraigOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	135	When the State Examinations Commission sends out communiqués and advertises for examiners, it will obviously do so in the newspapers and online and so on. However, how does it specifically communicate to teachers? I was involved with two unions when I was teaching and I can safely say it was very rare for this to come up or be encouraged locally. Is this done through the Teaching Council or directly through school principals? What is the mechanism?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	136	We use all mechanisms at our disposal. We advertise through the teacher unions, school management, representative bodies, the Joint Managerial Body, the Association of Community and Comprehensive Schools, Education and Training Boards Ireland and the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals. We also communicate directly to anyone who is on our lists from previous years. I am surprised the Deputy did not receive an email from us over the past while because we contacted everybody as part of the process. We have contacted principals directly to appeal to them to exercise their good offices as school leaders in encouraging participation in the staffroom. We are reaching out in as many different ways as we can. We have mentioned the "Earn, learn and understand" campaign, a poster campaign supplemented by a video run on social media. We will continue to use all channels at our disposal to reach teachers.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	137	I will just mention one other very important link, the teacher professional networks, which are the subject associations. We have national associations and regional associations. We have a banked list of 25 to 30 subject associations. These are included in our mailshots so, when we send something out, we are in direct contact with those specific subject associations.They were very helpful last year in communicating with and encouraging their members. We keep them in the loop because it allows us to address a specific audience related to a given subject.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	139	We can follow up on that with the Teaching Council and with the teacher payroll unit.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	141	We got four following the issue of the date and 65 before it was issued.

The student population at both leaving certificate and junior certificate level is going to increase. At the moment, there is an issue with the junior certificate. What is the commission putting in place to ensure the same issue does not arise with regard to the leaving certificate next year or the year after? If there is a shortage of examiners for junior certificate, which is an issue the commission has seen for a number of years, what reassurance can the witnesses give the committee that leaving certificate results will not be delayed until the end of August or early September next year or the year after? They will be aware of the problems that would cause with third level placements and so on.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	143	The leaving certificate results have issued in early September for the last three years because of the circumstances of the pandemic and the particular arrangements that were made.
#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	144	Let me rephrase my question. I would love to be able to forget we had the Covid pandemic. However, going back to the original date, the leaving certificate results were always published in August.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	145	On the question of the impact of the examiner supply issue on the leaving certificate results, it is very clear that we have prioritised marking the leaving certificate. The number of examiners who marked junior cycle in 2019 was 1,756. The number who marked junior cycle this year was 1,270. However, at leaving certificate level, the numbers kept pace. The numbers in 2019 and 2022 were similar. That was very deliberate on our part. We prioritised the marking of the leaving certificate in the assignment of examiners to the marking teams as we recognised the importance of the leaving certificate results to the students involved as regards progression. I am not saying that the junior cycle results are unimportant but the leaving certificate results are important for students progressing to further and higher education and to the world of work. The priority in the assignment of examiners was, therefore, given to the leaving certificate. We want to increase the number of examiners available across the board so that we do not face this challenge at either leaving certificate or junior cycle level. As to the reassurance we can give, as I have reflected already, we see this as a whole-of-system issue. There are absolutely measures we need to take and work we need to continue with the stakeholders but it is a whole-of-system issue. We have had offers of support from the management representative bodies. We have worked very closely with them and with the teacher unions and we will continue to do so in order to deliver our system of examinations, which is externally assessed by the State Examinations Commission. It is marked by teachers who are marking students for the State Examinations Commission. There is work for us to do as an organisation in concert with all of the stakeholders.
#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	146	There is quite a number of retired teachers who do supervision in the exam halls. Can retired teachers correct examinations?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	147	Yes. Retired teachers are involved in our examining teams and in superintending positions. In some subjects, we are actually very dependent on retired teachers. They do not make up the same proportion of examiners as superintendents but we are quite dependent on them in our written examining teams.
#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	148	Is there are a cut-off as to the number of years a teacher can be retired while still doing corrections in light of changes to the curriculum and what is happening in the classroom? People who have been retired for 20 years would not know the curriculum in the same way as people who retired five years ago.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	149	Again, I might ask my colleague, Ms Sheridan, to comment.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	150	Generally, we want to make sure people are as close to the classroom experience as possible. In some subjects, there is a specific policy after X number of years that retired examiners are no longer recruited. However, we must be very conscious of the reason we are here today, which is that we have an examiner-supply problem. We have very few examiners working with us who have a long distance from the classroom and are out of it for 20 years. What we are very conscious of is that we are very grateful to our retired examiners, because they bring a huge amount of experience, in particular to our senior examining teams as well. We are conscious of that in terms of the robust training that we provide. Very detailed resources are provided to all examiners. While retired teachers can be distant from the classroom, equally, there is an issue with newly qualified teachers who have not clocked up the miles in the first place. We provide very robust training materials and exemplars. There is a lot of marking done on sampling material at the marking conferences in order that we are sure that we can robustly support and stand over the marking by all our examiners, not just retired or newly qualified ones. Again, we have the quality assurance processes throughout in terms of getting material. As I mentioned to Senator Dolan, the move to online marking is pretty much instantaneous. If we have a situation with an examiner, we can immediately address that and put measures in place. We are very appreciative and very lucky to have a core group of retired examiners. As I mentioned previously, our priorities are in the criteria that are listed on our website on how we go about examiner appointments. We apply those criteria and try to put the best quality examiners in place, while we are cognisant of the fact that we do have an examiner supply problem.
#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	151	As Deputy O'Sullivan said, and from the experience of my own friends, both male and female, some of whom are single, the very minute they finish in the classroom they want to go travelling for the two or three months. When they get married and have a family, they want to spend time with their kids during the summer holidays. If the witnesses had the Minister for Education in front of them, what two or three processes would they ask her to put in place? Do they think that it should be part of a teacher's contract to correct exams?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	152	The Minister and the Department have already been greatly supportive of the efforts that we have made to get additional examiners.
#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	153	Has more money been requested for them?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	154	Yes, we have and we received it. The rates have increased. For the leaving certificate, the minimum increase is 17% in the script rate and the maximum increase is 50%. At junior cycle, the minimum increase is 48% in the script rate and the maximum increase is 58%. They are very significant increases in pay.
#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	155	Is Ms Feeney saying money is not an issue?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	156	Money is one of the issues, and we have certainly addressed it. The year 2021 was the first year that we got the Covid-related extraordinary payments that have now been retained for 2023. Prior to that, we were quite disempowered in our examiner supply recruitment efforts because pay was a constant issue. With the increases, it is clear that money is one factor. We do need to bear in mind the Covid context and the fact that people went on holidays this year. We hope there will be some improvement in that situation for next year. We must look at all the issues you mentioned, Chair, such as childcare, the fact that teachers have young families and that they have made a lifestyle choice and a career choice that is compatible with their family responsibilities. We must look at the range of factors with the stakeholders and see how we can strike a balance so that the time demand for teachers getting involved is perhaps reduced so that there are more teachers doing this for a shorter period of time. That is the objective that we have. We want it to become a beneficial experience as well as one which increases their earning power. With the increases in the script rate, the earnings can be significant. I appreciate the tax issue that arises, but the earnings can be significant for individual teachers if we can balance the time that is required for teachers involved in the work.
#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	157	Should it be considered part of a teacher's contract that he or she would have to correct examinations?We must get serious about this. The situation must improve. Ms Feeney says she hopes that next year it will not be the case that a lot of people will be on holiday, which they were due to Covid. I throw that out as an idea.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	158	I mentioned that it happens in other jurisdictions. These things need to be looked at in the longer term. We have had a very proud tradition in this country of not having it as part of the teaching contract. It was something teachers always did on a discretionary basis, in addition to their teaching work. In the longer term, it is perhaps something that could be looked at. It is not something the SEC has any power over in terms of the teaching contract. We must focus on the steps and measures that we take in order to effect the change that is needed in collaboration with the stakeholders.
#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	159	I have just one final question before I bring other committee members back in. The junior certificate is a very important examination because it prepares students for the career path they might want to take. I strongly believe that students should have their junior certificate results before they choose the subjects they want to take on in fifth and sixth years. Does Ms Feeney believe that by bringing the junior certificate forward by perhaps two months it would help the SEC and also prepare students for the subject choices they would make in fifth year for the real examination of the leaving certificate? Does Ms Feeney understand where I am coming from?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	160	I do. We probably need to go back, in terms of the junior cycle, and the results of the junior certificate. Even pre-Covid and the changes that we have had, in 2019 junior cycle results issued at the beginning of October. Prior to that, the timeline was the third week in September. Students have never had their junior cycle results before they made their decisions, but they also-----
#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	161	Yes, but my question is whether it would be beneficial to students if they had the results prior to making their choices. I know I am straying a bit from the issue at hand.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	162	Again, under junior cycle reform, the students are engaging in different forms of assessment in the classroom. They are engaging with their teachers in other forms of summative assessment, with their classroom-based assessment. There is a lot more information available to them and about their level of attainment that will give them the clues and information that they need about their subject selection and level. In terms of what it would do at a logistical perspective for the SEC, I do not know. I would have to give it some time to think about it. It sounds to me like it could be quite disruptive to have examinations happening two months earlier in the school year. If the students did their examinations in April instead of in June, what happens to them for the rest of the two months of the year? It might be hard in terms of engaging at that point in time. It is a question I had not considered previously. There are teachers in classrooms at the moment who are very capable of giving advice about their level and also the subjects that they plan to take, and they do so. That is for students who have gone directly into fifth year. A lot of students go into transition year and they have the time they need to make up their mind. Even for those who are in fifth year, there should be enough information available professionally in the school to give them that advice. That is not to say that we would not like to have the results out earlier. We would if we were able to.

What are their roles? I understand Mr. Dolan is head of operations, but could Ms Feeney outline briefly what are the roles of the 190 staff? My key question is who is the marketing manager?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	168	In terms of the structure of the organisation, we have four divisions: an examinations and assessment division, which Ms Sheridan heads up and chairs; Mr. Dolan is head of the operations division - I will hand over to him in a moment; we have two more divisions - corporate services and HR and information technology.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	170	The marketing falls under operations and corporate affairs. Does Mr. Dolan wish to comment?

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	172	No, we do not have a specific director with such responsibility. We are split between the various exams in a linear way for students entering through-----

The SEC came to the committee to state there is a shortage of examiners. Within its cohort of 190 staff and more than €70 million of a budget, how is the SEC highlighting who is managing its marketing and advertising? I am aware it had a number of staff who were engaging with teachers but who is managing the advertising that is going out? Who is managing the short video scripts? Is the SEC present on social media?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	174	That is being done. It is a management board issue. Both Mr. Dolan and Ms Sheridan have had responsibilities in terms of the marketing. We also have an examiner section that deals with the recruitment of our examiners. As I said, this is a key strategic issue for the organisation and has been co-ordinated at our management board level.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	178	It is something we would need to take away and look at.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	180	We do not have our own social media presence.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	182	We had co-operation and assistance from the Department of Education over the last year in the recruitment of examiners using its social media channels.
#AislingDolan	unknown-#AislingDolan-party	unknown-#AislingDolan-dob	unknown-#AislingDolan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	183	Obviously, we need to up the ante here. What I would like to see coming back from the State Examinations Commission is what its board is going to look at in terms of a dedicated position and how it is present in media. That is how it gets recruitment in. What sort of short or one-minute type videos is it looking at to showcase the strengths of this position and the benefits of taking part? My other question is around schools. Can schools indicate the number of teachers who are doing examinations or acting as examiners at the moment? Can a school inspection report state that four out of 20 of its teachers are currently school examiners? It does not need to indicate who they are, but is there any incentive we can give to schools and principals to encourage their teachers to take part? What incentives are we giving to secondary schools?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	184	There is one short video on our website at the moment.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	186	It is there and as I said, it has been broadcast on social media; not ours but those of others.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	188	With regard to the schools, we are conscious that some schools have a very proud and long tradition of supporting examinations work where-----

What is a principal's incentive to do this if he or she cannot say four teachers are currently examiners? Parents then can see there is a teacher in this school who is currently an examiner and really understands the system and the marking. There is potentially a benefit for a school to state that so many of its teachers act as examiners or have done so within the past five years. That could be showcased.

I will ask Ms Feeney to reply to the Senator's question. I will then move on to Deputy Pádraig O'Sullivan.
#AislingDolan	unknown-#AislingDolan-party	unknown-#AislingDolan-dob	unknown-#AislingDolan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	191	I apologise; it is just that the slot is so short.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	192	In terms of the schools, the benefits are inherent for the individual school leader that he or she can actually say that. As I said, we have gone directly to school principals and asked them to not just put a notice on the notice board and send an email but to go into the staff room and have that conversation with teachers about the benefits to the school and to themselves as individuals. There are, therefore, professional benefits to the school. In terms of the teaching and learning for a teacher who engages and works with the examinations, people want to know - not that there are secrets - what happens behind the scenes with regard to the examinations. The opportunity is there to come behind the scenes. Teachers can work with the State Examinations Commission and have that experience of marking their subject and then be able to use that in terms of informing their practice in the classroom. Those are the benefits we would stress in our engagement with principals.

I support Senator Dolan on one thing, which is social media. The SEC is now engaging with a different generation of young people, including those aged 45 and below. If the SEC wants to get people in, it has to get involved with social media platforms such as Twitter, Instagram and TikTok. Getting behind the scenes and under the bonnet of what happens has to be done on social media.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	194	Absolutely.
#PadraigOSullivan	unknown-#PadraigOSullivan-party	unknown-#PadraigOSullivan-dob	unknown-#PadraigOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	195	I have two brief questions. Ms Feeney mentioned earlier the delay with regard to the junior certificate results and the knock-on effect for people who may be doing apprenticeships. She mentioned that the SEC was in touch with SOLAS. Is it the case that the SEC is waiting for SOLAS to revert to her? Where is that at? Has the commission been corresponding with regard to what it will do with that cohort of people? That is the first question. The second goes back to the number of examiners. It is an unfortunate reality we have to deal with but before Covid-19, what way were the examiner numbers trending? Ms Feeney said the number is at approximately 3,500 or 3,300. Up to that point, was there in excess of that? Has there been a steady decline in the trend? Has it been up and down? What kind of trend was there?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	196	On the first question about the apprenticeships, the engagement with SOLAS is recent. We have some follow-up to do to work that through in terms of access to apprenticeships for students who are waiting for their junior cycle results.On the second question, this was a challenge pre-Covid. Ensuring that we had enough examiners each year was a challenge up to and including 2019. The number of candidates was trending up and the number of examiners was trending down, but we have actually seen a step change in 2022.
#PadraigOSullivan	unknown-#PadraigOSullivan-party	unknown-#PadraigOSullivan-dob	unknown-#PadraigOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	197	Was there a high point in the last decade where we had 5,000 or 4,500 just to give us an idea?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	198	The high point has probably been 4,000, to be honest. I am trying to think of the figures from 2013. I think it might have been 3,900; it has gone down. The number of candidates has gone up. We have been doing things, however. I mentioned to Senator Dolan earlier about using technology to ensure we are able to get marking done. Even in 2019 and up to that year, we had put in place remedial measures to get the marking done within the time window. It is not, therefore, a new phenomenon. It is just that there has been a step change this year, and I think there is a Covid impact.
#PadraigOSullivan	unknown-#PadraigOSullivan-party	unknown-#PadraigOSullivan-dob	unknown-#PadraigOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	199	This might be a completely useless point to make but I remember that after teaching, I subsequently went on to do invigilation for examinations. I always felt that was much more convenient and less time-consuming. Should we be placing an emphasis that anybody who is going to act as an invigilator for examinations might have a couple of years' experience built up in actually correcting those examinations to qualify for that? Perhaps "qualify" is the wrong word, but that experience might be beneficial. In my time, it was much more difficult to get that post than the actual examiner post. It might be something worth thinking about.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	200	It is an interesting suggestion. Certainly, we need to look at all possibilities here.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	201	That is the benefit of the review and the working group. We have built very strong relationships with a really broad range of stakeholders. The key ones are focus groups with teachers to ask them why they are not coming. We know there is a lifestyle aspect with holidays in June, July and August but we need to know the reasons. Why do people mark with us? Why do they not come back? Why do we have a retention problem? What might we need to do to find out what would make it more attractive? That is the bit we need now. We have been working with a range of stakeholders but now we need to tap in to the teachers themselves.
#PadraigOSullivan	unknown-#PadraigOSullivan-party	unknown-#PadraigOSullivan-dob	unknown-#PadraigOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	202	I assume that review is under way now and will be in place for next year. Can the SEC send us a copy of that when it is concluded?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	203	We are scoping the terms of reference for the review at the moment. We have had initial engagement with some of the key stakeholders to reach out to them to seek their assistance. As my colleague said, we need to engage not only with the stakeholders but directly through teachers. We will come back to the committee on that when we have scoped out the terms of reference for the review in full.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	205	With the changes that were introduced-----

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	207	I will give the Chairman a couple of averages, if he does not mind. The examiners are paid a per-script rate for every script they correct. They are also paid different fees for attending the conferences, for example, and for administration. With the changes that were introduced this year, the average rate of payment for the lowest paid examiner, which is an examiner at junior cycle marking 300 to 350 scripts, is approximately €3,000 before tax. That is the lowest. At the upper end of the spectrum then, the highest rate of payment we have is associated with marking English or Irish at higher level, remembering that the examiner for that subject marks both papers, that is, English papers 1 and 2 and Irish papers 1 and 2. To mark an average bunk, which is 200 scripts, they are paid €8,000 before tax.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-10-25 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	209	The contract is 26 days from the date of the training conference. The training conferences are related to the date of the examination and then we have a marking window that stretches for 26 days from that date. Really, what has been happening over the last number of years is that they will continue to mark past what we call the sprioclá, which is the end date of the 26-day period from the marking conference. To be clear, though, in terms of a headline number of €8,000, that is for our very top or highest level of marking. The rates of fees go from €3,000 to the top rate of €8,000. The rates are per-script based on the complexity of the subject and the length of time it takes to mark the subject.

I will look back through the transcript. I thank the Chairman.

I thank the officials for coming in today and briefing the committee. I specifically thank the officials and acknowledge their co-operation in agreeing to come before the committee at very short notice as we are in recess next week. This was a timely opportunity and I thank the officials.
