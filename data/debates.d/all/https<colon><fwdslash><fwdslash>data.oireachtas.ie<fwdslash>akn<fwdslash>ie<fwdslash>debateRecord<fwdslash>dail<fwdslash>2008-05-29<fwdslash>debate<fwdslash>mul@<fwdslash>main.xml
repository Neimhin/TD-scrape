          <p eId="para_5">It is proposed to take No.16<i>e</i>, motion re referral to joint committee of proposed approval by Dáil Éireann of a Council decision on the improvement of co-operation between the special intervention units of the member states of the European Union, Council framework decision on taking account of convictions in the member states of the European Union, draft Council decision on the stepping up of cross-border co-operation and Council framework decision on the protection of personal data; No. 16<i>f</i>, motion re referral to select committee of proposed approval by Dáil Éireann of the terms of the agreement establishing a maritime analysis and operations centre-narcotics between Ireland, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the Kingdom of Spain, the Italian Republic, the Portuguese Republic, the French Republic and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland; No.18 — statements on the prevention of cervical cancer; and No. 2, Legal Services Ombudsman Bill 2008 — Second Stage (resumed).</p>
          <p eId="para_6">It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that (1) Nos. 16<i>e </i>and 16<i>f </i>shall be decided without debate; (2) the proceedings on No. 18 shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 1 p.m. today and the following arrangements shall apply: the statements of a Minister or Minister of State and of the main spokespersons for the Fine Gael Party, the Labour Party and Sinn Féin, who shall be called upon in that order, shall not exceed 15 minutes in each case, the statements of each other Member called upon shall not exceed ten minutes in each case, Members may share time, a Minister or Minister of State shall take questions for a period not exceeding 20 minutes, and, on the conclusion of questions, a Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon to make a statement in reply which shall not exceed five minutes; and (3) the Dáil on its rising today shall adjourn until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 4 June 2008.</p>

          <from>An Ceann Comhairle</from>
          <p eId="para_7">There are three proposals to put before the House.  Is the proposal for dealing with Nos 16<i>e</i> and 16<i>f</i> agreed?  </p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AengusOSnodaighSF" eId="spk_7">
          <from>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_8">It is not agreed.  I do not agree that some of the decisions contained in 16<i>e</i> should be referred to a committee without debate, namely, the Council framework decision on the protection of personal data, the framework decision on police and judicial co-operation on criminal matters or the Council decision on the stepping up of cross-border co-operation, particularly in combating terrorism and cross-border crime.  </p>
          <p eId="para_9">The data protection decision is not good enough either in terms of its content or the mechanism by which the Government is attempting to rush it through.  Over the past number of years, countless EU measures mandating that sensitive personal data be made available to various agencies have been pushed through the Dáil with minimal scrutiny and in the absence of sufficient data protection in this State.  The Data Protection Commissioner has already acknowledged that our domestic protections are insufficient and has called on the Oireachtas to deal with that issue.  A full debate on that proposal is warranted and I oppose its referral to committee without debate on that basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_10">In the context of the framework decision on the protection of personal data, the fourth motion states that we should maintain and share a national DNA database.  Again, I am not opposed to the setting up of a DNA database but, as legislators, we have not had a proper debate on the issue and the fundamental concepts behind it have not been teased out in the Chamber.  The standards are being set for us by EU pressure and that is why the proposal should be rejected until such time as there is a proper debate in the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeCostelloLAB" eId="spk_8">
          <from>Deputy Joe Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_11">I have no objection to the referral of No. 16<i>e</i> to the joint committee but I ask that time be given, when the committee reports, for the issue to be discussed in the Chamber with whatever recommendations the committee makes.  The issues concerned are extremely important and deal with the stepping up of cross-border co-operation, which is something we have all called for in this House on many occasions and which is, incidentally, provided for in the Lisbon treaty.  I am surprised that Deputy Ó Snodaigh did not refer to the strengthening of cross-border co-operation in his remarks in the context of this treaty.  The other important issue that is being dealt with is the protection of personal data.  Again, the Charter of Fundamental Rights is extremely strong on the protection of personal data.  In fact, the Lisbon treaty will be engaging with these issues and making them stronger, more robust and more effective.</p>
          <p eId="para_12">It would be ideal if, in the run-up to the vote on the treaty, once the joint committee makes its report and recommendations, that the issues would come back to the House where we could have a decent debate on them.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryHarney" eId="spk_9" as="#Minister_for_Health_and_Children">
          <from>Deputy Mary Harney</from>
          <p eId="para_13">As Deputies are aware, the purpose of these motions is to strengthen Ireland's hand and that of its EU partners in the area of cross-border crime.  Countries that have parliamentary reservations have been urged to deal with the issues as a matter of urgency, which the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Government are anxious to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_14">I can agree to the suggestion of Deputy Costello that, following the debate in the committee, we can, if necessary, have a debate in the Chamber when the matter is referred back.  I cannot agree to the request of Deputy Ó Snodaigh, unfortunately.</p>

Will the Minister for Health and Children indicate where the priorities lie in the wake of yesterday's figures which show gangland crime is getting the upper hand?  Murders have increased by 28%, murder threats by 73% and drug offences by 31%.  We need to see where are the priorities.  Several times we were told we had a watershed.  If I had a penny for every time we were told a watershed killing had occurred and that things would utterly change——</p>

The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is a major law-making Department and we have enacted several items of legislation in recent years.

          <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_33">I wish to raise two matters.  The first relates to the promised legislation on agency workers and refers to the Bill published by the Labour Party on this matter.  The British Government has reached agreement with the British Trades Union Congress and with the Confederation of British Industry on a regime governing agency workers in the United Kingdom.  The terms of this agreement appear to be close to the provisions contained in the Labour Party Bill placed before this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_34">As a result of this agreement, the British Government is withdrawing its objection to the proposed European Union directive on temporary agency workers.  This means only Ireland and Hungary continue to oppose the introduction of this directive at European Union level, which will provide protection for temporary agency workers.  I understand a meeting of the employment Council will take place on 9 June.  Given the agreement reached by the British Government and the withdrawal of its objection, will the Irish Government withdraw its objection to the directive so that it can proceed? It is an important directive which will provide protection and rights to temporary agency workers.</p>

          <p eId="para_36">The second matter is the report of the Morris tribunal.  Previously, I asked for a debate in the House on this report.  We were told the Government wanted to await the publication of the two further reports from the tribunal which the Tánaiste stated were imminent when I asked her on 8 May and which I now understand will be published in the middle of June.  I am concerned that the debate in the House on the report of the Morris tribunal should take place prior to the Dáil going into recess for the summer.  I seek an assurance from the Minister that time will be provided prior to the summer recess for a debate on the Morris tribunal.  It is immaterial whether this debate is on the report already published or on the collection of reports when they are published.</p>

          <p eId="para_37">On the second matter, it was the Government's intention to wait to have a debate until publication of all of the reports which we expect by the middle of June.  Deputy Gilmore makes a reasonable request.  Even if we did not have these reports, I believe the Government would facilitate a debate prior to the summer recess.</p>
          <p eId="para_38">The employment agency regulations Bill is due to be published this session.  In everything the Government does, it seeks to enhance the creation and protection of employment in Ireland and this will be the approach we will adopt on this matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_41">The Minister replied that the legislation will be published this session.  What is the status of the Government's objection to the European Union directive?  The Governments of Ireland and Hungary are holding up this directive.  The British Government has reached agreement with trade unions and industry and is withdrawing its objection.  As I understand it, a meeting of the employment Council will take place on 9 June at which this matter could be progressed.  It is not reasonable that European Union legislation which would provide rights to workers is being held up by this country.  I want this objection withdrawn, particularly if, as the Minister stated, the Government is ready to proceed with the publication of domestic legislation.  I do not see any reason to continue to block the progress of European legislation on the matter.</p>

The board members are involved in significant work.  The board is comprised of incredibly dedicated people with enormous experience in handling major projects, together with a number of clinicians from the children's hospital and paediatricians generally.  I am satisfied the board is doing everything to advance the project with a view to it being completed by 2012.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryHarney" as="#Minister_for_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_166">
          <from>Minister for Health and Children (Deputy Mary Harney)</from>
          <p eId="para_188">I am very happy to have an opportunity to talk about the Government's cervical cancer screening programme.  This debate was requested last week by the Opposition.  I was delighted to agree to the facilitation of the debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_189">This debate is about women and women who get cervical cancer in Ireland.  On average, 75 women per year die in Ireland from cervical cancer.  We know that from screening programmes, we can save up to 80% of those lives.  So we could save 60 of the 75 women who currently die from cervical cancer.  This debate must be about facts and data; it cannot be about innuendo, rumour or about somebody who came out the wrong end of a procurement process or about industrial relations issues.  For many years there have been queries from Opposition Deputies and pleas for the roll-out the cervical screening programme.  That is something to which the Government has been committed for quite some time.</p>
          <p eId="para_190">Last year, we provided €5 million to the National Cancer Screening Service to prepare for the roll-out of a screening population-based cervical screening programme.  This year, we provided €15 million towards the implementation of that programme.  The intention is to begin the roll-out of that screening programme on a national basis during the summer.  It is expected that between 240,000 and 300,000 women aged between 25 and 60 will qualify for screening.  In the case of those aged 25 to 44, they will be called every three years and those aged 45 to 60 will be called every five years.  That is being done on the basis of best international evidence available to us.  The screening will be provided free of charge and this programme is the second one to be rolled out by the National Cancer Screening Service, the first being the breast cancer screening programme.  Everybody in Ireland — particularly those who have used the service — and outside it who have examined our breast screening programme consider it is highly successful with a participation rate of almost 80%.  By international standards, that is very high.  The former Minister, Deputy Nora Owen, said of the service in this House that it was a model of health service delivery that she would recommend to anybody.</p>
          <p eId="para_191">Therefore, I very much regret what I regard as the utterly irresponsible comments made by the Fine Gael spokesperson on health on the cervical screening programme.  I do not say that lightly.  The fact is that last week Deputy Reilly said that 2,000 women's lives would hang in the balance.  I regard that as an utterly irresponsible statement made for no reason other than to scaremonger.  Women have huge faith in the screening service and we want their faith in it to continue.  If we lose 75 women a year as a result of cervical cancer, one would need to multiply that figure by 28 years to achieve the figure of approximately 2,000.  All of us participating in this debate have a responsibility to adhere to facts and not to innuendo.  I appeal to everybody in the House to make sure that in this and other debates on cancer screening we are not irresponsible and do not try to make political points that have the effect of damaging a service that has a significant reputation.</p>
          <p eId="para_192">The National Cancer Screening Service is not part of the Health Service Executive, rather it is an independent service accountable to the Department of Health and Children and the Minister for Health and Children.  It has its own independent board.  The screening programme is now rolling out an integrated service where a system of call, recall, laboratory, colposcopy and follow up treatment will all be integrated and will all operate to best international practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_193">The screening service had a two-stage tender process for the cytology service.  It was open to all laboratories in Ireland and internationally to put forward an application in the context of the tender.  The tender was clear.  In order to meet the requirements, those who tendered had to fulfil three conditions.  First, they had to be accredited by an independent accreditation body, meeting the international ISO standard.  Second, they had to have a minimum throughput of 25,000 smears a year.  Third, they had to be able to do a ten-day turnaround.  Seven applications were made and I understand the number considered was reduced to about four.  The successful bidder was Quest Diagnostics, which is the largest such facility in the world; last year, it dealt with 13 million smears.  The tender was examined not by the Minister or any official from the Department of Health and Children, but by a group established by National Cancer Screening Service, which included doctors like Dr. O'Reilly, who has been running the service in the mid-west, and a doctor from Northern Ireland, who was charged with the responsibility for quality assurance there and who is also involved in the accreditation process in the UK.  These are highly reputable people who were asked to examine the tenders.  A total of 80% of the marks given related to quality and turnaround time and 20% of the marks given related to cost — that is the factual position.</p>
          <p eId="para_194">In regard to data, we have had a number of examples of where rumour and innuendo were advanced here as fact.  Two weeks ago on the Order of Business Deputy Reilly alleged that an official from the HSE had worked for this company and he wondered what the official's role was in regard to this tender.  Subsequently, when questioned by a media source, Deputy Reilly said he was waiting to seek clarification, but he put forward in this House as a matter of fact that an official had worked for this company.  That is not the case.  Journalists went on a wild goose chase to find out who was this official.  I appeal to people that when irresponsible statements, innuendo and rumour are advanced in this House as fact around something as important as a national screening programme that we would have the courage to withdraw those comments and not have the good name of individuals bandied around by journalists and in other places.  It is grossly unfair, misleading and inaccurate.  It is fiction and wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_195">Equally, Professor Miriam Wiley has had comments to make about data that was advanced in the Private Members' motion last week and I hope that will also be clarified.  If we are not going to base the debates in this House on data, evidence and information, we will not have informed debates and we will not make the right decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_196">In regard to company, or preferred bidder, awarded the contract, which has not been signed yet — obviously, there must be a cooling off period — the National Cancer Screening Service did not have to go to tender but chose to do so for reasons of transparency, fairness and equity to make sure it got the best quality assured service we would get.  In line with the McGoogan report, which stated that laboratories that participate in this screening programme should be independently accredited, the screening service is living up to the advice domestically and to best international practice on this issue. The fact is that the company that won it is accredited independently.  As I said, it is the largest such facility in the world and it does work for the National Health Service in the United Kingdom.  I have never met anyone in the company and do not know anyone associated with it, but I understand it intends to put in place a laboratory facility in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_197">I said that 75 women in Ireland a year die from cervical cancer.  International evidence shows, as has been demonstrably shown in the UK, that up to 80% of those deaths can be avoided.  However, the screening is not a test or a diagnosis of cancer.  What it detects are abnormalities that, if undetected and untreated, can lead to cancer.  Some 800 women in Ireland in the last year for which we have data were found to have abnormalities.  The purpose of a screening programme is early intervention to identify those abnormalities.  In a lifetime, a woman can expect to be called to the screening programme up to 11 times to identify those abnormalities and, if detected, to intervene with treatment before cancer develops.  We know such intervention is highly successful with a success rate of up to 80%.  The women affected by cervical cancer tend to be young women with children and significant responsibilities.  We also know that health promotion has a major role to play in the prevention of cervical cancer.  The cessation of smoking has a huge contribution to make to its prevention.  Sexual practices and the early onset of sexual activity contribute to the development of cervical cancer.  A vaccine has now come on the market as a preventative measure.  I asked the Health Information and Quality Authority to do a technology assessment of that vaccine.  The authority brought its recommendation to my attention in recent weeks.  This week, I received a recommendation from the National Cancer Screening Service for the vaccine.  I will work on the advice given to me and a decision will be made this summer regarding the vaccine.  Clearly, huge issues arise, not least that of parental consent because we are dealing with minors.  Since the vaccine will have to be administered twice in a calendar year and since this will be done through a schools programme, we must begin when the academic year begins.  It will not be possible to begin the programme in September 2008, as has been suggested.  We do not have the necessary lead-in time to allow us to do that.  What is important is that we make an early decision.  The intention is that the decision be made this summer.</p>
          <p eId="para_198">The National Cancer Screening Service has an enormous reputation, as a result of the success of BreastCheck.  Our breast cancer screening service was the first in the world to go digital.  That is something of which we should be very proud.  It has a huge participation rate and has gained the enormous confidence of the women who use the service.  Equally, I want to ensure that the cervical cancer screening programme has enormous confidence.  Screening will be done at primary care level.  It does not need to be done in acute hospitals.  When women are contacted it is important they go for a smear test and continue to do so on a regular basis.  Tests will be done every three years on women under 45 and every five years thereafter.  As has happened in other countries, this programme has the capacity, in time, greatly to reduce the incidence of cervical cancer and, in particular, to reduce the death rate from that cancer by up to 80%.  In everything we have done we have followed best international practice.  We have independent accreditation and turn-around times of ten days.</p>
          <p eId="para_199">With the opportunistic screening which was occurring, women were waiting more than nine months for test results.  This is highly dangerous.  This is why, in the past 18 months the HSE outsourced more than 40,000 smear samples so that we could get earlier results for the women who were awaiting them.  It has been alleged in parliamentary questions that 12 errors were detected.  No one could say there were 12 false readings without seeing the data.  I understand that in one case out of 40,000 a high-grade lesion was discovered.  This is not outside the scope of these matters.  The smears which were outsourced were not the urgent ones.  Urgent cases were examined domestically.  A higher number of high-grade lesions would be picked up among urgent case than among a different population group.</p>
          <p eId="para_200">Two cytotechnologists will read the smears.  They will be doubly examined, which is appropriate.</p>
          <p eId="para_201">It is important that this programme be rolled out quickly and I am satisfied that will happen over this summer.  It is important that it is quality assured.  It is particularly important that women get results within a four week period.  Those standards meet best international practice in this area.  The women of Ireland want the best possible service.  The contract will be awarded for two years.  This means that in the intervening period laboratories in Ireland can meet the independent standard required to provide a cytology service which is quality assured.  No one would want to see us availing of services which are not quality assured.  I have already explained that in awarding the contract, 80% of points were allotted for quality and turnaround time and 20% for price.  As it happens, the price quoted by the successful applicant was one third of that quoted by many of the domestic laboratories.  Laboratories in other jurisdictions offered better value for money that those which tendered in this jurisdiction.</p>

          <from>Deputy James Reilly</from>
          <p eId="para_202">I would like to share time with Deputy Deirdre Clune.</p>
          <p eId="para_203">I must comment on something the Minister said.  No one's good name or reputation was taken.  No name was mentioned.  Journalists came to me with the name but I would not do anyone the disservice of using his or her name in the House under privilege without absolute proof of a problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_204">The Minister mentioned Professor Miriam Wiley and the ESRI.  I have mentioned the issue of figures on a number of occasions.  Accuracy is of the utmost importance when we are planning our health services.  I wish to clarify comments I made and which some people have found confusing.  My office was in touch with the ESRI by telephone and e-mail.  I have expressed my opinion regarding the implications of that information.  There is a difference between the figures given by Mayo General Hospital, which says 85 people were treated for breast cancer in 2007, and the ESRI figure of 37, as quoted by the Minister.  That is too big a gap to be ignored.  It must be examined.  These data come from two sources: the National Cancer Registry and the hospitals.  Inaccurate information is heading into the ESRI, which cannot be asked to stand over figures over which it has no control.  The ESRI can stand over its analysis.  I do not impugn its reputation and I understand that its work is very important.  I have sought a meeting with Professor Miriam Wiley to clarify the information and to find out how the disparity arose.</p>
          <p eId="para_205">I thank the Government for overruling the Minister for Health, who was not willing to concede this debate when I called for it two weeks ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_206">Cervical cancer kills more than 70 women a year in this country and afflicts thousands of others.  By initiating a cervical screening programme in conjunction with a cervical cancer vaccine we could make this horrible disease, which affects so many of our women particularly during their child bearing years, a thing of the past.  I call on the Minister to introduce the vaccine without delay.  By her own admission, this has been recommended to her by three different bodies.  It is time to move things on.  A combined vaccination and screening programme would eradicate up to 90% of cervical cancer cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_207">Since my election to this House I have called on the Minister to introduce this programme and I warned on each occasion that I could not see how it could be achieved in the timeframe she promised, given that no preparation had been made between the HSE and the laboratories and particularly as so few of them had been accredited.  Notwithstanding this, I understand several laboratories are now accredited, including Beaumont/Rotunda, RCSI, St. James's Hospital through its connection with Antrim and Altnagelvin Hospital, which has looked after the needs of Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim.  St. Luke's is also mid-way through the process.  While accreditation is important as it ensures the right facilities are in place, it is not a guarantee of outcome.  That is, of itself it is not a guarantee of quality outcomes.</p>
          <p eId="para_208">This call for action obviously fell on deaf ears as so many of the laboratories remained unaccredited at the start of 2008.  Instead of addressing this issue and ensuring that our laboratories would be in a position to tender for and successfully provide cytology for our National Cervical Screening Service, the Minister struck out on a new route to outsource the entire smear reading service to another jurisdiction across the Atlantic.  This rushed and ill-considered decision has serious consequences for our health service and for the health of our women and further begs the question as to why, when we seek out partners from the United States of America, we cannot find a company that has not been guilty of over-billing.  Though technically not fraud in law, because they paid up before they were charged, nonetheless most people would consider this fraudulent behaviour.  This was not a once-off action.  It was found to be the case in 1998, again in 2001 and yet again in 2004.  It was no small sum of money in total either. It was $40 million dollars.  This is not the sort of partner one would seek out for a business venture, let alone a partner to provide an essential medical service where women's lives are at stake.</p>
          <p eId="para_209">The Minister referred to the screening contract.  I will read an extract from Council Directive 2004/18/EC:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_210">Any economic operator may be excluded from participation in a contract where the economic operator has been guilty of grave professional misconduct proven by any means which the contracting authorities can demonstrate.</p>
          <p eId="para_211">The sums of money paid for over-billing represent professional misconduct.  These are not the sort of people we should be dealing with where women's lives are at stake.</p>
          <p eId="para_212">There is, further, the issue of our loss of jobs.  Over 100 highly skilled people will now be no longer employed and will either become de-skilled through lack of activity or will emigrate to continue to earn their livelihoods.  This is a very odd situation when we have spent considerable time encouraging people to take up science.  Furthermore if in two years, as I anticipate, we find we have made the wrong decision we will have to spend years rebuilding the service having given a foreign multinational a virtual monopoly on cervical cytology.  This loss of cytology will further impact on the training of our pathologists for whom cytology is an integral part of training.  They will no longer be able to sit the UK examination in pathology as they currently do unless they go there for training.</p>
          <p eId="para_213">Most important, however, is the issue of reliability and the quality of testing.  A study done by St. Luke's Hospital looking at the results of 14,500 smears read by Quest showed a 30% difference in the pick-up rate for high grade pre-invasive cancer of the cervix.  Critics of the study from the NCSS have claimed it did not allow for urgent cases, but it did factor this in.  Two other laboratories, Cork and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, examined the figures for the Quest smears that went from their laboratories.  They discovered that it was a 50% difference but they had not corrected for the urgent cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_214">Accusations that the St. Luke's results are being over-simplistically analysed is absolutely outrageous and I refute it.  An article published by St. Luke's in the <i>Irish Medical Journal</i> showed the expected rate of high grade pre-cancers is 1.9% and this is accepted internationally.  In a comparative study by St. Luke’s this figure comes up again while the Quest figures were 1.2%.  Quest, therefore, could be missing up to 30% of high grade pre-cancers of the cervix, placing Irish women at an unacceptable risk.  These are statistics from medical professionals.  I see no reason to disbelieve my fellow professionals.</p>
          <p eId="para_215">The other deeply disconcerting aspect of this decision is that there will no longer be the ability of a multidisciplinary meeting to review the slides between the smear reader, the colposcopists and the gistopathologists who would give further advice.  The result of this is a less safe service with some experts predicting 1,000 and another expert predicting up to 2,000 high grade pre-invasive carcinomas being missed annually.  This may be acceptable if there is a system of annual smear tests, such as that in America.  However, in Ireland it is intended to test every three to five years.  We cannot afford that margin of error.</p>
          <p eId="para_216">I understand the tender contract specified adherence to NHS UK guidelines which specifically state that no primary smear reader should spend more than four hours reading the smears.  This in effect limits each reader to about 50 smears per day.  It is my understanding that each smear reader in the Quest laboratories regularly reads 90 to 100 smears per day.  How could they possibly have satisfied the tender document in this case?</p>
          <p eId="para_217">The McGoogan report, on which this screening programme was initially designed, looked to a hub and spoke arrangement within the country.  At no point did she mention outsourcing it, of which I am sure she would not approve.  The current capacity in our laboratories is approximately 250,000 smears per annum.  This would be well over 300,000 with the addition of two imagers, equipment which allows for automated pre-screening.  They only cost approximately €125,000 per year to lease.</p>
          <p eId="para_218">I ask the Minister not to ignore the McGoogan report or fragment our health service.  Instead I ask her to support and resource our laboratories to achieve accreditation which could be in place by the autumn.  She must invest in the imagers, thereby giving the women of Ireland the best quality service which is surely, what they deserve.  Yet again the talk is of putting the patient first but the action says more about saving money.  On this occasion, I beseech the Minister not to take the cheap option but to put the patient first.</p>

It was promised in several programmes for Government in 1997 and 2002.  Only in 2008 are we debating the implementation of a valuable programme that will save women's lives.  Up to 75 women die from cervical cancer every year.  It affects not just their families but their colleagues and friends.  A screening programme such as this will save up to 80% of those lives.  It is vital it is implemented as soon as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_221">The programme, however, has been dogged by controversy.  In 2006, there were six-month waiting lists for smear tests.  A large backlog developed and testing had to be outsourced, leading to a lack of confidence in the system.  It is important that when developing the programme, women can have confidence in the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_222">Deputy James Reilly gave figures from various medical professionals.  The Coombe Women's Hospital, St. James's and University College Hospital Galway have also questioned the outsourcing of the programme to Quest Diagnostics and its ability to instil confidence in the screening programme.  Dr. Conor O'Keane of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland questioned the future of pathology services in the country if this testing is outsourced.  It is important we maintain and develop expertise in this area.  When the contract comes up for renewal in three years we should hope that local laboratories can tender for the service.  It is also important if we want to attract young people into studying medical sciences.</p>
          <p eId="para_223">The Minister referred to the breast screening programme being rolled out and I note the excellence of the service in Cork.  The number of cases uncovered in the few short weeks that the service began in Cork highlighted the need for it.  I compliment those involved in developing this important service.</p>
          <p eId="para_224">Have GPs agreed to take the smear tests as part of the cervical cancer screening programme?  They will be an important cog in the process and we must ensure there are no delays in the roll-out of the programme.  I was glad the Minister spoke positively about the introduction of a cervical cancer vaccine programme.  I accept it will be difficult and will involve parental consent.  It is a necessary programme to which I hope the Minister will give the thumbs-up.  I hope it is introduced as soon as possible.</p>

          <from>Deputy Jan O’Sullivan</from>
          <p eId="para_225">I wish to share time with Deputy Emmet Stagg.</p>
          <p eId="para_226">I welcome this important debate which I have been requesting on the Order of Business over the past two weeks.  I thank the Labour Party Whip, Deputy Emmet Stagg, for pursuing the matter at the Whips' meetings.</p>
          <p eId="para_227">I assure the Minister that we are fully supportive of a good, accredited and safe programme of cancer screening, whether for cervical or breast screening or any other type of screening.  However, I do not know whether it was intentional on the part of the Minister but there was an implication in her contribution that this screening was not available in this country and this is not true.  We have accredited laboratories of a very high standard.  The awarding of the contract to a company outside the country implies that the expertise is not available here and this needs to be clarified.  I urge the Minister to provide this clarification in her response.</p>
          <p eId="para_228">I welcome the fact that the Minister has said that while Quest Diagnostics is the preferred bidder, the contract has not yet been signed and there is some time.  I urge the Minister to listen to what we are saying in the House today and to what is being said by other people who are very concerned about the decision to outsource the entire cytology screening programme.  One source of this concern is the editorial in this week's <i>Irish Medical News</i> which expresses serious concern that the outsourcing of the entire service is not desirable.</p>
          <p eId="para_229">The awarding of the entire contract for the Irish cervical screening programme to one bidder, Quest Diagnostics, a US-based private company, will result in the loss of jobs and skills which the Government cannot ignore.  This is not just a matter for the national cancer screening service even though the Minister has said it is nothing to do with her or with her Department.  However, its consequences are of national concern.  I would suggest we are being penny wise but pound foolish and there are serious long-term consequences of this decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_230">It is important to explain the context of the decision.  The Irish cancer screening programme was first established as a pilot programme in the mid-west region where I live.  The intention was that this programme would be evaluated after a period, that any necessary lessons would be learned and a national programme would be subsequently rolled out.  Along with thousands of other women in the mid west, I benefited from this screening and I welcome the fact it will be available to women in the rest of the country.  The Labour Party is fully supportive of the need for the highest standard in the quality of the screening methodology and the expertise of those who carry out the tests.  There is absolute agreement on all sides of the House and throughout the country on this.  What deeply concerns us is the awarding of the entire contract to one private non-Irish company, to the exclusion of all the Irish laboratories.  This puts accountability at a further remove and this is not a good idea.  Cytology will be separated from other aspects of patient care and this will not result in an integrated, patient-centred service which is vitally important.</p>
          <p eId="para_231">A number of measures were identified during the pilot programme which would require to be implemented in order to roll out the programme to the rest of the country.  These include the need to improve laboratory facilities, introduce quality assurance and accreditation and train extra staff to facilitate the full roll-out.  There was close co-operation between the pilot phase screening programme and the cytology laboratories in Ireland.  General practitioners and other providers of service took the smears and sent them to a number of laboratories around the country.  The laboratories did the testing and also set about improving their facilities and their turnaround time.  At least three, if not more, Irish laboratories are now fully accredited and others are in the final stages of achieving accreditation.</p>
          <p eId="para_232">The other significant action taken to prepare for the roll-out was the establishment of a specific higher education course to train medical scientists to carry out the smears.  This was one of the recommendations of the report by Dr. Euphemia McGoogan who carried out the evaluation of the pilot programme.  This state-of-the-art course is in place and is training highly skilled graduates at DIT Kevin Street.</p>

          <from>Deputy Jan O’Sullivan</from>
          <p eId="para_234">It was set up at significant cost to the taxpayer with expensive equipment and expert academic staff.  If all the testing is to be carried out by Quest Diagnostics, then all that effort and money will be down the drain.  There will be no jobs for the students, there will be no cytology expertise in Ireland and there will be no backup if Quest does not seek to renew its contract or if anything goes wrong in the meantime.</p>
          <p eId="para_235">We urgently need joined-up thinking in Government on this issue before it is too late.  The Minister cannot close her mind to all that has gone before and hide behind the independence she has given to the national cancer screening service.  Privatising and exporting the entire testing service has implications that are too serious to be decided purely within the narrow requirements of the national cancer screening service.</p>
          <p eId="para_236">I do not have time to discuss the argument as to whether Quest's methodology is inferior to the Irish model although it has been claimed by those more expert than I that Irish screeners have double the specificity for picking up abnormalities compared to US screeners.  I will not refer to the fraud charges that have been highlighted in the media.  These may or may not be relevant, but the argument I am making stands up, irrespective of these factors.</p>
          <p eId="para_237">If a rare species of animal, bird or insect was threatened with extinction from our country we would do everything we could to protect it and rightly so.  We must be equally vigilant in protecting unique specialist skills which our people need for the future.  I am not arguing that all of the testing must be carried out by Irish laboratories, rather that a significant amount should be.  The tendering criteria stipulated that there must be a ten-day turnaround — to which the Minister referred — and that the prospective bidder must handle at least 25,000 samples per year.  I understand there were Irish bidders that fulfilled these criteria.  I have serious questions as to why such strict criteria were set particularly as the McGoogan report suggested four working weeks as an appropriate turnaround time.  I ask the Minister to address this point in her reply.  I take the point she said that 80% was for the turnaround and quality assurance but I question what part of this is the turnaround and why it decreased from four weeks to ten days.  Was this in order to specifically exclude Irish laboratories?  Is this decision the precursor of more privatisation of Irish laboratory services?  This is another concern.  Are other pathology jobs at risk?</p>
          <p eId="para_238">Following on from the Minister's own co-location plans which will <i> </i>separate public and private patients on the campuses of many of our<i> </i>larger hospitals and which we in the Labour Party vehemently oppose, there has been more farming out of services to the private sector by the HSE and the national cancer screening programme.  In my own constituency, kidney dialysis is to be provided by a multinational company.  A sum of €15 million to €20 million has been paid to KPMG to administer the health repayment scheme.  Even the letters to patients in the north east whose X-rays are being reviewed were sent by a private firm.  It is difficult to believe there was any justification for contracting out that particular job.  We are very concerned that this again represents more outsourcing, more privatisation and a failure to trust and invest in the Irish public health service.</p>
          <p eId="para_239">I have no expectation that the Minister will share my concerns about the privatisation of cervical screening or of any other service.  She is ideologically committed to privatisation.  However, I do expect her partners in Government, Fianna Fáil and the Green Party, to be concerned about this continuous privatisation within the health service.  I expect her and her Government colleagues to protect the jobs and essential skills needed for this country.  I expect her to care about educating young people.  Their expectations about pursuing a career in this country are being raised only to have the door shut in their faces.</p>
          <p eId="para_240">I urge the Minister to intervene before this contract is signed.  I welcome the fact she has said today that Quest Diagnostics is the preferred bidder but that there is some time still available.  I urge her to consider all of the implications of this decision and also to consider the fact that we have the highest of standards and accredited laboratories in this country.  We have trained workers who will lose their jobs and students are currently studying in DIT Kevin Street to work in cytology labs.  We are in danger of losing these skills and in two years' time the skills will be gone.  I urge the Minister to change her mind on this issue.  I urge her to intervene to ensure that Irish laboratories are included in this contract as there is a national interest at stake.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EmmetStagg" eId="spk_173">
          <from>Deputy Emmet Stagg</from>
          <p eId="para_241">I wish to declare an interest.  I worked in this area for 25 years as a medical scientist and I welcome colleagues, old and new, to the Visitors Gallery.  They are being silenced, of course, by the Ceann Comhairle so they are mute today.</p>
          <p eId="para_242">For 40 years, medical scientists have screened literally millions of cervical smears.  Thousands of Irish women have had their lives saved because of this high quality service.  The expertise was built up slowly over the years until it reached a level that is literally second to none in the world.  We are now about to permanently wipe out that invaluable pool of expertise and sacrifice it on the altar of the Minister, Deputy Harney's privatisation agenda.</p>
          <p eId="para_243">The comments of the Minister for Health and Children and the Tánaiste in the Dáil, and of Mr. Tony O'Brien of the National Cancer Screening Service, to the effect that Irish women have not had an accurate and quality cytology service in the past, is not only grossly insulting to the professional integrity of the medical scientists involved but also highly inaccurate and damaging, by any international standards.</p>
          <p eId="para_244">Some 70 medical scientists in cytology laboratories now face an end to their careers. In addition, the country faces an end to sufficiency in cervical cancer screening and an absolute dependence on foreign private sector operators for a vital part of patient health.  No other country in the world exports the health of its citizens in this way.</p>
          <p eId="para_245">The quality of the outsourced work to the preferred bidder, Quest Diagnostics, has, on analysis, shown major discrepancies even on corrected figures.  No amount of statistical fudging by the Minister or Tony O'Brien will improve Quest's low detection rate.  If the screening programme is outsourced to Quest, the outcome for Irish women will be a decreased accuracy in the pick-up rate for high-grade smears, leading to an increase in cervical cancer and dire consequences for Irish women.</p>
          <p eId="para_246">The Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, is the independent authority on all aspects of quality in the health service.  Has it been asked to analyse the discrepancies in Quest's results and, if not, why not?  Is HIQA happy with the outsourcing to Quest?  Dr. Tracey Cooper, the CEO of HIQA, should be asked to report and comment on this matter.  That is his job and it is what HIQA is there for.</p>
          <p eId="para_247">The decision to outsource can only be explained by the political ideology of the Minister and the Government.  This is another step in the privatisation of the health service towards a for-profit service, if one can afford it.</p>
          <p eId="para_248">I served for 25 years as a medical technologist and, in addition, I served for ten years on the executive of the union representing that group.  I want to issue a word of warning to the Minister.  There are approximately 2,500 medical technologists and scientists in the country who are fully unionised and their unions have a mandate from their members for industrial action.  If 70 of their members have their hard-won careers terminated by this crazy outsourcing and privatisation, it is highly unlikely that their union will stand idly by.  They will have my full support in whatever action they take to protect the lives of women in Ireland, their careers and the knowledge base that we have built up here.  I ask the Minister to consider this matter very seriously.  It is seldom that such a debate is held in this House.  The Government agreed to the Opposition's request for a debate because of the urgency and importance of the issue.  Before a final decision is made on this matter, the Minister should seriously take on board the points that have been made in this debate by the Opposition, as well as the views of experts outside the House.</p>

        <speech by="#AengusOSnodaighSF" eId="spk_174">
          <from>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_249">Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer in women under 45 and the third most common cancer in women in Ireland.  On average, almost 200 women in this State develop the disease every year.  In contrast to most other cancers, this one affects mainly younger women, with 60% of cases occurring in women aged 50 or younger.</p>
          <p eId="para_250">Faigheann 70 mná sna Fiche-Sé Chontae bás de thoradh ailse an mhuiníl gach bhliain.  Léirigh suirbhé anuraidh nach bhfuil a fhois ag ach 29% de mná na hÉireann go bhfuil vacsaín ann chun déileáil leis an ailse seo.  In ainneoin gurb é an dara ailse is coitianta i mná faoi 45 bliain d'aois, ní fios de triúr as gach ceathrar mná cad is cúis leis, nó na fáthanna taobh thiar de.</p>
          <p eId="para_251">It needs to be known as widely as possible that this cancer can be prevented by means of a simple test, the cervical smear test.  It is a scandal and a disgrace that successive Governments have failed to roll out a national testing programme and that only this year progress is being made in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_252">On 24 February 2005, there was a unanimous call from the Irish Cancer Society and 24 other organisations, including trade unions, professional bodies and women's networks, for a State-wide pre-cancer screening programme.  Comprehensive screening leading to early detection and treatment can and will dramatically reduce the incidence and development of cervical cancer and the resulting terrible death toll.</p>
          <p eId="para_253">There is far too little information for women to highlight the fact that screening can be life-saving.  That information and the associated screening need to be as widely available as possible.  There must be quick progress in moving the screening programme beyond the current phase one in the mid-western HSE area.  The promise is that the national cervical screening programme will be free to all women between 25 and 60 years of age.  Screening will be provided every three years for women aged between 25 and 44, and every five years for women aged between 45 and 60, in line with best international practice.  That is the commitment given by the Government to the women of this country and it must be kept.</p>
          <p eId="para_254">It is very important that this long-promised national screening programme is not disrupted, as so much other patient care is being disrupted, by current HSE cutbacks.  That would be a betrayal of the women of Ireland and their families, and it would condemn thousands of them to serious illness, which is preventable.</p>
          <p eId="para_255">If the Government is only interested in bookkeeping, cutting this programme would make no economic sense as the cost of cancer treatment in the future, which could have been prevented or treated through early screening, will far outweigh the cost of the screening programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_256">On 9 May, the National Cancer Screening Service, NCSS, announced a preferred bidder for the provision of laboratory testing services for the national cervical screening programme.  This was described as an important milestone which, in the coming months, will enable the NCSS to launch the first quality-assured, population-based national cervical screening programme for women aged 25 to 60.  However, major concerns have been raised about the use of laboratories outside this country for these tests.  In particular, major concerns have been raised about the company named as the preferred bidder, Quest Diagnostics.</p>
          <p eId="para_257">Quest has won the tender to analyse 300,000 Irish smear tests a year, but consultant pathologists from the Coombe Women's Hospital, St. James's Hospital and St. Luke's Hospital in Dublin, and University College Hospital in Galway stated that missed cases would arise because the diagnostic rate of pre-cancerous cells at Quest Diagnostics in the US is 30% less than that of Irish laboratories.</p>
          <p eId="para_258">This concern has been echoed by the Irish Association for Clinical Cytology, IACC, which has expressed its disquiet at the decision to award the contract for cervical screening services to Quest, thereby excluding Irish laboratories.  The IACC says this decision will have serious implications for the long-term quality of the cervical screening programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_259">The association lists its main concerns as follows: quality in detection rates — from recently adjusted figures, excluding urgent smear policy, at least 30% of cases with pre-cancerous cells will go undetected based on the data from the previous outsourcing exercise by the NCSS to Quest Diagnostics; Irish laboratories' ability to tender for future work. the exclusion of the Irish cytology laboratories at this stage will result in the loss of cervical cytology as a discipline and laboratory service in this State — once lost, the re-establishment of this service will not be feasible due to the extensive training requirements and the loss of expertise and skill-mix that has taken years to develop here; and the creation of a monopoly.  By contracting to one organisation the NCSS has tied itself to Quest Diagnostics without an alternative provider of services.  If there is an issue with the provision of service down the line, there will be no domestic laboratories available to deliver such a service.</p>
          <p eId="para_260">It also highlighted a reduction in mortality rates by 80%.  Although this figure has been quoted as the potential reduction rate of mortality for cervical cancer, this can only be achieved in the setting of a population that has not been screened before and not in a relatively heavily screened population as in Ireland.  We would be concerned that an increase in mortality and morbidity may result in Ireland by using a laboratory with low detection rates.</p>
          <p eId="para_261">The Irish Association for Clinical Cytology states that Irish laboratories provide a quality screening service as evidenced by comparison of incidence and mortality rates to other European countries.  Even without an organised national screening programme, this State compares favourably to the UK which has had an organised screening programme for more than 20 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_262">There is significant concern that testing for this screening programme has been placed in the hands of a multinational giant that has been convicted of fraud in the US.  Quest Diagnostics has paid out almost $40 million in fraud settlements over the past decade.  It made major settlements in 1998, 2001 and 2004 after being investigated in connection with the billing of federal health care programmes for unnecessary tests.  In 2004, Quest Diagnostics paid more than $11 million to settle a lawsuit that alleged the company billed Medicare, a federal health care programme, for certain blood tests that doctors had not specifically ordered.  Janette Byrne of the Patients Together campaigning group, which is trying to improve the standard of patient care in Ireland, said: "We would definitely question why public money is being given to a company that has been investigated for acting fraudulently in another country."</p>
          <p eId="para_263">It seems the Minister for Health and Children would rather listen to corporate executives in the private health business than to health experts and patients in Ireland.  Not only are our health services being privatised, but jobs and services are being exported.  Trained and trainee laboratory technicians in Ireland are being written off by this decision and many will have to emigrate to find work in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">Incidentally, another corporation, Fresenius, has been contracted by the HSE to carry out dialysis services.  This corporation paid the biggest ever criminal and civil fraud fine to the US Government in 2000 — $0.5 billion.  The Fresenius scam involved fraudulent and fictitious blood-testing claims, kickbacks to dialysis facilities in return for blood-testing contracts and fraudulent claims against State health insurers.  This company, which will be based in Limerick, has been given a major role in the provision of dialysis in our health services in the mid-west and south east<b> </b>areas<b>.</b>
                    </p>
          <p eId="para_265">During questions on the issue of the cervical cancer screening programme last October, my colleague, Deputy Ó Caolain, asked the Minister if it was preferable that the testing labs should be here.  The Minister replied: "Yes, ideally we must have our own laboratory facilities in Ireland."  This does not seem to be the case now.</p>
          <p eId="para_266">I have been contacted by a medical scientist, a constituent of mine, who has raised her concern at the outsourcing to Quest Diagnostics.  She set out, in her letter to me yesterday, those concerns in the following terms: awarding this contract is handing a monopoly to a private company whose bottom line is profit not patients; the method of screening done by Quest Diagnostics is not up to the same standard as the public labs in Ireland — this means that more Irish women will die — and cytology labs in public hospitals will not be able to apply for the tender in two years' time as they will not be able to keep up their screening skills.  These skills will be lost forever so it will not be possible to reintroduce the service in the future if anything goes wrong.  The HSE has a sorry history with its privatisation agenda and she does not want to see it happening with laboratory services.</p>
          <p eId="para_267">She concluded by stating: "As a woman and mother of two daughters I am horrified to think that the standards of screening cervical smears are going to be reduced unnecessarily and put us at risk."  The Minister must listen to such expert voices — those involved in the service, those working in the service and the patients who have to use the service.</p>
          <p eId="para_268">The warped mentality behind this decision is the same warped mentality that has forced the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital to take the unnecessary step of discontinuing the cervical smear testing at that hospital.  This was highlighted recently by my colleague, Councillor Ray McHugh, when his wife was told that the Coombe was suspending smear tests as a result of HSE cuts due to lack of staff.  That is how illogical the approach of the Government and the HSE has been in terms of addressing the concerns of patients, cervical cancer and the screening programme it promised.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mary Alexandra White</from>
          <p eId="para_269">I wish to share time with Deputy Mary O'Rourke.</p>
          <p eId="para_270">I am pleased to speak here this morning.  I believe the health system is slowly but surely reforming and the great challenges facing it are being addressed over time.  The Green Party believes in equitable access to health services and recent achievements by the Government and the careful and co-ordinated approach by Professor Keane and the national cancer control programme, the encouraging signs of consultants accepting the contracts being offered by the Department of Health and Children and this latest development concerning the National Cancer Screening Service proposed contract for cervical cancer screening represent signs of reform and improvements in health care for the people of Ireland, particularly women.  Many challenges remain, but everybody in this House must welcome the reform and improvements we are witnessing.</p>
          <p eId="para_271">In recent weeks there has much coverage and criticism of the NCSS's announcement of a preferred bidder for the provision of laboratory testing services for the national cervical screening programme.  Much of it has centred on concerns over jobs losses of laboratory workers involved in cervical cancer screening.  Others have voiced complaints about the tendering process itself.  I wish to make several points about the tendering process and the implications of any contract with Quest Diagnostics lest any undue concerns gain further credence here.</p>
          <p eId="para_272">First,<b> </b>there is the issue of the procurement process and the speculation about the capacity criterion announced by the NCSS at the time of tendering.  The procurement process was open to all laboratories in Ireland and internationally, public and private, in accordance with the usual EU procurement guidelines.</p>
          <p eId="para_273">Each applicant was required to meet certain criteria, namely, currently screening a minimum of 25,000 cervical smear samples per annum at each proposed laboratory and the capacity and ability to process smears within a ten-day turnaround in order to facilitate the delivery of results to women within four weeks of their smear test.  This requirement is reflected in European guidelines.</p>
          <p eId="para_274">To ensure a quality assured service, the NCSS requires participating laboratories to currently screen a minimum of 25,000 cervical smear samples per annum at each proposed laboratory.  It was an essential requirement to ensure the necessary level of expertise.  Although the overall requirement for the programme is a target of 300,000 smears per annum, the procurement process was designed to allow for one or a number of tenderers if each met all tender criteria.</p>
          <p eId="para_275">The second public concern worth addressing is that of a disparity in detection rates between those of Quest Diagnostics and Irish laboratories at the same time.  The NCSS has highlighted that the analysis was not a comparative one of identical samples and that in the same analysis the performance of Quest Diagnostics matched that of an Irish accredited lab.  Moreover, a high pick-up rate overlooks the fact that an individual laboratory could be overcalling abnormalities and subjecting women to needless anxiety, worry and investigation.  A positive smear does not automatically mean a diagnosis of cancer.  It means a requirement for further investigation.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mary Alexandra White</from>
          <p eId="para_277">The last point is the legitimate one regarding the loss of Irish jobs.  On this, the Health Service Executive has accepted its responsibility to ensure medical laboratory scientists employed in cytology are redeployed in the health system.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">It must be remembered the new contract the NCSS is set to sign will be good news for 1.1 million women who will receive test results within four weeks rather than waiting for six months in some cases.  Each year, 180 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer and last year 73 women died from this form of cancer.  We need to address delays of up to six months in smear test results.  The NCSS has indicated that implementation of the national programme could reduce mortality rates from cervical cancer by up to 80%.  The women of my constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny want a quick, efficient service and an end to the agonising delays spent waiting for test results.</p>

          <p eId="para_279">I thank Deputy White for allowing me five minutes of her time, particularly as I was late in arranging to speak in this debate.  I am pleased the Minister is present to speak about the cervical cancer screening service.  One of the welcome features of her tenure has been her willingness, when important health matters surface, to engage in public debate in the Chamber by first laying out her stall, so to speak, before replying to questions raised by Deputies.</p>
          <p eId="para_280">I do not propose to address specific issues related to cervical cancer but instead I propose to make a case on behalf of the women of Ireland who are coming late to a recognition of their needs in cancer specialties.  As a result, there is impatience in the system in terms of the need to give women an opportunity to access a service, determine their needs and receive expert guidance and follow-up services.  We have had many tears in the midlands and I have listened to and shared the many concerns expressed by women in the region.  The best way to serve the people is to establish the best possible system for cancer services.  The discussion on the centres of excellence should be considered definitively and concluded because there is nothing to debate.  If one wants the very best for people, one does not opt for half measures or centres which may be good, one opts for the best.</p>
          <p eId="para_281">The Minister, in speaking about the BreastCheck service, has given me licence to raise this issue.  The roll-out of BreastCheck, a humane system which women understand, has been marvellous.</p>

          <p eId="para_291">In my time, I have heard a great deal of rubbish from that gentleman — he is full of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_292">I have observed BreastCheck and it is a professional, finely tuned, wonderful service.  May I ask the Minister, without interruption, the reason women aged 65 years and over are deemed to be invisible and denied access to the service?  I cannot understand the reason for this.  Many women have told me they are prevented from accessing the service because they are aged over 65 years.  Professor Keane, whom I met recently, seems to be a very good man and he informed me of an aspiration to make the BreastCheck service available to women aged over 65 years.  I want this aspiration to become a reality.</p>
          <p eId="para_293">If BreastCheck is to be a professional, universal programme, one cannot argue in favour of excluding women of a certain age from using it because the incidence of breast cancer in this group is lower than in other groups.  The incidence of breast cancer in women aged over 65 years is high and belies the statistics we often see.  Everybody seems to be afraid to point this out.  We do not need to erect a <i>cordon sanitaire</i> around women of this age, although I wish women in this group were immune from bullies and other obstructions life places before them.  I plead with the Minister to ensure BreastCheck is made available to women aged 65 years and over.  Cervical cancer screening services will be of great benefit to women.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#OlwynEnrightFG" eId="spk_189">
          <from>Deputy Olwyn Enright</from>
          <p eId="para_294">I wish to share time with Deputy Creighton.</p>
          <p eId="para_295">I have listened to some interesting comments in this debate but it is wrong to suggest the women of Ireland were late in voicing their needs.  They have been doing so for a considerable period but the Government has been late in meeting their needs.  The issue of screening has been characterised by a remarkable lack of urgency in all cancer specialties, whether breast or cervical cancer or other cancers affecting men and women.  While progress has been made in rolling out the BreastCheck programme, I understand the service is not universally available.</p>
          <p eId="para_296">I concur with Deputy O'Rourke on the need to address the issue of women aged over 65 years.  I note the Minister and her officials are nodding and hope progress will be made on this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_297">The purpose of today's statements is to discuss cervical cancer services.  The roll-out of services in this area has been remarkably slow.  We have heard accurate statistics on cervical cancer and Deputies largely agree on what is the current position in this area.  Figures show between 170 and 240 new cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed and upwards of 73 women die from the condition annually.  When Deputy Michael Noonan was Minister for Health one of the priorities in the national cancer strategy launched in 1996 was to establish a national screening service for cervical cancer.  When one extrapolates from the figures I cited, one finds that the lives of approximately 900 women could have been saved if the service had been introduced 12 years ago.  This is an important statistic, particularly given that the families of the women who died from this disease are probably still grieving.</p>
          <p eId="para_298">While I welcome the Minister's commitment to roll out a national cervical cancer screening service, we have heard such commitments previously.  I hope in this case it will be met.  Since being elected to the House six years ago, I and other Deputies have repeatedly raised the need to provide cervical cancer screening.  A service is not available to the majority of women in the constituency of Laois-Offaly, which I share with the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy John Moloney.  I look forward to a nationwide service being rolled out without delay.</p>
          <p eId="para_299">I ask the Minister to elaborate on whether a vaccine will be made available.  Judging by her choice of language, it appears she will make a positive decision and provide the vaccine.  I hope that is the case.  The Minister will probably agree that vaccinating young people against cervical cancer will be difficult given the need for parental involvement.  Notwithstanding this, it would be a worthwhile initiative and I hope progress will be made in this matter.  The Minister mentioned that she has the HIQA report.  When the vaccine was rolled out in the UK, the head of cancer research there said that it was an exciting step towards preventing cancer.  Taken in conjunction with screening, it will be an exciting step here and I look forward to it happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_300">I am not expert on pathology, but I have listened to the debate on the issue.  The Minister for Health and Children was previously the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  In my own time as spokesperson on education, I became aware of the difficulty in building an ethos for research and science in Ireland.  The service needs support from that basis.  There are excellent accredited labs in Ireland.  The Minister for Finance spoke about the decision in value for money terms.  Nobody in Fine Gael will say that value for money is not important, but we must also look at long-term value, and not just value for money in one particular contract.  Training people to be qualified pathologists, developing that service around the country but then effectively pulling the rug from under them has a long-term cost which weakens the value for money argument.</p>
          <p eId="para_301">From both positive and negative publicity, women are very aware of breast cancer and the need for self-checking, screening and so  on.  People are a little bit less aware of the need for vigilance about cervical cancer.  The All Ireland Cancer Foundation currently has a road show travelling around the country and a website, <i>www.tellher.ie</i>, which is a good idea.  While I do not normally call for advertising campaigns as we waste money on a lot of them, if we can have an advertising campaign for Transport 21, then we can have a campaign to make people aware of the need for vigilance in this area and the need for screening.</p>

        <speech by="#LucindaCreighton" eId="spk_190">
          <from>Deputy Lucinda Creighton</from>
          <p eId="para_302">I thank Deputy Reilly for giving me the opportunity to speak on this very important motion.  I am again very disappointed to hear a Green Party Deputy speaking from a script clearly prepared by a civil servant and performing a U-turn on his party's position just over 12 months ago.  We used to hear criticisms from the Green Party of the move toward promoting privatisation of the health service above patients, but the party now seems to have bought into this lock, stock and barrel.  I do not know the price the party paid, but it is very disappointing to see that from its public representatives in the Dáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_303">It is disappointing to think that we still do not have a national roll-out of cervical screening and the vaccine service.  They are vital elements in the prevention of cancer in Ireland.  There are more than 240 new cases of cervical cancer every year, with anywhere between 80 and 90 women dying from this illness annually.  I am not sure that we have the right type of response from the Government benches.  Evidence suggests that mortality rates can be cut by 80% with a national roll-out of proper screening.  As a woman, I am very disappointed to see this has not happened yet.</p>
          <p eId="para_304">The Fianna Fáil manifesto promised a national roll-out of cervical screening in 1997.  Five years later, the two Government parties stated that they recognised the need to ensure that people in all parts of the country have reasonable access to cancer services, and that they would ensure this objective is achieved.  That objective has clearly not been achieved.  I sometimes feel sorry for the Minister, as I know that during the last general election, Fianna Fáil candidates in my own constituency blamed her for the problems in the health service.  It is clearly an issue of collective responsibility, but Fianna Fáil always passes the buck and it is more than convenient to blame the Progressive Democrats Party for the problems in the health service, as opposed to taking collective Cabinet responsibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_305">Significant concerns about Quest Diagnostics were clearly outlined by Deputies Reilly and Enright.  The detection rate of pre-cancer cells is 30% lower than that of Irish laboratories, a statistic that has been supported by evidence and educated opinion in the <i>Irish Medical Journal</i> and elsewhere.  That is a major concern and the Minister cannot afford to turn a blind eye to it.  Of equal concern is the credibility and legitimacy of this private company.  Serious question marks hang over the Government’s decision to award the contract to Quest Diagnostics.  An article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on May 15 stated that Quest Diagnostics paid out $40 million in fraud cases in 1998, 2001 and 2004.  Irish women can hardly have trust and confidence in such a company.  It is quite alarming that the Government parties have awarded such a vital contract to a company of such a dubious background.</p>
          <p eId="para_306">There are legal consequences to all this, to which Deputy Reilly alluded.  Council Directive 2004/18 EC clearly states that any economic operator may be excluded from participation in a public service contract where that economic operator has been guilty of grave professional misconduct, proven by any means which the contracting authorities can demonstrate.  This particular contractor has admitted that it has been obliged to pay out $40 million in compensation for fraud, yet the Government is satisfied to award a public contract of national importance to this company.  I find that bizarre and I would like the Minister to give an explanation to the House for it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelDHiggins" eId="spk_191">
          <from>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_307">I listened with great care to the debate that has taken place.  A number of fundamental issues arise.  Some have been touched on in the last contribution.  On the degree of accountability that will be present from the allocation of a contract, moving from a tender to a contract, in the case of State laboratories and the educational preparation of technical and medical personnel, there are elaborate measures of accountability in the public system in respect of professional practice, the duties of institutions and hospitals, and preparation and validation.  These are the skills and accountable mechanisms in a public system.</p>
          <p eId="para_308">The alternative that the Minister described is to move outside the jurisdiction to describe a tendering process where the accountability mechanisms are neither explicit nor under the control of the State.  They are under the gaze of the courts in their own jurisdiction.  It is only fair to say that the favoured tenderer is not alone in drawing one court decision after another, almost all of which are in the same vein and relate to excessive testing where it was unnecessary and where the federal and individual states are involved.  They relate to overpricing and over-billing, and figures of €40 million have been mentioned.  That is the accountability that is offered as the alternative to the public system.</p>
          <p eId="para_309">The Minister mentions that after two years there will be a review and we will move on to a new condition of contract.  In a later flourish she suggests that those who get the contract may have a laboratory in this country.  One may ask if this is in anticipation of the two years or if it is on condition that the contract will be renewed after two years.  These questions can be dealt with reasonably.</p>
          <p eId="para_310">How will the capacity to have diversity in bidding at the end of two years be established if the professionals have been prepared and the equipment purchased but it cannot be seen by RTE cameras and the students who have been prepared have not been allowed to gather experience?  If one wants security in any model of health, one wants it to be integrated where one can deliver accountability and give some certainty.  It is like walking out of one's house and staring at a bungalow in the distance.  What provision is there for continuity for these people and the capacity to prefer an alternative bid in two years' time that would be integrated with the Irish health system?</p>
          <p eId="para_311">I refer to the procurement criteria.  Everyone who spoke rightly emphasised what worries every woman, the natural anxiety about speed and accuracy of diagnosis.  How were the volume and turnaround requirement established as criteria?  The Minister suggests 80% relates to quality and turnaround.  I contradict a point of the Minister, the suggestion that several different units within the Irish system could have combined to offer an alternative to the contract that is coming from abroad.  That does not fit with the facts as I know them and I am perfectly happy to illustrate them.</p>
          <p eId="para_312">There is a suggestion that 20% of the tender assessment was based on cost.  The Minister differs from me politically.  If cost is based on very large volumes with a lower level of quality and performance and a murky level of corporate ethics, does it not worry the Minister that just for the sake of the turnaround and to meet the volumes, she is willing to put at risk the existing and potential infrastructure that might provide a fine service over which she would have full accountability?  She is saying that the corporate ethic of a bidder from abroad, over which she will not have the same level of accountability, is welcome in the short term.  To contrast is to sacrifice good and careful planning at the cost of an immediate knee-jerk response.</p>
          <p eId="para_313">There are those who say none of this matters but it does matter.  Medicine all over the world has been damaged by people who suggest that what is important is a sickness industry rather than a health policy.</p>

          <from>Deputy James Reilly</from>
          <p eId="para_314">Why did the Minister not instruct the HSE to invest in the labs?  When I met the NCSS yesterday, it made clear that its role was procurement and that laboratories were none of its business.  That points the finger firmly at the Minister.  It is objectionable that the NCSS would issue a statement impugning my consideration of women and delay this project, for which I have called for nine years.  Having waited that length of time and having lost many lives as a consequence of the delays of the Government that has been in power all that time, the Minister will now rush in at the end and will, as many Members pointed out, cause the fragmentation of our public health service.  I can only surmise this is a further part of the agenda to undermine the public health service, in addition to privatisation drives, co-located hospitals and other initiatives.</p>
          <p eId="para_315">Why did the Minister not allow investment in the labs to proceed?  Will the Minister confirm that Altnagelvin Hospital, which operates under the Western Health and Social Care Trust of Northern Ireland and covered the north west, is deeply unhappy with the way the tender was carried out and is threatening legal action?</p>

        <speech by="#MaryHarney" as="#Minister_for_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_193">
          <from>Minister for Health and Children (Deputy Mary Harney)</from>
          <p eId="para_316">The NCSS is independent of the HSE.  It is a stand-alone body and reports to the Department and the Minister for Health and Children.  I have confidence in the screening service and Deputies have attested to their experiences of BreastCheck, which is acknowledged domestically and internationally to have been rolled out in a most appropriate fashion.  When I asked the NCSS to roll out a cervical screening programme I did not tell it how to do it.  I have confidence in its capacity to make those decisions.  As Minister for Health and Children, I make the policy and allow those with expertise to implement it at clinical level or at other levels.</p>
          <p eId="para_317">Deputy Higgins asked why we decided on 25,000 as a minimum throughput and a ten day turnaround.  We did so because these are the international standards.  We will not have quality assurance and the women of Ireland will not have the best possible cervical screening standard unless we follow international best practice, as followed in the UK and several other countries that have introduced effective screening programmes and reduced mortality from cervical cancer by 80%.  In our case we could reduce it by up to 60 women per year out of 75.  I refer the Deputy to page 163 of the European Standard.  I did not invent this, I provided the money and asked the experts to put a cervical screening programme into effect for women affected, aged between 25 and 60, as quickly as possible.  Furthermore, there was a two-stage tender process that was robust and transparent.  They did not have to go to tender.</p>

          <p eId="para_322">On the public laboratories and the HSE, the HSE, as the Deputy will be aware, undertook a review of laboratory services.  The review is quite controversial because it makes radical proposals on what we need to do in terms of laboratory facilities in the public health system to ensure quality assured facilities are available to patients.  No question arises in respect of resources.  It is a matter for the HSE, Professor Drumm, and his management team to advance the recommendations in that review in the interests of the public health system.</p>

          <p eId="para_351">The Minister has accepted she has a role to play.  Perhaps then she will clarify for me what is that role.  Does it include protecting the skills of cytology laboratory staff in this country into the future?  Does the Minister have a role in this regard?  Also, is there any joined-up thinking between the Minister and the Minister for Education and Science in terms of the students in DIT who are currently pursuing this course or have pursued it in the past?  Is there any role for Government in this or is it completely a matter for a company from which the Minister has distanced herself?  I have no problem with the company which is doing a good job.</p>
          <p eId="para_352">Will the Minister accept that she as Minister for Health and Children has a role in this in terms of the long-term interests of the country?  Does she accept that there were laboratories in Ireland that met the standard qualification criteria in this regard and who made a bid for the contract?  The Minister appears to be implying Irish laboratories do not have the required qualifications.  My understanding is that there are laboratories in Ireland that can meet the ten day turnaround requirement and are accredited.  Does the Minister accept that this is the case?  My understanding is that it is the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_353">Does the Minister accept that Dr. McGoogan's report specifically states that the turnaround time should be four working weeks?  Why was this timeframe reduced to ten days?  Was consideration given to the fact that laboratories in Ireland were not given the resources to bring themselves up to the required standard?  While some are up to standard those that had almost obtained accreditation had a terribly hard time obtaining the resources required to enable them reach the accreditation standard.  It is understandable the laboratories assumed that if they could meet the four-week turnaround time they would qualify for the contract.</p>
          <p eId="para_354">It is unacceptable for the Minister for Health and Children to say she has no role in the matter or that she cannot interfere in the process.  The fact that the contract will be awarded to a company outside the country and that cytology services will be located a couple of thousand miles away from all other services provided for patients is her responsibility.</p>

          <p eId="para_355">I have a lot to do with it, Deputy.  My obligation is to ensure there is in place a screening programme and to get Government backing for it.  This means I must obtain resources to allow the screening service to recruit staff, roll out the programme and to pay for cytology services and smear testing.  It is also my responsibility to ensure the service being rolled out is quality assured and is not inferior.  The cost of the service is not at issue as alleged earlier by Deputy Reilly.  What is important is the quality of service provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_356">I am not distancing myself from any company.  I am simply saying that I have no connections with it contrary to stories planted by various individuals in the tabloid media.  I have never met anyone from the company and I know nothing about it.  In fact, I had never heard of the company until last year when the HSE outsourced work to it.</p>

          <p eId="para_360">As regards turnaround times, the laboratory must turnaround a result within ten days of receipt of a smear.  This is necessary to facilitate the woman receiving a result within four weeks.  This is as recommended in the standards and is not inconsistent with Dr. McGoogan's report which referred to the necessity for women to receive a result within four weeks.  The smear must be taken, forwarded to the laboratory and returned by it before the woman can be contacted in regard to the result and any necessary follow-up treatment such as colposcopy and so on can be arranged.  For a woman to obtain a result within four weeks a laboratory must turnaround a test within ten days.</p>
          <p eId="para_361">I should point out that the Royal College of Physicians in Ireland has stated: "In line with our mission to promote the health of the nation the College supports [this was issued last night] the implementation of the national cervical screening programme and the goal of reducing waiting times for smear test results....".  The national screening service has met with and agreed to work with the college in this regard.  There has never been forced redundancy in the public sector.  I do not know why people are suggesting 70 or 100 people will lose their jobs.</p>

          <p eId="para_369">The Minister stated last October in a reply to Deputy Ó Caoláin: "Yes, ideally we must have our own laboratory facilities in Ireland."  Does the Minister not agree these facilities already exist?  We have the trained technicians which the public health service needs if it is to develop.</p>
          <p eId="para_370">Will the Minister agree that sending the entire screening programme outside the country is moving in the opposite direction and that we will not in the future have the capacity or laboratory facilities required if this proposal proceeds?  In doing this, the Minister is endangering women's lives especially given the diagnostic rate of pre-cancer cells at Quest is 30% less than that which pertains in Irish laboratories.  How does this square with the Minister's quality assured service?  This decision is putting women's lives at risk.  It is not good enough for the Minister to lay the blame on the NCSS and to wash her hands of its decision.  She is the Minister and is responsible and will be responsible if the death rate increases.  We have an opportunity to increase the capacity of the laboratories in Ireland, to ensure that the screening programme is rolled out properly and to ensure that we have quality assurance in Ireland in laboratories which are responsible and accountable to the Irish health service, not to a company which has been found guilty of fraud continuously.</p>

          <p eId="para_371">Of course we want to have quality-assured laboratory facilities in Ireland.  Among the recommendations in the McGoogan report, which has been quoted here this morning, is the need to rationalise our laboratory services.  When I was in British Columbia two years ago as part of the advanced preparation of the cancer control programme, I noted that a laboratory there dealt with 600,000 smear tests per year.  That is the volume it deals with to get the quality assurance that is required.  I am not suggesting that we move to 600,000 here but I am simply saying that is what is happening in other places.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_391">My question arises from one of the Minister's earlier replies.  No one is suggesting that she should behave improperly in relation to the negotiation of a contract, which is beyond her ministerial competence or responsibility.  I am concerned that regarding the review of the State or public systems, the Minister said that the report is now a matter for Professor Drumm.  I am sticking strictly here to what I have competence in, which relates to political responsibility and policy.  The Minister said that one matter is outside the area of policy altogether, namely, impropriety.  Let us agree on that point.  However, she then referred to Professor Drumm and said that he has responsibility for the preparation of the existing services that we have, the provision of resources, the creation of their capacity, the utilisation of the existing staff, the training and placement of student staff and so forth, but these are matters of policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_392">My point is very simple.  The Minister for Health and Children is responsible for the situation in which she finds herself.  There is much we all agree on in wanting to assure women in the speediest, shortest and most certain way.  While the Minister has that situation to deal with, she also has the issue of future planning to address and future planning is crucially a matter of policy.  On the basis of what we have heard, the Minister will have just the guarantee of a contract.  We are contracting an international provider.  That provider has assured the tendering process in terms of turn-around and volume.  However, the Minister does not have the capacity to give guarantees, beyond the present even and into the future, with a contract relationship.  The contract relationship itself is under a considerable shadow because of the performance of those with corporate responsibility in a number of areas which I will not go into now.  That is a matter of concern.</p>
          <p eId="para_393">It is an inescapable issue of policy and what we should hear today is how the Minister will take responsibility for the situation.  Let us say two years from now, having assured us that those who have given work in laboratories, have invested in equipment and have come through specific training will be able to meet the volume and turn-around requirements, how will she be able to say they can enter the field?  The Minister for Education and Science is responsible for education matters.  The Minister for Health and Children used to be responsible for health matters.  The Minister cannot say that one aspect is to do with contracts over the waves in America, that Professor Drumm is waiting to take responsibility for everything that is left over and she is just in the Chamber to tell us about volumes and turn-around.  The Minister cannot do that.  She has a responsibility to show the capacity of that which is not being chosen and how it makes its way into the future, for the sake of national security and the integration of the health services.</p>

          <p eId="para_394">On the issue of the published paper by St. Luke's, having spoken to the author this morning, I understand the study showed a 1.9% pick-up rate for high-grade, pre-invasive cancers.  When the author compared St. Luke's work to that of Quest, he found that the figure for St. Luke's remained at 1.9%, while the figure for Quest was only 1.2%.  They are the facts that have been given to me.  I suggest, as we have been having trouble over a lot of facts recently, that HIQA might be involved, as suggested by Deputy Stagg, to adjudicate on the matter and provide clarity.  I do not want to mislead anybody and nor, I hope, does the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_395">I wish to raise again an issue raised by Deputy Creighton and myself earlier in the debate and ask the Minister to give a definitive answer.  The Minister must accept responsibility for a situation where a company, which has been reported as being guilty of fraud on three separate occasions, is the preferred bidder in the tendering process.  Council Directive 2004/18/EC states that a company can be excluded from participation in a contract where it "has been guilty of grave professional misconduct proven by any means which the contracting authorities can demonstrate".  I put it to the Minister that it has been pretty well demonstrated by the authorities in the United States that this is serious.  I consider that $40 million in fraud claims represents serious professional misconduct.  What is the Minister's attitude to this and can she assure the people that they are not putting themselves in the hands of individuals and a company that we will regret employing in the future?  In fact, there could even be litigation involved here.</p>

It does work in the US and for the NHS in the United Kingdom.  Even if the preferred bidder did not proceed, I am not certain that the next on the list is an Irish laboratory.  I am not certain of that.  There seems to be an assumption that if we can get these people off the pitch, through some interference in the tendering process, then one of our own laboratories will suddenly succeed.</p>

The report commissioned by the HSE and the McGoogan report both refer to rationalisation.  I do not know enough about hot labs and cold labs and all that detail because I have no expertise in the area.  However, rationalisation of our laboratory facilities will be required to make sure we have quality-assured facilities for the public health system in Ireland.  This is the task of the HSE.  It is not a resource issue.  It is about redeploying the resources we already invested in these facilities.  If we do not have rationalisation, we will not have appropriate quality.</p>

        <speech by="#CharlesFlanagan" eId="spk_292">
          <from>Deputy Charles Flanagan</from>
          <p eId="para_436">Last evening, I made the rather obvious point that a certain momentum has been building up for reform in this area over the past number of years.  I acknowledge a significant element of public disquiet in so far as the handling of complaints is concerned with regard to speed, transparency and accountability.  A perception exists that matters are not as independent as they might be.</p>
          <p eId="para_437">This issue formed part of an independent report of the Competition Authority published towards the end of 2006.  It pointed to a pressing need to introduce reform in this area and provided the impetus for debate on the subject of regulation of the legal profession and of the provision of legal services to the citizen.  This topic has been aired extensively in the print media and on the local and national airwaves.  It has also been the subject matter of conferences for interested parties.  This debate is ongoing.  It is a healthy process which helps clarify the role and responsibilities of professionals engaged in the provision of legal services, the Bar Council and the Law Society.</p>
          <p eId="para_438">The issue of regulation versus representation is also raised and a significant body of deep blue water is required between the two.  One cannot act as an advocate or representative on one hand and objectively engage in a process of regulatory vigilance on the other.  It is generally accepted this conflict existed and needed to be addressed.  Such a difficulty arose not only in the legal profession, but also with regard to accountants, dentists and doctors.  It is important to have an element of independent oversight to ensure the interest is not vested in a way that gives rise to a perception on the part of the public that matters are not being dealt with in an open way.</p>
          <p eId="para_439">The 2006 Competition Authority report pointed to a need for new legislation.  It made 29 recommendations, including empowering consumers by requiring the Law Society and the Bar Council to actively provide useful and accessible information to consumers about their rights and about key features of legal services, such as how legal fees are determined.  This was assisted by a legislative initiative through the 1994 amendments to the Solicitors Acts which provided for an onus on the part of the legal practitioner to provide, in so far as feasible, an estimate of the costs involved.  This is a requirement and has the force of law.  To my mind, it has brought about welcome changes.</p>
          <p eId="para_440">Another recommendation of the Competition Authority report is to extend access to barristers for legal advice to all members of the public without the necessity to engage the services of a solicitor.  Further recommendations are to allow barristers to form partnerships, solicitors to form limited partnerships and to require solicitors whose clients wish to switch to another solicitor to hand over the client's file to the new solicitor in a prompt manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_441">This latter issue gives rise to serious complaints and it is difficult for the public to understand the delays involved or the manner in which documentation, which may be the property of the legal adviser but nevertheless pertains to the person to whom the legal service is being provided, is dealt with.  It is important the profession ensures a strict requirement that where an alternative legal firm becomes involved in a case, all the necessary papers are made available in a prompt manner and in a way which ensures the consumer of the service is not left in a position of disadvantage.</p>
          <p eId="para_442">There is no doubt that the reputation of legal professionals as a whole has been damaged by a number of recent high profile events involving certain members of the profession.  It is unfortunate that a small number of individuals have succeeded in damaging the reputation of the legal profession as a whole.  Having practised law myself for many years, I know a great many solicitors and barristers who, without exception, carry out excellent work in an honourable manner and professional way and engage in the use of the highest possible standards.  It is a cliché to state that bad apples turn up from time to time in every profession but unfortunately this is what has happened and the legal profession is not immune to such practices.</p>
          <p eId="para_443">It is important that individuals who have brought the legal profession into disrepute are subject to due process and held accountable for their actions.  If a myth or perception exists that people operate outside the law or that the law favours people with certain status or in certain categories of society, then it should be exposed as such.  The sooner particular matters are dealt with comprehensively, the better.  If criminal proceedings are to follow, let them take their course.  It is essential that legal practitioners, no matter who they are or what professional qualifications they hold, are held accountable for their actions if public faith in the legal profession is to be maintained and not tarnished.  It is important and absolutely essential that they be held accountable for their actions if public faith in the legal profession is to be maintained and not tarnished.  Notwithstanding the rarity of such cases involving the recent high profile Dublin issues, these incidents have underlined the need for change and the urgency in proceeding with this legislation.  The Bill is a good start in introducing constructive changes.</p>
          <p eId="para_444">The establishment of the legal services ombudsman office follows on a long line of ombudsman offices and our experience has been positive, happy and satisfactory over the years.  Emily O'Reilly, the current Ombudsman, is widely respected for the objective and professional manner in which she carries out her duties and responsibilities.  Recently she was appointed as a leading light in the ombudsman association for the UK and Ireland.  That is the measure of the esteem and standing in which she is held by her colleagues.  Her predecessor, Michael Mills, who died recently, was from my county.  I pay tribute to him for his great pioneering work as Ireland's first Ombudsman.  He had the opportunity to define the role of the office, which he did with considerable skill.  The recent creation of the positions of Press Ombudsman and the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission reflect the widely held belief that the post of ombudsman easily facilitates independence, impartiality, professionalism and expediency in dealing with matters in a way that can provide the best service to the citizen.</p>
          <p eId="para_445">As I have stated in the past regarding other ombudsman posts, it is essential the legal services ombudsman's office is well resourced if it is to function in an efficient manner.  The Bill proposes to place part of the burden of costs on the Law Society and the Bar Council with the Government making up the rest if there is a shortfall.  It is crucial the Government honours its commitments in this regard and facilitates the smooth and efficient operation of the office.  While it may be too early to pass judgment, the indications from the office of the recently established Press Ombudsman and the office of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, which was established 12 months ago, are that they are moving in a satisfactory direction from a public service point of view.  Failure by the Government to honour its commitments would make a mockery of the creation of the post and it would undermine the spirit of the proposed legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_446">On the matter of costs, the Bill requires the Bar Council and the Law Society to pay an annual levy to fund the ombudsman's office.  Each association will be liable to pay 10% of the approved expenses of the office and the remaining 80% will be paid <i>pro rata </i>according to the number of complaints made to the ombudsman regarding barristers and solicitors.  This is an interesting proposal and I hope it will operate smoothly in practice.  We will have an opportunity to monitor progress by dint of the requirement on the ombudsman to report to us.  I greatly welcome the provision in respect of the responsibilities of the ombudsman to report to the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_447">Unfortunately, myself and my colleagues in Opposition sometimes find ourselves fighting a rearguard action to maintain the integrity and uphold the central importance of this Assembly in the face of repeated Government attempts to enforce total Executive dominance over the Parliament.  The Ceann Comhairle witnesses this on a daily basis and it is an issue to which we must return with seriousness in the context of the consequences of the Lisbon treaty, under which the scrutiny by national parliaments of laws will require greater vigilance on the part of the House.  It is important to ensure the committees are equipped with resources, legal advisers and specialists, particularly in the complex area of EU law.  I look forward to returning to this matter next week because this anti-democratic trend has been highlighted in recent years by the creation of a host of quangos and authorities without any measure of accountability and by the Government press conference being substituted for accountability to the Legislature.  The proposals contained in the Bill, which require the ombudsman to make regular reports to the Oireachtas and the Minister, are welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_448">Not only will the ombudsman be empowered to deal with complaints, under section 9 he or she will be required from time to time to make submissions in respect of entry to the legal profession.  That will empower him or her in a way that no other ombudsman is sufficiently empowered currently.  The ombudsman will be required to assess the adequacy of admissions policy of both the Bar Council and the Law Society and to promote public awareness of the complaints procedures of the two bodies, which is important.  There is not much point in setting up an ombudsman's office if people are not aware of its existence.  The office will have to be properly and adequately funded from an early date because information is knowledge and if people do not know about the office, they will not use its services.</p>
          <p eId="para_449">The Law Society and the Bar Council had a number of concerns regarding the report of the Competition Authority, which recommended extreme changes to current practice in certain contexts.  Both bodies made submissions to the authority's proposals with the Law Society submission being particularly lengthy.  However, both have shown a willingness in the context of the authority's report, which contained unpalatable recommendations, to embrace change and both arms of the profession have welcomed the Bill.  The Law Society stated recently it unreservedly recognised the system can be improved and welcomed the legislation to introduce an ombudsman, together with the non-lawyer majority on the society's complaints and client relations committee.  It is often overlooked in media reportage that this committee comprises an independent lay majority, which gives a lie to the myth that the society is a closed shop controlled by vested interests.</p>
          <p eId="para_450">The Bar Council described this Bill as "a progressive step in improving access to justice and the administration of justice".  The Law Society recently took the initiative of providing all of its members with a comprehensive document entitled, Solicitors' Terms and Conditions of Engagement.  The document prepared by the society's guidance and ethics committee reflects the spirit of the proposed legislation, which must be acknowledged.  There is a clear responsibility on members of the profession to engage with their clients from an early stage to set out in considerable detail not only the costs involved but also the difficulties that might arise.  The ethics committee of the Law Society has made recommendations as to how difficulties that unfortunately arise can be avoided.  The document states that:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_451">The business of solicitors' firms is to sell legal services.  As with any business, the owners hope that members of the public who come to do business with the firm will have a good experience and a satisfactory result, so that they will recommend the firm to others and the business will thrive.  This is more likely to happen if both parties are clear about the service that is being offered.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_452">Often when difficulties arise between a solicitor and a client, this may be because there is a gap between the client's expectations of the level of service that was to be provided by the solicitor and the solicitor's intentions in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_453">This document spells out in a comprehensive way the importance of the letter of engagement in the early stages from the solicitor to the client.  The document states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_454">A letter of engagement formally sets out the terms and conditions on which the solicitor's firm will carry out work for the client.  It should define the relationship between the client and the solicitor and will then form the basis of the contract between them.</p>
          <p eId="para_455">So the manner of the difficulty can lead to the origin of the contract between the two parties.  The document also states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_456">It is important that the client is clear about the role of the solicitor — what it includes as well as what it excludes — and that there is agreement between the solicitor and the client as to the extent of the solicitor's duties.  It may be obvious to the solicitor, but if a client has not dealt with a solicitor before, they may simply not know what to expect.</p>
          <p eId="para_457">So this letter of engagement will help to ensure there is no gap between the expectations of citizens or the consumer and the reality of what is being offered in terms of the provision of the service.  It is also interesting to note that the document recommends the letter of engagement be set out in plain language.  This is a difficulty that has arisen and continues to arise from time to time in a way that is unacceptable.  Much of the documentation can be couched in legal jargon which is not easily understood by the client.  I often wonder whether this gap between members of the profession and members of the public is evident in such a way as to ensure that both parties are not on an even keel and that the playing pitch is not even.  I would go further and say this is probably one of the reasons why, for example, in the hallowed halls of the Four Courts, barristers still dress in a manner which can often be off-putting to members of the public and can in many ways be a disconcerting experience.  It is important the letter of engagement is written in plain language and is capable of being easily understood by the client.</p>
          <p eId="para_458">The Law Society has offered a precedent which is a simple statement of the terms and conditions on which the business will be done by a firm.  If that matter is subjected to a dispute, the letter can be used as a way to resolve the difficulty.  The letter has been approved by the National Adult Literacy Agency in respect of its clarity and the plain English used and is a sample of best practice.  This initiative by the Law Society is welcome.  The clarity brought about by such an initiative fits in well with the present reform agenda and I hope similar initiatives will be taken in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_459">This Bill will offer the member of the public who has a complaint an opportunity to deal with an office that is entirely independent and that will be resourced in such a way as to ensure there are no delays or backlogs, that the service can be speedy and efficient and that, more than anything, the service can be fair and impartial.  Along with colleagues, I look forward to monitoring the office of the ombudsman, receiving the report of that office and ensuring that if there are problems of the type that might not immediately be apparent, the matter can be revisited at some stage in the future in the event of amending legislation being necessary.  It is very important in the provision of legal services that the confidence of the public be maintained.</p>
          <p eId="para_460">Regrettably, particularly in light of some recent high-profile cases involving a minority, this public confidence has been dented.  This Bill is an essential step in restoring and maintaining confidence in a profession that has suffered from the actions of less than a handful of practitioners.  The ombudsman model has served us well and I expect the legal services ombudsman will continue the legacy of fairness and efficiency created and maintained by previous and serving ombudsman office holders.  I look forward to examining the setting up of the office, the powers of the ombudsman and the nature of the work when we have an opportunity to go through matters on a line by line basis on Committee Stage.  I look forward to contributing at that stage.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryORourke" eId="spk_293">
          <from>Deputy Mary O’Rourke</from>
          <p eId="para_461">I was telephoned by the office of the Government Chief Whip and I understand the Opposition party is not speaking.  It is not that I am taking its place.  As the Acting Chairman is aware, there is a tradition of moving around the House and I am glad to have the opportunity to speak in an informal sense about this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_462">For many years, I wondered why this Bill did not come about.  There is no doubt that we live in an age of ombudsmen.  We live in an age when people rightly require that decisions taken by others, albeit sometimes for their good, can first be explained and then explored if they do not come out in their regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_463">I shall not be long in case Deputy D'Arcy is thinking of bolting.  I am only taking ten minutes.  I count many people of the legal fraternity, particularly many solicitors, among my personal friends.  I have always found them to be very robust, thorough and concerned with their clients' wishes and what they mean to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_464">Deputy Charles Flanagan raised a very important point at the end of his speech, namely, the language contained in the letter of engagement.  My gripe about the legal profession is that its members understand each other.  They love each other if they are not facing each other in court.  They like and speak their language.  Outside of that magic circle, we often do not know what they are talking about.  I am not talking about judicial decisions.  I have never commented on what a judge has said or done because it is not my business to do so.  However, as a public representative, I am the conduit for people who have felt that they have not been best served by the legal system.  I have a particular case in mind which I shall not go into.</p>
          <p eId="para_465">The cases that come to a Deputy inform his or her debate, as they should because we are sent here to put forward our points of view.  I am thinking of a particular case involving a separated mother with grown-up children and now grandchildren and her business arrangement with a particular legal representative and how that was handled, or mishandled, on her behalf.  She was told to be at the High Court in Dublin on such a day when the case would be heard.  She went to the High Court, waited outside the court and the solicitors for both sides, who were engaged in heavy dialogue, eventually came over to her and told her it was all settled.  She asked them what did they mean by saying it was all settled.  They told her they had settled it.  She was the person involved who was at the High Court to see she got justice, but the two solicitors had got together and decided they would settle the case and she was not brought into that dialogue at that end point.  She felt she got a very raw deal.</p>
          <p eId="para_466">I thought about her case afterwards, what I would do about it and whether I would write to the Law Society about it.  According to the society's remit, it is well handled and a nice man is in charge of it, but the society is judging its members, which is a difficult task.  Deputy Flanagan, who is a hugely welcome addition back to the Dáil — I am sure I am too, at least I will pat myself on the back if the Deputy does not — would have his own views on this matter.  However, he is a member of that profession so he may not agree with what I am saying.  I asked that woman why she did not tell the solicitors that the way they settled the case did not suit her.  She said they just went home each in his own big car and she was left to make her way back to Athlone with the settlement arranged over her head, even though she was on the spot outside the court.  I found that appalling.  She had no redress.</p>
          <p eId="para_467">I advised her to take her case to somebody else.  She went back to her solicitor and he said he could not release the file unless she paid him some horrendous amount of money.  I cannot remember the amount.  He would not release her file to enable her to bring the case to another legal representative unless she handed over a huge amount of money.  I thought that was wrong in itself that somebody would deal with a matter such as this in that fashion.  This lady is well educated and is a woman of the world.  The issue is that she was ignored as the solicitors on both sides reached a settlement and her wishes were subsumed.  They told her they had it all done and dusted and that they may as well all go home.</p>
          <p eId="para_468">If the office of a legal services ombudsman, the establishment of which is provided for in the Bill, is a place to which a person, such as this woman, could bring his or her gripe, then it should be a good place.  However, I have a concern about it.  I have had the experience of dealing with the offices of a few ombudsmen.  The Ombudsman, Ms Emily O'Reilly, is doing a wonderful job.  One can be truly certain that if one brings a case to her attention, it will be followed up, impartially, and that the interests of the appellant will be represented.  I have also found the pensions ombudsman to be excellent.  However, I have a concern about a legal ombudsman.  I hope the person who gets this job will not be a legal person.  It would be a distortion of justice if a legal person got that job.  The office holder may have staff who are legal people, but the legal ombudsman should not have legal experience because, irrespective of how hard he or she tried, the system would become self-regulatory.  Self-regulation does not work.  It cannot work because under such a system the profession judges its own members.</p>
          <p eId="para_469">I welcome the contents of the Bill.  I welcome the idea that the letter of engagement between client and his or her solicitor is to be in plain language.  I understand plain language because it is what we all understand, but those in legal practice have words which ordinary people do not understand.  They use terminology which is often obtuse and it does not work to the benefit of the consumer.  The term "letter of engagement" is a good one — the client engages with his or her legal representative.  It is provided that the letter of engagement should be in plain language.  One might ask what is plain language.  It is the language one hears in one's local pub, shop, post office or on the street as one goes about one's business; it is not legal language.  I am sorry if in saying that I cause offence to legal people who are present, but matters such as this need to be said.</p>
          <p eId="para_470">We have a duty to the people we represent to ensure the legislation we introduce reflects their point of view and how they feel they have been treated or mistreated by the legal profession.  Rather than the legal profession treating it as an onerous burden, if people say they intend to bring a case to the legal ombudsman, I would say fair dues to them, that is the person to whom they should go to get redress.  However, a person will only get that if the legal ombudsman is not a legal person.</p>
          <p eId="para_471">Teasing out of the provisions of the Bill on Committee Stage will be interesting.  It will serve the public well and it is long overdue.  I hope our knowledge of how ombudsmen operate will permeate the workings of this ombudsman's office when it is set up.  I also hope it will operate for the benefit of the ordinary people who will be able to say that they went to this office and the steps to be taken were laid out for them.  While the case may work out in favour of the person concerned, it may not, but I believe it may well do so.  I wish the Bill every success.  I hope the work of the legal ombudsman's office will be to the benefit of the public.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelWDArcy" eId="spk_297">
          <from>Deputy Michael D’Arcy</from>
          <p eId="para_475">It is pleasure to speak on this Bill.  It will be progressive legislation.  While it may be difficult for some in the legal profession to welcome this legislation, it is long overdue.</p>
          <p eId="para_476">I very much agree with what Deputy O'Rourke said about the language used by the legal profession.  It is somewhat archaic.  Joe and Josephine Soap on the street, in the pub or elsewhere truly do not understand what is being said in the context of legal language.  A number of people, on leaving a solicitor's office, have come to me as their public representative to assist them decipher what is being said in a legal context.  It is nearly an impossibility for any of us to decipher that.  The legalese that is spoken for too long and too often needs to be brought down to much plainer language.  Certainly, Deputy O'Rourke was very much correct on that point.</p>
          <p eId="para_477">The legal profession needs this Bill as much as the public needs it.  There has been much talk of a number of high profile cases.  Prior to getting to the nub of that issue, I want to make the point that the vast majority of people who work within the legal services sector, whether barristers or solicitors, work on behalf of their clients and do a good job.  I do not believe there are any greater or fewer members of that profession, whether barristers or solicitors, who are any more greedy or self-serving than in any other profession, be it politics, medicine or business.  That said, I have some harsh things to say about those who stray offside and move way beyond their remit in terms of the service they provide for their clients.</p>
          <p eId="para_478">The separation of powers in terms of the Legislature, the Executive and the Judiciary are clearly set out in the Constitution.  A massive body of administration is formed by the Government, the Courts Service and other Government agencies.  People are dissatisfied with that administrative body.</p>
          <p eId="para_479">Other professions have ombudsmen and professional councils.  A majority of the members of the Veterinary Council of Ireland and the Medical Council are not members of those professions.  Deputy Flanagan referred to committees within the Law Society of Ireland.  However, I believe the majority of the members of the Council of the Law Society are members of the legal profession.  The only other council which has a majority of members from within its profession is the Press Council.  However, that is a discussion for another day.</p>
          <p eId="para_480">Access to the Law Society and its committees is not sufficient at present.  That is why the Bill will be of major benefit to citizens.  People are intimidated by having to go to the Law Society or the Bar Council.  One hopes it is something very few people ever have to do.  Unfortunately, that need seems to arise more and more often.  The procedure is too slow, cumbersome and difficult.  More often than not, people need some form of legal advice, whether professional or from the citizens information service or some other source.  The Bill will go a long way towards benefiting the public in availing of the legal services ombudsman.</p>
          <p eId="para_481">The history of ombudsmen goes back to 1984.  Since then we have had a very beneficial experience of those people who have acted on behalf of the public.  We now have the Ombudsman for Children, the Financial Services Ombudsman, the Press Ombudsman, the Garda Ombudsman as well as Ms Emily O'Reilly, the State Ombudsman.  People's experience of the Ombudsman is good.  The office is independent, strong and accountable.  For too long, structures were established which were not answerable to elected representatives.  The annual report of the legal services ombudsman will come before a committee of the Oireachtas where it will be scrutinised and analysed in detail.</p>
          <p eId="para_482">One will not need a lawyer to access the legal services ombudsman.  It may even be possible for members of the public to receive assistance by telephone.  I was pleased to read that section 27 of the Bill will render it an offence to obstruct the ombudsman in the performance of his or her duties.  Too often, structures are established without teeth.  It is important that obstructing the legal services ombudsman will be an offence.  This measure will give the office the power to provide a truly independent advocacy on behalf of clients.</p>
          <p eId="para_483">In recent years groups like the Victims of the Legal Profession Society and the Rate My Solicitor website have sprouted up in response to the public's concern about sharp practice, overcharging and other abuses in the legal profession.  A profession that was once considered noble is now viewed by many with suspicion.  It is, perhaps, the only profession for which the public have less respect than our own.</p>
          <p eId="para_484">Programmes like "Prime Time" on RTE, which reported on overcharging and professional misconduct by solicitors, have added to the perception that the legal profession, generally, is engaged in such practices.  Very good investigative media work by RTE exposed overcharging in Army deafness claims.  In a number of cases clients were not only overcharged but double charged.  Solicitors who had been paid by the State also took funds from awards.</p>
          <p eId="para_485">This is extremely damaging to those who provide a good and important service to their clients.  They are tainted by the small minority who have engaged in malpractice.  This has led to a considerable lack of trust in the legal profession generally.  Before I became a Member of this House I studied for Law Society of Ireland examinations.  I got the opportunity to watch at close hand how the profession works.  Not being a fully fledged member of the profession, I was able to watch and be objective in my views.  I saw how things work and how sharp practice operates.  It was an enlightening experience.</p>
          <p eId="para_486">The high profile cases of recent rogue solicitors like Mr. Michael Lynn and Mr. Thomas Byrne give rise to a view in the public consciousness of solicitors and barristers getting away with serious wrongdoing.  Anything which can improve on accountability and add to the protection of clients is desirable for them and for the profession generally.</p>
          <p eId="para_487">That said, many of those working in the legal profession are strongly of the view that it is the form and structure of the legal profession which needs to be looked at.  They believe that the form and structures currently in place are at the root of the problem.  They also believe that the changes needed cannot be brought about by the Law Society.  Indeed, the view is that the Law Society itself is part of this form and structure which needs to change.  Solicitors have to work with the system that is there.  They argue that it is this very system that is flawed.  They believe that if the form and structure of the legal system was amended it would have a hugely beneficial effect on such areas as family law and litigation, to name but two.</p>
          <p eId="para_488">It is, therefore, imperative that the proposed ombudsman be given the powers to look at the very form and structure of the legal profession.   As currently proposed, the office of the legal services ombudsman would not have such powers.   This is a missed opportunity.   The legal profession is undergoing a period of fundamental change.  Now is the opportunity to direct these changes.  It would be a great shame and a squandered opportunity to go ahead and appoint a legal services ombudsman and not equip that person with sufficient powers to get to the very root of the problems that have brought the legal profession into disrepute.</p>
          <p eId="para_489">I would like to see more detail on section 27.  I hope this section will be amended on Committee Stage to ensure that sanctions for the offences listed in the section are significant.  It must be made clear that the risk of obstructing the ombudsman will be a great one.</p>
          <p eId="para_490">I must touch on the under-representation of the smaller legal firms.   I speak as a representative of a rural constituency.  The majority of legal firms in Ireland are small and made up of two or three solicitors.  Yet, committees of the Law Society are, to a large extent, made up of solicitors from the big law firms in the country.  This leaves the smaller firms without a voice and without a means of effecting change themselves.  This is something which should be addressed and the time to do it is now, in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_491">Up to now the legal profession has been self-regulated and it is obvious that this has not worked.  What is needed is the appointment of a person with real powers to take up cases which have not been resolved by the Law Society or the Bar Council.  This effectively provides another form of redress to disaffected clients.</p>
          <p eId="para_492">Another forum for the resolution of complaints is also a benefit to the profession.  Any process that improves transparency and accountability in the system will help restore trust and faith in it.  Currently, the only redress for anyone dissatisfied with an adjudication by the Law Society or the Bar Council is the courts.  This poses certain difficulties such as getting a solicitor to act against another solicitor and a court hearing takes time.  The number of people willing to follow that route, let alone fund it, is small.</p>
          <p eId="para_493">Regarding the operation of the ombudsman's office, it is good procedure to allow complaints to be made by any person on behalf of another.  Sometimes a complainant may be unable, through ill health, infirmity or other reasons, to do so themselves.  It is also correct to have a six-month deadline for complaints to be taken to the ombudsman, following the matter being adjudicated upon by the Bar Council or the Law Society.  This ensures complaints are expedited in a timely manner instead of dragging on for years.</p>
          <p eId="para_494">Another positive provision is that if the ombudsman decides not to proceed with a complaint that a person is making, the person or body against whom it is being made will be notified of the decision and the reason for it.  It is important that such decisions are written in a comprehensive form.</p>
          <p eId="para_495">It is proposed that the ombudsman will take submissions from the complainant and investigate them in private.  Any person with information may be requested to produce it and may be required to attend, if necessary, the office for that purpose.  It is correct that all avenues would be opened to allow full and proper investigation of complaints.  Section 27 needs to be expanded to outline what offences can be considered.</p>
          <p eId="para_496">It is right that the ombudsman will be wholly independent, with the required qualifications, experience, training and expertise.  Deputy Mary O'Rourke questioned whether the appointee should be from the legal profession.  That can be explored on Committee Stage.  If the ombudsman comes from the legal profession, an argument could be made that it is a closed shop.  I believe there are many possible candidates from other professions capable of making objective decisions.  There is a need to demonstrate the office's complete separateness from the legal profession.</p>
          <p eId="para_497">The ombudsman will be charged with issuing an annual report and a report on the effectiveness of his or her office and the adequacy of its functions with recommendations for improving its effectiveness.  However, this could be reliant on such recommendations being subsequently implemented if improvements are to be made.  There are plenty of examples of agencies using up much money and man hours to issue recommendations in reports that are never implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_498">Another function of the office will be to issue an annual report on the number of persons admitted to practise as barristers and solicitors during the year and to assess, given demand, the need to ensure an adequate standard of education and training for people admitted to practise and that the number of persons admitted is consistent with the public interest in ensuring the availability of such services at a reasonable cost.  Up to 90%, an enormous rate, fail the first three of the four barrister examinations.  Many of these students are recent law graduates.  That raises the question of whether there is a quota system in place to restrict the numbers entering the profession.</p>
          <p eId="para_499">With positive amendments on Committee Stage, the Bill can be improved.  I hope the Minister will take on board the positive recommendations made in the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulConnaughton" eId="spk_298">
          <from>Deputy Paul Connaughton</from>
          <p eId="para_500">Unlike other Members who spoke on the Bill, I am not a solicitor or a barrister, but I speak for the majority of people who use the legal services.  Many aspects of everyday life are intertwined by legalities which are becoming more complex.  To make matters worse, the famous legalese, as referred to by Deputy Michael D'Arcy, is becoming more difficult to understand.  There is an argument about the bureaucracy of the European Union.  One can imagine the bureaucracy and legal complexes needed to deal with 27 member states.  Although spoken about thousands of times, no one has made an effort to overcome the complexities of legal speak.</p>
          <p eId="para_501">In my contacts, as a Deputy, with solicitors, I find them honest and straightforward.  They do a good job but I would not say they work for nothing.  The public will be happy with the provisions of the Bill.  The solicitors and barristers of this country will welcome this new body.  Those legal practitioners who work according to the procedures will have no problem with this new body.  However, as referred to by Deputy D'Arcy, there are a few bad apples in every barrel and the legal profession is no exception.  A bad apple in the legal profession can create havoc for a large number of ordinary people.  Many Members will know of solicitors' firms where something went wrong, for instance, title deeds being mislaid, and the misery that has resulted for ordinary families.  This Bill will allow the injured parties have recourse to a more straightforward type of justice.</p>
          <p eId="para_502">The person who will be the legal services ombudsman will need to have all the qualities of leadership.  He or she should not be a person who is easily frightened as the legal profession will rightly ask questions.  The system will need to be robust enough to defend the decisions made by the ombudsman's office.  Of all the professions none is better able to make a case than the legal profession and those in legal life.  I share the view that whoever is appointed to that exalted position should not be involved in the legal profession, that he or she is neither a solicitor nor a barrister.  It is entirely possible to find a person with the requisite competence but who is not involved in the legal profession, is neither a solicitor nor a barrister.  The person appointed should be neither a solicitor nor a barrister as the reasoning behind this Bill is the need to reassure people they do not have to go to court with the devil in hell.</p>
          <p eId="para_503">I refer to the first Ombudsman, the late Mr. Michael Mills, who had outstanding qualities.  We have since been blessed with persons in those roles who also have those qualities.  I expect the person appointed as legal services ombudsman will have those qualities and more because he or she will be subject to tremendous pressure.</p>
          <p eId="para_504">The three categories of cases for appeal to the ombudsman will be inadequate services, excessive fees and misconduct.  The Bill provides for a procedure that an ordinary citizen who believes that he or she was badly served by legal advice may go directly to the ombudsman.  This could be daunting for an individual even though the ombudsman is there to help the individual.  Many people may require some legal help with bringing their complaint to the ombudsman.  I know the Bill states that this is not necessary but many people require professional assistance even when submitting planning permission for building a house.  Legal assistance could be costly.  I hope the Bill will provide that the person making the complaint will not be financially worse off.</p>
          <p eId="para_505">It appears that the costs of running the office of the legal services ombudsman will be borne by the Law Society of Ireland and the Bar Council of Ireland.  If this is the case, I know it will be the clients who will carry the can.  Those two professional bodies are paying 10%.  However, like everything else in this life, it will come back to the primary producer in the end and the consumer who uses a solicitor in years to come will be paying an invisible levy to take care of contributions being made up the line.  I would like to believe this will be taken note of as this Bill goes through the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_506">I wish to raise another matter which is associated with this Bill but not included in it.  I can never understand why wigs are still being worn in court.  It is not consumer-friendly, so to speak.  It reminds me of the wren boys on St. Stephen's day when people dress up.  I see no practical need for wigs.</p>
          <p eId="para_507">The majority of people in this country have never seen the inside of a court — this is good because it means they have had no reason to.  When they need to attend court and see people dressed in those wigs they wonder what planet they are on.  The wearing of wigs does not affect the outcome of the cases but I can never understand why they are worn.  It is a subject that raises its head every so often but the day I see the wigs being done away with will be a good day for everybody concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_508">Section 14 provides that various periodic reports are to be made by the legal services ombudsman to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  I am not sure in my own mind about the procedure.  I acknowledge that frivolous complaints will arise and it is important that such cases are filtered out following due process.  The Garda Ombudsman also receives frivolous complaints.  When a claimant goes through the process and where the only option left to them is to go to the courts, has the Minister any executive powers to decide on a case?  If a case proceeds to court, will the office of the legal services ombudsman pay the legal fees for the claimant?  It will be appreciated that such proceedings would be beyond the financial capabilities of most people.  That is not clear in the Bill but I am sure it can be clarified on Committee Stage.  It is something that will be raised in the coming months.</p>
          <p eId="para_509">The question of overcharging comes within the remit of the legal services ombudsman.  I have no doubt that there is gross, wilful overcharging in the legal profession.  Much of it never sees the light of day, although there have been a number of exposés about it on television.  It can arise over simple enough matters, such as ordinary insurance claims.  There is no end to the amount of money solicitors and barristers can make on the basis of charges to their clients and the insurance companies involved.  I have no doubt that there is no shortage of double charging and that it is going on all the time.  I hope the cases brought before the ombudsman will be made public so that people will understand the situation.  If a number of high profile cases were successful, it could have a ripple effect.  It would show the legal profession that it could not and should not overcharge.  Hopefully a satisfactory outcome can be achieved with regard to the practices of overcharging clients and ambulance chasing.</p>
          <p eId="para_510">When people decide to have windows fitted in their homes, they seek numerous quotations, but they never get quotations for medical or legal advice.  If someone has a headache, they may not have time to obtain quotations for treatment, but there is plenty of time to seek quotations for legal advice.  Over the years, however, I have seen very few people using the telephone to ask lawyers what they would charge for doing X, Y or Z.  People will visit a solicitor to outline their case and because they have confidence in that law practice, but rarely if ever will they ask how much the legal services will cost.  That has been my experience over the years but I cannot understand it because we do not have a shortage of solicitors.  Given the immense amount of money being charged, even for small services such as conveyancing, one would have thought that a few telephone calls to various solicitors might be worthwhile.  Surely a cartel is not being organised.  I am sure it is not, but the last thing potential clients do is seek quotations for legal services.  I hope this will become common practice through the Ombudsman's office.</p>
          <p eId="para_511">I am delighted that before he was elevated to higher things, the former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, decided to introduce this legislation on its own, although it was linked earlier to another Bill.  This is one of the most important pieces of legislation that will pass through this House this year because of the positive impact it will have for so many people in future.  Some people have told me that no matter how one does it, the legal profession will always win but I do not think so.  If we get a strong, dedicated and focused person in that office, with backup from the best possible legal advice, he or she will be able to take on all the vested interests.  If that happens, it will be a good day for this country.  This stand-alone legislation has an importance that it would not normally have if it were merely a tailpiece to another Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_512">Many aspects of the legislation will have to be teased out on Committee Stage.  In his opening statement and in a recent interview, the Minister said there will be a sympathetic approach and that consideration will be given to many of the views we all hold.  There will be widespread support for the Bill, which lends itself to that approach.  If most common sense views can be facilitated in the Bill, it will make for better legislation.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TerenceFlanagan" eId="spk_299">
          <from>Deputy Terence Flanagan</from>
          <p eId="para_513">Like previous speakers, I welcome this Bill which will put the office of the legal services ombudsman on a statutory footing.  Under the terms of the Bill, it will be possible, for the first time, for members of the public to make a complaint to an independent ombudsman, who is neither a solicitor nor a barrister, if they are unhappy with the outcome of their complaint made to the Bar Council or the Law Society.  When lawyers investigate themselves, it can lead to charges of a cover-up.  I am glad that the Bill provides for the establishment of a new, independent ombudsman.</p>
          <p eId="para_514">Complaints made both to the Law Society and the Bar Council vary from excessive fees charged to clients, misconduct, inadequate service and bad advice to poor representation.  As Deputies, we all know of instances where rogue solicitors have overcharged constituents and provided a poor service.</p>
          <p eId="para_515">Some of the functions of the legal services ombudsman will be to promote awareness among the public of matters concerning the procedures of the Bar Council and the Law Society; to assess the adequacy of the admission policies of the Law Society for solicitors and of the Bar Council for barristers; and to review the procedures of the Bar Council and the Law Society for dealing with complaints made to those bodies.  Those functions are to be welcomed and it is no harm that an independent ombudsman will have a remit to ensure that proper and adequate candidates are appointed as solicitors or barristers, as well as ensuring that the complaints procedures are correct.</p>
          <p eId="para_516">I welcome the fact that the legal services ombudsman will have to submit an annual report on the effectiveness of his office to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  That report will also cover the adequacy of the functions of the ombudsman's office.  This is an innovative change.  Given the current number of quangos, this practice should be introduced for all such bodies so that they have to provide an annual report outlining the effectiveness of their functions.  This report may contain recommendations for improving the effectiveness and value for money of the office of the legal services ombudsman.  We want an independent ombudsman who will function correctly within a given remit.</p>
          <p eId="para_517">The legal services ombudsman will attend meetings of the relevant Oireachtas committee whenever he or she is asked to do so by the committee and shall provide the committee with such information as requested.  I hope that when the ombudsman's office is up and running it will be well advertised and that the necessary details will be contained in literature produced both by the Law Society and the Bar Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_518">The legal profession should have nothing to fear from the appointment of an ombudsman.  If anything, the appointment should help to promote higher standards in the legal profession.  It should enhance its reputation as happened in England and Wales with the appointment of an ombudsman who oversees complaints relating to lawyers and barristers.  Whoever is appointed to this office needs to speak to the ombudsman in England and Wales and learn from its experiences.  This will ensure that the teething problems experienced in that office are avoided in the new ombudsman's office.</p>
          <p eId="para_519">Will a customer charter be put in place which will outline the turnaround time members of the public can expect in regard to their complaints?  Will the ombudsman's services will be free of charge to the public?</p>
          <p eId="para_520">It is good that the ombudsman's role, as stated in the Bill, will specify the numbers of persons admitted to practise as barristers and solicitors respectively during the year, and that the decisions made will be in the public interest so as to ensure that the cost of employing a solicitor is reasonable for any member of the public.  Certainly, one of the major criticisms is the excessive fees that some barristers and solicitors charge.  If the Bill ensures there are more solicitors and barristers and more competition within the market, that is a positive development for the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_521">It is reasonable and welcome that one has up to six months in which to make a complaint to the ombudsman.  Why is it that all investigations are to be held in private?  Would it not make more sense, in the interests of transparency and public accountability, if some of the investigations were held in public?  Perhaps the Minister could indicate when summing up whether this will be the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_522">I am pleased to note that the full cost of the office of the ombudsman will be paid by both legal professions and that the State will not have to pick up the tab.  That is welcome given the current rates of wastage.  It is necessary to ensure high standards are retained in the law profession and in the Bar Council.  It is welcome that both professions will provide the money to pay for this office because it is in their professions' interest to have a good independent ombudsman functioning in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_523">I note that if a person obstructs the work of the ombudsman, he or she is liable to a fine not exceeding €2,000.  That certainly would focus the mind or any person seeking to obstruct the work of the ombudsman and it is welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_524">As Deputy Connaughton said, the Bill could be examined further and the Fine Gael Party will table amendments on Committee Stage.  However, I welcome the publication of the Bill.  For the first time, it will provide for an independent ombudsman who will not be a solicitor or barrister and will look at the complaints procedure in both professions.  The legal services ombudsman will ensure that excessive fees charged to clients and any misconduct or inadequate service provided by solicitors or barristers will be investigated.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_526">This Bill has been stripped out from the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.  This was a suggestion the Fine Gael spokesperson, Deputy Flanagan, and I put to the former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and he took it on board.  It is right that we have stand-alone legislation in this area.  It is a modest reform.  I would not be as enthusiastic or as over-the-top as some of the comments I have heard about it.  There are many consumers of the legal profession and the question they will ask is whether the Bill goes far enough.  I support it as far as it goes, but I argue that it is a modest measure.</p>
          <p eId="para_527">If we were to ask the National Consumer Agency to do a survey and, as we all know, apparently, that is what it does.</p>

          <p eId="para_529">If the National Consumer Agency could take time off from the supermarkets, finding out what the rest of us already know, and conduct a survey of people who are dealing with the legal profession, it would say this is a welcome measure but that it is limited enough.  The background against which one has to measure it is the Competition Authority report.  That report is very instructive but I do not think anybody has adverted to it.  For example, it states that the Competition Authority has concluded that the legal profession is in need of substantial reform and it goes on to spell out why that is the case.  The report states that the Competition Authority recommends comprehensive new legislation, a legal services Bill, to address the competition concerns identified in its report.  The legislation would establish an independent legal services commission with overall responsibility for regulating the legal profession and the market for legal services.  That is a horse of a completely different colour.  The Bill before the House provides for a legal services ombudsman but in terms of what was envisaged by the Competition Authority, it is a modest measure.</p>
          <p eId="para_530">Part of the reason we are where we are is because of what might be euphemistically referred to as recent events.</p>

        <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_304">
          <from>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_532">Recent events have undoubtedly alarmed the public and have done damage to the legal profession.  Like Deputy Paul Connaughton, members of the profession I have dealt with have been honourable people.  I forget the phrase Deputy Connaughton used but it was to effect that they do not do it for nothing.  I am prepared to go along with that too.</p>
          <p eId="para_533">Some woeful weaknesses have been shown up in the system.  I am not just referring to the few bad apples in the barrel, and they have been fairly dramatic by any standards.  If one owes the bank €2,000, one is in trouble but if one owes the bank €2 million, one is in a stronger position.  What we have witnessed recently has been dramatic, involving, as it did, two high profile cases in particular.  However, there was not only two.  We also had a case affecting two lawyers who seemed to be engaged in an extensive tax evasion scam in which they put money offshore and so forth.  These developments have conditioned the perception of members of the public and done damage to the reputation of the profession.</p>
          <p eId="para_534">In that regard, I referred to the report of the Competition Authority, which should be compulsory reading for those interested in reform in this area.  However, I could also make reference to a speech to the Law Society in University College, Cork, by the Master of the High Court, Mr. Edmund Honohan SC, in which he stated that "no spinning" by the Law Society could disguise the "systemic failure" of self-regulation of solicitors.  What was now needed, he added, was a "robust agency" to deal with rogue solicitors, most of whom, he said, must now realise they have been let down by a few rogue, negligent solicitors.  Let us be clear that the Bill does not provide for the "robust agency" he recommended.</p>
          <p eId="para_535">The Master of the High Court also stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_536">It is the status of the solicitor as officer of the court that makes the solicitor's undertaking the gold standard of contractual obligations... When an officer of the court undertakes, he puts his official status on the line.  A solicitor who defaults on an undertaking damages the entire profession.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">Mr. Honohan's views in this matter are hotly contested by the Law Society of Ireland.  The Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights had an opportunity to hear representatives of the Law Society on these matters and members had a useful exchange of views with them.  Ultimately, however, the matter hinges on the question of regulation versus representation and whether one organisation can perform both these roles.  There is a great deal of confusion surrounding this question.  For example, I have a copy of a speech delivered by the president of the Law Society of Ireland, James McGuill, on 7 December last in which he stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_538">Let me make another principle clear.  Opinion-formers and other commentators assume that the legal profession supports self-regulation.  I don't.  We don't.</p>
          <p eId="para_539">These comments were given considerable mileage in newspapers which ran stories to the effect that Mr. McGuill had spoken out against self-regulation.  He did not do anything of the kind.  The text of his speech shows he used language which seems to indicate he is against self-regulation but this is only because of his perception that the existing arrangement is not self-regulation.  The current arrangement is, however, one of self-regulation.  Later in his address, Mr. McGuill stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_540">We don't, and won't, promote self-regulation.  As we have pointed out repeatedly, it is fundamentally misleading to describe the current system of regulation of solicitors in Ireland as "self-regulation".</p>
          <p eId="para_541">Even though it is acknowledged in terms of the common language used by most people that the system we have is one of self-regulation, the president of the Law Society of Ireland has stated it is not self-regulation because some outside elements are involved.  As everyone else accepts, the system is still essentially one of self-regulation.  The nuance of what Mr. McGuill said was, therefore, missed in the media.  This is not the only place in which the media missed the nuance of certain comments.  For example, I have a copy of a report from <i>The Irish Times </i>in which the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, is quoted as stating in the Dáil:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_542">I am not satisfied that self-regulation, as it has been operated over the years, is the best model. . .  Total self-regulation does not provide the impression that the public interest is best served in a transparent way, notwithstanding the fact that the overwhelming majority are doing a good job.</p>
          <p eId="para_543">While I agree that the overwhelming majority are doing a good job, the comment that self-regulation is not the best model is testament to the extraordinary skill of the former Taoiseach who had a habit of saying something and allowing a nuanced message to go abroad, in this case that he was opposed to self-regulation.  Later, he also implied the Government would do something about it.  As so often in the case of the former Taoiseach, one had to read the small print to learn that this was not what he meant.  The purpose of the Bill his Government introduced was not to end self-regulation but to establish an office of legal ombudsman with the duties described in the Bill.  While I welcome this step, albeit against the background of my comments, it is more modest than ending self-regulation.</p>
          <p eId="para_544">A great many people worry about the acquiescence of the House to the concept of self-regulation by the professions and note the scams that have taken place in recent years in the financial industry and business, including the beef industry.  These could not have happened without the acquiescence, negligence or complicity of professionals.  Whether in the accounting or legal profession or some other profession, many people profoundly question whether self-regulation is acceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_545">Although the Government invoked the assistance of the Competition Authority in examining the legal profession, scant regard has been paid to the authority's conclusions.  The authority concluded that "the legal profession is in need of root and branch reform reflecting the important need to create a modern system of regulation that is proportionate, accountable, transparent, flexible and reflects the needs of consumers".  The Ceann Comhairle was an honourable member of the honourable profession.  I do not believe any Member would question the Competition Authority's description of the current position.  Its recommendations are not generally included in the Bill, however.  For example, it recommended the establishment of a legal services commission which would be "an independent, transparent and accountable body, involving a wider group of stakeholders than the current model of self-regulation."  The former Minister did not take on board this view.  It would be helpful to hear from the new Minister the reason this recommendation was not taken on board, given that he failed to do so in his address to the House last night.</p>
          <p eId="para_546">I have long since been persuaded that when it comes to writing persuasive English, Irish civil servants have no competitors in the western world.  They are much better, even than civil servants in the neighbouring island, at making the most of a rather small reform.  Their capacity to exaggerate it and present it in plausible English is limitless and I pay tribute to them.  However, I would still like to hear the Minister tell us why the Competition Authority has been thrown out the window.  He may state that some modest concessions have been made by the Bar Council and the Law Society, which is true, but we are certainly not going anywhere near what was recommended for this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_547">We spoke about "recent events", which is a euphemism for the fraud that has been perpetrated on clients and financial institutions by a small number of solicitors, as well as the fraud perpetrated on the taxpayer by those other solicitors who were salting money offshore.  As a TD, I am just as concerned by the routine dereliction of duty by some solicitors.  Constituents come to me with complaints that would be regarded as minor in this Bill, but they are big complaints from where they are standing.  The difficulties they encounter in a few cases with their solicitor can be an impossible mountain for them to climb.  They cannot even get their files back from the solicitor.  One would need a JCB to get a file back from a solicitor who is not diligently attending to it.  Many ordinary people have had this experience with members of the legal profession.  It is that routine dereliction of duty that concerns me as much as the few bad apples in the barrel that have recently gained such public notoriety.</p>
          <p eId="para_548">An ordinary person with a minor claim that has been negligently attended to will get nowhere with a complaint to the Law Society.  Such a person would not know how to access the Bar Library and make a complaint if the Bar Library was involved.  I hope that whenever the ombudsman is appointed, he or she will devise a code of practice to deal with the average citizen who is not getting satisfaction or value for money from a member of the legal profession.  Up to now, it has been very difficult for a client to get satisfaction in cases of negligence.</p>
          <p eId="para_549">The Competition Authority states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_550">If a client wishes to switch solicitor, for example in response to poor quality of service, the solicitor has the right to withhold the client's file until the client has paid the solicitor's bill, even if the bill is disputed.  As a practical matter, full payment may not be possible to achieve in a short space of time and, in the interim, the client is disadvantaged with possibly serious consequences.  For example, a consumer who believes that his/her current solicitor is putting his/her case in jeopardy, or is failing to act in a timely manner, cannot take his/her business elsewhere.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_551">This special protection for solicitors against bad debts does not exist for any other profession in Ireland and is an unnecessary restriction on competition between solicitors and on consumers' rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_552">Consumers of legal services, especially small infrequent buyers, are in a far more vulnerable position than the solicitor who can self-supply legal services to remedy any injustice he thinks might be done to him.  We in this House have all met constituents who believe that their case is not being acted on in a timely manner or is being negligently handled and who feel that they do not owe money as alleged by their solicitor.  Even if we intervene, it is extremely difficult to get the file back.  I hope that a code of practice will be designed to deal with the average punter who finds himself or herself in that quandary.</p>
          <p eId="para_553">The Minister stated last night that the Bill will establish a legal services ombudsman which will oversee the handling by the Law Society and the Bar Council of three classes of complaint against solicitors and barristers, namely, inadequate service, excessive fees and misconduct.  I welcome that.  If the ombudsman is enabled to discharge his duties in those three areas, this Bill will be worthwhile.  We have all experienced it.  I challenge even the newest Members of this House to say that they have not encountered one of these causes of complaint.  Members talk about it privately among themselves.  If redress is to be provided in this Bill, that would be welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_554">I referred to the remarks of the master of the High Court, when he spoke about the gold standard of contractual obligation, which he claimed was the solicitor's undertaking.  As Members of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, we had the opportunity to hear representatives of the Law Society make a well argued and worthwhile submission to us on this issue.  This again arises from recent events, in which a couple of solicitors were able to raise a mortgage several times on the same property.  They used that gold standard of contractual obligation as a means of levying finance for their own purposes.  The key point is that the system of solicitors' undertakings, without which it would be difficult for society to function, is in respect of the solicitor giving an undertaking on behalf of his client, not on behalf of his own business.  If we are to permit a situation where a solicitor can resort to that in furtherance of his own private enterprise, we are inviting the kind of difficulty that has become notorious in the media in recent times.</p>
          <p eId="para_555">I worry that the Bill does not go far enough to address this central issue.  In our society, access to justice is dependent, in most if not all cases, on the consumer resorting to the services of a lawyer.  As Deputy Paul Connaughton said, they charge well for it in most cases.  In saying that, we should be prepared to acknowledge the lawyers who do tremendous work <i>pro bono</i> on occasion.  We should give credit for that, of which there have been exceptional examples.  In any event, no one is complaining about lawyers being rewarded for their services like anyone else but about where, as identified in this Bill, excessive fees are charged.  There are, on occasion, excessive fees charged and worse, they sometimes do not come to light.  What about the abuse of the redress scheme where a small number of solicitors’ companies were charging their clients and at the same time taking a percentage from the settlement when it emerged?</p>

          <p eId="para_562">The Master of the High Court referred to what he described as an abuse of privilege.  He referred to the use of mumbo jumbo by lawyers of the "it's the law, you wouldn't understand" variety to keep a client at bay or to seek to over-complicate issues, perhaps to justify a higher fee.  There is a certain amount of mumbo jumbo associated with all professions but access to justice and certainly access to the courts can be an intimidating prospect for many citizens.  People who never expected to find themselves in courts, and did not particularly want to, find the court environment intimidating.  It is mysterious to the average citizen when the barrister, with whom a relationship of some kind has been established, must run away to present in a different court.  The game playing that goes on in the round hall mesmerises ordinary people.  It would be no harm if the Bar Library and the Law Society came further in understanding that the days when the professions lorded it over the average citizen are gone and there is no need for the mystique and mystery that surrounds the process.  The citizen is paying for it either through taxes or directly in fees.  If citizens could get an intelligible, accessible service that they could understand, delivered in a fashion they could understand, they would have a higher perception of the profession.</p>
          <p eId="para_563">The profession has behaved honourably, by and large.  I commend those who have done work in the public interest for no payment.  It is regrettable that there have been instances that threatened to damage people's confidence in the profession.  It is timely that the House addresses that subject.</p>

          <p eId="para_564">Cuirim fáilte roimh an mBille fán Ombudsman um Sheirbhísí Dlí 2008, agus roimh an cuspóar atá aige.  Tugann an Bille aitheantas sa deireadh thiar nach féidir le heagrais atá gafa le gairmeacha dlí déileáil i gcónaí i gceart le gearáin i gcoinne baill na n-eagras sin, An Cumann Dlí nó an Bar Council.  Tá sé nádúrtha go mbeadh bá ag lucht dlí le lucht dlí.  Tá an bá chéanna ag An Garda Síochána le gardaí, agus ag dochtúirí le dochtúirí agus araile.  Tá gá le bealaí neamhspleácha a aimsiú chun déileála go héifeachtach agus go gasta le gearáin.  Caithfear chomh maith bheith cothrom le gach taobh páirteach sa choimhlint nó sa ghearán.  Tá ár sochaí tar éis roinnt de na céimeanna sin a ghlacadh maidir leis na gairmeacha eile agus tá súil agam go leanfaidh muid ar aghaidh leis na hathruithe atá le teacht.</p>
          <p eId="para_565">Tá sé thar am don Bhille seo.  In ainneoin an fháilte atá curtha roimhe agam, d'fhéadfadh sé a bheith i bhfad níos foirfe, cé gur céim chun tosaigh é.  Déileáileann an Bille le gairm a bhaineann le daoine a chleachtann an dlí, dlíodóirí agus abhcóidí.  Mar an gcéanna leis na gairmeacha eile ar nós An Garda Síochána, dochtúirí nó cuntasóirí, baineann an caidreamh idir dhaoine ag obair mar dhlíodóirí nó abhcóidí agus an pobal le ceisteanna tábhachtacha.  Déileáileann siad le saibhreas nó daibhreas, sláinte nó tinneas, nó le saoirse agus daoirse.  Mar aon leis na gardaí, déileáileann dlíodóirí le ceisteanna móra i dtaobh saoirse agus sealúchas.</p>
          <p eId="para_566">Tá go leor scéalta cloiste agam thar na blianta faoi chásanna inar bhuail dlíodóir nó abhcóide bob ar an chliant.  Uaireanta ní bhíonn a fhios agam an d'aonghnó nó de thaisme a tharla sin.  De gnáth, níor míníodh don chliant sna cásanna sin cad go díreach a bhí ar siúl nó cén toradh a thiocfadh as an seasamh a d'iarr siad ar an abhcóide a ghlacadh.  I gcásanna eile, níor thóg an abhcóide nó an dlíodóir an treo a bhí á lorg ag an chliant.  Is trua go dtarlaíonn sin.  Go minic, is i gcásanna mar sin a bhíonn fadhb ann.  Bíonn fadhb ann nuair nach mbíonn dlíodóir sásta an scéal a mhíniú.  Cuirim fáilte roimh an mBille, ach tá leasuithe le teacht.</p>
          <p eId="para_567">Sinn Féin welcomes the Legal Services Ombudsman Bill.  Sadly, whether it is the Garda Síochána, the legal profession or the medical profession, we know too well the dangers of leaving any profession to its own devices.  Sinn Féin welcomes the change in our society that tries to ensure an independent complaints process for the profession to ensure both the profession and the public are protected.  The danger of allowing professions to operate without independent and transparent systems to ensure that the highest standards and accountability are inherent is that it undermines public confidence in that service and the profession.</p>
          <p eId="para_568">At the extreme, the absence of independent mechanisms to receive and rule on complaints can risk and ruin lives.  There have been a number of cases highlighted in recent years and protests outside these gates by victims — as they put it — of the legal profession.  They have come together to try to ensure that what we are addressing today is set up.  They also seek redress for the complaints made in respect of their experiences of the legal profession in this State.  For example, the Irish Medical Organisation should have struck off Dr. Neary from the register a lot sooner than it did.  The fact he had chosen three members of the IMO who assessed him speaks volumes about the need to ensure complaints bodies are independent of the sectoral organisations of which the subject of a complaint is a member.</p>
          <p eId="para_569">The seeming inability of the Garda Síochána complaints board in the past to find against members of the force and its frequent refusal to investigate complaints never surprised me.  I welcome the new body though I would have preferred it to be much more independent and stronger.  A well known specific example, which illustrates the need for an effective complaints mechanism, is the despicable double charging of victims of child sexual abuse by certain members of the legal profession as highlighted by a number of previous speakers.  There are many other lesser known but equally grave examples.</p>
          <p eId="para_570">My office is receiving an increasing number of complaints and requests for assistance in respect of improper, unethical and incompetent conduct by members of the legal profession.  The people concerned have run out of options in seeking justice.  I believe this is only the tip of the iceberg.  I am sure all 166 Members of this House have received complaints from members of the public in regard to their treatment by members of the legal profession.  In general, the legal profession is above reproach but there exists within it, as in all professions, those who would do it down.  They are the ones we are trying to weed out.  We are trying to ensure the highest possible standard is attained by the legal profession, barristers and solicitors, within and outside the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_571">Some members of the legal profession are profiting from the vulnerability of people who must access their services.  This is creating great hardship and distress for people who have been pursuing justice and recompense for years at great financial and emotional cost to themselves.  A person wishing to take on the legal profession in this State needs a great deal of money.  Many people have lost their holdings and farms in an attempt to undo a wrong or perceived wrong on the part of practitioners in our justice system.</p>
          <p eId="para_572">Many people have been denied access to legal recourse to pursue their complaints or to appeal against unethical solicitors owing to their inability to find another solicitor who is willing to take their case.  This is happening across various professions.  It is difficult to find a garda who will make a complaint against another garda.  If this were not so, there would have been no need for the Morris tribunal.  Also, it is difficult to find a solicitor who will give evidence or make a complaint against a solicitor.  The same applies in respect of a doctors.</p>
          <p eId="para_573">Members of the House have called for the introduction of a whistleblowers' charter to protect those who want to expose, without having to suffer any consequences or risk of being sent to Coventry by their fellow practitioners, members of a profession who are guilty of misconduct.  This culture must change.  It is hoped the findings of the Morris tribunal will result in such change in the Garda Síochána and that the advent of the legal services ombudsman will result in a change in attitude in the legal profession.</p>
          <p eId="para_574">Not alone are people finding it difficult to find a solicitor willing to take on a case, they are also finding it difficult to obtain free legal aid.  The free legal aid centres, FLAC, are not in a position to handle some of these cases owing to under-resourcing, means test results or because they are precluded by law from doing so.  Mar a dúirt mé, cuirim fáilte roimh an córas neamhspleách atá molta sa Bhille seo, a chinnteoidh go mbeidh muintir na gairme dlí freagrach trí oifig an ombudsman um sheirbhísí dlí.  Tá sé thar am go dtarlódh a leithéid.  Is comhartha é go bhfuilimid ag dul sa nua-aois.  Molfaidh mé leasuithe ar an Bhille seo ar Chéim an Choiste chun a dhéanamh cinnte de go n-úsáidfí "fear an phobail" — an teideal a bhí ann nuair a cheapadh Michael Mills — in ionad "ombudsman" i nGaeilge.  Déanann an teideal "fear an phobail" cur síos níos fearr ar an ról a bheidh ag an duine a oibreoidh sa phost nua seo.  Beidh an "fear an phobail" ann thar ceann an phobail.  Tá sé sin le bheith molta.  B'fhéidir gur chóir dúinn an teideal a athrú ó "ombudsman" go "fear an phobail" nó "bean an phobail".</p>
          <p eId="para_575">The introduction through this Bill of an independent body in the form of the legal services ombudsman to hold legal professionals accountable is both welcome and overdue.  On Committee Stage, I will table amendments with the aim of improving the Bill to ensure we have the most effective and, crucially, the most independent ombudsman possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_576">Section 5 outlines the eligibility criteria for appointment to the position of ombudsman.  Sinn Féin will table an amendment to this section to ensure that not only current but recent members of the Law Society of Ireland or Bar Council are ineligible for this position.  Measaim gur chóir go mbeadh spás ama de dhá bhliana nó cúig bhliain i gceist, ionas nach féidir leo siúd atá ag cleachtadh dlí faoi láthair bheith ainmnithe mar ombudsman.  Ba chóir dúinn féachaint ar sin.  Ba cheart dúinn tréimhse ar leith a shainiú ionas go mbeidh ar dhaoine obair eile a dhéanamh idir an dá linn.  Beimid níos fearr as muna mbeidh duine atá gafa leis an tseirbhís ainmnithe mar ombudsman.  Ní chóir go mbeadh an cumadh ar an scéal go bhfuil bá ag an ombudsman don ghairm ina raibh sé nó sí ag cleachtadh roimhe sin.</p>
          <p eId="para_577">Section 11 governs the appointment of the staff in the office of the legal services ombudsman.  It also provides that prior to seeking the consent of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Minister for Finance to appoint a new staff member the legal services ombudsman must first consult the Bar Council and the Law Society of Ireland.  I find this provision bizarre.  The recently established Garda Ombudsman Commission under the Garda Síochána Act 2005 does not and should not have to consult with the Garda Síochána before appointing its staff.  I fail to understand why the legal services ombudsman should be any different.  Section 11, as currently drafted, can only serve to reduce the potential for public confidence.  Perhaps the Minister when replying will explain cén fáth go bhfuil an foráil seo sa Bhille.</p>
          <p eId="para_578">Section 15 makes provision for the legal services ombudsman to produce annual reports on admission policies of the Law Society of Ireland and the Bar Council.  These reports must contain the number of people admitted to practise and set out how this matches the demand for services.  We have been long of the opinion that the Judiciary is not representative of Irish society and has long been disproportionately made up of people from wealthy backgrounds.  In the interests of justice, it is imperative this situation be reversed.  It is crucial the legal professions begin to include a fair representation of people from working class backgrounds.  With this in mind, I will also table amendments to section 15 to ensure the legal services ombudsman reports provide a breakdown on admissions policy under a number of different headings, including socioeconomic background, gender, ethnicity and so on with a view to establishing quotas if the admission quotas are not reflective of society, which I believe is currently the case.  We must set targets to achieve change in our legal services to ensure we are judged by our peers rather than by our masters, which I have never accepted.</p>
          <p eId="para_579">Deputy Connaughton suggested that the wearing of wigs and gowns should be prohibited.  They are a hand-down from a previous jurisdiction and a previous part of Irish life and they should be prohibited once and for all.  One is not being judged by one's peers if the person at the bench believes he or she is above another because he or she wears a wig and a gown.  It is high time we modernised our society, including the Bar.</p>
          <p eId="para_580">Section 21(7) appears to limit the retrospective powers of the ombudsman regarding complaints determined by the Law Society or the Bar Council to no more than six months prior to the commencement of the section.  This is in contrast to section 6 which gives the ombudsman certain discretionary latitude.  The retrospective powers provided by this section should be clarified.  If one compares section 21(7) with section 6, one can see that clarity is required.</p>
          <p eId="para_581">I will also be tabling a number of standard amendments to ensure the democratic accountability of the ombudsman.  I welcome the fact that the ombudsman will be in some way answerable to the Dáil, through a committee, with regard to costings and so forth.  However, all the ombudsman's reports to the Minister should be open to scrutiny by the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights to ensure that the ombudsman is working correctly and that we are getting the correct response from the Bar Council and the Law Society with regard to his or her recommendations.</p>
          <p eId="para_582">I remember when the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, whose name is hard to remember because he is no longer a Deputy, set up the Garda Ombudsman Commission, he argued that it had to have three members.  He maintained that it could not function properly without three members, but an ombudsman's office is now being set up with just one person.  Obviously, the new Minister took on board the advice that many people gave to the effect that one person is a lot more effective in terms of making adjudications.</p>
          <p eId="para_583">Another issue which I am interested in examining and on which I will do some research before Committee Stage is the term of office of the ombudsman.  There are various terms of office and we should standardise them.  In this case, it is six years plus a subsequent term and a further term if so required, which means that somebody could theoretically be in this job for most of his or her working life.  I do not think that should be the case; two terms would suffice.  Whether six years or five years is appropriate I do not know but we should consider standardising the terms of office of all ombudsmen across the board.</p>
          <p eId="para_584">I have major concerns about section 27 because its provisions do not go far enough.  The section refers to the obstruction of the work of the legal services ombudsman.  Basically, if one obstructs the ombudsman one is liable, on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding €2,000.  Given the fees charged by some solicitors and barristers, I do not think they would care too much about €2,000 and would forego such a sum.  In this case, because of the seriousness of what the ombudsman will be addressing and the fact that we want to improve public confidence, the ability to strike a person off the register and rule him or her out of practising should be included as a punishment for obstructing an officer appointed by this House to work on behalf of the public as a whole.  It is important that the seriousness of this is reflected in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_585">Measaim go bhfuil an chuid is mó den méid atá le rá agam ráite agam anois.  Cuirfidh mé roinnt leasoithe ar Chéim an Choiste.  Tá sé tábhachtach a léiriú go dtugann Dlí-Chumann na hÉireann agus Comhairle an Bharra tacaíocht don Bhille seo.  Táimid ar fad ag tarraingt le chéile sa chás seo.  Tá gach éinne ag iarraidh a chinntiú go mbeidh an reachtaíocht seo, agus an "fear an phobail" nó ombudsman um sheirbhísí dlí, chomh éifeachtach agus is féidir ionas go mbeidh muinín ag gach éinne sa chóras dlí ina iomlán.</p>

        <speech by="#BernardJDurkan" eId="spk_315">
          <from>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</from>
          <p eId="para_588">Absolutely.  Hindsight usually gives us that entitlement.  I think I would enjoy it and I am sure the Ceann Comhairle would as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_589">When I was a very young, green and a raw recruit in this House I remember, on behalf of a constituent, engaging or locking horns with a famous legal firm.  I was fairly trenchant in my attitude and was not the shrinking violet type, as befits a public representative.  After some considerable time I received a written response from the legal firm concerned, which was very trenchant and challenging and was supposed to set me back and make me reconsider my position.  However, enclosed with the letter, whether by way of mischief, omission or error, perhaps mischievousness on the part of the legal secretary who might not have been on good terms with the firm, was an opinion from senior counsel.  Obviously the letter had been referred to the senior counsel for an opinion as to whether this was the right road to take in dealing with this upstart of a politician who dared to poke his nose into this particularly restricted area.  I have to say — I know that the Ceann Comhairle would have had a good laugh — I had a really great laugh at that because I knew what to do next, having received the opinion of senior counsel.</p>
          <p eId="para_590">We suffer in this country from what I would call post-colonial deference to professionals and professional opinion.  It comes from our colonial past.  Various speakers have referred to the legal, medical and teaching professions, among others.  With all professionals, whether rightly or wrongly, we seem to take their opinion as read.  As the public becomes more well versed at reading the English language and reading all languages, there is less of a tendency on their part to accept without question the opinion given, whether from a lawyer, doctor or any other profession.  That is correct and is as it should be. Every human being has a certain amount of intelligence and has the right to ask a question.  Even if the question appears to be frivolous or badly phrased, the individual still has the right to an answer.</p>
          <p eId="para_591">Before relating another case from some years ago, I must say that the vast majority of lawyers and solicitors are decent people and do a lot of work <i>pro bono</i>, as Deputy Rabbitte said, which we hear very little about.  However, there are some cute so-and-so’s out there as well.  I remember a case involving a young couple who bought a house.  It was not a great house and it needed a lot of refurbishment.  They were living in a mobile home at the time.  We moved their case on by encouraging the local authority to grant them a loan.  It was a little difficult but they could just about afford to buy the house — it is great that young people can aspire and be able to buy their own homes.  However, between the time the deposit was paid, the contracts signed and the conclusion of repairs which had to be done before closure, house prices dramatically increased.  The vendor took advice from his lawyers who told him he had the right to increase the price, notwithstanding the existence of a contract.  They basically told him he should charge the couple more, which he duly did.  As a public representative, I had to lock horns with that particular legal firm.  I still remember the name of the firm, but we are precluded from naming such people on the record of the House.  Previously in the House, perhaps ten or 12 years ago, I did not name the firm but gave its address and telephone number.  At least I had that privilege.  I consider the way the legal eagle advised the vendor to be sharp practice.  The vendor could do what he did legally, but the fact that one can do something legally does not necessarily mean it is right.</p>
          <p eId="para_592">One of the problems we have in society is secrecy.  Family law has an <i>in camera</i> rule.  If a Member of this House asks a question about it, we are told it is <i>in camera</i> and how dare one suggest one might offer assistance, advice or information.  Whenever we surround ourselves with secrecy, we also tend to surround ourselves with an armoury to protect whatever it is we think we have.  It does not make any difference how this affects the public and this is a mistake.  It leaves itself open to all types of possibilities, none of which is in the interests of the public or, ultimately, the profession concerned.  Deputy Pat Rabbitte made reference to another case.</p>
          <p eId="para_593">With regard to the restitution payments in respect of those in institutions, if one inquired of a particular firm — I will not say in which profession — one was told it was a confidential matter and the information was covered by the Data Protection Commissioner.  This is utter rubbish.  It is not confidential and the Data Protection Commission has no function in the matter of any activity by the Members of this House in determining what is happening in respect of their constituents and whether their constituents are getting fair play.  It is merely a fig leaf to hide behind when somebody does not want to give an answer.</p>
          <p eId="para_594">The firm would write to the family of the individual concerned and ask whether permission had been granted to the public representative to inquire on their behalf.  When we come to this type of situation, I ask myself whether it is really progress.  All we are doing is allowing the creation of barriers around groups of people who do not want to be questioned and never intended that their activities would be questioned.</p>
          <p eId="para_595">The question of discipline applies to all professionals.  In this case, the ombudsman will be responsible.  Deputy Ó Snodaigh was correct that, originally, an ombudsman triumvirate was to be established.  Now, it will be one ombudsman which is an improvement.  When one spreads authority and alleged responsibility, one does not get accountability.  The more people with equal responsibility in an area, the less chance of ever getting anybody to be accountable for the operation of that show.  It is sad but that is how it is.  Everybody is responsible and nobody is responsible.</p>
          <p eId="para_596">I do not know how the application of discipline will work in this situation.  It should and could work but I do not know if it will.  Other speakers referred to complaints against the Garda and I know gardaí are in the front line in the fight against crime.  It is difficult to admit something has gone wrong and that it needs to be stopped.  It tends to be seen by public representatives as a reflection on the entire profession, which it is not.  If something goes wrong in any profession at any time and it comes to our attention, somebody's job is to raise the matter and see whether it can be attended to.  They should ask what is the problem and say "Let us deal with it".</p>
          <p eId="para_597">The next part is important.  What happens with regard to discipline?  What action is taken and who takes it?  This is where many of the difficulties we have at present arise.  The chain of command does not work.  The reason is that if a whistleblower makes a report to his or her superior, the superior may have a weakness or an issue he or she does not want to be aired and may not be in a position to take any action.  This moves it to the next level.  At what level in the chain of command should action be taken?</p>
          <p eId="para_598">The presumption is that whoever reports should report to his or her superior.  What is happening is that nobody takes any action and nothing happens because if one does act, one's own position is weakened.  The person thinks somebody will be waiting for him or her in the long grass at a later stage.  What happens then?  One must produce an ombudsman or somebody like an ombudsman at the top of the pyramid, who will state he or she is responsible for operations being run in the manner in which it was intended.  It remains to be seen whether it will work.</p>
          <p eId="para_599">At present in our society, to ensure the public gets some semblance of fair and honest representation, we must put in place structures such as the ombudsman to deal with situations nobody else is willing to deal with.  Politicians cannot deal with these issues any more not because they are in an invidious position and are afraid to, but because nobody will take any notice.  People consider it a personal affront.  I do not want to discuss past cases from recent years.  Other speakers referred to recent history.  Nobody wants to accept that one has the right to make a complaint even on one's own behalf.  This is a sad reflection on our society.  It is the way we have gone and are going and we must do something about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_600">All Members of the House deal with constituency queries and will know that fees have become a major issue in family law.  I hope younger Members of the House will never have reason to have recourse to these areas.  When we discussed these issues in the House a number of years ago, they were all supposed to be extremely simple, but they have become complicated and extremely expensive.  They require references from professionals from all corners, all with an opinion.  The sanctity and volumes of fees charged for what to the rest of us seem to be simple issues are truly amazing.</p>
          <p eId="para_601">The legal services ombudsman has a major task ahead.  Will the ombudsman be able to monitor the ongoing processes and procedures and to intervene without reference from a complainant?  For example, Ireland has more regulators than Texas had following the US civil war.  We have a regulator for everything.  They are supposed to identify what needs to be regulated, ensure everything is running smoothly and make sure everything is done in accordance with their plans.  They should have the foresight and insight to deal with an issue before it becomes an issue and, hopefully, that will happen.</p>

            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Eamon Ryan)</from>
            <p eId="para_604">I propose to issue a draft policy paper shortly on next generation broadband, NGB, which will set out the framework for Government policy and related proposed actions in this area.  I will invite comments on the draft paper through an on-line consultation process.  While I cannot indicate the detail of the paper at this juncture, it is my ambition for Ireland to have a NGB infrastructure that will underpin a transformation to a knowledge economy based on leading edge development and application of information communications technology, ICT.  In the main, the private sector should build and finance NGB networks.</p>
            <p eId="para_605">The role of Government is to ensure the legislation and regulatory regime is such as to promote competition and investment by the private sector in NGB.  Direct Government investment in broadband infrastructure will be primarily targeted at supporting regional competitiveness and addressing digital divide issue.  The role of Government investment is not to support one particular broadband technology or the investment proposals of any particular private sector investor.  In addition to an on-line consultation process referred to above, I also propose to hold a one day forum to hear the views of all stakeholders on the overall framework and specific policy actions.  My Department has been given the new responsibility of drawing up a new action plan on the information society.  I envisage that the broadband policy paper and the subsequent consultation process will be an important input into this action plan.</p>

            <from>Deputy Joe McHugh</from>
            <p eId="para_606">I thank the Minister.  He is two weeks shy of completing his first year in the job and many questions and grey areas remain regarding broadband provision.  The public is looking for a clear policy direction.  The forum on broadband met last February.  Since then Deputy Coveney, the Fine Gael spokesperson in this area, has repeatedly asked when the forum will report and engage in consultation.  The Minister said this will happen soon.  When will the consultation process happen?  His reference to an on-line consultation is ironic.  Will a facility be provided for those who do not have access to computers or broadband to contribute to the debate, given many rural areas do not have access to broadband?</p>
            <p eId="para_607">An issue arose earlier regarding the Taoiseach's comment that the national development plan is under review.  Will the investment the Minister plans in ICT in schools proceed?  There is complete confusion about this, as highlighted by my colleague, Deputy Brian Hayes, earlier.  Will the Minister shed some light on that?</p>
            <p eId="para_608">Have industry representative groups been consulted?  If not, when will that happen?  The Minister said a report would be published soon but he still has not specified when.  It is important that the industry representative groups, which are key contributors to the broadband debate, be included.  When he was in Opposition, the Minister was a strong advocate of the importance of NGN.  I do not intend this as a political slight but his energies have been very much employed in the green sector and the broadband debate has been consigned to the position of bridesmaid within his portfolio.  It is evident our position on NGN, next generation networking, is weak in a EU context.  Will he take responsibility for this area?  He has been in the position for almost a year but, as of yet, he has provided little direction.</p>

            <p eId="para_612">All domestic groups will be involved in the consultation document.  I regret the delay in putting it out but I apologise to no one for trying to getting things right before doing so.  I am confident my colleagues will recognise this as a crucial investment under the NDP. In the past year, broadband connections increased from 500,000 to 1 million and mobile broadband connections from zero to 120,000, while Ireland was the third fastest growing economy in the OECD in terms of broadband connection.  I am happy we are progressing but we have a long way to go.  I am happy to lead us there.</p>

The Irish oil industry is fully privatised, liberalised and deregulated.  There is free entry into the market.  Prices at the pump reflect market factors such as global market price, transportation costs, euro-dollar fluctuations and other operating costs.  In April 2008 the average price of petrol in Ireland was €1.20 per litre.  The average price of diesel was €1.24 per litre.  In April 2004 the average price of petrol was 93.8 cent per litre and that of diesel was 85.3 cent per litre.</p>
            <p eId="para_615">Under the Electricity Regulation Act 1999, as amended, electricity and gas prices are the statutory responsibility of the independent energy regulator, the Commission for Energy Regulation.  I have no direct function in setting or regulating energy prices.  I am, however, advised that the commission will commence its annual tariff review of Bord Gáis energy supply and ESB customer supply in the coming months.  The commission has signalled that the recent upward trend in international fuel costs may have significant impact on electricity and gas costs for the coming tariff year 2008-09.</p>
            <p eId="para_616">Increasing energy costs pose particular difficulties for vulnerable consumers, including the elderly and those on low incomes.  A number of schemes are in place to assist those on low incomes in regard to fuel and electricity costs as well as to enhance the key contribution of energy efficiency to alleviating fuel poverty.  The Revised Estimate for the Department of Social and Family Affairs includes provision of €158 million in respect of fuel allowance and electricity and natural gas allowances.  I have provided €4 million to fund the warmer homes scheme in 2008.  This scheme supports the installation of energy efficiency measures, including attic insulation, draught proofing, hot water cylinder insulation and wall cavity insulation.  The scheme is co-ordinated by Sustainable Energy Ireland and is delivered principally through community-based organisations.  Over 9,000 homes have benefited from the scheme since its introduction in 2003.</p>
            <p eId="para_617">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_618">The scheme is targeted at householders who are in receipt of the fuel allowance, disability benefit or invalid benefit and is provided either free of charge or for a nominal fee, less than €100.  Households are identified by community-based installers working closely in association with other intermediaries including the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, health services and GP networks.</p>
            <p eId="para_619">The fuel poverty action research project is assessing the effectiveness of the interventions delivered under the current warmer homes scheme in addressing fuel poverty.  Its final report is due in coming months.  Information on all national and local schemes of assistance in respect of fuel poverty is provided in the cross-agency information pack Keep Well This Winter, Stay Well and Warm.</p>
            <p eId="para_620">In addition, my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, introduced a new housing aid for older people scheme last November which provides targeted support to improve conditions in the existing housing of older people.  The scheme supports works that can improve the energy efficiency of homes, including insulation, provision of central heating and repair or replacement of windows and doors.</p>

            <p eId="para_621">The Minister must recognise that this is a grossly inadequate response to what is a real and extensive problem.  I ask him to recognise that the impact of fuel poverty is very severe.  It can and does take human life.  On this island, it is reckoned that approximately 2,500 lives are lost in winter.</p>
            <p eId="para_622">A fuel poverty strategy is in place in Northern Ireland.  Does the Minister not accept that he has a particular responsibility to protect those vulnerable people who will simply not be able to heat their homes this winter?  I ask him not to be so coy when it comes to giving information.  We all know that Bord Gáis is talking about an increase of up to 20% and that the ESB is talking about something similar.  In respect of petrol and diesel prices, will the Minister look to the example of Australia where a petrol commissioner has been appointed to take on the oil companies?  Has the Minister dealt with the mystery of why diesel is still more expensive than petrol?  Will he state how he intends to reduce the impact on people on low incomes and indeed people on incomes that are not necessarily that low because the pool is increasing all the time?  These are the people directly affected by the steep rise in utility and petrol costs which we will see over the coming winter and which needs to be prepared for now and not left on the long finger.</p>

            <p eId="para_634">Identifying that as the problem demystifies the mystery of why diesel is more expensive.  The reason diesel has been more expensive in recent times is that the demand for diesel globally is ahead of supply.  It is because of events in China and other countries where it is being used in diesel generators because they are short of electricity.  In Europe, it is because we are switching towards diesel cars.  That is the reason diesel prices in every country have gone up.</p>
            <p eId="para_635">That is backed up by the fundamental problem that we are approaching a peak in global oil production.  We are not unaware of and are committed to protecting our people from fuel poverty in those circumstances in whatever way we can.  I increased the budget in the warmer homes scheme from €2.5 million to €4 million to provide people with what is the only proper solution.  This is insulating and reducing their use of the material as the best way of cutting back in their long-term spending.</p>

         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</b>
         if he has had contact with the National Consumer Agency or with the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment to address the high cost of diesel here; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          </question>
          <speech by="#EamonRyanGP" eId="spk_339" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Energy_and_Natural_Resources">
            <from>Deputy Eamon Ryan</from>
            <p eId="para_640">As I said in my reply to the previous question, the Irish oil industry is fully privatised, liberalised and deregulated.  There is free entry into the market and prices at the pump for both petrol and diesel reflect market factors, notably global market price, transportation costs, euro-dollar fluctuations and other operating costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_641">Traditionally, diesel has been less expensive than petrol at the forecourts in Ireland.  This has been due to the fact that the international prices for both products were previously at a similar level and excise duty is lower on diesel.  The international price of diesel has, however, increased because of a rising demand for diesel in Europe, as well as in China and other developing economies.  European refineries have been unable to keep pace with the demand for diesel, which means that it has to be sourced from further afield, particularly Russia.</p>
            <p eId="para_642">The International Energy Agency has also reported an over-supply of petrol in the market stemming from high production and high stocks of petrol in the US.  This has curbed exports of petrol from Europe to the US, resulting in high stocks of petrol in Europe.  The combination of these various market factors has contributed to the rise in diesel prices relative to petrol.</p>
            <p eId="para_643">The increase in the price of diesel is affecting all of Europe.  EU price figure comparisons published on 19 May 2008 show that the average price of diesel in Ireland in April was €1.24 per litre.  This price ranks as the eighth cheapest price out of the 27 EU member states reported by the EU on 19 May.  The average price of diesel in the UK in the same report was €1.56 per litre and the average EU price for diesel was €1.40 per litre.  These comparisons demonstrate that Ireland is by no means the worst affected country in Europe in respect of the price of diesel.</p>
            <p eId="para_644">My officials are in regular contact with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment on a range of matters, given the clear relationships between energy policy, competitiveness and enterprise.  Neither Department, however, has any role in respect of price control in the oil market.  Price differences are an ongoing feature of the market economy and it is a matter for consumers to exercise choice.</p>
            <p eId="para_645">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_646">The Deputy will be aware that petrol stations are required to display their prices clearly so that consumers can make an informed choice.  Consumer protection is a matter for the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and consumers can report any infringements of the law in this regard to the National Consumer Agency.</p>
            <p eId="para_647">The upward global trend in oil prices and the prospects of a peak and then decline in global oil production reinforces the imperative for Ireland to reduce its oil dependency and to use energy wisely and efficiently.  The actions we are taking to accelerate delivery of our targets for renewable energy and energy efficiency are essential to ensure a sustainable energy future for the economy and consumers.</p>

            <p eId="para_648">I will be brief this time and give the Minister some time to answer my question.  I came into this job working from the basic premise of thinking globally and acting locally.  The Government has gone completely askew.  It is blaming global matters and doing nothing locally.</p>
            <p eId="para_649">Everybody knows that diesel is €1.40 per litre.  The Minister is trying to get people to use environmentally friendly fuels but it has completely backfired.  There is a danger that people might start buying petrol cars.  There are no incentives for hauliers who have bought environmentally friendly lorries in terms of reduced motor tax for complying with environmentally friendly regulations.</p>
            <p eId="para_650">In respect of doing something locally and not blaming global matters, the Minister mentioned countries from the UK to China to the US.  In terms of something local, we on this side of the House launched a proposal to reduce the VAT rate from 13.5% to 12.5%, which would affect goods like coal, gas and electricity products.  What is the Minister's position in respect of this proposal?  Will he consider bringing it to Cabinet because it will directly affect the matter referred to by Deputy McManus, namely, heating oil for people?  We are talking about a figure of approximately €300 million that is going directly as a windfall tax to the electricity producers, which could go directly to the consumer.  What is the Minister's position on this and will he consider the Fine Gael proposal launched yesterday?</p>

          <speech by="#EamonRyanGP" eId="spk_354" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Energy_and_Natural_Resources">
            <from>Deputy Eamon Ryan</from>
            <p eId="para_665">The Government is firmly committed to the sustainable development and deployment of bio-fuels in line with the EU commitments agreed by the European Council in March 2007.  We have committed to achieving a target of 5.75% market penetration by 2010, in accordance with the current EU bio-fuels directive and Commission proposals in this area.  We have also committed to achieving 10% market penetration of bio-fuels by 2020 which is the target proposed by the EU Commission.  These targets will be underpinned by the introduction of a bio-fuels obligation in 2009.  The proposed obligation will require all fuel suppliers to ensure that bio-fuels represent a certain percentage of their annual fuel sales.  By moving to an obligation market players will be given the long-term certainty to make appropriate investment decisions.  Eleven other member states have chosen obligations as their preferred policy option.</p>
            <p eId="para_666">My Department is actively engaged in the EU Council Working Group, which is working to agree the sustainability criteria.  Currently, the feed stocks used for bio-fuels production are generally sourced on the open internationally traded commodities market with little or no information attached to these with regard to their origins.  It is only through setting stringent sustainability criteria that Ireland and other member states will be able to trace the source of these fuels, and obviate the cumulative effect of unsustainable practices on developing countries.  I wholeheartedly support the Commission's commitment to ensuring that rigorous sustainability criteria are put in place and complied with under the new directive.</p>
            <p eId="para_667">The obligation will build on the 2005 and 2006 mineral oil tax relief schemes for bio-fuels.  A total of 18 projects have been awarded excise relief between 2005 and 2010.  The schemes, valued at more than €200 million aim to ensure that Ireland reaches an initial target of over 2% market penetration of bio-fuels this year.  The schemes are geared towards those producing bio-fuel.  As a result of the excise relief schemes, bio-fuels are already being mainstreamed in blends of up to 5% at a number of existing petrol and diesel pumps.</p>
            <p eId="para_668">Ireland's national bio-fuels obligation will take full account of EU developments on bio-fuels and related sustainability.  Ireland is working closely with other member states in the negotiation of the directive to ensure that all bio-fuels placed on the European and Irish market are verifiably produced by reference to appropriate environmental and social sustainability criteria.</p>
            <p eId="para_669">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_670">The motive for promoting bio-fuels is to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions from the transport sector and to ensure we have an alternative fuel supply to power essential transport, agriculture and industrial services in the event of a disruption in conventional oil supplies.</p>
            <p eId="para_671">I will shortly be launching the public consultation process on the proposed obligation which will allow all interested stakeholders to submit their views on the proposal.  Specific details of the obligation will be finalised on foot of the consultation process and will reflect EU developments over the coming months.</p>

            <p eId="para_672">The Minister's colleague, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, announced the introduction of  bio-fuels schemes in 2007 at which time he promised there would be a period of consultation to be followed by the introduction of legislation.  It is now mid-2008 and as of yet consultation has not taken place.  Furthermore, we are still completely in the dark about the proposed legislation.  Will the Minister clarify if at this late date there will be a consultation period and, more important, will legislation on this area be introduced shortly?</p>
            <p eId="para_673">Some 16 companies in this sector have been granted permits for excise duty.  Does the Minister consider that figure of 16 companies is adequate or should the number of such permits granted be increased to stimulate the bio-fuels industry?</p>

            <from>Deputy Eamon Ryan</from>
            <p eId="para_674">I hope and plan to have the consultation paper prepared in July this year.  There will be a consultation process prior to any legislation being framed.</p>
            <p eId="para_675">We are very much driven by the proposals being developed in the European Union.  This is an area where we as a small country cannot control world markets or the World Trade Organisation's negotiation rules in the area.  We have to work with the Commission.  I agree with the key developments it is examining.  The first is to guarantee that any bio-fuels development adds a carbon emissions reduction, namely, that there is an energy gain from it.  A second development it is examining is that any bio-fuels development must be from sustainable resources.  We must ensure we are not in the process of developing bio-fuel targets that would lead to world hunger, that would result in the chopping down of native rainforest or infringe other ecosystems which must be protected and that we can have a clear traceability of fuels so that we know exactly from where they are coming.  It is through such European negotiations, which are ongoing and should be completed by the end of this year, that we will establish our policy framework.</p>
            <p eId="para_676">A bio-fuels obligation system is the right way to go rather than the taxpayer subsidising the sector.  The targets in this sector are different from some of our other renewable targets in that they are not targets for us to strain to exceed or reach at any cost.  We need a small supply of bio-fuel alternative fuels to ensure that if we do have a serious future oil shock, we will have an essential alternative oil supply that will run essential farming, industrial and transport services to maintain our society.</p>
            <p eId="para_677">The key incentive for me in developing bio-fuels is to have a security of oil supply in the event of a global oil shock.  We would obtain a 1% or 2% supply from waste material, which is a small but significant percentage.  Such energy generation contributes to solving an environmental problem and it is indigenous.  The more companies there are in this area, the better.  We should aim to grow as many bio-fuel crops as we can without bankrupting or destabilising other aspects of our agricultural industry.  There is potential to grow additional crops, particularly if there is the development of second generation bio-fuels, which involve the use of a feed stock — not a product that would otherwise go into the food chain but one such as algae or some other such product that does not interfere with the food market.  We will also be purchasing bio-fuels on the international market, but that can only be done within the constraint of the new EU obligation system which, itself, will set the criteria that makes sure that they are sustainable and that their production does not cause world hunger.  That is the policy framework within which we will develop a bio-fuels policy.</p>

            <p eId="para_686">I have to return to the fundamental principle I mentioned earlier.  The way the Spanish are approaching this — and what Fine Gael proposes in this respect — is in terms of tax revenue, namely, that it would be taxed.  Such tax yield would go back into the general tax revenue.  My key point on this issue is that if we are raising any revenues, and it is not by any means certain or easy that it could be done effectively but if we can — and we are examining that — we would have to ensure that the revenue goes back into what is the most crucial investment we need to make, namely to turn this economy around to ensure a renewable, more energy efficient future.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Seán Power)</from>
            <p eId="para_689">As the Deputy will be aware, the Government has agreed to fund, through the Vote of my Department, the rehabilitation of the abandoned mine sites at Silvermines, County Tipperary.  North Tipperary County Council agreed to act as agents in this matter and I am happy to continue with this arrangement.</p>
            <p eId="para_690">In 2006, following a competitive tendering process, North Tipperary County Council appointed Golder Associates to finalise the design and manage the implementation of the rehabilitation programme as set out in earlier conceptual plans.  The initial focus of the rehabilitation project at Silvermines is being placed on those sites that contain hazardous waste, Gortmore Tailings Management Facility and the waste facility at Garryard.</p>
            <p eId="para_691">Planning permission was granted by North Tipperary County Council on 17 September 2007 for the design of rehabilitation work at the Gortmore Tailings Management Facility.  A tender notice was advertised in the <i>EU Journal</i> on 21 January this year, following which seven companies were shortlisted and invited to submit a tender for the first phase of the rehabilitation works.  Tenders were received from all seven companies on 21 April 2008 and subsequently assessed by Golder Associates.  On 21 May 2008, my Department authorised North Tipperary County Council to issue a letter of intention to accept the tender of a construction firm for the first phase of the remediation works at Gortmore at Silvermines.  I understand that this letter was issued by the council on 22 May and it is expected that works will commence on site in June, subject to the contractor producing insurances, bond and tax clearance.</p>

            <p eId="para_692">I wish the Minister of State well in this Department.  I welcome what has been announced for the Silvermines area, but the local people are disappointed that this is only a patching exercise.  I understand that less than €2 million is being spent on a part of the site. There are six sites in total.  The Minister mentioned two.  The other four are Shallee, Gorteenadiha, Ballygowan and Magcobar.  Will the Minister of State reaffirm the Government's commitment to the rehabilitation of the Silvermines Mogul sites and confirm that the necessary resources will be made available in the coming years?  Will the Minister of State outline the funding which will be made available in 2009 and 2010 and the works which will be carried out?</p>
            <p eId="para_693">The people of this area have been waiting for 26 years for this development.  Before last year's election, a commitment of €10.6 million was made for the rehabilitation of Silvermines.  There is a huge difference between €2 million and €10.6 million.</p>

This is a complex matter which is being actively pursued by the project team.  It is expected that an application will be made for this purpose in the very near future.</p>
            <p eId="para_697">Work is also continuing on finalising the detailed designs for the other sites to be rehabilitated at Silvermines.  In addition, essential conservation works are being carried out on the historic mine structures at Ballygowan and Shallee.

            <p eId="para_708">I have no plans to issue a policy direction to the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, on mobile termination charges.</p>
            <p eId="para_709">The regulation of telecommunications operators, including regulatory issues surrounding telephony charges, is the statutory responsibility of ComReg in accordance with the requirements of the Communications Regulation Act 2002 and the regulations transposing the EU regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services.</p>
            <p eId="para_710">As Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, I have responsibility for overall telecoms policy.  My main goal in this policy is to create conditions for sustainable growth and competition that will benefit the economic and social development of Ireland and facilitate competitive services.</p>
            <p eId="para_711">It is my belief that improving the market conditions to enhance competition is the best way to drive down mobile telephone charges to the end user.  The more competitive telecoms services that are on offer, the better in the long run for consumers, the sector and the economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_712">The European Commission has signalled an intention to review mobile termination rates, MTRs, this year.  Commissioner Reding has proposed to launch a public consultation, working with the European Regulators Group, ERG, on the harmonisation of MTRs within the EU for all calls.  My Department and ComReg will be actively working with the EU Commission and ERG on this recommendation.</p>
            <p eId="para_713">The EU Commission is also preparing a communication to the European Parliament and the Council on the review of the functioning of the roaming regulation and its possible extension to cover SMS and data roaming, which is due before the end of 2008.  Commissioner Reding has given the mobile industry until 1 July 2008 to cut the price for sending a text message or surfing the web on a laptop when roaming in the EU.  Commissioner Reding has raised the prospect of setting caps on text messages and international data services if her calls to cut costs are not answered.</p>

            <p eId="para_714">I am disappointed that the Minister will not use his influence to change the policy.  I accept that ComReg may fear a legal challenge.  Nevertheless, the Minister is the man in charge.  We are talking about a potential 20% reduction in charges to the retailer.  The Minister has a responsibility to act on this matter, rather than wait for the EU to take action.</p>
            <p eId="para_715">The Minister referred to roaming charges.  Without crossing the political border, a mobile telephone user can incur roaming charges.  If one drives between Greencastle and Muff in east Inishowen, one will receive a text message welcoming one to the United Kingdom.  Some years ago, the O2 network introduced a zero roaming charge for the whole of Ireland.  However, this only applies to users going from one O2  network to another.  Customers who, when near the Border, do not re-set their telephones to O2  find themselves in the Orange or Vodafone network and liable to roaming charges.  Does the Minister have plans to get rid of roaming charges for cross-Border users if we are to comply with the legal requirements of the Good Friday Agreement?</p>

            <from>Deputy Eamon Ryan</from>
            <p eId="para_716">One does not always need to issue policy directions to give one's views.  There are three policy requirements in the development of our mobile networks.  One needs an environment which helps companies invest.  One needs innovation and services which facilitate the development of new innovative digital services that help the people.  Deputy McHugh is right that we need services that are cheap, available everywhere and of higher speeds in the data end.  We must push those requirements and make sure that our regulator and the industry are providing a proper service.</p>
            <p eId="para_717">Commissioner Reding's proposals are not insignificant.  It is right to work with the Commission as it goes to the European framework.  Commissioner Reding's proposals are radical, particularly in the area of data roaming, where there is a real issue as we move towards mobile broadband services.  I support the radical reduction regarding data services, which she is now talking about.</p>
            <p eId="para_718">In opening our mobile networks to new data digital applications, we can make a commercial case for such networks.  They will benefit in the long run.  Those companies which are ahead of the game in providing digital services and mobile data networks will have a real commercial advantage and will make profits from the services they deliver to the customer.</p>
            <p eId="para_719">This is a risky business for those companies.  They have been engaged in what has been a profitable voice mobile business, particularly when it involves roaming.  We must change the nature of that business.  We need to make it more innovative which, in particular, means bringing data costs down.  At the same time, we must be aware of the companies' needs to have an investment environment that facilitates the development of those innovations.  It is a complex and crucial area at the centre of our telecommunications market.</p>

            <p eId="para_722">I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 20 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_723">The provision of broadband services is, in the first instance, a matter for the private sector.  Broadband service providers operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated, where appropriate, by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.  The role of the Government is to formulate regulatory and infrastructure policies to facilitate the provision of high quality telecommunications services by competing private sector service providers.</p>
            <p eId="para_724">The widespread provision of broadband services continues to be a priority for the Government.  In that regard the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has undertaken initiatives to address the gaps in broadband coverage.  These included providing grant aid under the group broadband scheme and ongoing investment in metropolitan area networks.</p>
            <p eId="para_725">Although broadband is now widely available, there are still some parts of the country where the private sector will be unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband services.  These areas are being addressed by the national broadband scheme, NBS, which will provide broadband services to areas currently not served and will ensure all reasonable requests for broadband are met.</p>
            <p eId="para_726">The first phase of the NBS procurement process, the pre-qualification questionnaire, is now complete.  Four candidates pre-qualified to enter the next phase of the procurement process.  Following the withdrawal of the IFA-Motorola consortium as a candidate, the remaining three candidates commenced competitive dialogue with the Department and are developing their proposed solutions to meet the Department's requirements for the delivery of broadband to the unserved areas of the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_727">The Department recently received notice of judicial review proceedings regarding certain elements of the NBS mapping process.  These proceedings are before the Commercial Court and due for hearing on 10 and 11 June 2008.  A speedy conclusion of the matter has been requested to advance the NBS as quickly as possible.  It is anticipated that a preferred bidder will be selected in August 2008, with the roll-out to commence as soon as possible thereafter.</p>
            <p eId="para_728">Up to €970,000 will be distributed by Pobal this year to support ICT initiatives aimed at disadvantaged communities.  Almost 1,500 public access Internet PCs are available in public libraries across the country.  I welcome the roll-out of all electronic communication infrastructure by service providers, which increases competition in the market.  Increased competition gives rise to better quality services, increased choice and more competitive prices, all of which enhance connectivity for the consumer.</p>

            <from>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
            <p eId="para_729">Is the Minister aware of a recent report that, despite improvements in broadband roll-out, placed Ireland 12 out of 15 in a survey on EU broadband penetration?  Despite the third highest growth rate of broadband services, penetration remains well below the EU average.</p>
            <p eId="para_730">What is particularly striking is the low level of broadband accessibility in rural areas.  There are still large areas of the State with no access to broadband.  A year ago while Dún Laoghaire had penetration levels of 40%, the rate in Leitrim was 7% and Sligo, 10% and Leinster counties such as Wexford and Longford had similar levels.  Does the Minister understand this is a serious problem for the rural economy?  It has been cited as one of the main barriers to job creation in rural areas.  Will the Minister agree it is, therefore, too important an area to be left to private providers and the State must play a greater role in ensuring broadband access is available throughout the State?</p>
            <p eId="para_731">Will the Minister agree a universal service obligation, similar to that which applies to the telephone network and the postal services, ought to be applied to broadband services?  If the market remains in private hands, private companies should be obliged to provide services even in areas where they claim no profit can be made.</p>
            <p eId="para_732">The Minister's party was correct in opposing the privatisation of Eircom  in 1999.  The deficiencies I have highlighted are a direct consequence of this.  Two years ago, the Minister supported the retaining of Eircom as a natural State monopoly to ensure access to broadband in every part of the State.  Does he still hold that view?</p>

            <from>Deputy Eamon Ryan</from>
            <p eId="para_733">The events since privatisation in 1999 have been unsatisfactory.  The change of ownership of Eircom on a regular basis and the lack of investment, particularly between 2002 and 2004, are the reasons we are playing catch-up.  It was the failure then to invest in broadband that put us down the league table.  I said at the time that this was a bad business mistake because broadband will deliver key services in society.</p>
            <p eId="para_734">The State plays a role and will continue to do so with the NBS.  When the market claims it does not have a commercial case for providing broadband services in certain areas, the State will provide them through the NBS.  That is the State funding the roll-out of broadband through private providers.</p>
            <p eId="para_735">The State has other roles in, for example, the management of the wireless spectrum.  It is now a key component in the delivery of a range of mobile broadband services.  This asset, I believe, should be used in an innovative and flexible way to promote the development of new services.  That is an area where the State is involved.</p>
            <p eId="para_736">The State is involved in the use of existing State assets to support broadband access.  This is done through the metropolitan area networks and, for example, in Dublin through the QBCs.  New QBCs are fitted with ducting to facilitate broadband development.  The State has a key role in assisting the development of broadband services through the provision and delivery of health, social welfare, education and other services.</p>

I would very much like to see such investment proposals progressed.  However, I had to make a policy decision as to whether it is right for the State to make a direct investment in any one platform or technology.  My assessment is that it is not right to do so.  It is better to clarify this early so other investment decisions are not disrupted.</p>
            <p eId="para_741">The Telecommunications and Internet Federation estimated that €700 million is invested each year by a plethora of telecommunications companies.

            <p eId="para_749">These broadband technologies are crucial to the economic and social development of our country.  The recent ESRI medium-term review report shows that one of the main areas of growth will be in the development of international traded services.

            <p eId="para_752">I will check my information but I understand Thurles is included in the third phase of the MAN scheme.  At the same time as it is intended to publish our next generation broadband report, I intend publishing the value for money report on the metropolitan area networks which assesses exactly the question asked by the Deputy.  We must decide how these metropolitan area networks are used where there is not strong connectivity between the town and the network and the crucial issue of how to connect those fibre-optic rings into the house or into the business.  This is a real expense.  It costs approximately €10,000 at least for any short connection from a fibre-optic ring into a house and this cost makes the development of fibre broadband connection prohibitive except for a very large business.</p>

            <from>Deputy Eamon Ryan</from>
            <p eId="para_760">I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 27 and 54 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_761">I will shortly launch the public consultation on the proposed bio-fuels obligation.  The consultation process will enable all interested stakeholders to submit their views on the proposal.  In that context, EU developments on bio-fuels policy in light of the emerging concerns in relation to sustainability will be fully factored in and will be publicly debated.  Specific details of the obligation will be finalised on foot of the consultation process.  The intention is to have the bio-fuels obligation in place next year in line with the programme for Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_762">We are currently working to deliver the EU indicative target of 5.75% penetration of bio-fuels by 2010.  Under the excise relief schemes over 50 million litres of bio-fuels are being deployed in Ireland, of which in the region of 25 million litres are produced in this country.  The EU Commission's proposed renewable energy directive sets a minimum mandatory target of 10% market penetration of bio-fuels in transport in all member states by 2020.  The proposal also includes an explicit framework for sustainability criteria in relation to bio-fuels.  These criteria are designed to ensure that bio-fuels deployed by member states are produced sustainably and do not contribute towards the degradation of the natural environment, including the destruction of forests, wetlands or long-established grassland.  The criteria will also set strict targets for bio-fuels in terms of the greenhouse gas emissions they must save before they can be considered eligible as counting towards national targets.  My Department is actively engaged in the EU Council working group which is working to agree the sustainability criteria.</p>
            <p eId="para_763">Currently, the feed stocks used for bio-fuels production are generally sourced on the open internationally traded commodities market with little or no information attached to these with regard to their origins.  It is only through setting stringent sustainability criteria that Ireland and other member states will be able to trace the source of these fuels and obviate the cumulative effect of unsustainable practices on developing countries.  I wholeheartedly support the Commission's commitment to ensuring that rigorous sustainability criteria are put in place and complied with under the new directive.</p>

            <from>Deputy Noel J. Coonan</from>
            <p eId="para_764">The Minister says the EU target of 10% must be met by 2020, yet there are only 16 companies in the country who have permits.  A company in my area, Centenary co-op, is looking for a permit.  It has planning permission and a building ready to go but it has not been granted a permit.  This means the company will have to pay the full rate of 37 cent per litre if it is to go into production.  The Minister has said a lot but he has said nothing really; he has just talked about consultation processes.  Has he any concrete, positive or imaginative proposals for a strategy to reach that target?</p>
            <p eId="para_765">The Minister earlier referred to a Fine Gael proposal as "gimmicks".  This is the height of the production season for agriculture and an important time for the hauliers who must transport that produce to mainland Europe, yet they are being ripped off by the price of diesel.  What the Minister did not say was that the higher the price of diesel on the international market, the more revenue this Government is receiving.  The Minister is doing nothing for those people.  It is no gimmick.  Seven farmers a week are going out of business and the cost of production this summer will crucify them and put many more of them out of business.  It is time the Minister took this issue seriously and addressed the problem for producers and hauliers.</p>

            <p eId="para_766">I fully sympathise with and understand the difficulties faced by people, particularly in the haulage industry and elsewhere, because of increasing diesel prices.  However, providing a short-term solution that ignores the fundamental long-term problem is not doing them or anyone else a favour.</p>

            <from>Deputy Eamon Ryan</from>
            <p eId="para_768">I am talking about the haulage people.  We have the eighth cheapest priced diesel in the European Union.  We will not serve those people well by addressing a long-term problem with a short-term solution which will not have any material effect in the long run.  We are far better investing any resources we have in providing a long-term solution to what is a long-term problem.</p>
            <p eId="para_769">I return to what I said earlier.  The crucial issue is that we identify to the Irish people and provide real clarity as to the scale of the challenge and problem we face.  A total of 60% of our energy comes from imported oil.  We do not have any oil ourselves and we are not likely to have any in the next 20 years.  The majority of our oil will come from the Middle East where we do not have a secure future supply.  We are exposed.  The response to that exposure cannot be to pretend that it is just a short-term problem and that if we reduced our tax by 1%, which would probably be gobbled up by the market anyway, we would solve the problem.  We would not.  We need to make fundamental changes in everything we do to address that long-term fundamental problem.</p>
            <p eId="para_770">Bio-fuels represent one of the answers.  One of the greatest frustrations for companies who want to get into this area has been that the tax-exempt scheme was a competitive scheme which left a lot of companies — of the kind the Deputy referred to — outside the process.  They did not win in the competition, therefore they could not develop anything.  They could not get the excise duty exemption.  The key attraction of an obligation scheme is that it does not provide such a restriction; it is an open door to anyone who can make an economic and, crucially, a sustainable case for their production.  Then there is no impediment to them in developing fuels.</p>

            <from>Deputy Liz McManus</from>
            <p eId="para_771">On the last point, I support the Minister in his call for honesty.  I do not have a problem with that and I know it is difficult but I ask the Minister to consider that it is not honesty that the poor and the elderly of this country need but rather support.  The Minister cannot expect them to bear the burden he is asking of them this coming winter.  It has to be a fair burden and we all must share the burden fairly.  What the Minister is doing by refusing to recognise that there is a need for a fuel poverty strategy is expecting the poor to pay an undue price, which is unacceptable.</p>
            <p eId="para_772">Is the Minister aware that while he is expecting the consumer to pay increased prices, he must also accept that the Government is making an absolute killing out of increased fuel prices?  Is he aware that in 2007, the return from VAT to the Government coffers was €970 million and this year it will be well over €1,000 million?  Is he willing to accept that this money should be ring-fenced and put to good use in terms of ensuring that we have a good bio-fuels strategy and a good meeting of that requirement?</p>
            <p eId="para_773">I return to the issue of bio-fuel traceability.  If I buy a steak in a supermarket I can see the farmer's name and a picture of the farm where the animal was reared, yet the Minister cannot tell me how much of our imported bio-fuel comes from the developing world.  Unless that issue is addressed, all the fine words about protecting against world hunger are meaningless.</p>

            <p eId="para_774">I share the Deputy's concern for those suffering from hunger and poverty, which is a crucial aspect of this matter.  That is why the Department of Social and Family Affairs is spending €158 million this year on natural gas and electricity allowances.

            <p eId="para_776">That is why we have practically doubled the budget for the warmer home scheme to assist people in low-income housing to cut back on the use of fuel, which is the best long-term solution, rather than trying to reduce tax which is a short-term solution.</p>
            <p eId="para_777">The Deputy is correct in saying that at present it is impossible under World Trade Organisation rules to differentiate between various bio-fuels.  They are sold globally and purchased on spot markets, so one does not have ultimate traceability.  That is why it is important to support, as I have done, Commissioner Piebalgs and Commissioner Dimas in their attempts to establish a new system to ensure full traceability on the energy efficiency of bio-fuel crops.  There are concerns that one might use as much energy in creating certain bio-fuels as one would obtain from them.  The new EU system will also determine whether the bio-fuel is from a sustainable resource.  It is important to support that EU initiative.  It is the only way of achieving such traceability and obtaining a secure supply of bio-fuels, which we use not only to reduce our emissions but also, crucially, as a back-up stock in case of future oil supply difficulties, while helping Irish agriculture in the process.</p>

            <p eId="para_778">Food imports and exports are completely reliant on the haulage industry.  Excluding excise duties, there has been a 360% increase in fuel prices over the past five years.  Fishermen say that 70% of their turnover is being spent on diesel for their boats, while the corresponding figure for the haulage industry is 50%.  Many haulage operators have bought new lorries that are economically efficient and are adding blue liquid solutions to be environmentally compliant.  Does the Minister think there is an opportunity to incentivise the haulage industry in some way, perhaps by discounting motor tax?  In his response, the Minister will say that we must look at the long-term position but, as Deputies McManus and Coonan have said, there is a short-term crisis because lorry drivers are going out of business every day.  What measures can the Minister take to ensure the future of the haulage industry?  They will go out of business in the short term, not to mention the long term.</p>

            <p eId="para_796">Another reason is that diets are changing in Asia.  The consumption of meat has doubled in the last five years in China, which has changed the agricultural model because it takes a lot more food grain to produce a pound of meat than a pound of grain.  In addition, certain food crops have gone into bio-fuels rather than the food chain and while that is not the main reason for rising food prices, it is one of them.  Another reason for higher food prices is that globally farmers are finding it difficult to survive or succeed because of increasing oil prices.  That affects the cost of fuel for tractors, as well as pesticides and fertilisers which are oil-based.  Irish farmers are also exposed and the agricultural community must consider how it can develop in future.</p>

            <p eId="para_800">The GATE Three process has recently been the subject of public consultation by the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER.  I am advised that no decision has yet been made on the scale or timeframe of GATE Three.</p>
            <p eId="para_801">Projects under the GATE Two process with grid connection offers and planning permission can access the renewable energy feed-in tariff, REFIT, support scheme, which is operated by my Department.  The REFIT scheme supports the construction of new renewable energy powered electricity generating plants.  The support programme delivers fixed purchase-prices to project developers.</p>
            <p eId="para_802">The guaranteed prices remove a price uncertainty for developers arising with pool market prices in the single electricity market and the associated revenue earning uncertainty.  This certainty on prices increases the predictability of future cash flows which is crucial for renewable energy investors at this time.  The REFIT guaranteed prices are indexed to the annual change in the consumer price index and are capable therefore of absorbing increases in investment costs and operating costs in that range.</p>
            <p eId="para_803">The public consultation process on processing GATE Three applications and the settling of any disputes on connection requests generally are matters for the Commission for Energy Regulation.  I have no statutory function in the matter.  However, my Department is monitoring developments closely and is liaising with the renewable energy sector, the CER and all relevant agencies through the renewable energy development group.  A fully cohesive approach by all stakeholders is critical to delivery on the complex challenges inherent in achieving our ambitious targets for renewable energy.</p>

            <p eId="para_804">Offshore energy projects currently get a set figure of €140 per megawatt hour, but will there be parity between offshore and onshore projects?  If so, what will the rate be, assuming it will not be exactly the same?  When will it be announced and what confidence can the Minister instil for the project investors?  We are not talking about the super-rich, but about small farmers who got together and built their own projects.  They want a timeframe for access to the grid.  Can the Minister shed some light on the matter?</p>

            <from>Deputy Eamon Ryan</from>
            <p eId="para_805">I do not believe that in the immediate future there will be parity between support measures for offshore and onshore for the simple reason that the environment and the capital costs of offshore are in excess of anything on onshore.  It is still an evolving technology and is not yet on a commercial scale.  I made a strategic decision that it was right for us as a country to seek to develop our offshore potential.  If we were not, at this stage, giving a signal that we wanted to get into that business we would see investment concentrating in Germany, England, France, Portugal and elsewhere where they have given similar support prices to the one we have outlined as our support price.  Failure to give a price in that range would have meant that investment would have gone to other countries.  I still think, even with that support price, there is no guarantee of the transfer of capital resources and other engineering expertise into the offshore area because it is expensive and there are certain constraints in terms of shipping and grid access that make it difficult to develop the offshore.</p>
            <p eId="para_806">In the future, we will develop our onshore potential first — something of the order of 4,000 MW was set out in our all island grid study as our onshore capability between now and 2020.  We will then develop our offshore in tandem.  It is probably an additional 2,000 MW first.  The advantage of offshore, if we crack it and if we get the economies of scale down, is that it can be scaled up to a very large scale and the wind is more consistent.</p>
            <p eId="para_807">The onshore business has also experienced difficulties, largely because of turbine availability, increasing turbine costs and operational and maintenance costs.  We have reviewed and kept in mind our support price system.  I outlined a series of changes in that regard at the recent Irish wind energy conference, including changes we would allow, such as contestable construction of the grid connection which is a major benefit for smaller developers.  We retrospectively increased the price to take into account an earlier year's inflation increase.  We have been working to determine a market price floor that gives some certainty to financers in the area.  We are working to fine tune our support price system which is necessary because of the new single electricity market in which we operate.  I believe we are getting that right.  We are starting to see investment in onshore wind on the scale needed but that is only the start.  We will then move on to offshore and a number of other sources.</p>

            <p eId="para_808">Has the Minister done everything he was supposed to have done in regard to offshore wind?  I think it was last year he announced the tariff scheme for offshore.  I welcomed it at the time and I thought the industry indicated that there was the possibility of an investment of €4 billion in offshore, but we have seen no developments.  When I raised this matter with the industry at a committee meeting, the response was that the scheme had not actually been introduced by way of a statutory instrument.  Perhaps the Minister will comment as I was surprised to hear that.</p>
            <p eId="para_809">I am sure the Minister would congratulate, as I do, the tidal energy company that has successfully connected the Irish energy company that is successfully connecting to the British grid.  Would he not consider it is something of an indictment that this is an Irish company, which has successfully innovated abroad and is getting contracts abroad, yet it is not happening in Ireland?  Surely that is a disappointment.</p>

          <p eId="para_832">The issue has affected several day care centres around Laois-Offaly.  It became public last weekend, after staff in Birr community nursing unit were told on Friday that day care services were to be suspended for the summer.  It appears there were some attempts this week to say staff were not told that, but they were most definitely told last Friday that services were to be suspended from 16 June.  I believe it was also to happen in several other centres in the constituency, including Abbeyleix, Mountmellick and Edenderry.  I understand from a telephone call I received today that it has been announced that the day care services in Mullingar will close for five weeks.  Senator Nicky McFadden, with whom I discussed the issue today, has expressed her concerns.  The Minister of State may not have an answer in regard to that area but this seems to be a trend in the midlands.</p>
          <p eId="para_833">It appears the situation has arisen because of the recruitment embargo.  Posts of those who have retired, or who are on maternity or sick leave have not been filled because of the tight budgetary position.  The staff in all these units work extremely hard to try to make ends meet.  Given that many of the units are doing a good job, I do not accept that this argument should come into play.</p>
          <p eId="para_834">I am sure the Minister of State appreciates the importance of these facilities.  For example, 115 people use the service at the unit in Birr for different amounts of time during the week.  These people have very different levels of care need.  Some are extremely vulnerable and many have no direct families.  For many it is their only social interaction during the week.  It is not just about the social interaction; it is also about the care needs and the medical needs that are fulfilled in the day care service.  The service is so crucial that a few years ago a decision was taken in Laois-Offaly not to suspend the service for the month of August.  Given that people depended on it so much, closing it for that month was found to be cruel and to cause a degree of difficulty.</p>
          <p eId="para_835">In a local radio interview yesterday the HSE indicated that there is a lesser demand for its services during the summer.  I do not accept that argument.  Very few of the 115 people who use the unit in Birr are able to go on a two-week holiday.  They need the service and use it constantly.  The number of people using the unit in recent years shows clearly that the demand does not change during the summer.  The cessation of the service, if it goes ahead, will lead to a virtual collapse of the public health nurse service also.  The nurses are already stretched to the limit and cannot possibly take an additional 115 people on to their books for the summer months.  There is no back-up plan or plan B if this goes ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_836">On Tuesday morning we were told the decision was on hold.  Some politicians have interpreted this as meaning that the closures will not take place.  I am not so convinced and I wonder whether they actually read the e-mail from the local health manager.  What is the precise position?  According to the statement from the health manager, while a final decision has not been taken on curtailment of services in Laois-Offaly PCCC, the Health Service Executive will keep the matter under regular review.  The letter gives no indication that the plan will not proceed.  Although the decision taken on Friday appears to be on hold, I seek a commitment that services will not be suspended either in the summer or at any other time.  I ask the Minister of State exactly what the HSE means by the comment in the same statement that plans are being considered which may result in alterations to the current level of service in the near future.  What services will be curtailed?</p>
          <p eId="para_837">This week I was contacted by a woman from County Offaly who was unable, due to the severity of her injury and her medical condition, to use crutches and a walking frame given to her when she broke her leg.  When her son approached the hospital to try to secure a wheelchair — the family was prepared to hire one from the hospital — he was told to go to Argos.  This case arose because the hospital is so stretched it is unable to provide basic services such as a wheelchair.</p>
          <p eId="para_838">I am concerned about what the HSE means when it refers to "alterations" in current levels of service.  While I am aware local staff are trying to implement cuts in areas which do not affect members of the public, the phrase "as a last resort" always seems to enter the equation.  Cutting services to people in serious need of care and medical attention is not a last resort, nor is it acceptable to me or my constituents.  I hope the Minister of State bears good news and will be able to inform the House that vital services will not be curtailed.</p>

          <p eId="para_839">I will take this Adjournment debate on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.</p>
          <p eId="para_840">A keystone of the Government's policy on older people is to support them to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.  To cater for the needs of older people the Government has invested heavily in this important area, resulting in significant service improvements in community supports in recent years.  In budgets 2006 and 2007, funding of more than €400 million was provided to enhance service developments across the sector.  Of this sum, €190 million was specifically earmarked for community-based services.  This covered, for example, home helps, home care packages, day-respite care, meals on wheels and sheltered housing initiatives at regional and local level.</p>
          <p eId="para_841">With regard to day and respite care, an additional €9 million was provided in 2006 for a wide range of new and increased services at local level, including improved therapy services for specific needs.  A further €3.5 million was provided the following year, which allowed the Health Service Executive provide in excess of 21,000 day places in 2007.</p>
          <p eId="para_842">I am informed by the HSE that it is committed to providing high quality services to the population of Laois-Offaly and has committed €1.79 million to day care services in the area this year.  In this context, all services are subject to constant monitoring and review bearing in mind the executive's requirement to keep expenditure levels within budget.</p>

          <from>Deputy Liz McManus</from>
          <p eId="para_847">I am grateful for an opportunity to raise the plight of Kevin McCabe of Wicklow and Joseph Hogan of Dublin, both of whom are inpatients at the National Rehabilitation Hospital in Dún Laoghaire.  It has been suggested that Kevin and Joseph will be discharged to the Mater Hospital from where they came, as they are included on the delayed discharge list.  Both young men have nowhere else to go because the funds to provide personal assistants and carers have not been made available by the Health Service Executive.</p>
          <p eId="para_848">The Mater Hospital is under pressure to transfer patients from its spinal injury unit to the National Rehabilitation Hospital's spinal programme and there is now pressure to move on Kevin and Joseph.  Both men say they know of others who were discharged back to the Mater Hospital and remain there two years later.  They are fearful that this will also be their fate and, as the years go by, they will become less visible to those who have a responsibility for funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_849">In early 2007, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, visited the National Rehabilitation Hospital.  During her visit she showed a special interest in the cases of Kevin and Joseph and requested that more information about them should be forwarded to Mr. Tom Kelly, her assistant at the time.  However, despite her assurances on the day, Kevin and Joseph remain in hospital with little hope for discharge other than to the Mater Hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_850">Kevin has been in the National Rehabilitation Hospital since November 2006 and was due for discharge in 2007.  Joseph, who became an inpatient in July 2006, was due for discharge in December 2006.  Both men have been allocated a specially built house in St. Brigid's Park, Greystones, County Wicklow, owned and managed by Cheshire Ireland.  Despite protracted lobbying and negotiations involving many sources, including Cheshire Ireland and the National Rehabilitation Hospital, funding for their care is not forthcoming from the HSE and a timescale has not been set for making such funding available.  This is the second delay and a major disappointment for Kevin and Joseph.</p>
          <p eId="para_851">The Cheshire Ireland housing initiative at St. Brigid's Park is funded through capital assistance grants provided by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  Owing to delays in the Department's approval process, Cheshire Ireland was unable to provide the support housing within the timeframe expected, which resulted in a delay of up to one year until February 2008.  The lack of HSE funding has affected a further four individuals with physical disabiities who have been allocated houses in St. Brigid's Park.  Two of the individuals in question live in Cheshire Ireland homes, while a third is being cared for in a family home by her brother who is finding it increasingly difficult to cope financially.</p>
          <p eId="para_852">Since the beginning of 2007, Cheshire Ireland has been having ongoing discussions on securing the new core revenue funding needed to provide the required services in St. Brigid's Park.  The HSE has made clear to Cheshire Ireland that the required funding will be provided once the people move to their new services.  However, the position is that two young men cannot go to their new home.  I urge the Minister to resolve this terrible situation.</p>

          <p eId="para_853">I take this Adjournment debate on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.  I am pleased to have this opportunity to address the issue raised by the Deputy.</p>
          <p eId="para_854">The Department of Health and Children has been informed by the Health Service Executive that the facilities referred to by the Deputy are new Cheshire Ireland supported accommodation which was funded through Wicklow County Council under the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government's capital assistance scheme.  I understand the bungalows were handed over to Cheshire Ireland in March this year.  The HSE has informed the Department that the persons to whom the new bungalows are to be allocated have been identified through an assessment process undertaken by the executive and Cheshire Ireland.  Four people have moved into their new homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_855">As part of the multiannual investment programme under the national disability strategy, the Government provided the Health Service Executive with an additional €75 million in both 2006 and 2007.  This funding included moneys to provide new and enhanced services for people with disabilities.  A further €50 million investment was announced in budget 2008.  This funding includes funds for the provision of additional residential places for people with a disability, which would include the residential places in the new Cheshire Ireland bungalows in County Wicklow.  The HSE has informed the Department that this funding for additional services for people with a disability is under review in the context of the executive's overall service levels and funding position this year.</p>

            <from>Deputy Noel J. Coonan</from>
            <p eId="para_862">I welcome my constituency colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Hoctor.  While I am pleased she is taking this Adjournment debate, I am disappointed the relevant Minister is not addressing this serious issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_863">As the Minister of State is aware, Erin Foods in our constituency finally closed this month with a loss of the remaining 96 jobs.  This time last year, the plant employed more than 130 people.  From its formation in 1962 until the 1970s and 1980s, the company employed up to 300 people.  Erin Foods was established as a subsidiary of the Irish Sugar Company and is the final link with the Irish sugar producing era.  The Minister of State's party colleague from Nenagh had the privilege of closing the sugar factory in Thurles.</p>
            <p eId="para_864">I am anxious to learn what hope the Government can give to the people of Thurles, bearing in mind that the IDA has let down north Tipperary which has not secured foreign direct investment for 24 years.  Perhaps there is significance in the fact that the Minister of State's party has been in control of North Tipperary County Council for the past 24 years.  Thurles has not been given due regard from the other authorities, although I compliment Shannon Development on opening a technology park.  Under a master plan, another park will be developed in the medium to long term at Archerstown outside Thurles.  What hope can the Minister of State offer the workers of Thurles for retraining?  What hope can she offer them for attracting employment back into Thurles?  The Government's national spatial strategy has been a disaster for Tipperary.  There is neither a hub nor a gateway, and Thurles is not included in it.  This is what has happened.</p>
            <p eId="para_865">In order to create employment, we need to tackle the issue of competitiveness and costs.  These problems are being exacerbated by the lack of proper finance for local government, which then has to introduce stealth taxes.  These taxes impact on ordinary people who want to set up business, as they must pay substantial charges to the county council before they even turn a sod.  Thurles is crying for an initiative from this Government.  I am looking forward to the Minister of State's response on initiatives in the pipeline that will attract industry and employment to Thurles.  The last major manufacturing industry closed a few days ago, which is a tragedy for the area.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MarieHoctorFF" eId="spk_471" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children">
            <from>Deputy Máire Hoctor</from>
            <p eId="para_866">I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  I am also familiar with the concerns of the people of Thurles about the closure of the factory, and I will give the response of behalf of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_867">Following notification of the redundancies by the company in question, representatives of FÁS visited the company with a view to carrying out a needs analysis while the staff were still in employment.  Unfortunately, this analysis did not get under way before the agency learned last week that the workers had been made redundant on 16 May.  In its efforts to offer the most prompt and efficient service possible, the agency contacted all of the company's workers who had registered their interest with FÁS and invited them to an open information session last Friday.  Comprehensive information was provided about FÁS services to approximately 40 staff who attended.  FÁS will examine fully the information gathered at that information session and it is envisaged that this exercise will be completed by 6 June 2008.  The Department of Social and Family Affairs also attended this meeting to answer questions about its own services.</p>
            <p eId="para_868">The State development agencies are adopting a co-ordinated approach in response to these job losses.  In addition to FÁS, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and the county development board will be lending their assistance.  This multi-agency approach is directed at assisting all the employees affected and seeks to enhance the future employment prospects of the workforce.  The agencies will also support any individual who wishes to start his or her own business.</p>
            <p eId="para_869">The IDA strategy for Thurles and north Tipperary involves developing the knowledge economy by winning new foreign direct investment in innovation driven, high skills sectors.  The agency is also working with its existing company base to expand its presence in Ireland, with the addition of new functions of scale and by deepening their strategic functions.  Another of the agency's strategies is to influence the provision of property solutions and supporting infrastructure to meet the requirements of inward investors.</p>
            <p eId="para_870">The agency recognises the need to achieve high value employment in Thurles and is committed to marketing the area as part of its national goal of achieving balanced regional development.  The transition to a knowledge-based economy in north Tipperary can be achieved by winning new overseas investment in innovation driven, high value, high skill sectors.  However, the final decision on where to locate a particular project rests ultimately with the promoter.</p>
            <p eId="para_871">IDA Ireland has four supported companies in north Tipperary which employ nearly 600 people.  A small UK company acquired the burn garment business from BSN Medical in Thurles.  The company subsequently leased incubation space at the Tipperary technology park and employs eight people.  The agency also works closely with Shannon Development in the development, promotion and marketing of tailored property solutions to potential investors.  This includes the development of the Tipperary technology park in Thurles to which I have already referred.  Shannon Development has completed the first stage development of the technology park and it is now fully occupied. The agency has lodged a planning application for a second 20,000 sq. ft. building.</p>
            <p eId="para_872">IDA Ireland is a partner in the Thurles Marketing Group, which was established with a view to developing a pilot marketing initiative in north Tipperary as part of the implementation of the county economic and cultural strategy for 2002-12.  The focus of the marketing initiative is to promote Thurles as a location for business investment.  The Tipperary North County Enterprise Board also supports the work of the group and, since its inception in 2003, the board has made available a financial contribution of €27,500.</p>
            <p eId="para_873">A significant number of Enterprise Ireland client companies in the county are actively developing their businesses.  There were 60 agency-assisted clients in north Tipperary employing over 3,200 people in 2007.  The agency approved funding of over €7.9 million in 2007 to its client companies in north Tipperary.  In 2007, Tipperary North County Enterprise Board paid out over €250,000 in grant assistance to 20 clients in the north Tipperary area and assisted in the creation of 25 net jobs.  The board grant-aided the creation of ten full-time jobs in Thurles in 2007 in a new call centre set up in the Thurles technology park.  A number of small micro-businesses have also received financial support in the Thurles area over the past 12 months that will yield a further 12 jobs when fully operational.</p>
            <p eId="para_874">The strategies being pursued by the State development agencies, in partnership with other key players, together with the Government's ongoing commitment to regional development, will drive investment and job creation for both Thurles and north Tipperary.</p>

            <from>Deputy Joe Costello</from>
            <p eId="para_875">The failure of Ireland to provide an inspection regime for military aircraft using Irish airspace has led to our being found wanting in the eyes of the international community.  In its annual report published this week, Amnesty International has criticised Ireland for its failure to provide an inspection regime.  It states that specific aircraft, known to have been used by the CIA for extraordinary rendition, have transited Ireland, primarily through Shannon Airport.  It also states that aircraft en route or returning from rendition missions have transited through the airport.  These aircraft have apparently breached Irish and international law since they sought and obtained automatic clearance under rules governing civilian aircraft, even though they were performing US state functions and should have presented themselves as state aircraft.</p>
            <p eId="para_876">This serious allegation by Amnesty International claims that Ireland has been involved in a breach of international law, as it claims that aircraft have transited through Irish airspace in an illegal fashion.  It follows two Council of Europe reports, a European Parliament report and a report by the Irish Human Rights Commission, which all express grave concern about the use of Irish airspace by CIA aircraft in its transport of prisoners to Guantanamo Bay and other centres of detention and torture in the practice of extraordinary rendition.</p>
            <p eId="para_877">It is time for the Government to reconsider its policy of non-inspection of such aircraft, a policy which claims as its basis that no other European country has such an inspection regime.  It is not good enough to hide behind that.  We are a neutral country and we should lead the way on this, just as we are leading the way by hosting a highly successful international conference in Croke Park to rid the world of cluster bombs.</p>
            <p eId="para_878">In its comprehensive report, Amnesty International recommends that the Government should establish an Oireachtas committee to inquire into the allegations of extraordinary rendition through Irish airspace.  A similar recommendation was made by the Council of Europe in two reports over the past two years.  I fully agree with the Council of Europe and with Amnesty International.  The committee could invite submissions from other states, where similar allegations have been made.  It should review our own laws and procedures in granting overflight or landing clearances to foreign aircraft, both civilian and state.  It should make solid recommendations for reform, which when implemented would remove the current allegations and suspicions that besmirch Ireland's good standing with the international community in the field of human rights.</p>

            <p eId="para_879">The Deputy has raised a number of wider issues on extraordinary rendition which have been dealt with on a number of occasions on the floor and in committees of this House.  As recently as yesterday, the Taoiseach reiterated to the House our unequivocal opposition to the practice of extraordinary rendition.  The Taoiseach went on to state that none of the various investigations into allegations of extraordinary rendition, whether by the European Parliament or the Council of Europe, has revealed any evidence, or even a single concrete or credible allegation, that any person has been subject to extraordinary rendition through Ireland.  He made it clear that no other state has adopted the inspection measures of the type which some have recommended.</p>

            <p eId="para_884">I should make it clear that the Garda Síochána has no role in the inspection of military aircraft from any country, which in any case are subject to sovereign immunity.  However, the position is clear that in the case of all other aircraft registered to another State, including civil aircraft chartered by foreign Governments, whether used by foreign officials or otherwise, powers of search are available to the Garda Síochána.</p>
            <p eId="para_885">Statutory powers of entry and search are bestowed upon the Garda Síochána pursuant to the Air Navigation and Transport Act 1988 and the amending Act of 1998.  Other statutory powers of search and arrest bestowed upon the Garda Síochána include sections 4 and 6 of the Criminal Law Act 1997.  However, these provisions do not confer a power of entry for the purpose of random or routine checking.  Garda powers of search can be deployed only where there are reasonable grounds for their use, capable of withstanding scrutiny in a court of law.  In much the same way that gardaí need reasonable suspicion supported by hard evidence to conduct a search of a private dwelling, so too must gardaí have similar standards of suspicion before inspecting an aircraft.  The mere assertion of wrongdoing by a member of the public is clearly insufficient in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_886">To date, where complaints of alleged unlawful activity concerning the use of Irish airports have been made to the Garda Síochána, Garda investigations have ensued and, where appropriate, files have been submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  In all these cases, no further action was found to be warranted, owing to a lack of any evidence of any unlawful activity.  One of the planes in question was subsequently found to have been transporting racehorses from Shannon to Dubai, another was privately owned and engaged on a corporate business flight.</p>
            <p eId="para_887">However, where complaints are received by the Garda Síochána about individual aircraft these are investigated.  Any person with credible information that Irish airports have been used for any alleged unlawful purpose should report the concerns to the Garda Síochána.  It remains the case that on the basis of such reporting or any other information, where the Garda Síochána reasonably suspects that an offence is being committed, the matter will be investigated, and any such investigation may include the inspection of an aircraft, subject to national and international law.</p>
            <p eId="para_888">On the wider question of the role of the Garda Síochána in the protection of human rights, I wish to highlight the centrality of human rights compliance to policing in Ireland.  Section 7 of the Garda Síochána Act sets out the functions of the Garda Síochána, which include providing policing and security services with the objective of protection of life and property and of vindicating the human rights of each individual.  Human rights training forms an integral part of the training at the Garda college, Templemore.  New members of the Garda Síochána now make a declaration of the need to have regard for human rights in carrying out policing duties.  Human rights training also forms part of the training of the Garda divisions for serving members of the Garda Síochána.</p>
            <p eId="para_889">I draw the attention of the House to the commitments contained in the programme for Government in this regard.  The programme includes commitments to place a renewed emphasis within the Garda Síochána on upholding the human rights standard within our society, and to ensure that all relevant legal instruments are used so that the practice of extraordinary rendition does not occur in this State in any form.  As the Minister informed the House earlier this week, he has been in communication with the Garda Commissioner about the fulfilment of these commitments,  particularly in the ongoing development of training programmes within the Garda Síochána.  The Government will continue to ensure that its commitments in this regard are fully honoured.</p>

        <b>Deputy Róisín Shortall</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</b>
         the percentage increase in electricity use in winter 2007; his views on ESRI warnings in winter 2007 that electricity capacity was at a stage where forced shutdowns of aging plants during winter peak demand could result in shortages; if he is confident that there will be sufficient capacity in winter 2008; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Eamon Ryan)</from>
            <p eId="para_891">I am advised by Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) that the point of peak demand for 2007 occurred on 18 December last, with the generation of 5,077 megawatts of electricity. The demand was met satisfactorily.  This compares with a 2006 winter peak demand of 5,035 megawatts and represents a rise of less than 1%.</p>
            <p eId="para_892">As with any power generation system, it is not possible to give definitive guarantees that generation adequacy will always be maintained.  By their nature, high level forced outages on the system cannot be predicted.  The work of the ESRI in the area of security of electricity supply underlines the necessity to ensure adequate capacity margins on the generation system.</p>
            <p eId="para_893">My Department liaises closely with the CER, which has key functions with regard to security of electricity supply, and with EirGrid as the independent Transmission System Operator.  Reporting to the CER, EirGrid has responsibility for managing generation adequacy and monitoring generation capacity.  EirGrid publishes a Winter Outlook Report annually around the end of August.  This year's report will again provide a rigorous analysis of the capacity of Ireland's electricity generation to meet expected demand in the coming winter.</p>
            <p eId="para_894">Based on the ongoing EirGrid analysis, including the most recent Generation Adequacy Report, the overall assessment is that capacity will be sufficient in the short term.</p>
            <p eId="para_895">However, security and reliability of electricity supply over the coming years must be of paramount concern.  It is critical for the economy, for business and for all consumers.  Improved availability of existing generating capacity and delivery of new generating and interconnection capacity are therefore key priorities over the period to 2014.  The provision of flexible plant in light of the continued strong growth in wind energy on the system is also critical in this context.  My Department will work closely on these priorities with all stakeholders over the coming years.</p>

            <p eId="para_899">As Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources I have overall responsibility for electronic communications policy, but I have no responsibility in relation to the actions of persons conducting bullying or intimidation activities over electronic communications networks.</p>
            <p eId="para_900">Bullying in any form can be very real issue and can be distressing for those on the receiving end, particularly children.  However, parents must be aware of their children's behaviour and their supervisory role is key to safeguarding their children from the perils of abuse of communications technology.</p>
            <p eId="para_901">Malevolent Internet activity falls within the remit of my colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and I would draw the Deputy's attention to the Office of Internet Safety recently established by that Minister.</p>
            <p eId="para_902">I would also refer the Deputy to www.webwise.ie, a website developed by the National Centre for Technology in Education (NCTE), an agency under the Department of Education and Science.  This website provides information and resources to help ensure that children's on-line activity is positive and safe.  My colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, also launched a new education programme earlier this year on Internet safety, which focuses on promoting safer and more effective use of social networking websites by children in Ireland.  The programme is aimed at parents and teachers as well as children.</p>
            <p eId="para_903">My Department, in conjunction with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the authorities in Northern Ireland and private sector companies, recently launched a public awareness campaign called "Make IT Secure" to raise awareness of issues surrounding Internet access and security.</p>
            <p eId="para_904">Finally, as the Deputy may be aware, legislation is already in place to prosecute the issue of nuisance and criminal phone calls, and the sending of pornographic images by mobile phones.</p>
            <p eId="para_905">It is an offence under Section 13 of the Post Office (Amendment) Act, 1951, as amended, to send by phone any message or other matter, which is grossly offensive, or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character.</p>
            <p eId="para_906">Also it is an offence under Section 10 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, 1997 to harass a person by use of a telephone.</p>
            <p eId="para_907">The investigation of these offences is a matter for the Garda Síochána.</p>

            <p eId="para_911">Currently, over 90% of Ireland's energy needs are provided for by imports. In order to ensure the security and sustainability of our energy supply, we must reduce our reliance on imports and significantly enhance the diversity of our energy mix. While Ireland does not currently maintain a strategic gas reserve, commercial reserves of natural gas are held by licensed natural gas shippers and suppliers, including Bord Gáis Éireann (BGÉ).  At current levels, BGÉ's Kinsale reserves can supply 50% of non-daily metered customer requirements, that is, small business and domestic, for up to 50 days.</p>
            <p eId="para_912">The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) has the statutory function of licensing natural gas storage facilities.  In carrying out its functions, the Commission must have regard to the need to ensure that there is sufficient capacity in the natural gas system to enable reasonable expectations of demand to be met and to secure the continuity, security and quality of supplies of natural gas.</p>
            <p eId="para_913">The CER has granted a gas storage licence to Marathon Oil Ireland Ltd to make the full capability of its depleted Kinsale facility, which has a capacity of 7 billion cubic feet (bcf), available to third parties.  Another development is the proposal by Shannon LNG to construct a liquefied natural gas (LNG) import terminal near Tarbert on the Shannon Estuary.  The project could potentially provide up to 40% of Ireland's gas requirements.  The connection of the Corrib gas field would also reduce our dependence on imports for the period it is in operation.</p>
            <p eId="para_914">In 2007, a study was jointly commissioned by my Department and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment for Northern Ireland, to assess the medium to long-term position with regard to security of natural gas supply on an all-island basis. The study also considered the scope for a common approach on natural gas storage and LNG.  A summary of the study has been published on the websites of both Departments. The results of the study, which has recently been completed, are currently being assessed by both Departments.</p>

            <p eId="para_916">The UK has a schedule to switch off analogue TV in different regions from 2008 to 2012 in favour of Digital Terrestrial Television (DTT).  Analogue TV services in Wales, for instance, are expected to switch off in 2009 and this will impact on viewers in Wexford, Waterford, Wicklow and Dublin who receive UK TV channels via overspill from the UK.</p>
            <p eId="para_917">Viewers on cable and satellite will not be affected by these changes and will continue to receive the UK terrestrial channels.</p>
            <p eId="para_918">In Ireland, the development of DTT is well under way.  The Broadcasting (Amendment) Act 2007, provides for RTÉ to develop a public broadcasting DTT service with space to carry RTÉ, TG4 and TV3.  In addition, the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland is currently running a competition to provide commercial DTT services.  In these circumstances it is expected that Irish digital terrestrial services, providing a significant range of television services, will be available in the south east of the country in 2009, including to those persons who will be impacted by the switch off of analogue services in the UK.</p>
            <p eId="para_919">Digital terrestrial services will offer more to viewers in terms of digital quality pictures and sound, more services such as programme guide information and more channel content.</p>

            <p eId="para_922">I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 23 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_923">The rollout of a national smart meter programme is progressing in line with the commitment in the Government's Energy Policy Framework and in the Programme for Government.  The Smart Meter programme is a central component of our strategy to significantly enhance management of demand for electricity and to achieve greater energy efficiency through the use of cutting-edge technology.</p>
            <p eId="para_924">The delivery of smart metering requires a collective response.  This is a technically complex and ambitious initiative. The Steering Group overseeing programme implementation is chaired by the Commission for Energy Regulation and includes representation from Sustainable Energy Ireland, ESB Networks, ESB Customer Supply and independent suppliers as well as my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_925">There are also four working groups, reporting directly to the Steering Group, which are mandated to progress the complex technical aspects of smart metering including Tariffs, Billing/Data Services, Networks and Customer Behaviour.</p>
            <p eId="para_926">I can confirm that the installation of meters for the pilot phase will get underway by this summer.  ESB Networks is currently engaged in the final stages of a tender process to select smart meters for testing in this pilot phase.</p>
            <p eId="para_927">In parallel, work is well advanced on the design of the customer behaviour and tariff aspects of the pilot phase, led by Sustainable Energy Ireland and ESB Customer Supply respectively.</p>
            <p eId="para_928">In addition, good progress has also been made on the preparation of an interim data solution to be used during the pilot to deal with the much expanded quantity of data which will be generated by the interval reading functionality of smart metering.</p>
            <p eId="para_929">The combined results of these work streams will define the number of installations necessary to achieve the objectives of the pilot phase. It is expected that the pilot phase will last for a year. The objective remains to complete the national smart meter programme in five years, thereby providing a cost effective electricity metering system which will deliver tangible benefits to all consumers of electricity.</p>

            <p eId="para_931">The Third Postal Directive, EC/2008/6, was published in the Official Journal of the European Union earlier this year and was reviewed by officials in my Department with a view to establishing the key issues arising from it for Ireland. Whilst the Directive sets the date for the final liberalisation of the postal sector and stipulates that there should be no changes to the Universal Service Obligation, certain other key decisions with regard to the liberalisation of the sector are being left to individual Member States.</p>
            <p eId="para_932">In this regard, my Department launched an online public consultation process on 29th April, inviting the public to submit its views on the key issues and the key decisions to be made arising from the Directive.</p>
            <p eId="para_933">Of importance for Ireland is how to facilitate competition and the provision of high-quality, competitively-priced postal services whilst ensuring the protection of universal service in a liberalised market so that all postal consumers will have access to a basic, high quality suite of services.</p>
            <p eId="para_934">The consultation invites submissions from interested parties on key issues such as financing the Universal Service Obligation in a liberalised market, the regulatory regime to be put in place with respect to price and quality of service, issues relating to access to An Post's network and matters relating to the promotion of competition. The deadline for receipt of submissions is 9th July.</p>
            <p eId="para_935">The results of this process will assist my thinking with respect to the transposition of the Directive into Irish law, including any possible consolidation of existing postal legislation, which is currently under consideration.  The deadline for transposition of the Directive is 31 December 2010.</p>

            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Eamon Ryan)</from>
            <p eId="para_942">The Broadcasting Bill 2008 proposes a number of legislative initiatives to support the development of the independent production sector, including TV, film and radio in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_943">Section 25 sets the new single content regulator, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI), the objective of stimulating the provision of high quality, diverse and innovative programming by independent producers.  Section 112 requires RTÉ and TG4 to prepare a Code of Fair Trading Practice outlining how they will go about commissioning programmes from the independent production sector.  These codes will be subject to review by the BAI and by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, and must address RTÉ and TG4's approach to multi-annual commissioning, the acquisition of rights and the timing of contractual negotiations.</p>
            <p eId="para_944">Section 116 of the Bill increases the minimum level of expenditure required of RTÉ in respect of independent production to €40 million annually, and for the first time sets a minimum level for independent radio production of €0.5 million per annum for an initial period of five years.</p>
            <p eId="para_945">These initiatives along with the continuance of the Sound and Vision Scheme under Part 10 of the Bill will serve to facilitate the development of the independent production sector in Ireland, adding to the diversity of voices and creative ideas that populate the Irish airwaves.  I further understand that under the Sound and Vision Scheme some €4.3m has been awarded to radio projects to date.</p>
            <p eId="para_946">As I stated at second stage in the Seanad, I am anxious to garner the views of Senators and Deputies as to the appropriate statutory interventions in respect of developing the independent production sector in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_947">I recognise that there is a balance to be struck reconciling the legitimate interests of public service broadcasters and those of the independent production sector.  The burden on the licence fee payer and on the generality of taxpayers must also be taken into account.  Overall, I consider that the existing and proposed new provisions demonstrate a strong commitment by Government to the independent production sector.</p>

            <p eId="para_954">I propose to take Questions Nos. 22 and 28 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_955">I would refer the Deputy to my Statement of 13th March on the future of Ireland's electricity sector.  In that Statement I affirmed the Government's decision in the Energy Policy White Paper and the Programme for Government to transfer the ownership of the electricity transmission assets from ESB to EirGrid.  It is also fundamental Government policy that we retain the electricity and gas networks as strategic national assets in state ownership which will never be privatised.</p>
            <p eId="para_956">The unbundling of the transmission assets involves the resolution of complex technical, financial and operational issues as well as legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_957">In the context, not least, of wide-ranging challenging priorities for ESB and EirGrid, I have proposed  that we commission an independent analysis of the transmission transfer, including costs, benefits and regulatory impact assessment, set in the context also of EU developments and the all island single electricity market.</p>
            <p eId="para_958">Statements by my predecessor and myself have consistently underlined the need for transparent and inclusive engagement with all relevant stakeholders in the process of implementing Government policy in relation to the electricity transmission assets.</p>
            <p eId="para_959">Input to the process of independent analysis will accordingly be invited from the direct key stakeholders.  These are the management and unions of ESB and EirGrid, the ESB Employee Share Ownership Trust, as well as the Commission for Energy Regulation and the Department of Finance.</p>
            <p eId="para_960">As I also announced in my statement, I intend to appoint a senior independent figure to chair this process including the commissioning of independent consultants to carry out the technical and economic analysis.  I am considering potential candidates for this role at present.</p>
            <p eId="para_961">All the direct stakeholders have pivotal roles to play in the process of engagement and analysis and in achieving outcomes that are good for EirGrid and ESB, which are satisfactory for all parties concerned, and which are in the best interests of the economy and consumers.  I look forward to getting this collective process under way following my appointment of the senior independent chair.</p>
            <p eId="para_962">Government policy is clear in relation to ensuring the strategic future of both EirGrid and ESB as strong viable Semi State bodies with vital roles to play in delivering our national targets for emissions reduction, renewable energy and energy efficiency as well as security of supply and energy competitiveness.</p>
            <p eId="para_963">I recently welcomed ESB's announcement of its new Strategic Framework to 2020, which will see an unprecedented capital investment programme by the company at home and abroad in support of our goals for renewable energy, energy efficiency, emissions reduction and energy security.</p>
            <p eId="para_964">I look forward equally to EirGrid's forthcoming Transmission Development Strategy 2025.  This will set out an ambitious national plan for critical investment in the transmission system over the next two decades in support of economic, social and regional development and the integration of renewable energy generation.</p>

            <p eId="para_985">The sources of Ireland's natural gas supply are indigenous production combined with imports from the UK to Ireland via sub-sea gas interconnection to the Moffat entry point located onshore in Scotland.  The source of imported supply has largely been the North Sea although this situation is changing as the UK has moved to become a net gas importer.  UK gas imports come from a range of sources and by a variety of routes from Continental Europe and from Norway.</p>
            <p eId="para_986">With the decline of the Kinsale gas field and, pending the full development of the Corrib field, we now import over 90% of our natural gas from the UK.  The connection of the Corrib gas field, with its estimated capability to supply some 60% of our annual natural gas requirements over the first 3-4 years of production, will also significantly reduce our dependence on imports during that period.</p>
            <p eId="para_987">The prospect of a liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal at Shannon is a potentially positive step in securing diversified gas supplies for Ireland. The recently finalised study on a common approach to natural gas storage and liquefied natural gas on an all-island basis, which was commissioned by the two Departments North and South, is currently being assessed.</p>
            <p eId="para_988">In the context of new record peaks this year in international gas prices, the prospect of price increases later this year has been signalled by Bord Gáis and the Commission for Energy Regulation. High gas prices underline the imperative of achieving a more diverse and sustainable fuel mix together with enhanced energy efficiency.</p>

          <speech by="#EamonRyanGP" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Energy_and_Natural_Resources" eId="spk_497">
            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Eamon Ryan)</from>
            <p eId="para_998">I propose to take Questions Nos. 33, 49, 55, 199 and 200 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_999">The price of oil, diesel or petrol, which is set on international markets, is outside our direct control.  The Irish oil industry is fully privatised, liberalised and deregulated.  There is free entry into the market.  Prices at the pump reflect global market price, transportation costs, Euro/Dollar fluctuations and other operating costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1000">The Competition Authority is a statutory independent body with a specific role in the enforcement of competition law.  The National Consumer Agency has specific responsibilities for protecting the rights of consumers.  Their function is to ensure that competition works optimally for the benefit of consumers throughout the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_1001">Ireland's high dependence on imported oil makes us price takers, sensitive to the volatility of the markets and reflecting a range of market factors.  Traditionally, diesel has been less expensive than petrol in Ireland at the forecourts.  This was due to the fact that international prices for both products were previously in the same range, and excise duty was (and still is) lower on diesel.  The excise differential in favour of diesel is 7.46 cents.</p>
            <p eId="para_1002">Currently, there are a number of factors that account for the higher price of diesel relative to petrol.  These include an increased demand for diesel in Europe as well as China and other developing economies.  This has led to the European demand for diesel exceeding the supply from European refineries.  Diesel is now being sourced from farther afield, particularly from Russia.</p>
            <p eId="para_1003">In addition, the US oil industry has made a strategic choice to produce more petrol relative to diesel, believing that there would be a high demand for petrol but in fact, consumer demand for petrol was less than anticipated this winter, which has resulted in surplus stocks of petrol in the US.  High Stocks are likely to have curbed flows of exports of petrol from Europe to the US, leaving high stocks of petrol in North West Europe.  A combination of these market factors has contributed to the rise in diesel prices relative to petrol.</p>
            <p eId="para_1004">The increase in the price of diesel is affecting all of Europe.  EU price figure comparisons published on 19th May 2008, show that the average price of diesel in Ireland in April was €1.248 per litre.  This price ranks as the eighth cheapest price out of the 27 EU Member States reported by the EU on 19th May.  The average price of diesel in the UK in the same report was €1.561 per litre and the average EU price for diesel was €1.40 per litre. These comparisons demonstrate that Ireland is by no means the worst affected country in Europe in relation to the price of diesel.</p>
            <p eId="para_1005">It is also the case that the increase in the price of oil generally, for both petrol and diesel, would be even higher for the consumer if the effect had not been moderated to date by the sharp depreciation of the dollar against the Euro.  This is particularly clear when recent price increases for a barrel of oil are compared with relative increases in diesel and petrol prices.</p>
            <p eId="para_1006">The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) is the independent body responsible for overseeing the liberalisation of Ireland's electricity and gas sectors.  The CER has no role in regard to the oil industry, which is already fully deregulated.</p>
            <p eId="para_1007">Government policy on prices is concentrated on the promotion of competition, consumer choice and awareness.  The Deputies will be aware that petrol stations are required to display their prices in a clear manner, so that consumers can make an informed choice when purchasing fuel.  Consumer protection is a matter for the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and consumers can report any infringements of the law to the National Consumer Agency.</p>
            <p eId="para_1008">The upward global trend in oil prices reinforces the imperative for Ireland to reduce its oil dependency and to use energy wisely and efficiently.  The actions we are taking to accelerate delivery of our targets for renewable energy and energy efficiency, are essential to ensure a sustainable energy future for the economy and for consumers.</p>

            <p eId="para_1010">I propose to issue a draft policy paper shortly on Next Generation Broadband. The paper will set out the framework for Government policy and related proposed actions in this area. I will be inviting comments on the draft paper through an online consultation process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1011">Whilst I cannot indicate the detail of the paper at this juncture, I can say that it is my ambition for Ireland to have a Next Generation Broadband infrastructure that will underpin a transformation to a knowledge economy based on leading edge development and application of Information Communications Technology (ICT).  It is also my firm view that, in the main, it is the private sector that should build and finance Next Generation Broadband networks.</p>
            <p eId="para_1012">The role of Government is to ensure that the legislation and regulatory regime is such as to promote competition and investment by the private sector in Next Generation Broadband.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Seán Power)</from>
            <p eId="para_1021">Ireland's offshore remains a relatively under-explored area with a history of poor prospectivity compared to other locations such as the North Sea.  In order to change such negative perceptions, the Government has sponsored major resource assessments during 2005–2006, which indicate a yet to find reserve potential of between 8 and 10 billion barrels of oil equivalent.</p>
            <p eId="para_1022">This is the total combined quantity of potentially recoverable oil and/or gas (expressed as barrels of oil equivalent) indicated by these assessments for the Porcupine, Rockall, Slyne, Erris and Donegal basins, off the west coast of Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1023">The figures are the output of regional geological studies into the petroleum systems which govern the presence or absence of oil and gas, and are based on the best available data and analytical methods.  While the figures are indicative of the area's likely prospectivity, they relate to ‘potential' and not to ‘proven' reserves.  The only way of determining actual reserves is to drill wells on prospects.</p>
            <p eId="para_1024">While this has assisted in encouraging new exploration, further work is needed to address the relative scarcity of geological and geophysical data over large areas of the Atlantic Basins.  Additional acquisition of such data will reduce the perception that Ireland's offshore is a high risk exploration location.</p>
            <p eId="para_1025">Although potential has been demonstrated for both oil and gas offshore Ireland, it would require exploration drilling activity to be substantially increased to assess the reserves and the possibility of their commercial recovery.</p>
            <p eId="para_1026">There is evidence of a continuing upswing in the level of interest in exploration offshore Ireland, both in terms of the increase in the number of exploration authorisations awarded and in the number of major international companies applying for licences or buying into existing licences.  Drilling activity, actual and scheduled, though fairly modest by international standards, is currently at its highest level in decades and is set to continue in the coming years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1027">Exploration investment has been encouraged through active promotion of the opportunities by my Department and the holding of regular licensing rounds.  The next round will take place in the first half of 2009 in the Rockall Basin.</p>
            <p eId="para_1028">The tax regime applicable to oil production is a key factor in attracting internationally mobile exploration investment to Ireland.  A comprehensive review of Ireland's licensing terms was carried out last year following which both the fiscal and non-fiscal licensing terms were revised.  The revised terms will apply to all licences issued since 1 January 2007.  The revised fiscal terms provide for a higher tax rate on more profitable fields, where the maximum tax rate is now 40% compared to 25% previously.  The overall objective is to make Ireland's offshore sufficiently attractive to secure ongoing exploration investment while ensuring a fair return to the State.</p>

            <p eId="para_1030">Broadband services are provided in the Irish market by the private sector, with appropriate regulation from the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).</p>
            <p eId="para_1031">The role of Government is to ensure that the appropriate regulatory regime is in place and to also invest directly in the case of market failure such as the proposed National Broadband Scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1032">The latest figures from the OECD show that Ireland experienced one of the fastest rates of growth in broadband take-up in the OECD and had a penetration rate per capita of over20%.  ComReg has found that 44% of Irish households had a broadband connection at the end of September 2007.  I expect that ComReg data for quarter 1 of 2008 will confirm that we are now well over the 50% household penetration mark.</p>
            <p eId="para_1033">There is also evidence on the supply side of greater bandwidth being made available at lower prices such as the recent offerings by two companies of 12Mbps and 15Mbps at €40 and €45 per month respectively.</p>

This is happening where there is strong competition and incentives to innovate.

            <p eId="para_1041">A proposal, based on the recommendations of the National Postcode Project Board (NPPB) concerning the introduction of postcodes, was made to Government in May 2007.  The work of the NPPB focused on quantifying the costs and benefits of postcodes to the postal sector including postal operators and customers and did not explicitly address non-postal costs and benefits.  Two extensive consultations with stakeholders both within and outside the postal sector were carried out as part of the process.

            <p eId="para_1042">The consultants assisting the NPPB estimated that the upfront cost of establishing, implementing and promoting the postcode would be in the region of €15m with any ongoing expenses to be met from revenues generated by the postcode manager.</p>
            <p eId="para_1043">Government decided last year that prior to the introduction of postcodes, further analysis to quantify the wider economic implications should be carried out.

This work will be completed shortly.  On receipt of the analysis I will assess the position with a view to a further submission to Government.</p>

            <p eId="para_1048">The provision of broadband services is, in the first instance, a matter for the private sector.  Broadband service providers operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated, where appropriate, by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.</p>
            <p eId="para_1049">The role of the Government is to formulate regulatory and infrastructure policies to facilitate the provision of high quality telecommunications services by competing private sector service providers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1050">The widespread provision of broadband services continues to be a priority for the Government.  In that regard my Department has undertaken initiatives to address the gaps in broadband coverage.  These included providing grant-aid under the Group Broadband Scheme (GBS) and ongoing investment in Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs).</p>
            <p eId="para_1051">Although broadband is now widely available in Ireland there are still some parts of the country where the private sector will be unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband services.  These areas are being addressed by the National Broadband Scheme (NBS), which will provide broadband services to areas that are currently unserved and will ensure that all reasonable requests for broadband are met.</p>
            <p eId="para_1052">The first phase of the NBS procurement process (Pre-Qualification Questionnaire (PQQ)) is now complete, and four candidates pre-qualified to enter the next phase of the procurement process.  Following the withdrawal of one of the candidates, the remaining three candidates have now commenced "Competitive Dialogue" with my Department and are developing their proposed solutions to meet my Department's requirements for the delivery of broadband to the unserved areas of the country.  It is anticipated that a preferred bidder will be selected in August 2008, with rollout to commence as soon as possible thereafter.</p>
            <p eId="para_1053">My Department has recently received notice of Judicial Review proceedings regarding certain elements of the NBS mapping process.  These proceedings are currently before the Commercial Court and due for hearing on 10 and 11 June 2008.  A speedy conclusion of the matter has been requested in order to advance the NBS as quickly as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_1054">Finally, I welcome the roll out of all electronic communication infrastructure by service providers, which increases competition in the market.  Increased competition gives rise to better quality services, increased choice and more competitive prices, all of which are good for the Irish consumer.</p>

            <p eId="para_1088">In the course of EirGrid's pre-planning public consultations on proposed routes for the North-South and Meath-Cavan transmission lines, concerns were expressed locally about the impacts of overhead transmission lines. Noting that these concerns are likely to be common to all transmission line projects, and in order to provide clarity on issues in relation to overhead versus underground transmission lines, I decided that the Department would commission an independent national study on this issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_1089">International consultants Ecofys were appointed to undertake the independent study on the comparative merits of overhead electricity transmission lines versus underground cables. The consultants were appointed on 8th April 2008 following a tender process launched on 29 February on the Government's eTenders website.</p>
            <p eId="para_1090">Ecofys, which is based in the Netherlands, with offices in twelve different countries worldwide, specialises in energy saving and renewable energy solutions.  Ecofys are also utilising the services of Golder Associates, a global group of consulting companies specialising in ground engineering and environmental services. Golder has provided environmental consultancy services for a range of electricity generation and transmission related projects both in Ireland and the UK.</p>
            <p eId="para_1091">The independent study is being undertaken by Ecofys as a national assessment as opposed to being project-specific. The study will offer professional advice on best international practice for the construction of transmission lines, thereby informing debate and decisions on national transmission development.</p>
            <p eId="para_1092">In tandem with the tender process, my Department placed advertisements in nine national newspapers requesting submissions from the public on the issue. Over 500 submissions were received by the closing date of 7 March.  The consultants have been furnished with these submissions and will consider points raised in their analysis of the merits or otherwise of underground and overground options. The consultants will also be available to meet with the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, to discuss the details of the report, once published.</p>
            <p eId="para_1093">The report is scheduled to be finalised by early June and will be published thereafter. The time frame for completion of the work is in line with the tender specification.</p>

            <p eId="para_1095">The decentralisation of the Central Fisheries Board (CFB) involves relocating the entire Headquarters complement to Carrick-on-Shannon.  In that regard, I can advise the Deputy that 41 staff have been recruited to posts relocating since the announcement of the decentralisation programme, the majority of which are temporary.</p>
            <p eId="para_1096">The other major element of the Decentralisation Programme relates to accommodation.  Accommodation and property issues are in this regard a matter for the Office of Public Works (OPW).  I understand that there were significant challenges in identifying a suitable accommodation solution for the board.  However, I am pleased to advise that a new property in Carrick-on-Shannon is currently being jointly assessed by my Department, the OPW and the CFB, and may provide a solution which meets with the approval of all concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_1097">In relation to the CFB's former and current premises, I can confirm to the Deputy that relocating the staff of the CFB from Glasnevin was due to inadequacies in those premises on health and safety grounds.

            <p eId="para_1109">The electricity generation and supply markets are both fully liberalised.  The future development of any wind-farm in the context of the liberalised market, including any future developments on the Arklow Banks, is a matter for the commercial judgement of the developers concerned.   I am fully supportive of the development of our offshore wind potential and I have announced the expansion of the Renewable Energy Feed In Tariff (REFIT) Scheme to encompass offshore wind developments.</p>
            <p eId="para_1110">Current data on grid connections published by EirGrid indicate there are approximately 80 wind-farms connected with a combined installed capacity exceeding 800 megawatts (MW). A further 40 or so projects with a combined capacity of 466 MW have contracted for connections.</p>
            <p eId="para_1111">A further 1300 MW of capacity will move from connection offers currently to contracted projects in the near future as part of the Gate 2 process.  A further 4300 MW of capacity represents projects which have yet to secure a signed connection agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_1112">Overall, the number of wind-farm projects now in the frame for connection demonstrates the steady progress towards achieving our renewable energy targets for 2010 and for 2020.</p>

            <p eId="para_1114">The investigation into the funding of public service broadcasting in Ireland, to which the Deputy refers, arose in the context of a formal complaint, made originally in 1999, alleging infringements of Articles 92–94 of the EC Treaty relating to, among other things, the payment of licence fee revenue and direct grants to RTÉ.</p>
            <p eId="para_1115">The Amsterdam Protocol to the European Treaty establishes the competence of Member States to provide for the funding of Public Service Broadcasting (PSB) in recognition of its direct relationship with the democratic, social and cultural needs of each society and with the need to preserve media pluralism. The Amsterdam Protocol permits such funding insofar as it is granted to broadcasting organisations for the fulfilment of their public service remit and insofar as such funding does not affect trading conditions and competition in the Community to an extent which would be contrary to the common interest.</p>
            <p eId="para_1116">Following a period of investigation, the EU Commission forwarded an Article 17 letter to the Irish Authorities on 3 March 2005 setting out its preliminary views in relation to the compatibility of the funding arrangements for RTÉ with the requirements of the EU Treaty.  Negotiations between the European Commission and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources led to the resolution of these issues in early 2008 culminating in a letter of commitment by the Irish Authorities to certain undertakings and an EU Commission announcement to close the investigation.  These commitments, including a commitment to determine the scope of the public service remits of RTÉ and Teilifís na Gaeilge by enumerating their respective objects and duties in broadcasting legislation, and to limit the use of public funding by RTÉ and Teilifís na Gaeilge to the achievement of such public service objects and duties, are being formally undertaken in the context of the Broadcasting Bill, 2008, which I introduced recently into the Oireachtas.</p>

            <p eId="para_1119">I believe that the public would be better informed about the energy security and climate change challenges we face by an informed debate on what alternative fuel supplies we can turn to as we withdraw from our use of fossil fuels. I believe that a debate on nuclear power fits within such a context. It could best take place within the remit of an Oireachtas committee given that the committees can work in a public manner that is on the record and where relevant expertise and research resources can be directed to the issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_1120">I believe that such a debate would confirm that nuclear power is not a suitable or desirable choice for Ireland and that such a conclusion would reaffirm public commitment to the alternative renewable and energy efficiency solutions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1121">While the use of nuclear fission for the generation of electricity in Ireland is statutorily prohibited under Section 18(6) of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999, this prohibition does not include the importation of electricity generated by nuclear energy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1122">Legal advice received by my Department states that such a prohibition would be in breach of Article 28 of the EC Treaty, which prohibits quantitative restrictions on imports and all measures having equivalent effect between Member States.</p>
            <p eId="para_1123">I am therefore advised that a prohibition on the importation of electricity generated with the use of nuclear energy would be highly unlikely to have a legal justification even if it were technically feasible.</p>
            <p eId="para_1124">I am further advised that it is not technically possible to guarantee that electricity imported over an interconnector is not generated from nuclear sources as it is not physically possible to prevent the flow of nuclear generated electricity onto the network. Nor is it possible to distinguish the flow of electricity across interconnectors by reference to the original source of supply or generation.</p>

            <p eId="para_1179">One of the key challenges facing the health service is the need to ensure that services are planned and provided in line with the clinical need of the patient.  A number of experimental initiatives have been put in place by the Health Service Executive with a view to providing care in community based rather than hospital based settings where clinically appropriate.  The Hospital in the Home Service is one such initiative, along with the introduction of Primary Care Teams, Community Intervention Teams, a Rapid Access Service for the Elderly and the GP Out of Hours service.</p>
            <p eId="para_1180">The Hospital in the Home Service was delivered by a private service provider on the basis of a service level agreement with the HSE and was for a period of one year. This agreement came to an end on the 16th March and was extended by agreement until 11th May 2008.  During the year, the service treated in the region of 2,000 patients at an annual cost of €6.83m.</p>
            <p eId="para_1181">A review of the service was carried out between January and March of this year under an independent Chairperson.  The review made a number of recommendations.  The main recommendation, which has been adopted by the HSE, is that the concept of the "Hospital in the Home" be retained and that the service should be repatriated within existing HSE post-acute care and community services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1182">The HSE is considering the manner in which it can best mainstream the service previously offered by the service provider into the Executive.  In this context the scope and capacity of the Community Intervention Teams in the Greater Dublin Area are being examined by the HSE with a view to absorbing the service.  The HSE has emphasised that no patient will be disadvantaged by this decision.</p>

            <p eId="para_1190">The 2006 Annual Report of the Alcohol Marketing Communications Monitoring Body (AMCMB), established to monitor compliance with the voluntary codes, was submitted to my Department in July 2007.  The Monitoring Body concluded that although there had been a number of breaches of the code throughout 2006, there has been overall compliance with Voluntary Codes. The Monitoring Body were generally satisfied that where breaches were identified immediate remedial action was taken to rectify the situation and prevent recurrence.  I expect to receive the 2007 Annual Report of the AMCMB in the coming weeks and I intend to have it published very shortly thereafter.</p>
            <p eId="para_1191">Following consideration of the 2006 Annual Report, officials from my Department commenced discussions with representatives of the Irish alcohol industry and representatives of the Irish advertising industry with a view to strengthening and expanding the codes on alcohol marketing and communications in order to provide significantly greater protection for children and young people.  These discussions resulted in a revised set of Codes on advertising and sponsorship being drafted.  Final drafting changes are currently being made to the revised Codes which are expected to be published before the end of June 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1192">The aim of the Codes on Advertising and Sponsorship is to limit the exposure of young people to alcohol advertising and marketing.  My Department is satisfied that the Codes have been successful in controlling the content of alcohol advertising as well as controlling the timing and placing of alcohol advertisements. However, research is needed to establish how effective the Codes have been in limiting the exposure of young people to alcohol advertising and marketing. My Department intends commissioning appropriate research within the next 12 months to test the effectiveness of the Codes in achieving this aim.  In monitoring the implementation of the revised Codes it is my Department's intention to facilitate further representation and involvement from the social partners in the process of monitoring compliance with the Codes through the AMCMB.</p>

            <p eId="para_1196">The article in question refers and applies solely to Member States of the European Union. While the article sets down a requirement of aid and assistance to a Member State which is the victim of armed aggression, it provides no mechanism for implementation of such aid and assistance. Moreover, it specifically states that this commitment "shall not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of certain Member States", a formulation originally proposed by Ireland to protect our position. It would, therefore, be for Ireland to take its own sovereign decision on whether and how to come to another Member State's assistance, taking into account our traditional policy of military neutrality.</p>
            <p eId="para_1197">The Lisbon Treaty also makes provision for permanent structured co-operation among those Member States "whose military capabilities fulfil higher criteria and which have made more binding commitments to one another in this area with a view to the most demanding missions." It would, of course, be a matter for each Member State to decide whether to participate in such permanent structured co-operation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1198">There have been no proposals to date in this area. Moreover, the possible future development of structured cooperation would not in any way change the requirement for all European Union peace-keeping or crisis management missions to be decided upon unanimously by EU Member States. Participation by the Defence Forces in any overseas mission will, of course, continue to require compliance with the ‘triple lock' of Government decision, Dáil approval and United Nations authorisation.

            <p eId="para_1199">I would like to emphasise finally that the Bill for the referendum on the Lisbon Treaty specifically retains our Constitutional prohibition on participation in an EU common defence, should one ever be proposed.</p>

I should say, however, Department of Social and Family Affairs approval is required for each of these options if the person wishes to engage in employment of a rehabilitative nature.</p>

            <p eId="para_1208">I am aware of the significance of the recent job losses for Tallaght and every effort is being made to create new employment opportunities in the area.  At present, IDA Ireland is working with its existing client base to help them to further develop their businesses as well as providing world-class property solutions with supporting infrastructure. The development of the Grangecastle Business Park, combined with the development of the City West Business Park, will ensure that Tallaght and the surrounding area is an attractive location for investment. The Microsoft Corporation has selected Grangecastle for its new data centre and Wyeth Biopharma has announced that it is investing in the creation of dedicated Research and Development and process development facilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1209">Enterprise Ireland's activity in Tallaght is focussed on the creation of new jobs through supporting entrepreneurs in manufacturing and internationally traded services companies. Enterprise Ireland activity, in terms of job creation, is focused on the retention and creation of new jobs in existing companies, and the creation of new jobs by supporting entrepreneurs to set up High Potential Start-Up Companies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1210">EI supports the provision of incubation space for start up companies and works towards enhancing the innovation capability of Ireland at a national and regional level by supporting research in companies and third level institutions. The M50 Enterprise Platform Programme is underway in the Institute of Technology in Tallaght, in conjunction with Blanchardstown Institute of Technology and Dublin City University. This is a one-year rapid incubation programme designed for entrepreneurs who wish to start their own business. The agency works closely with the Tallaght Institute of Technology in encouraging the commercialisation of research and has approved financial support of over €2.6m to the Institute for the development and management of a Campus based Incubation Centre. The agency has also approved support of €1.2m for a Centre of Excellence at the Institute, the focus of which is Microsensors for Clinical Analysis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1211">The role of South Dublin County Enterprise Board is to provide both financial and non-financial support for micro-enterprise in the start-up and expansion phases, to promote and develop indigenous micro-enterprise potential and to stimulate economic activity and entrepreneurship.  The South Dublin County Enterprise Board remains central in assisting micro-enterprises to develop their growth potential and continues to be proactive in ensuring that available funds are targeted to maximize entrepreneurial development throughout 2008.  I can assure you that the Industrial Development agencies will continue to promote and market Tallaght in order to bring about further job creation in the area.</p>

Ireland's representation at meetings of the EDA is provided by the Department of Defence.

            <p eId="para_1214">At the request of the Department of Defence, EI has attended a number of meetings of the Research and Technology (R&amp;T) Points of Contact, the annual European Defence Agency R&amp;T Conference and the CAPTEC Expert meeting on Space Systems and technologies. Following the decision by Government to join the Joint Investment Programme (JIP) on Force Protection, EI has also attended a number of meetings of the JIP Management Committee. The purpose of EI's engagement was to ensure that there was no conflict between R&amp;T issues being addressed by the European Defence Agency, and those that were being addressed by the EU Commission meetings, which EI attend.  EI's advice and participation at EDA meetings was considered beneficial in identifying any potential overlap that may have arisen in the R&amp;T forum.</p>

            <p eId="para_1225">The school meals programme gives funding towards provision of food services for disadvantaged school children through two schemes.  The first is the long-standing statutory urban school meals scheme, which is operated by local authorities and part-financed by the Department.  The second is the school meals local projects scheme through which funding is provided by the Department to participating schools and voluntary community groups in both urban and rural areas, who are running specific school meals projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_1226">The Department of Education and Science has indicated that there are currently approximately 153,000 pupils enrolled in 873 DEIS schools.   Over 93,000 pupils from 700 DEIS schools are benefiting under the school meals local projects scheme.  This includes a variety of different types of school food projects, including DEIS schools who receive funding directly from the Department for either their full school population or for targeted pupils and also school food projects funded by the Department and operated by local and voluntary organisations for pupils from DEIS schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_1227">In addition, over 30,000 pupils in DEIS schools benefit under the urban school meals scheme.  Given the possibility that some pupils may benefit under both schemes, it is estimated that between 30,000-60,000 pupils in DEIS schools do not currently benefit from the school meals programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1228">The decision to operate a school food project or to apply for funding under the school meals local projects scheme rests with the school itself.  Funding under the scheme must be targeted at disadvantaged school children and is intended to assist schools or groups who are operating their own school food projects, with the food costs of the project only.  Responsibility for all aspects of the day-to-day operation of the scheme lies with the school.  Demand for funding under the school meals local projects scheme remains high and additional funding provided in 2008 will be used to include more DEIS schools in the scheme.</p>

This includes ensuring that applications are processed and that decisions on entitlement are issued as expeditiously as possible having regard to the eligibility conditions which apply.

These conditions vary from scheme to scheme and may involve, among other things, the need to establish the customer's social insurance record, verify medical incapacity for work, establish a customer's identity or their place of habitual residence and to assess means where appropriate.  In some cases there is an unavoidable time lag involved in making the necessary enquiries to enable decisions to be made.  Time can also elapse where the applicants do not supply all the necessary information in support of their claim. Increases in the number of claims can also impact on processing times. For example, in the case of family income supplement, improvements in the eligibility criteria and a heightened awareness campaign resulted in a significant rise in claims while the introduction of the half-rate carer's allowance scheme has impacted on claim processing in that area. The following tabular statement sets out on a scheme by scheme basis, in respect of the month of March, the average times taken to award new claims.</p>

            <p eId="para_1284">The Department has commenced claim initiation on the State Pension Contributory scheme whereby customers are proactively invited to claim pensions in advance of reaching pension age in order to ensure their entitlement to pension is decided by the due date.  Over the past year 59% of State Pension Non-Contributory claims were processed and decided within 8 weeks. The processes involved in deciding claims for the schemes are currently being reviewed with a view to reducing the time taken to decide claims.  In order to facilitate a good customer service people are advised to apply for pension at least three months before reaching pension age so that their entitlement can be determined as close as possible to the due date.</p>

It encourages and facilitates people on certain social welfare payments to improve their skills and qualifications and, therefore, their prospects of returning to the active work force.

            <p eId="para_1317">I propose to take Questions Nos. 93 and 94 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1318">The following table sets out the amounts estimated to have been spent on the National Drugs Strategy in the period since 2001.  In this context, it should be noted that expenditure under the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund (YPFSF) was managed by the Department of Education and Science up to 2002.  Responsibility for this funding transferred to my Department from 2003, which significantly increased the overall departmental spend on the drugs area in that year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1319">The drop in expenditure by my Department in 2004 arose from the mainstreaming of a number of community based drugs projects to other Departments and agencies that year.   The relevant funding to support the ongoing activities of the projects transferred to the other Departments and agencies in this context.</p>
            <p eId="para_1320">Expenditure by other Departments on the drugs area has been compiled since 2005.  The figures for 2005 and 2006 should be interpreted as indicative, however, as they relate only to services that are considered to be directly attributable to dealing with problem drug use.  They do not take account of mainstream services that are available generally to the public, but  which problem drug users can also avail of.</p>
            <p eId="para_1321">Finally, the Deputy should note that the allocation under the Drugs Initiative/Young Peoples Facilities &amp; Services Fund in my Department's Vote for this year is €64.332m, an increase of 25% on the outturn for last year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1322">Expenditure to date this year is approximately €26m.</p>

            <p eId="para_1361">Wood energy is already playing a significant role in meeting Ireland's energy requirements.  In 2006, solid biomass, primarily in the form of solid wood, accounted for 45% of renewable energy consumption in Ireland, mainly in the generation of heat in the domestic and wood processing sectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_1362">Projections by COFORD and Sustainable Energy Ireland indicate that there will be a potential annual supply of 2 million tonnes of wood biomass by 2020, based on a combination of energy wood from privately owned-forests, final harvesting residues from State owned forests, processing residues from the saw milling sector and recycled untreated wood.  Furthermore, Sustainable Energy Ireland estimates that by 2020, refined wood fuels (wood chips and pellets) produced in Ireland could be meeting up to 5% of Ireland's heating needs.</p>

            <p eId="para_1368">The demand for water in schools can be minimised through push type spray taps, low flushing toilets, urinal controls, fixing easily identifiable leaks etc. Guidance was recently issued to schools on the most appropriate measures to minimise excess consumption of water and to reduce wastage where it exists. In addition, water conservation issues will continue to be addressed by my Department as a matter of routine where new schools are being built or where major renovations are being carried out to existing schools under the schools modernisation programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1369">Primary school authorities may use their annual minor works grant to fund measures to minimise water consumption. The minor works grant has increased by nearly 50% over the past two years and some €27m issued to primary schools at the end of last year for that purpose. Individual primary schools received a grant in the sum of €5,500 plus €18.50 per pupil.  There is good potential for recovering or harvesting rainwater in schools to use for flushing toilets and where feasible these systems are being provided for in new school projects. Retro-fitting rainwater recovery into existing buildings is not possible without major intervention into the internal fabric and services of the building (dedicated water supply to every toilet in the building) and external drains (separating rain water and external drains and re-routing to a central collection point).</p>

            <p eId="para_1382">I propose to take Questions Nos. 100 to 104, inclusive, and 107 to 113, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1383">To achieve the maximum benefits from the resources available to my Department to combat educational disadvantage in schools, a High Level Group was established to secure the improved integration of the services delivered by programmes and agencies on behalf of my Department. The principal objective of the Working Group is to develop protocols to guide the programmes and services and to foster collaboration and cooperation both at national and local levels.</p>
            <p eId="para_1384">To secure this objective the Working Group aims to:</p>
            <p eId="para_1385">Ensure maximum benefit is derived from the substantial personnel resources deployed in these programmes</p>
            <p eId="para_1386">Assist with the development and implementation of clearly articulated operational guidelines of best practice for collaboration in service delivery among the services and agencies</p>
            <p eId="para_1387">Establish co-operation, information sharing and acknowledged roles of responsibility.</p>
            <p eId="para_1388">The Home School Community Liaison scheme is a major mainstream preventative strategy targeted at the families of pupils at risk of not reaching their potential in the educational system because of background characteristics which tend to affect adversely pupil attainment and school retention. HSCL focuses directly on the salient adults in children's educational lives, seeking indirect benefits for the children themselves and works to involve parents in their children's education which is a crucial component in convincing young people of the value of education.</p>
            <p eId="para_1389">HSCL coordinators are assigned on a full time or shared basis between schools and are deployed to do full-time home school community liaison duties. For the first time, posts are shared across the two sectors — primary &amp; post primary level, to facilitate local HSCL coordinators working with the families of disadvantaged children. A local committee structure at local level is established involving all relevant stakeholders and a National Coordination Team that comprises a National Co-ordinator and five Regional Coordinators support and manage the services of the HSCL scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1390">The School Completion Programme (SCP) is a preventative measure designed to combat issues of poor attendance and early school leaving. School attendance is a central objective of SCP with targeted interventions for children at risk of early school leaving through a variety of extra supports aimed at encouraging them to stay in school. The range of interventions is designed to support retention of young people in education through local strategies developed to ensure maximum participation levels in the education process. This entails targeting individual young people of school-going age, both in and out of school, and arranging supports to address inequalities in education access, participation and outcomes. It is based on the project model with an integrated approach involving primary and post primary schools, parents and relevant statutory, voluntary and community agencies. These supports cover both educational and non-educational interventions and are provided during and outside of school time. A local management committee, comprising of representatives of schools and other relevant agencies, manage each project.</p>
            <p eId="para_1391">School Completion projects are required to engage in a consultative and planning process with the school staff, with parents and with local representatives of relevant statutory, voluntary and community agencies in the development of annual retention plans. They must devise a collaborative programme of in-school and out-of-school actions that will prevent early school leaving and support young people with characteristics and behaviour that are indicative of real risk. A National Coordination Team that comprises a National Co-ordinator and four Regional Coordinators support the School Completion Programme. It is the task of the National Co-ordination Team to advise on and monitor the integrated area-based Retention Plans that support the young person at-risk at local level. A Programme Research and Development Officer provides research and administrative support for the development, delivery and evaluation of the School Completion Programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1392">Educational Welfare Officers (EWOs) are appointed and deployed throughout the country by the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) which is established under the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000 as the national body with responsibility for school attendance. The Act provides a comprehensive framework promoting regular school attendance and tackling the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving. The general functions of the Board are to ensure that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education. I have been informed by the Board that it prioritises its resources to support the most disadvantaged areas and schools participating in DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) the action plan for educational inclusion. EWOs provide an intensive service in the designated areas. Outside of these areas, priority is given to children who are out of school or have significant difficulties with school attendance.</p>
            <p eId="para_1393">In addition to case work on referrals from schools EWOs also provide assistance and advice to parents whose children experience school attendance difficulties by arranging for continuation of education through alternative placement or assisting with application for home tuition. They also work closely with schools offering advice and assistance on developing policies to encourage children to attend school regularly. At both school and community level EWOs work in co-operation with other agencies to integrate delivery of services to schools, families and children. Furthermore EWOs also handle queries relating to the Educational (Welfare) Act, 2000, and school attendance issues in general. Where required the EWO has responsibility to initiate legal proceedings under the Act to safeguard the educational welfare of a child.</p>
            <p eId="para_1394">The Board operates through 5 regional teams and the service is provided from 26 locations nationwide. Resources to the EWB has grown incrementally since its establishment and future allocation to the Board will be considered in light of the rollout of services, the scope for integrated working and any proposals that the Board may submit to the department in relation to clearly identified priority needs. The allocation to the Board for 2008 is €10.119m. In relation to the Deputy's specific questions concerning the deployment and costs of EWOs in Co. Clare I am informed by the Board that there is currently one Educational Welfare Officer based in Co. Clare and the caseload for this EWO, during the current school year from September 07 to the end of April 08, is 131 cases involving intensive work and 78 of these cases are ongoing. For the previous school year 2006/2007 there was 143 cases dealt with by the EWO.  The annual cost involves pay which is determined in accordance with a standard scale ranging from €37,121 to €59,211 and overhead costs associated with service delivery, such as the cost of providing office accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1395">There are a total of 450 local HSCL coordinators providing services to 691 schools (370 Primary and 281 Post primary), with an additional 80 posts made available in 2006 to extend Home School Community Liaison services to all schools selected to participate in DEIS. Commitment has also been given to schools not selected to participate in DEIS but already in the HSCL scheme, to continue to support these schools in their efforts to deal with educational disadvantage among their students in line with both their size and level of disadvantage. 2,680 pupils attending 9 schools in Co. Clare (4 post primary &amp; 5 primary) currently have access to Home School Community Liaison, with approximately 600 of these pupils' families being specifically targeted for the services of 6 local Home School Community Liaison Co-ordinators.</p>
            <p eId="para_1396">My Department is currently finalising a full review of Home School Community Liaison (HSCL) clustering arrangements in all schools participating in the scheme to ensure that all schools have a level of service which is commensurate with both the size of the school as well as its relative level of disadvantage. Any changes made in the HSCL clustering arrangements, which will take effect from 1 September 2008, will be notified to schools shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1397">SCP is funded on a multi-annual basis under the National Development Plan (NDP) and up to 2007 with assistance from the European Social Fund (ESF). €31.160 million has been allocated to SCP for 2008. There are currently 124 projects participating in the School Completion Programme spanning 26 counties, comprising 224 post-primary schools and 468 primary schools. Each project employs a local Co-ordinator to run the project at local level. My Department currently supports 7 schools (2 post primary and 5 primary schools) in 2 School Completion Projects in Co. Clare, under DEIS. These 2 School Completion Projects receive over €460,000 in total annually which targets approximately 557 young people and 21 out-of-school young people.</p>
            <p eId="para_1398">The substantial resources deployed in programmes to combat education disadvantage is a clear indication of this Government's commitment to prioritise investment in favour of those most at risk. Through improved co-operation and co-ordination of services we are determined to optimise access, participation and educational outcomes at every level of the system for disadvantaged children and young people.</p>

            <p eId="para_1408">As indicated to the Deputy previously, the application from the school referred to is currently under consideration at present and it is expected that Department officials will be back in contact with the school authorities with a decision on this application very shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1409">With regard to the question of who is legally responsible and liable if a child or a teacher has an accident, it is the school authorities who are responsible in the first instance for health and safety issues at the school.  The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 sets out the responsibilities on individual school management authorities to have a safety statement in place in their schools. It is also a matter for school authorities to determine school policies, taking into account any health and safety risks to children and to put appropriate safeguards in place to mitigate any potential risk to the school community.</p>
            <p eId="para_1410">As part of the management of the risks there is an onus on Boards of Management to ensure, as appropriate, that they have put in place comprehensive insurance cover for schools.  Boards are advised by my Department to ensure that all such insurances are effected and maintained as are necessary to safeguard the school, the Board and the Trustees against all public liability.</p>
            <p eId="para_1411">A key element of the management of the risks is ensuring that there is adequate supervision of pupils in school yards.  The Education Act assigns each Board of Management and Principal Teacher responsibility for the day-to-day management of schools. School Principals are obliged to organise supervision for the order and general behaviour of pupils during school hours.  In particular, they should organise and participate in the effective supervision of the pupils during breaks, lunch-breaks, assembly and dismissal.</p>

            <p eId="para_1443">However, any decision to move to a common defence would have to be taken by unanimity, providing Ireland with the right to veto any such proposal.  There is currently no indication that any proposal in this sense is likely in the foreseeable future.</p>

Under our Constitution, Ireland cannot participate in a common defence without the prior consent of the people in a referendum.</p>

            <p eId="para_1447">The European Defence Agency was set up in 2004 during Ireland's Presidency of the EU.  Its mission is "to support the Member States in their effort to improve European defence capabilities in the field of crisis management and to sustain the European Security and Defence Policy as it stands now and develops in the future".  Ireland participates in the framework of the Agency and is represented on the Steering Board by the Minister for Defence.</p>
            <p eId="para_1448">Since its inception, the Agency has made significant progress, notably in areas such as the development of the EDA Code of Conduct for defence procurement and a Code of Best Practice in the Supply Chain to ensure transparency in procurement and security of supply of defence equipment.  A European Bulletin Board has been developed as a single portal for defence contract opportunities linking customers and defence contractors.  Whilst Ireland does not have a defence industry per se, it can benefit as a buyer of defence equipment in terms of increased competition and from economies of scale from such developments.</p>
            <p eId="para_1449">Pursuant to the Government decision on participation in the framework of the EDA it was agreed that participation by Ireland in any specific investment project promoted by the EDA would be subject to prior consultation by the Department of Defence with an Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  The Minister for Defence, having consulted with An Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, approved Ireland's participation in the first project of this nature, the Joint Investment Programme on Force Protection (JIP-FP) which is in the area of Research and Technology.</p>
            <p eId="para_1450">In November 2006,  the Steering Board of the EDA approved this Programme.  Force Protection involves measures to protect defence forces engaged in peace support and crisis management operations overseas and is one of the main factors considered when undertaking any operation.  As such, the development of enhanced capabilities in this area is one in which the Defence Forces have a great interest.</p>
            <p eId="para_1451">The JIP-FP Programme, which has a budget of €55 million over 3 years (which commenced in 2007) covers 18 specific research and technology goals under 5 capability areas:</p>
            <p eId="para_1452">Collective (units, platforms, infrastructure) survivability through enhancing detect and identify and response performances;</p>
            <p eId="para_1453">Individual protection;</p>

            <p eId="para_1456">Mission Planning/Training in an asymmetric environment</p>
            <p eId="para_1457">The Department of Defence sought admission to the Programme with a commitment of €700,000 over three years from 2007.  The financial commitment is in accordance with EDA funding principles, based on the Gross National Income key.  The Programme Arrangement for the JIP-FP was signed by the participating Member States at the EDA Ministerial Steering Board on 14 May 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_1458">A second Joint Investment Programme on Innovative Concepts and Emerging Technologies was approved at a ministerial meeting of the EDA Steering Board on 26 May 2008.  Eleven (11) European countries will contribute to the new initiative, which will be funded by a common budget of €15.5 million.  Ireland has decided not to participate in the new programme on this occasion.</p>
            <p eId="para_1459">The financial contribution Ireland is making to the EDA will be in the region of €327,000 in 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1460">Participation in the framework of the Agency does not impose any specific obligations or commitments on Ireland other than a contribution to the budget of the Agency.

            <p eId="para_1462">The European Defence Agency was established under a Joint Action of the Council of Ministers on 12 July, 2004 "to support the Member States and the Council in their effort to improve European defence capabilities in the field of crisis management and to sustain the European Security and Defence Policy as it stands now and develops in the future".  The EDA is an Agency of the European Union.  Ireland participates in the framework of the Agency and is represented on the Steering Board by the Minister for Defence.</p>
            <p eId="para_1463">The Agency has made significant progress in many areas since 2004, such as the development of the interGovernmental regime for defence procurement of which Ireland is a member.  The EDA Code of Conduct for defence procurement and a Code of Best Practice in the Supply Chain was developed to ensure transparency in procurement and to create a more competitive European defence equipment market.  The Defence Procurement Regime is now 21 months in operation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1464">There are 25 subscribing Member States (including Ireland) to the Code of Conduct.</p>
            <p eId="para_1465">Under the regime a European Bulletin Board has been developed as a single portal for advertising defence contract opportunities. 2007 was the first full year of operation through the Code of Conduct.  The general consensus amongst participating Member States is that it has been a success.  Whilst Ireland does not have a defence industry per se, we expect that benefits should accrue from being a subscribing Member State in terms of increased competition and resulting economies of scale when buying equipment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1466">On 6 July 2004, the Government approved participation in the framework of the EDA on the basis of a memorandum submitted by the Minister for Defence, in association with the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  The agreement of Dáil Éireann was not required for this decision or the decision to participate in the Code of Conduct.  Participation in the Regime was agreed by Ireland at the level of the EDA Steering Board in this instance.</p>
            <p eId="para_1467">There is no requirement for Dáil approval for participation in the Agency.  The Agency is an intergovernmental agency within the framework of ESDP.  Participation in the framework of the Agency does not impose any specific obligations or commitments on Ireland other than a contribution to the budget of the Agency.  Participation in individual projects of the Agency will be a matter for national decision on a case-by-case basis.</p>

            <p eId="para_1482">I take it that the Deputy is referring to the psychological support available to prisoners in custody.</p>
            <p eId="para_1483">Where a prisoner is assessed as having difficulties with their incarceration, steps are taken to provide assistance to address such problems while in prison.  All prisoners have access to a range of therapeutic services, including access to medical, psychiatric and other healthcare services, if clinically appropriate.  Prisoners also have access to the Prison Psychology Service.  Referral to any particular service is on the basis of assessed need.  While every effort is made to address identified problems within prison, the Deputy will appreciate that this also requires the active cooperation of the prisoner involved.</p>
            <p eId="para_1484">The Criminal Law (Insanity) Act, 2006, also provides a mechanism whereby a prisoner who is suffering from mental illness and who cannot be treated effectively within the prison may be transferred to a designated centre under the Act, for further treatment.</p>

In addition he has been evading his deportation since 10 August 2004 and should therefore present himself to the Garda Authorities with any further delay.  As a matter of policy, I do not intend to reward persons who have failed a very fair and comprehensive asylum process, and who have thereafter proceeded to evade their deportation for several years, by granting such persons residency in the State.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if there has been a change in the circumstances of the person concerned, or if new information has come to light which has a direct bearing on his case, there remains the option of applying to me for revocation of his Deportation Order pursuant to the provisions of Section 3(11) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended.

These conditions are that the applicant must be of full age, or by way of exception, be a minor born in the State; be of good character; have had a period of one year's continuous residency in the State immediately before the date of application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, have had a total residence in the State amounting to four years; intend in good faith to continue to reside in the State after naturalisation; and have made, either before a Judge of the District Court in open court or in such a manner as the Minister for special reasons allows, a declaration in the prescribed manner, of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State.  Section 16 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, provides that I may, in my absolute discretion, waive some or all of the statutory conditions in certain circumstances i.e. where an applicant is of Irish descent or of Irish associations; where an applicant is a person who is a refugee within the meaning of the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees; or where an applicant is a Stateless person within the meaning of the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Stateless persons.

            <p eId="para_1583">Lagarosiphon major, also known as the curly-leaved pondweed, is a native of southern Africa.  It has been widely sold for many years as an oxygenating plant for garden ponds and aquaria.  However, it is viewed as a major threat to Irish lakes and their associated wildlife since it became established in Lough Corrib in 2005.  Surveys which have been carried out by the Central Fisheries Board have found no evidence of Lagarosiphon major in either Lough Mask and Lough Carra.  A Lagarosiphon Task Force has been established to address the spread of the pondweed in Lough Corrib and in any other areas where it is identified.  The Task Force includes representatives of my Department's National Parks and Wildlife Service, the Central Fisheries Board, the Western Regional Fisheries Board, the Office of Public Works and Galway County Council.  Last year, my Department provided funding to the Central Fisheries Board to purchase a weed cutting boat to be dedicated exclusively to removing Lagarosiphon major in Lough Corrib.  I understand that the boat is now moored on the lake and will begin operations shortly.  In this regard, I have provided additional funding of €200,000 this year to the Central Fisheries Board for work involving the removal and control of Lagarosiphon major in the lake.

            <p eId="para_1622">The planning, development and routing of transmission line infrastructure is a matter for EirGrid, which is the wholly State-owned company responsible for operating the electricity transmission system, including the wholesale electricity trading system. EirGrid delivers connections, transmission and market services to generators, suppliers and customers, using the high voltage electricity system and in this context is also responsible for planning the construction of high voltage transmission lines.</p>
            <p eId="para_1623">The approval of the Transmission System Development Plan, which includes power lines, is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), which is statutorily independent in carrying out its functions. Individual power lines also require approval through the relevant planning process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1624">EirGrid is developing the second North South electricity interconnector in conjunction with its Northern Ireland counterpart in the context of the Single Electricity Market. The increased capacity provided by the interconnector will enhance security of supply and promote competition. In addition to the benefits on an all island basis, EirGrid is strengthening the high voltage network in Counties Meath, Cavan and Monaghan, thereby adding to the availability of bulk high quality power in the North East. The importance of strengthening the network is shown by the fact that such networks have helped facilitate high-tech manufacturing plants in north-west Dublin and east Kildare.</p>
            <p eId="para_1625">EirGrid is currently engaging in further public consultation on the North South interconnector and Meath Cavan transmission lines. Following that consultation process, a formal application will be made to An Bord Pleanála.</p>
            <p eId="para_1626">With regard to the East/West interconnector, in 2006 the Government requested the CER to arrange the design of a competition to secure the construction of a 500 megawatt interconnector by 2012. The Government decided that the interconnector will, as a national strategic asset, remain in public ownership and will be owned by EirGrid. To this end, I have introduced legislation, which recently completed Committee Stage in the Dáil, to allow EirGrid to construct, own, operate and maintain the interconnector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1627">I am advised that EirGrid expects the contract for design and construction of the interconnector to be completed by late 2008, when the successful bidder will be announced. EirGrid has secured Woodland in County Meath as the connection point for the interconnector on the Irish transmission system and Deeside in Wales on the UK side. Furthermore, EirGrid has undertaken a marine survey to determine the most suitable route for the undersea cable. Late 2011 is the target for the completion of works and 2012 is the target for the completion of commissioning and testing and the start of commercial operations.</p>

            <p eId="para_1631">The Digital Hub Development Agency (DHDA) is making significant progress in achieving the major targets set out in its development plan.  The DHDA contains 96 digital media companies, employing 727 full time highly skilled staff and a further 250 contract workers.  The companies generate spending of €45M in salaries per year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1632">The DHDA manages 10 operational office buildings totalling 150,000 square feet.  The next phase of property development is currently going through the planning process; this will deliver 140,000 sq. ft of state of the art digital media space by 2011.  Revenue generated from rental income, course fees and sponsorship accounts for 65% of DHDA's income with the balance provided by the Exchequer.  The DHDA is on track to achieve self-funding by 2010.  The DHDA's learning programmes supported 3200 participants in 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_1633">The Digital Hub has made significant progress in constructing a vibrant, innovation driven, collaborative knowledge community built around digital media, which is a new industry for Ireland.  This is making, and will continue to make a considerable contribution to the regeneration of the Liberties in Dublin.</p>

            <p eId="para_1642">Net metering, in the electricity market, requires that participating generators can access electricity meters which record both imports and exports of electricity or, at a minimum, meters which offset electricity imported by individual customers against volumes of electricity exported to the electricity system from the same property. Traditional electricity meters do not record or offset the volume of any electricity exported.</p>
            <p eId="para_1643">In line with the Programme for Government, work is underway on the roll out of the national smart meter programme. These meters, among other functions, can measure and record both imports and exports of electricity.

            <p eId="para_1645">As outlined in the reply to question number 232 on 23 April 2008, during 2007 two finds were made in the North Celtic Sea Basin off the south coast.  Providence Resources Limited identified an oil accumulation at the Hook Head prospect in block 50/11 while Island Oil and Gas Limited encountered gas at the Schull prospect in block 57/2.  In addition, Island Oil and Gas Limited successfully appraised its 2006 Old Head gas discovery in block 49/23.</p>
            <p eId="para_1646">In all three cases further studies are continuing in order to determine whether these accumulations can be progressed to commercial developments.  So far during 2008 no additional finds have been made.</p>

While these results are encouraging, it is too early to say whether an economic mineral deposit occurs in the area.</p>

            <p eId="para_1652">The provision of broadband services is, in the first instance, a matter for the private sector.  Broadband service providers operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated, where appropriate, by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.  Details on broadband availability throughout the country are available on www.broadband.gov.ie.</p>
            <p eId="para_1653">The role of Government is to ensure that the appropriate regulatory regime is in place and to invest directly in certain circumstances, that is, in cases of market failure, for economic and social inclusion reasons and to enhance and support regional competitiveness.</p>
            <p eId="para_1654">The latest figures from the OECD (December 2007) show that Ireland experienced one of the fastest rates of growth in broadband take-up in the OECD.  ComReg's latest report shows that we have a penetration rate per capita of over 20%, which equates to over 44% of Irish households at the end of September 2007.  I expect that ComReg data for quarter 1 of 2008 will confirm that over 50% of households had broadband at the end of March this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1655">In Ireland there is evidence on the supply side of greater bandwidth being made available at lower prices such as the recent offerings by two companies of 12 Mbps and 15 Mbps at €40 and €45 per month respectively.</p>
            <p eId="para_1656">The latest OECD report also highlights weaknesses in broadband development across the OECD and identifies policy issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_1657">Internationally, telecommunications is moving to next generation broadband to deliver greater quality, speed and service to the consumer.  This is happening where there is strong competition and incentives to innovate.  I will shortly publish for consultation a policy paper that will set a framework for investment by the private sector in next generation broadband.  The paper will also set out what I believe is the optimal role for Government in facilitating the roll out of next generation networks.</p>

            <p eId="para_1663">The role of the Government is to formulate regulatory and infrastructure policies to facilitate the provision of high quality telecommunications services, by competing private sector service providers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1664">The widespread provision of broadband services continues to be a priority for the Government.  In that regard my Department has undertaken initiatives to address the gaps in broadband coverage.  These included providing grant-aid under the Group Broadband Scheme and ongoing investment in Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs).</p>
            <p eId="para_1665">Although broadband is now widely available in Ireland there are still some parts of the country where the private sector will be unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband services.  Accordingly, the procurement process for a National Broadband Scheme (NBS) is under way.  The NBS will provide broadband services to areas that are currently unserved and will ensure that all reasonable requests for broadband are met.  Homes and premises that are more difficult to reach are also being examined and potential solutions are being considered.  Consequently, it is expected that all homes and premises in currently unserved areas will be offered a broadband service.  It is anticipated that a preferred bidder will be selected and appointed in August 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1666">As regards MANs a Value for Money and Policy Review of Phase I of the MANs Programme is currently being finalised in my Department.  I am also finalising a consultation paper on next generation broadband.  Both documents will be published shortly and will inform future Government investment in broadband.</p>
