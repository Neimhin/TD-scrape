#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	0	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, together.As I indicated in reply to previous questions on the matter, the recommendations of the Nally report in relation to the reorganisation of the Chief State Solicitor's office have been largely implemented.  Agreement with the unions involved was achieved during 2001.  The criminal prosecutions functions undertaken by the Chief State Solicitor's office were transferred to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions at the end of 2001.A common promotion pool within the two offices between the CSSO and the solicitors division of the DPP's office for professional solicitor and technical promotion posts formed part of the agreement and this is now operating.A negotiating process with local State solicitors is currently under way, seeking to agree on the transfer of the service to the DPP.  Two reviewers were appointed to undertake a study of the current workload of local State solicitors and their expense base.  They have submitted their report and this has been considered by the Chief State Solicitor's office and the DPP's office.A formal offer of increased remuneration, approved by the Department of Finance, was made to the State Solicitors Association on 21 April 2006.  Representatives of the Chief State Solicitor's office and the DPP's office met with the State Solicitors Association to discuss the offer.  The association rejected this offer and submitted a new proposal on 10 July 2006.  A new offer was made to the association on 6 September 2006 and it indicated on 29 September that it will not accept this offer at present and wishes to have further discussions on the matter.Enabling legislation and appropriate legislative provisions on the transfer of the local State solicitor service are contained in the Civil Service Regulation (Amendment) Act 2005, which was signed by the President on 9 July 2005.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1	A number of questions arise from this matter.  We must accept that one of society's duties is to vindicate the rights of citizens to peaceably enjoy this society.  Part of this duty involves ensuring, as far as possible, that when a wrong is committed against a citizen, justice is seen to be done.  Perhaps the DPP's office, the Chief State Solicitor's office or the Garda Síochána need to liaise with victims of serious crime to a much greater extent.  Certain well-publicised cases over the past number of years consisted of an ongoing series of events, but no information was given to the families of those who were murdered or otherwise affected by crime, which caused them great trauma and stress.  There should be dedicated liaison officers within the DPP's office, the Chief State Solicitor's office and the Garda Síochána to inform victims of the progress of the case.The DPP and his office should be able to make submissions on behalf of the people so that society can have a voice in the range of sentences handed down by judges in court.  Would the Taoiseach consider it appropriate if, prior to a sentence being handed down, the DPP, on behalf of the people, voiced an opinion on the range of sentences available?  It is only a convention that this does not happen and it might be very useful if it did happen.Will the Taoiseach progress the issues of dedicated liaison officers and the opportunity for the DPP to voice an opinion on behalf of society in so far as the Nally report is concerned?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	2	The Nally report did not cover any of these issues as it was produced some years ago and, as was pointed out, its recommendations effectively have been implemented.   I will gladly bring the points made by Deputy Kenny to the attention of the relevant offices.As the Deputy is aware, the DPP's office is independent in its functions and actions but there would be no problem if I brought the House's point of view to its attention.  In a speech he gave earlier this year, the DPP spoke about the point the raised by Deputy Kenny in respect of the lack of information given to families of victims.  The DPP's office is conscious of the fact that when decisions not to proceed with a case are made, it is left to legal points rather than the emotional impact on the families concerned.  I will bring the points mentioned by Deputy Kenny to the attention of the relevant parties.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	3	I will revisit the question of the transfer of the State solicitor's office from the Office of the Attorney General to the DPP's office.  I heard what the Taoiseach said but I am not clear where the decision now stands.  This was a recommendation of the Nally report as long ago as 1999.  What is the Taoiseach's expectation in terms of that transfer being effected?In his annual report, the DPP stated he would like to see a legal policy unit opened in his office.  Times have changed and he is no longer concerned with prosecuting files alone.  Often, his office is required to give advice on legal policy and he feels the office would be enhanced by the creation of such a policy unit.  Has progress been made on that?  Has the DPP sought this or has the Government granted resources for it?  Does the Government have a view on it?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	4	On the first issue, as was pointed out, all initiatives and recommendations of Nally were implemented and the conclusions and recommendations were agreed.  The matter of the State solicitor was held for further discussion.  The current system of appointing State solicitors through open competition, which was the initiative proposed at that time, is working well.  It is done through open competition now and there is no decision to change from that position.  It changed from the old system to open competition.Other issues arose from that.  Following that report, State solicitors put forward a number of staffing initiatives which were examined by the Chief State Solicitor's office.  That has been an industrial relations issue for the past year or two.  The office has been dealing with the State Solicitors Association which now acts for State solicitors.  Because of the way State solicitor offices are now formed, staff and costs differ from county to county.  Some offices are large, such as Cork, Limerick and Galway, while others are small.Negotiations have been trying to reach an offer which can be used across the system.  Three offers have been turned down.  Last week or the week before, the State Solicitors Association did not accept the latest offer and wish to have further discussions on the matter, particularly on the issue of personal pay and remuneration element.  New contracts will have to be agreed with the DPP.  I am advised efforts are continuing although three offers have been rejected since Easter — in May, June and September.  If agreement can be achieved, new State solicitors' contracts which have been subject to open competition since Nally will have to be agreed with the Director of Public Prosecutions.  As I understand it, that work cannot be finalised without agreement on salaries, expenses and overheads.  The State solicitors' offices are an important part of the legal system.In reply to Deputy Kenny, the DPP has put forward a number of points in speeches on how he wishes to change the format of his office.  I understand the changes are subject to the annual budget exercise handled by my officials.  Discussions with the Department of Finance on those issues have not finished.  I am not sure whether the policy office mentioned is part of that.  I know the DPP has proposals and initiatives on accommodation and other issues being discussed at present.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	5	The Taoiseach mentioned rejection of the offer.  Was that based on monetary considerations alone or has there been an evaluation of the effects of the transfer of the Chief State Solicitor's office from the Attorney General to the DPP?  Was that done independently, particularly with regard to the general efficiency of the proposal and the effects on individual cases?  Has the Taoiseach any views on the effects or merits of the change?Will the Taoiseach indicate the status of the offer of increased remuneration regarding the State solicitors?  Does the Taoiseach think this is all about remuneration or are there other issues that must be clarified?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	6	There were a number of issues because there were new contracts with the DPP and they are issued on a competitive basis.  At this stage, however, it is down to money; the other issues have been completed.  There is a problem because some of the offices are very large while others are very small.  It is a hard issue to find a basis for a settlement.  There have been three offers and discussions are continuing.I am advised that the system has worked well over the past few years.  There was a total overhaul of all the offices, with huge increases in staff and investment in information communication technology.  That work is ongoing.  The Chief State Solicitor's office has now recruited additional staff and has a complement of 238 full-time equivalents, a huge increase on the number a few years ago.  There is now only a small number of vacancies in the office.  The DPP has recruited the additional staff sanctioned and it has a staff complement of 170, so there are now 400 people between the two offices.  As I stated, there is now a promotional base where they can move between offices; the ring-fencing no longer exists.  From a staff point of view, the situation is much better.The Nally report recognised and identified problems with grading, appointments, transfer and promotion of staff.  There were a number of issues that led to a difficult position at that stage with staffing.  In the CSSO and the solicitor division of the DPP, promotions and professional and technical grades are now open to all suitably qualified people.  The system is working much better and the tensions of the past are gone with better promotional prospects and movement between sections.There were many other initiatives, such as the setting up of better library, research and ICT facilities, and those have all been implemented.  We have reached the last point of an agreement with the Chief State Solicitor's office which will allow new contracts with the DPP.

Does the Taoiseach recall the number of cases where the State has vigorously contested cases, for example, cases brought by parents fighting for the rights of their children to special needs education?  Is he aware of the great hurt that has caused to many families?  Have the changes he outlined in any way affected the location of the determination of what cases should be fought by the State where citizens are pursuing their rights or is it the case that it is still vested in the control of the Chief State Solicitor's office?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	8	I do not think the changes have changed the points of law.  Both the DPP and the Chief State Solicitor's office will take cases or fight cases based on what their legal judgment is and the culpability or rights of the State.  Obviously I hope that because of the additional resources that have been put in for a number of years, they are in a better position to do that from the point of view of having the resources and staff to do so but I do not think their legal judgment would have changed because of the administrative changes in the office.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	9	I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 to 7, inclusive, together.Significant progress has been made since the publication of the OECD Report on Regulatory Reform in Ireland.  The focus of our efforts in progressing regulatory reform is now on implementing the White Paper on better regulation, Regulating Better, which was published in January 2004 in response to the OECD's report.  It sets out six core principles that are to be reflected in how we design, implement and review legislation and regulation.  Some of the key areas outlined in the OECD report relate to specific sectoral issues and the appropriate Ministers with responsibility for those sectoral areas are reporting directly to the House on progressing the OECD recommendations.Progress has been made in a number of key areas set out in the White Paper.  The better regulation group was established in 2004 to oversee the implementation of the action plan which forms part of the White Paper.  This group has met four times so far this year.  At present, the better regulation group oversees the work of three subgroups.  The first subgroup has been charged with progressing certain commitments in the White Paper in relation to developing improved approaches to regulatory appeals.  It prepared a consultation paper on regulatory appeals which was issued in July last and is the basis of a public consultation process that is under way.  I will return to this shortly in reply to Deputy Rabbitte's question.  Another subgroup of the better regulation group is looking at improving electronic accessibility to statutory instruments.  A third subgroup is finalising a database that identifies bodies in Ireland which have regulatory functions.Alongside this work, the better regulation unit in my Department has commissioned a comprehensive survey of business attitudes to, and experience of, regulation.  This will build on a similar survey conducted in 2002.  The survey has been guided by input from both the better regulation group and the business regulation forum, which is under the aegis of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  It is intended that the survey will focus not only on red tape and administrative burdens but also on the impacts of regulation on business more broadly such as the extent to which it facilitates or is a barrier to economic growth and the competitiveness of business.  Following a competitive tendering process, the ESRI was appointed to conduct the survey and it is expected the survey results will be published by the end of the year.My Department continues to provide support and guidance to Departments and offices on regulatory impact analysis, which is now required for all proposals for significant new regulations being sent to Government for approval.The process of modernising the Statute Book also continues with the ongoing review of all legislation enacted before the foundation of the State.  Deputies will recall the enactment last year of the Statute Law Revision (Pre-1922) Act, which repealed 206 Acts.  Earlier this year, there was public consultation on the repeal of a further 2,000 Acts dating from before 1801.  There was a very positive response to that consultation, with 70 submissions being received.  The results of that consultation are being considered by the Office of the Attorney General.In light of progress made since the public consultation, the Government agreed to widen the scope of the repeal process to include Acts made since 1801.  Accordingly, a new consultation phase to cover Acts made in the period from 1801 to 6 December 1922 was advertised last week and is now under way.  Once these latest consultations are complete, the Government will introduce a statute law revision Bill to repeal all remaining pre-1922 legislation from the period 1200 to 1922 which has been found to be redundant or obsolete.  It is intended to publish this new Bill by Christmas.Deputies will also be aware of the Statute Law (Restatement) Act 2002.  Shortly before the summer the Government agreed that the Law Reform Commission will conduct a programme of restatement.  This programme is to be carried out under the oversight of a steering group, which includes representatives of the Law Reform Commission and the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and will be chaired by my Department.  In May this year, I launched a public consultation process where I invited interested parties to propose areas of law for restatement as a priority.  The steering group is examining the submissions received.Turning to Deputy Rabbitte's question, another commitment in the White Paper was to develop an improved approach to appealing the decisions of the major economic and sectoral regulatory bodies.  Given the complex nature of the issues involved in appeals, the Government decided to initiate a broad public consultation process on the issue and a consultation paper was prepared by a sub-group of the better regulation group.  The consultation process was launched on 26 July 2006 and advertised in a number of national newspapers.  A very successful consultation seminar in relation to appeals was organised by my Department on 14 September 2006 to generate debate on the issue and encourage submissions.  The seminar presented legal, international and business experience in relation to appeals.  Speakers at the seminar included the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and the Attorney General.  A number of presentations from the seminar as well as the consultation document are available on the better regulation website or in hard copy on request.Two submissions have been received to date and a number of other submissions are expected before the closing date of 31 October 2006.  The better regulation group will then review submissions received and publish a synthesis document.  These submissions will inform proposals on appeals which the better regulation group will prepare for consideration by the Government by the middle of 2007.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	10	I am grateful to the Taoiseach for his lengthy reply.  The 2001 report referred to a number of bottlenecks in physical infrastructure, such as housing, transportation and environmental services, which it said were responsible for fuelling inflation.  Is it not true that these bottlenecks still exist and are a contributing cause of rising inflation?The ESB and Bord Gáis are part of a regulated sector.  The Government commissioned an expensive report from Deloitte & Touche, which recommended the break-up of the grid and the generation section of the ESB.  The Government rejected this recommendation.  Would the Taoiseach not consider that competition and separateness would have been valuable, while both would still have been owned by the State?  Has he examined the position in which the regulators find themselves?  For example, they have given a 34% increase in gas prices, which affects hundred of thousands of people, and a 20% price increase will be allowed to the ESB later in the year.  The regulators approved those increases based on information which is no longer pertinent.  For example, in Britain gas sells at a minus price and the price of crude oil is below €60 per barrel.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	12	I know.  I am lucky I got that far.

The regulator cannot amend the prices it has given unless the entity returns and asks for a price reduction, which is unlikely.  In the interests of pressurised families the Government should examine this.Does the Taoiseach recognise that the Green Paper on Energy recently published by the Government fails to deal with the fundamental issue——
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	15	Again, that is a matter for the Minister.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	16	If the Ceann Comhairle will let me finish the sentence I will explain that it is about regulatory reform in the energy sector and the Government's Green Paper does not grasp that nettle.  In the context of the OECD report, which mentioned bottlenecks in physical infrastructure, energy is central to the next 25 to 50 years of our country.  Will the Taoiseach comment on that element of the OECD regulatory reform?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	17	The group's main focus has been on issues around the economic and sectoral regulator authorities, and there are a number of those, including the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, the Commission for Aviation Regulation, the Commission for Energy Regulation, the Financial Regulator, the Competition Authority and the Commission for Taxi Regulation.  It has endeavoured to work with all these groups.  Deputy Kenny asked about energy in particular.  The Commission for Energy Regulation is an independent statutory body established under the Regulation Act of the late 1990s.  Since then it has regulated the markets and since 2002 it has regulated the natural gas market too.  The commission's functions and duties are wide-ranging and have grown since its establishment under statutory order.The Government recognises the fundamental role played by the ESB in the economic and social development of the State.  However, it is of the view that there is strategic value in maintaining a strong, commercially viable ESB into the future.  The Government does not favour the fragmentation of the ESB and that is why it did not agree with the proposals to which Deputy Kenny referred.  The European Commission, in the context of the Green Paper on Energy, mooted the establishment of a single regulatory authority to better progress the fully liberalised market agenda.  That matter is under discussion and the two regulators, North and South, are preparing a dialogue in the context of the all-Ireland energy market, which is making enormous strides.  Development of a single regulatory body is signalled as a long-term strategic goal in the development of the all-Ireland energy market.  Examination of the benefits and requirements for the creation of an all-Ireland regulatory body is scheduled for two or three years from now.  We are going to move into that area.On the point relating to the regulator making a decision, the process is long and drawn out and takes a number of months to complete.  If the regulator believes that the circumstances have changed, it is a matter for him, under the relevant statute, to deal with the issues.  I do not believe he can deal with fluctuations that occur on a weekly basis.  The regulator has responsibility for making the decisions to which I refer.As regards the other regulators and the appeals mechanism, work is ongoing in that regard.  The idea is to try to bring uniformity to the kind of mechanisms used by the various regulators.  It is not intended to have a super-regulator but rather to ensure that there is consistency in the approaches taken by regulators — not just as such approaches relate to business but to everyone — in the way they operate.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	18	Did I understand the Taoiseach to state that a new consultation process, which will ultimately lead to the removal from the Statute Book of measures in this regard from the period 1200 to 1922, has been embarked on?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	19	Yes.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	20	From the time of Henry VIII, 1536.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	22	Is the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform aware of this development?
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	23	In terms of regulatory appeals, is the purpose of the consultation process — I gather from the Taoiseach's answer that this is still under way — merely to bring about uniformity and consistency or does he envisage, depending on the outcome of the process, that new legislation designed to bring about changes in the current system relating to one or other sector will have to be introduced?  Is the Taoiseach aware of what was the response to the advertisement of the fact that this consultation process is under way?  Did it attract interest and contributions from consumer bodies as opposed to those that might have an economic or other vested interest in this matter?In the context of the remarks the Taoiseach made in reply to Deputy Kenny on the area of energy, was the Deputy correct that the regulator may only deal, for example, with the extraordinary increase of 34% in gas prices on the Sunday before last in the event of Bord Gáis returning to him?  I had been under the impression that the regulator may only review the matter once a year.  If that is so, is that not an urgent matter for us to address in light of the hardship that will be caused by such an increase when, as Deputy Kenny pointed out, for example, the opposite is happening in the United Kingdom?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	24	On legislation, some hundreds of old Acts remain in place.  We are almost there on the 1922 period.  We must now review the old Acts and get rid of those that do not need to be there; we need to obtain the statutory instruments and statute law.  This process has already started and on its completion the Law Reform Commission will then try to consolidate the Acts.  It intends to set up a unit — discussions are taking place with the Department of Finance at present — and will be able to consolidate far more legislation going forward.  Consequently, we will have a far tidier Statute Book.  Any work that has taken place in recent years extended back in the main to 1922.  There is still a great deal of other legislation and statutory instruments.  Even if someone takes 1922 as a base — we are fairly close to achieving this completely — many other laws exist.  In the next few years, the aim is to get the entire legislative base and statutory instruments right up to date.  It will then be consolidated on an ongoing basis.  Rather than going through the Departments to do this, which would take years, the Law Reform Commission will undertake this task.  This will improve matters greatly.The summary of the appeals mechanism for each of the various bodies I mentioned, such as the Commission for Communications Regulation, Commission for Aviation Regulation, Commission for Energy Regulation, the Financial Regulator etc., has been presented in the consultation paper.  The group that is working on this matter has gathered information on appeals mechanisms within the public service and in respect of administrative decisions and other sectoral appeals.  While this data informed the group's work, it is not referred to in detail in the paper.  It tried to take all these areas into account by examining appeal mechanisms, including some from other countries, to see what changes could be made.I understand from those working on this matter that, based on the experience of individual members and the information gathered both domestically and internationally, the group has identified a number of issues relevant to the design of an appeals mechanism for regulatory authorities.  These include whether appeals should be heard by a court or an appeals panel; whether an appeals body should be ad hoc or a standing body; whether regulatory decisions should be suspended pending the outcome of an appeal; and methods for avoiding vexatious appeals.A host of groups, organisations, bodies and agencies have the right, under statute, to make an appeal.  I understand there are more than 100 such bodies.  This measure is to try to bring this into some kind of coherent order.  As the Deputy's question suggested, not everyone is jumping up to give his or her view in this regard and responses have not been great from either individuals or consumer groups.  Responses tend to come from the professional groups.  My Department's officials, without my urging have tried in the consultation paper to orientate a section on consumer and citizen appeals.  They are examining developments in other countries.  Hence, the officials themselves are trying to generate this mechanism.  Unfortunately however, such matters do not greatly catch the imagination of Joe Public.  However, they are important because they pertain to citizens' rights as to how they can appeal a decision made by a particular body.  This is why my officials held public consultations and open days, which were useful.The electricity issue is probably of interest to most people at present.  I understand that on 8 September, the Commission for Energy Regulation published its draft decision on an average price increase of 19.7% for ESB consumers, to come into effect on 1 January.  The proposed price will vary across various categories and while approving the price increase, the Commission for Energy Regulation has reduced the total revenue requirements sought by the ESB by more than €80 million, or approximately 3.5%.  Moreover, it should be noted that the public sector obligation levy for next year will be zero.  However, the Commission for Energy Regulation has decided to end the regulation of ESB tariffs for its largest customers and the commission's public consultation of the draft tariff closed on 29 September.  Consequently, the regulator will make a final tariff determination for 2007.  The energy regulator has indicated that the tariff will remain in place until the introduction of an all-island energy market, which is now scheduled for November 2007.  To be precise about this, he is still preparing to make his determination, which will last for a year from 1 November next.  I assume that the fluctuations which are happening——
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	25	Is the Taoiseach saying that the figure of 19.7% is an indicative one at this stage?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	26	It is a draft consideration.  As I understand it, his draft consideration did not change much in other years.  However, it is a draft.  If one examines the position, one will find that the cost of fuel is obviously the main driver of the price.  When the tariffs were set last year, it was assumed that natural gas would cost 41c per therm.  The forward price of gas that is assumed for next year is 58c, which is an increase of 48%.  The equivalent increase for oil is approximately 36%.  I do not know what level of headroom the regulator provided for in his various calculations of how it will average out over a given period of time.  We need to examine those figures.  One can see in the regulator's judgment how it is going.  The regulator has stated that when he makes his final determination, it will last until the all-island energy market joint regulation report, which comes into effect on 1 November.

Will such assessments be published by the energy regulator so we can be sure that someone is cognisant of the impact of such increases?In light of the problems being encountered by customers of Smart Telecom, does the Government intend to reform the regulation of telecommunications in this country?  Such reform is needed, not least as a result of our international broadband embarrassment.

As I said, all the issues relating to the appeals mechanisms which are available at present, such as court appeals, and the alternative systems or structures which could be put in place have been examined.  The group has highlighted 34 specific questions and invited the respondents to the consultation process to address them.  It is intended to streamline the entire system, to make it more coherent than the system which has developed since the foundation of the State, and to try to get consumers and businesses to come together to develop a public view on narrowing the focus of what appeals should be.On the issue of poverty difficulties, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, has already announced the changes for those in receipt of units who will be protected from increases in this area.A number of possibilities exist to improve the appeals system and views on various models and options are being sought as part of the ongoing consultation process.  I do not wish to prejudice the outcome and I look forward to seeing proposals emanate from the group on what is a very important issue because such issues influence how action occurs in a number of areas.  The country is far more attractive, and business and consumer interests are helped, when such issues are presented clearly.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	46	As the House will be aware, because of slow progress being made towards our overall targets in the pensions area, in early 2005 I asked the Pensions Board to undertake the national pensions review.  This was published in January 2006.  In its report on the review, the board reaffirmed the various targets recommended in the original national pensions policy initiative, including a supplementary pensions coverage rate of 70% for those aged 30 years and over.  The board also suggested a continuation of the existing system of voluntary supplementary pensions provision with improved incentives for participation.However, as I said before, no truly voluntary pensions system has delivered the coverage rates for which we are aiming and if we are to achieve our overall targets, we may have to consider more radical approaches.  I therefore asked the Pensions Board to explore and report to me in more detail on the general issues surrounding mandatory or quasi-mandatory supplementary systems outlined in its report on the national pensions review.I published this second report, with the consent of the Government, last August.  The report is a technical examination of the practical issues associated with a mandatory supplementary pension system.  It is not a recommendation by the board for or against the introduction of a mandatory system.  The board has, instead, examined several options and concluded by giving an outline of what such an arrangement could look like.The model put forward by the board for consideration is aimed at low to middle earners which entails mandatory contributions of 15%, shared between employers, employees and the Exchequer, on earnings between €15,000 and €60,000.  This would be backed up by an improved social welfare pension, which would increase from a current level of 33% of gross average industrial earnings to 40%.  A timescale of ten years was suggested for full implementation if this model was approved.The two reports developed by the Pensions Board over the past year require serious debate and analysis before we decide finally on the type of retirement provision we want for our older people and the contribution we will make during our working lives to that future.In this regard, pensions featured very strongly in the negotiations on the new social partnership agreement, Towards 2016, and the final agreement features a number of commitments in this area. As part of the agreement, the Government is committed to publishing a Green Paper on pensions policy outlining the major policy choices and challenges in this area and taking account of the views of the social partners.The two reports completed by the Pensions Board will input greatly to the Green Paper, as will the views from the partnership talks and the National Pensions Forum.  A group of senior officials in my Department have already begun work on the Green Paper and it is my intention to produce it over the coming months.There will then be a consultation process after which the Government is committed to developing a framework for comprehensively addressing the pensions agenda in the long term.

What does he mean when he refers to the coming months?  The Minister has been talking about this issue for some time and now action is needed.The State pension currently stands at 33% of gross average industrial earnings.  In 1987 it was 38%, therefore the figure seems to have decreased quite a bit.What is the Minister's view on the various options put forward by the Pensions Board?  Is he in favour of the Kiwi Saver in New Zealand or the mandatory pension scheme in Australia?  What is the position on part-time workers and pensions?  Does the Minister agree that part-time workers are particularly disadvantaged where pension coverage is concerned?

The officials in my Department have started drafting the Green Paper and are finding the process very useful.  The Green Paper will outline the major policy choices that face the country and most people would agree this is the right way to proceed.  We know the size of the problem, that the choices are not easy and that they must be paid for.  One idea the officials proposed for consideration entails a mandatory contribution of 15%, shared between employers, employees and the Exchequer, on earnings between €15,000 and €60,000.I have stated a few times that it is important not to shy away from considering the mandatory or quasi-mandatory systems.  I am determined to shine the light on them and examine them closely to determine whether we can afford them.  More important, we should determine whether we can afford not to have them, given that over half the population, including 500,000 working women, do not have occupational pensions.  It is incumbent on us to take some action.This is not an easy area and mandatory pension contributions can be misinterpreted as additional taxation.  However, saying this is like saying PRSI contributions should not have been made mandatory.  PRSI contributions are mandatory and nobody in the country would put his hand up and ask that they be made voluntary.  I am determined to keep the options of mandatory and quasi-mandatory pensions on the table as we engage in the Green Paper process.  Meanwhile, we will consider other proposals, for example, the suggestion by the Pensions Board that we should have an SSIA-type system rather than tax reliefs.  This was one of the major proposals and we are continuing to make good progress in examining it.

However, we already have the options before us in that the Pensions Board has issued two reports and there was an intense media debate on the issue.  We now need concrete proposals from the Government.  We have had many discussions, debates and reports but no action.Is it correct that 53% of Irish women have no private pension coverage, as the Minister suggested, and that 43% of men have no such coverage?  While the Minister is fiddling with all the reports, this issue is continuing to feature.  When will we see action?  The Minister has issued many press releases on the subject.  How serious is he taking it?  How serious is the so-called pensions time bomb for workers or is it all a mirage?
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	54	A very serious issue is developing with regard to pensions and, as far as I understand the matter, the figures the Deputy has mentioned are correct.  One solution is to ignore the problem and allow all the tax breaks to benefit the top 20% or 30% of earners, who are benefiting from them at present.  Another solution is to hype the voluntary system, perhaps by turning tax breaks into cash breaks, to see whether it will attract more people thereto.  The third system is to consider a more quasi-mandatory or mandatory system.  By "quasi-mandatory", I mean a system in which people are enrolled automatically but can opt out.I have decided to engage in a process with regard to the latter option because, as I said from the beginning, one needs to bring the country with one on an issue such as this.  No Government would impose a mandatory pensions system without securing consensus in the political and financial systems.  I am trying to build such consensus.  We have largely done so and pensions have reached the top of the agenda in the national pay talks, the media and this House.  The first priority question today, for example, concerned pensions and it is therefore obvious that the issue has reached the top of the agenda.The next stage in the process is to combine all the research in a Green Paper and try to elicit from the parties opposite their views thereon.  I saw a Fine Gael press release that opposed mandatory pensions and expressed a preference for the SSIA-type route.  In calmer times, when we are not considering the matter in light of the forthcoming election, Deputy Stanton might revisit that statement.  Being in favour of mandatory pensions probably does not represent a very popular election platform, but it will surely be popular in 20 or 30 years among the 500,000 women without pension coverage, about whom we have spoken many times in the House.  At that stage, they will not care who wins the next election — all they will care about is whether we did the right thing.

#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	57	Family members working together are generally not insurable under the Social Welfare Acts.  Spouses of employed or self-employed contributors are specifically excepted from social insurance contributions in respect of their working activity with their spouses.  However, there is scope within the provisions of social welfare legislation to enable spouses who are partners in an enterprise, or who work together in a legally incorporated business, to be insurable and thereby accrue entitlement to contributory pensions in their own right.At the heart of the issue lies the fact that current social welfare provisions recognise that family members regularly support each other without having any intention of entering into formal contractual arrangements.  Employment under a contract of service as an employee, or as a contract for services as a self-employed person, is, by its very nature and necessity, a formal agreement between two or more parties.  All contracts bring with them rights and responsibilities that, in this instance, include compliance legislation relating to PRSI, taxes and employment rights.In general, close family members must show an express agreement to overcome the presumption that parties did not intend to be bound in a legally binding contract.  Evidence of a partnership between spouses or the incorporation of a business will overcome this presumption and establish liability for Class S contributions providing income is above the annual threshold of €3,174.  These provisions apply to couples engaged in farming activities and other self-employment activities, for example in retailing or in providing professional services.The exception of spouses from PRSI liability in respect of a shared occupation does not preclude them in certain circumstances from accessing the voluntary PRSI contribution scheme.  Access to this scheme requires a minimum number of 260 paid contributions.  Where a person has been previously insured as an employee or a self-employed person, is no longer compulsorily insured and is under 66 of age, he or she can opt to pay a voluntary social insurance contribution.Voluntary contributions will maintain social insurance cover for pensions such as retirement, State, widow's and widower's pensions, guardian's payment and the bereavement grant, depending on the rate at which voluntary contributions have been paid.  These contributions maintain pension coverage at the level equivalent to that for which the person was last compulsorily insured.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.The amount to be paid as a voluntary contribution is a percentage of annual income. For those who were previously self-employed, the voluntary contribution is paid at a fixed amount of €253 per annum.The requirement to have 260 paid contributions to gain access to the voluntary contribution scheme ensures that the requisite number of paid contributions is in place to establish a contributory pension entitlement.  While some spouses may not be able to accrue the paid contributions through farming, large numbers are now engaged in off-farm employment which enables them to accumulate the requisite number of paid contributions.Under the existing social welfare provisions, where formal employment or partnership relationships are intended between spouses or assisting relatives, the legislation provides the scope necessary to allow parties to enter into arrangements that will enable them to gain access to social insurance coverage.  On the voluntary contributions scheme, the requirement to have 260 paid contributions to gain access to the scheme is appropriate.  I am always willing to consider possible improvements.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	58	I thank the Minister for his reply.  Let me articulate and propound the case of the cohort including farmers' and shopkeepers' spouses.  They are declining categories of people across rural Ireland and in urban areas who are effectively forgotten or invisible in the social welfare code.  They spend many hours at the shoulders of their spouses, trying to retain and build up businesses.  They work extremely hard from early morning to late at night.  They do not have the formal arrangements or contractual arrangements to which the Minister referred.  They could in the case of legally incorporated businesses or partnerships, but that is the State effectively imposing a view on them.  Why does this have to be done?  Does the Minister agree that a significant anomaly exists within the social welfare code for farmers' and shopowners' spouses as well as other self-employed categories?  Women are being classified as relative to the system and prevented from paying PRSI in their own right.  As a result, they cannot qualify for contributory pensions in their own right.Does he agree that the problem has been compounded since the introduction of a means test for the qualified dependant?  Is it not the position that they are wiped out all together?  They work extremely hard, rear families and give a service to many people across the country, whether on the farm, huckster or corner shop.  Is this not effectively another form of discrimination?The answer is to remit such people in these situations.  I accept such an initiative would have to be subject to examination, restriction and regulation.  However, they should be allowed to pay the PRSI contribution on a voluntary basis, as was done with the carers, provided they work a certain number of hours in the shop or on the farm.  Let us say it would cost up to €500 per annum and they would need ten years' contributions to qualify.  It would not be open season and would be subject to regulation.  We all know that one cannot undermine the concept of the PRSI system, and we would not want to do so.  However, we should recognise people who are making a major contribution but who are wiped out of the system and in statistical terms turn up with zero in this regard.I appeal to the Minister as part of the multifaceted reviews going on in his Department to examine this situation.  I am sure the farmers' bodies and self-employed associations will make robust submissions to the Minister in the context of recognising people's contributions, ensuring the independence of women and removing them from a sense of dependency which was introduced in the 1920s and 1930s and which should be eliminated.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	59	This issue has been the subject of many reviews over the years.  More recently, it was discussed under the partnership talks.  The distilled wisdom of all the parties involved, at review level among employers, employees and, in so far as I can ascertain, farmers, is that while the system is not perfect and leaves people out of the loop, there is a solution by way of making formal arrangements so that the spouse becomes a business partner.I will listen carefully to the farmer bodies in particular if they have another approach to the problem.  However, all the reviews and the partnership talks have fallen back on the solution that is available, namely, formal relationships between partners as one might expect in any business.  That would allow them into the contribution net.I commented earlier on the availability of voluntary contributions.  Access to that scheme required a minimum number of 260 paid contributions and I can foresee some difficulty in that area for these people.  I understand the issue and I am sympathetic.  It has been reviewed many times.  Nobody in the Department has produced an easy solution to the problem.  However, there is an answer for anyone who is doing this work, namely, to enter a type of formal business relationship.  I am not sure that it has to be an extensive high-powered business relationship.  A partnership of some type might meet the requirements.  Nonetheless, I will take account of what the Deputy said.

Although the formal consultation process on the Government discussion paper has concluded, my officials continue to be in contact with lone parents' representative groups, whose views continue to feed in to the development of the proposals.I fully realise that the proposed new payment cannot be introduced without co-ordinated supports and services being put in place by other Departments and agencies.  This is why the Government has instructed the senior officials group on social inclusion to draw up an implementation plan to progress the non-income recommendations in tandem with the development of the legislation required in my Department to introduce the new payment scheme.  Once the implementation plan has been successfully drafted, it is my intention to bring proposals for legislation to the Dáil.As regards the National Economic and Social Council report, the council was asked to examine the feasibility of merging the family income supplement and child dependant allowance into a second tier child income support.  Such a payment would be aimed specifically at targeting child poverty by channelling resources to low-income families without creating significant disincentives to employment.While waiting for the structure for the new second tier support to be finalised, a range of other reforms, increased welfare supports and expanded child-centred services are all combining to make significant progress in tackling child poverty.  The most recent figures show that at least 100,000 children have been lifted out of deprivation and hardship inside the last decade as a result of targeted measures and supports.These include substantial increases in each budget in child benefit rates which directly benefit over one million children; increases of from €21 to €282 a week for families on family income supplement, which is being claimed by almost 19,000 families; some 80,000 families are benefiting from the €40 per child increase in the back to school clothing and footwear allowance; over 350,000 children have qualified for the €1,000 a year early child care supplement, a third of whom are the children of lone parents; and 41,000 child care places have been created under the €500 million equal opportunities child care programme.

Perhaps the Minister might confirm whether it was 2%, but it is now way beyond that figure.  There are two payments to be considered here, the parental allowance and the second tier payment.  Again, the Minister might recall that in his 2005 budget speech, made almost two years ago in December 2004, he spoke about the targeted second tier payment.  Will he tell the House when he plans to introduce it or bring forward solid proposals in this regard?  That is a fairly straightforward question.  We have been talking about this for two years.  When will we see action, or at least concrete proposals before the House, on the second tier payment?The same question arises regarding the parental allowance.  When will concrete proposals regarding this new allowance be brought before the House?  It is like the pensions issue — there is a lot of talk, reports, discussions, reviews and bodies, but we do not see any action.

#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	67	——back to school allowances, early child care supplements and equal opportunity child care programmes, etc, have been put in place.  Last year, those improvements stood at well over €1 billion.  Much is happening in tackling child poverty and poverty generally.  The facts and figures I have make clear that it is having a major impact.To return to the Deputy's question, I do not have a specific percentage in mind regarding a target for reducing child poverty outside the general poverty target.  The general poverty targets depend on whether one uses the approaches for measuring relative poverty used by the CSO or Europe, or the more sensible approach of measuring consistent poverty.  It ranges from 5% to 20% depending on the figures with which one deals.  The figures available to me indicate that approximately 240,000 people have escaped from the poverty trap in the past decade or so.  The percentage of those in poverty is reducing steadily.As regards the NESC report, while I am committed to the second tier payment, it is not the only tool against child poverty.  It was trumped somewhat by the child care payment of €1,000 to children under six.  This skewed the pitch a little in regard to payments directly to support children.  The NESC tells me that it is a complicated issue and it is continuing its work.  I have told it to continue its work, and I will move quickly on its proposals.  I have been tackling poverty, including child poverty, through increasing family income supplements, child benefits, clothing allowances and early child care supplements.  We are not waiting for that single tool.  While it will be a valuable tool, it is not the only one.I hope the lone parent family legislation will be brought before the House in the coming months.  While consultations with the various groups have been completed, it is not yet drafted.  We promised to put an implementation plan together to deal with the non-income element of the reforms, such as access to education, training and child care.  As well as my other proposed reforms, the groups feel strongly that those three elements must be organised.  We will try to progress them together.

Does the Minister agree that this new child care payment was designed to cover child care costs and not child poverty per se?

There may be financial aspects of it that will have to be dealt with in a budget, but the legislation would have to be separate because it is a new scheme and there are considerable legislative reforms involved.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	72	The free travel scheme is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years or over.  All carers in receipt of carer's allowance and carers of people in receipt of constant attendance or prescribed relative's allowance, regardless of their age, receive a free travel pass.  It is also available to people under age 66 who are in receipt of certain disability type welfare payments, such as disability allowance, invalidity pension and blind person's pension.  People resident in the State who are in receipt of a social security invalidity or disability payment from a country covered by EU regulations, or from a country with which Ireland has a bilateral social security agreement, and who have been in receipt of this payment for at least 12 months, are also eligible for free travel.The scheme provides free travel on the main public and private transport services for those eligible under the scheme.  These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus Átha Cliath, Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann, as well as Luas and services provided by more than 80 private transport operators.  The free travel scheme applies to travel within the State and point to point cross-Border journeys between here and Northern Ireland.  In line with the Government objective to put in place an all-Ireland free travel scheme for pensioners resident in all parts of this island, I am committed to significantly improving the North-South element of the current arrangements.There have been a number of requests and enquiries regarding the extension of entitlement to free travel in Ireland to Irish-born people living outside Ireland, or to those in receipt of pensions from my Department, particularly in Britain, when they return to Ireland for a visit.  I have examined the reply given by the European Commission to a parliamentary question from Proinsias De Rossa MEP in the European Parliament.  The reply indicates that to extend the free travel scheme to people in receipt of an Irish pension and living abroad could be discriminatory under EU law.  I have also been advised that it would not be possible to extend entitlement to free travel simply to Irish-born people living abroad as to do so would also be contrary to European legislation, which prohibits discrimination on the grounds of nationality.However, I am determined to explore all options and I have raised the issue in meetings with the Commissioner for Employment and Social Affairs.  Officials from my Department have met with European Commission officials on two occasions in an effort to clarify the legal issues involved.  I am keeping this issue under close review and contacts with the European Commission are ongoing.
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	73	I thank the Minister for his reply and for his history lesson on free travel.  I do not know why Ministers do not exclude that part of their answers.  Obviously, members of the Opposition know just as much about free travel as the Department's officials.  I do not know why it has to be read into the record every time.I am asking the Minister to take his courage in his hands.  Instead of running to Europe seeking a licence every time he wants to do something, he should do it and let Europe respond if it sees fit.  If the Minister had done this in the first place, we would already have the free travel scheme for the Irish abroad.In the response to Proinsias De Rossa, the Court of Justice's ruling effectively said that Irish nationals cannot be discriminated against on the basis that because someone does not have an Irish pension, one cannot get free travel when they come home to Ireland, whereas the Minister argues that he will only grant free travel to those with a pension.  I do not know why the Minister interprets it differently, but the European Commission said that were the Government to introduce free travel for all Irish citizens of a certain age living abroad, that would be in order.  The Court of Justice ruling quoted in the reply to Proinsias De Rossa fortified that argument.Rather than going over and back to the EU and leaving files piled high without any decision or effective action being taken, the Minister should now introduce a free travel scheme for all Irish citizens whether they live in Ireland or elsewhere.  I do not think he will have any difficulty from the Commission for doing so.

I must take account of what both institutions say.  As the Deputy is aware, I removed the peak time restrictions recently and in the coming period it will be possible to give full details on the expansion of the North-South travel.  We will then have sorted those two problems.I am as committed as the Deputy to trying to make progress on this issue.  I have had a number of meetings with Commissioners.  My officials have met their opposite numbers on many occasions.  There has been much protracted and heavy discussion about it and it keeps coming up.  I have a letter here from the Commission setting out the issue in black and white, including the European Court of Justice case.  It states that any action I take that is based on nationality alone will be challenged.  Free travel could be extended therefore to everybody in the European Union over the age of 66.  That is something I was not planning to contemplate given the huge numbers involved.  One answer to this question would have been for the European Community to proceed with its free travel pass many years ago.  That would have been a good solution but various countries pulled that apart and it did not get anywhere, which is a pity.I will continue to press every possible angle to ensure that our citizens in the United Kingdom are dealt with, not just those in receipt of pensions, although that would be a start.  I specifically put that proposal regarding those in receipt of pensions.  At one time I offered to change the legislation to make it a condition of an Irish pension that one would get free travel.  I even pointed out that it would be discriminatory for me not to give free travel to someone in receipt of an Irish pension in the UK, but that proposal was not accepted.  I then went back to the basics but if I put some measure in place for Irish citizens only, it will have no chance of standing the test of time so there is no point in going down that road.I will continue to search for every possible angle to address this issue.  I will take careful note of what the Deputy says to me today and promise him that within a couple of hours I will have it assessed by whatever legal brains are available.

He tells us every time that he is pressing the buttons but there is nothing he can do about it.  That, however, is no good to us.  What we need is action from the Minister on this issue.  He said he will raise another hare with the Commission and let the Commission chase it around for another six months before it comes to ground.  That is no use to the people about whom we are talking.It is important that the House realises the sort of people about whom we are talking.  We are talking about Irish people who went abroad, worked extremely hard and sent back a great deal of money to the rest of us who were at home.  They and their organisations believe there is a necessity for some recognition of that.  It is not about monetary value because there is very little monetary value involved, and I believe the Minister appreciates that.  It is a matter of recognising them and giving them somewhat of a salute for what they did for us.I ask the Minister to stop running to the Commission every time he wants to do something.  He should take a leaf out of the book of the French Government and Administration and do it.  He can then talk to the Commission.  I strongly suggest he should do that.  He should not run to the Attorney General either because he will give the Minister the most careful possible answer.  He should just do it and deal with the Commission subsequently.  It will be ten years before it catches up with any one pensioner.

#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	79	I propose to take Questions Nos. 108, 122, 151, 175, 196, 201 and 203 together.The package of reforms and initiatives aimed at supporting lone parents is based on the Government discussion paper Proposals for Supporting Lone Parents, which I launched in March this year.  The discussion paper sought to address the increased risk of social exclusion and poverty faced by lone parents and parents on low income.  It put forward proposals for the expanded availability of education and training opportunities for lone parents, the extension of the national employment action plan to focus on lone parents, focused provision of child care, an improved information service for lone parents and the introduction of a new social assistance payment for low income families with young children.Long-term welfare dependency in the case of a person of working age is not in the best interests of parents, their children or society in general.  Any new social assistance payment must have the long-term aim of assisting lone parents and parents on low incomes to achieve financial independence through supporting them to enter employment, as it is employment that offers one of the most important routes out of poverty.While conditions are being suggested for receipt of payment, it is proposed that supports will be offered in a structured and systematic manner to the persons concerned.  It is only in this context that continuing payment would be made conditional on engagement with the support services.The discussion paper suggests that activation measures would commence when the child reaches the age of five.  Concerns have been expressed in submissions and at meetings that this could exclude lone parents from accessing supports earlier should they so wish.  That matter is now being further examined.Activation, as referred to in the proposal, is positive in nature.  It encompasses interview-advice meetings and access to education and training, thus providing people with the skills to enable them to achieve financial independence and a better life for themselves and their children.  Activation supports will also be available to many older women at risk of poverty who are currently categorised as qualified adult dependants of husbands in receipt of social welfare income.I fully realise that a new form of payment cannot be introduced without co-ordinated supports and services being put in place by other Departments and agencies.  That is why the Government has instructed the senior officials group to draw up an implementation plan to progress the non-income recommendations in tandem with the development of the legislation required by my Department to introduce the new payment scheme.Work on the development of this implementation plan is under way.  Issues including access to child care support, education, training and activation measures and options for further research, all of which impact on the large number of recipients of the one parent family payment who are not working, will be considered.As soon as I am convinced that we have reached conclusions that are equitable, with a fully workable implementation strategy, it is my intention to bring forward proposals to the Dáil as soon as possible.  In the meantime, my officials continue to be in contact with the lone parents' representative groups for whose ongoing support I am grateful and whose views continue to feed into the development of the proposals.  I thank all those agencies concerned.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	80	I noted the Minister's response to the earlier priority question and sense from it — perhaps the Minister will agree — that it is unlikely the measures introduced on foot of this consultation process will be in place before either of the social welfare Bills that will follow the budget this year or before the general election.  In that case, will the Minister indicate the alternative measures he intends to put in place subject to a new payment being introduced?  Has he noted the pre-budget submission of the Combat Poverty Agency, which referred to changing the rates of child dependant allowance that have been frozen since 1994 as an interim measure?  In light of the consultation process and concerns that were expressed by lone parent groups such as One Family and OPEN about the possibility of a group of lone parents being worse off under the initial proposals, have changes been suggested and are they being accepted in that consultation process?  The fact that 40% of lone parents choose to remain at home with their children indicates a conscious decision on the part of many of them that the role they have chosen for themselves is to be actively involved in the upbringing of their children, and changes in the payment system may irredeemably affect that choice for lone parents in the future.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	81	As I said, it is my intention that we will have separate legislation on lone parent reforms.  That does not rule out the Minister for Finance making preparatory type changes in a budget, as he has done in recent budgets, by adjusting guidelines and limits, increasing amounts and putting in place a framework in anticipation of the legislation.  While it will be a specific Bill, the budgets and social welfare legislation will anticipate it and make the necessary preparation for it.  I intend, with the Minister for Finance in our discussions before the budget, to revisit the matter of the child dependant allowance.  I will examine whether this is the correct way in which to proceed.  In the past two budgets I was convinced that it was not and that we should reform the family income supplement and the child dependant allowance together and that we should continue to increase child benefit and the flow of funds to low-income families.  I will revisit the matter of the child dependant allowance as I prepare for the budget.Regarding the Deputy's worries that lone parents are worse off under new reforms, the initial financing figures show that the cost to the State increases in the first couple of years.  Assuming that the reforms are successful in the medium term the cost should decrease as lone parents opt to participate in employment.  I have no motive to hunt people out to work where they have chosen to be with their children.  That is not envisaged in these reforms.  Considering the profile of lone parents, the education attainment levels and the age cohort, it is not beneficial to the 80,000 people involved or to the country to deny these people access to education, training and employment in a structured way.At present, a child of a lone parent may reach 18 years of age before any arm of the State offers more education or a return to employment to the lone parent.  This matter is at the heart of these reforms, with the removal of the cohabitation rule.  The House will agree that the latter is old-fashioned social policy and has no part in modern Ireland.  It is not my intention that anyone be worse off after these reforms.  In the medium term, lone parents and the country will be better off if we take a sensible approach to helping these people, who are a resource for the country, to play a full role in the employment market if possible.

Compelling lone parents to undertake employment will not solve poverty problems.  No one wishes to live in poverty and the key area is the implementation plan.  When will it come about?  There is a need for a co-ordinated strategy and effective co-operation between all Departments.  Will we force people into low-paid employment?  Will necessary training be provided?  Will a child care package and flexibility in work be examined?  We can have all the grandiose views of today but the implementation plan is the key.  We have failed lone parents in the past and the worry is that we are about to fail them again.  Tinkering with the system will not work.  Compelling lone parents to go down a particular road is a major worry.  Does the Minister agree that lone parents should be given a choice to pursue education or employment?  No one wishes to remain in poverty but that is the situation in which most lone parents and their children live.

Senior officials in my Department, researchers and various bodies involved have been undertaking this study for more than three years.  I have picked up the ball and run with it in an effort to get it across the line.  I seek to distil the wisdom around me.  There is no financial agenda because I have received no letters from the Department of Finance instructing me to reduce the moneys spent on lone parents.  This initiative attempts to create better social policy.  No one seeks to compel people to work but if it was a member of our family we would prefer that he or she would speak to agencies about improving education, training and job opportunities.The reforms envisaged allow for a considerable period before any pressure is applied.  It is done substantially on a voluntary basis although pressure must be applied at some point.  However, this will not happen before many years' notice has been given.  This initiative is designed to assist people to enter employment or education and deal with the cohabitation rules.  In parallel, an implementation plan will address child care, flexible working hours and access to education and training.

Does he agree it is a disgrace that so many people are under so much pressure in this day and age?  Does he agree that the lack of affordable and accessible quality child care is the greatest barrier to work for lone parents?  Regarding the implementation plan and the senior officials group, when were the senior officials asked to formulate this plan?  When does the Minister expect to receive the completed plan?
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	85	For some months a group of officials have been working on the implementation plan.  It arose from our consultations with lone parent groups who made it clear that income was one aspect of the problem.  Aspects such as flexible working hours, child care and access to education and training, as mentioned by Deputy Crowe, should be addressed in tandem.  We committed to developing proposals and plans in those areas to complement changes made in legislation with regard to income.  Rapid progress is being made and we should have legislation, including an implementation plan, before the Houses in the coming months.  Deputy Stanton and I do not agree on this matter.  The country must make substantial changes in this area.  It is not a political issue and anyone who wishes to take a cheap shot and wreck these proposals can easily do so.  All one needs to do is to return to the shibboleths of the past.

Everyone here is being responsible about it but I am thinking in the context of the next election.  Dealing with these social issues in a political cauldron is most difficult.  It is easy to whip up fears.

I will try to introduce legislation in a few months.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	88	It was a very worthwhile attempt to explore a utopian solution but it has considerable limitations.  The age limit for children is the first of these.  I ask the Minister to examine the report produced by Camille Loftus for the One Parent Exchange and Network.  This excellent report exposed all of the limitations, particularly those relating to workplace flexibility, the availability of child care and the marginalisation of people who end up worse off.  People did become worse off.  Ms Loftus gave three or four examples which clearly indicated that this was the case.I wish to raise the case of a young girl I encountered who was a lone parent and returning to education.  I was given an assurance by the Minister in this House and I consider such an assurance to be equivalent to a solemn oath.  The Minister's predecessor, Deputy Coughlan, destroyed many schemes.  She was the worst ever Minister for Social and Family Affairs and tried to emasculate every scheme she got her hands on.  She increased the qualifying period of unemployment for the back to education allowance from six months to 15.  A number of spurious reasons were given for this decision, which was an attempt to implement the Thatcherite agenda of the former Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy.  However, that is another matter.  The current Minister for Social and Family Affairs reduced the period to 12 months but gave a solemn assurance on the floor of this House that because it would only cost a few million euro, the period would be reduced to nine months.I met the young girl in question in August.  She had come to the end of the nine-month period but no longer qualified for the scheme because she had not been unemployed for 12 months.  This young girl was ready to return to education, obtain a qualification that would be of some use to the country and improve her lot.  What the Minister has said is highfalutin nonsense.  It is great theory.  He is the Minister for reviews.  However, unless a review produces something positive for people, it is useless.  I recall the reference to the nine-month period in this House because I badgered the Minister in a possibly uncouth manner.  However, I was doing my job.

People can accuse me of being many things but I am not a fool.  I was extremely disappointed.  I knew the Minister made a commitment in this House but departmental officials insisted on the 12-month period.  The nine-month period applied to disadvantaged areas but I never knew about this and thought it applied across the spectrum.  Could the Minister furnish me with advice from departmental officials stating that the nine-month period operates across the country?

In respect of the clause Deputy Penrose is thinking of, we reduced the period to nine months but introduced a FÁS assessment so that FÁS would have a role in assessing the back to education requirement.

It now appears that the prevaricating democrats are in for a penny, in for a pound, with apparently another political hoax in the form of new ethics legislation that makes it all okay.  I would like to tell the Taoiseach directly that I hope this will be the last time we must raise these matters in this House.  I understand that both the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform have issued statements about the close and warm relationship that now exists between them and that they intend to see this Government either run its course or into the sand.  Seeing that it is a last gasp effort at propriety by the Progressive Democrats, perhaps the Taoiseach might take the opportunity to tie up the remaining loose ends that must be dealt with here?In respect of the questions that were not answered by the Taoiseach, does he now share the Tánaiste's assessment in the statement issued by him today that what he did was wrong?  The Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O'Malley, who gave a stooge-like performance for the Progressive Democrats this morning, reluctantly said that in his opinion, the Taoiseach was wrong.  In his statement, the Tánaiste said the Taoiseach's actions were wrong.  Is the Taoiseach prepared to say that what he did in 1993 was wrong?Can the Taoiseach give the House any new information used to pacify the Tánaiste about the attention paid to the Manchester payments, people he now knows were present at the function or whom he has discovered were present since last weekend?  Will he pass this information to the Mahon tribunal, as he said he would?  Some people claim that what took place in Manchester was an illusion and never happened.  Given that there were only three possible dates during the period from 1993 to 1994 when the football match in question could have taken place——

It was an error of judgment, notwithstanding the fact that my actions did not breach obligations.  It was open to construction and capable of misinterpretation, in some cases deliberately.  I regret having accepted the money at the time, notwithstanding the points I made about the circumstances.  I have nothing new to add to what I said last week.In respect of Deputy Kenny's second question, we have put forward proposals for changes in the ethics Act.  In respect of Deputy Kenny's third question, I have already stated that it was connected with a football match.  I cannot be precise about the date but I have tracked down some of the information.  I know I was in Manchester on six occasions that year.  I will give any information to the tribunal.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	99	When the Taoiseach states he has tracked down some of the information, does he mean he has tracked down some of the persons at the function and that he will pass on that information?Will the Taoiseach outline the new ethics which were arrived at between the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste?  How can one legislate for conscience, right and wrong and principle?  Will the Taoiseach state what is the new agreement?  Is it a case that if any Minister, such as the Minister for Education and Science, gets his or her house painted, he or she must ask the Standards in Public Office Commission whether it is all right?  Is the essence of the new ethics Bill that one must approach the Standards in Public Office Commission and ask whether an offer which has been received is all right?This matter apparently came from leaks from tribunals, which is a serious matter.  The Taoiseach has a close and friendly relationship with the Tánaiste who is sitting beside him.  Last Tuesday on the plinth of Leinster House, the Tánaiste stated many people in here will have a lot to answer for when the second report of the Moriarty tribunal is published.  The Moriarty tribunal has been sitting for nine years and a first report has not yet been published.  How does the Tánaiste know when the second report will be published?  Has he explained to the Taoiseach how he knows or pretends to know what is in the report?  It is a serious matter for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in his capacity as deputy leader of the Government.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	100	One of the issues which came out of this is that while we introduced an enormous amount of legislation, such as the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995, the Standards in Public Office Act 2001, the Electoral Act 1997 and the later electoral Act, it is still possible for somebody to receive a substantial gift from a friend or a loan and not declare it.  That point was made here and elsewhere on a number of occasions.  I made the point myself.The Tánaiste and I agreed to amend the ethics legislation to deal with the question of significant loans or gifts from friends.  Essentially what we have in mind, and what the Government approved in principle this morning, is that the views of the Standards in Public Office Commission will be sought where such gifts or loans arise.  In any such case, the commission will be required to give its opinion as to whether acceptance of a loan or gift would compromise an officeholder, Deputy or Senator in the discharge of his or her functions.  It would be an offence not to seek or comply with an opinion of the commission in these circumstances.  At present, that is not there.  Many people were surprised to find it was not there.  We will bring forward the legislation as quickly as we can to deal with this issue.Regarding how the Tánaiste knows the Moriarty tribunal will publish its second report in January, it is because I told this to the House approximately two weeks ago in reply to a question.  Nobody knows what it contains.

However, there is a surreal air about the House this afternoon from which we cannot walk away.  The situation over the past five or six days has seen headlines about the coalition on the brink and the Tánaiste in hiding or considering new information given to him during the weekend.  Independent Deputies are writing out their shopping lists.  Deputy Healy-Rae will not come alone and will also deliver Deputy Fox.  Deputy Cowley will deliver a larger group but not until after the general election.Then we are expected to believe from a press conference today that all this was made up by what the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, refers to in his extraordinary speech from the dock as a "small minority of commentators".  He states none of this ever happened.

There was no dispute.  I find this unbelievable and pathetic.  Did one ever in one's life read such patronising vainglorious nonsense?  Wait until the Ceann Comhairle hears this: "It would be an act of supreme moral and political folly to reward the wrongful actions of a leaker in this way."  This comes from a man who knows a thing or two about leaking.  "It would also amount to a failure of politics and statecraft——"

The Taoiseach and Tánaiste claimed they have drawn a line in the sand.  Have they done so?  When will we obtain answers to the outstanding questions?  The Tánaiste stated in black and white he wanted to know the identity of the donors, the mysterious money men at Manchester.  He stated he wanted to know the nature of the function.The Taoiseach told us it was an organised function, that he made a speech and that they were his friends.  He then told us it was not an organised function, he did not make a speech and he does not know who was present, apart from two people.  He told the authors of a book that he bought his house for £139,000 and he told the House it cost £180,000.  Did the Taoiseach have the particulars delivered to the Revenue Commissioners as he is required to do?Will the Taoiseach explain to the House why he volunteered the information that he had paid gift tax and capital gains tax?  Nobody asked him whether he did, but he stated he did.  Why and on what did he pay gift tax?  Will we receive answers to these questions or must we await the Taoiseach's appearance before the tribunal before we have any coherent statement which will bring this to an end?  How can the Tánaiste sit there having conferred approval on this activity, as compared to his statements and sentiments expressed in the past?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	108	Deputy Rabbitte asked three questions.  I do not have to comment on his comments on what was stated at the press conference today.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	110	I already gave as full information as I have about Manchester.  I answered the questions fully.  I paid £180,000 for my house.  I had a mortgage of £150,000 and £30,000 from my own accounts.  I put all of that information in the public domain.Regarding whether I paid this, that or the other tax, I am entitled to state what tax I paid.  It extraordinary that I am being asked during Leaders Questions why I paid gift tax or on what I paid capital gains tax.  If the House really wants to know and if it would make such an enormous difference to the House, it was when a policy I held moved from a mutual one to shares.  Like everyone else with a similar policy, I was given the calculated amount which was subject to capital gains tax.  Hundreds of thousands of others also paid it.  I paid gift tax on a matter which has nothing to do with the tribunal and one will not hear about it at the tribunal.  One must comply with the law and regulations.  If the only issue in the country today is my paying capital gains tax, or gift tax or how much I paid for my house, it is a sad day for this House.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	111	It is not the only issue at all, as the Taoiseach well knows.  The last time he told us about the mortgage it was €100,000; it is now €150,000.  The Taoiseach has made more changes to this story than a supermodel makes at a fashion show.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	112	There are no changes.  Keep to the facts.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	115	The Taoiseach said it was €100,00 the last day, another major change.  He came down the steps today with his Tánaiste beside him with a laughable, cobbled together, face saving legislative solution to a problem that ought not require legislation in the first place.  The Sunday Tribune showed last week that the Taoiseach was very good at raising money for political purposes in his constituency, he is perfectly legally entitled to do so and no one prevented him from doing so.  This, however, is about the use of money for private purposes.The Taoiseach came in today with this cobbled together solution that gets the Tánaiste off the hook.  If he is so interested in amending the Ethics in Public Office Act, why does he not introduce the amendment sought by the Standards in Public Offices Commission when it asked for the right to initiate investigations into this kind of thing?  Why does the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform concede that in the legislation he wrapped around himself?  When I said yesterday he would settle for a fig leaf, I did not think he would settle for one so miserable as this but apparently it is enough for him.What information was he given over the weekend?  What was it about?  Did Micheál Wall eat the dinner after all?  What is the new information?  It is an insult to this House for the Tánaiste to now emerge blinking into the light of day and pretend none of this happened and he is mesmerised as to why the entire news media were reporting that the Government was on the brink, would be sundered, the PDs could not live with it and all the rest.  It appears the PDs can live with anything after this.  We have not got the answers the Tánaiste said he wanted and, in so far as the Taoiseach is giving answers, they are changing from day to day.

I have put out all of the information.  By the way, I do not know anyone else's mortgage in this House.  If the issue here is to find out how much someone's mortgage is or who ate a dinner and who did not and who ate a sandwich instead, we should get real.  I have answered a level and depth of questions never answered by any Deputy in this House before.

I did not leak anything from the tribunal, the tribunal asked me questions about Mauritius, about whether I got €15 million from O'Callaghan and about a range of other things.  I gave my facts in answer to those questions and someone leaked those facts.  I do not know who did it or how but I must answer those issues.This is the level that the House gets into now, that I am asked my mortgage, why I paid capital gains tax — I answered that — why would I pay gift tax, was I at a function and did I have a private function, a Saturday night function, who ate the dinner, who drank the wine, who had water, who had Ballygowan.  That is what I am meant to answer.  Is that what I am to turn in here every day to do?

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	123	I do not care who had the water and who had the wine but I want to ask about another anniversary this year.  We had the 90th anniversary of the Easter Rising, where the Taoiseach took the salute in O'Connell Street, a very happy day for him.  It was also the 90th anniversary of the Prevention of Corruption Act 1916.  The Taoiseach mentioned earlier that he is doing away with much of the pre-Independence legislation but, fortunately, in 1928, Dáil Éireann updated that law and it was in force in 1993 and still is today.Last week I asked the Taoiseach to choose a course of action — to resign, to go to the country or to clean up politics.  Today he might try to say he has taken the last option.  This minimal face saving exercise with the Tánaiste, who appears to have regained Government but lost most of his party, is nothing more than that.  It is a face saving exercise but does it comply with the Prevention of Corruption Act 1916, which outlawed the giving or acceptance of any money, gift or consideration by and from anyone seeking a contract with the State.  The Act assumes that such gifts are corrupt unless the contrary is proven.  Can the Taoiseach assure the House that none of the individuals who attended the dinner in Manchester and none of the individuals who contributed to his whip-arounds were seeking Government contracts in the early 1990s?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	124	I can confirm that nobody in any way either lent me money or that anyone who was at a dinner to the best of my knowledge——

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	131	The Taoiseach might need to clarify that because he says it is as far as he knows.  I appreciate he may not have all the facts at his fingertips on that matter, I am simply putting the legal situation to him.  This is not just about the Taoiseach, the Prevention of Corruption Act is much bigger than any activity the Taoiseach was ever involved in, it goes back much longer and will be there long after him.Is the Taoiseach aware of the Transparency International report for 2006, a league table of perceptions of this country?  When the Taoiseach entered office in 1997, we were in 12th place in the corruption perception index.  The 2005 corruption perception index sees us slip to 19th place.  There is work to be done to reverse that perception.  Will the Taoiseach have a clear line, like that of the Green Party, on the unacceptability of any Oireachtas Member receiving gifts such as those the Taoiseach was given by prominent people, a line Mr. Justice McCracken has set down clearly?  As well as doing what the Taoiseach plans, which goes some way along the line, will he end the acceptance of corporate donations and set spending limits on electioneering between elections?  Will he show some leadership to his party, to Government and to other parties in this House that still continue to accept corporate donations?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	132	I have been responsible for most of the legislation in the last nine years.

The amendment we now have states no one can receive a substantial gift in any way from friends that could be linked with any perception that it is wrong and the Standards in Public Office Commission would have to arbitrate on that before anyone could accept it.  If it finds that it is not permissible, it is illegal to ignore that.  That is as strong as we can make it.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	137	"A Cheann Chomairle" — is iad sin na focail lena bhfuair chuile Theachta a bhí anseo sna 1980í cead labhairt sa Dáil.  We are here today to pay tribute to the best of men, the late Tom Fitzpatrick.  I know I speak for Deputies across the House when I say that Tom Fitzpatrick was one of Ireland's and nature's gentlemen.  He was a gentleman of politics, a man of great honour, integrity and dignity.  He was also a man of great purpose, principle and humanity, one who set, upheld and demanded the highest standards of public office.Each time Members meet in the House to pay tribute to a former colleague I am always struck by the fact that while we claim them as our own in Dáil Éireann, there is always a group of people in the Distinguished Visitors Gallery who miss a much loved husband, father, wife, brother, grandfather, uncle or friend.  Here today, while we can only offer them a few words in appreciation, I hope that in their hearts they will get some small comfort from what those words signify — our deep and abiding respect.It was Tom Fitzpatrick who, as my director of elections in a by-election in 1975 after my father's death, oversaw my journey to the Dáil for the first time.  On hearing the news of his death, it was not just deeply felt by his own family or the Fine Gael family but also by myself.  A figurehead had departed.When I first entered the Dáil, Tom Fitzpatrick was already a veteran TD who had represented the people of Cavan-Monaghan for ten years.  He was not in undistinguished company.  As some Members will recall, the constituency was established in 1977 and its first representatives to Dáil Éireann were John Wilson, Jimmy Leonard, the late John F. Conlon, the now late Tom Fitzpatrick and the current Ceann Comhairle, the last of a distinguished quintet to represent the people of Cavan-Monaghan.Tom Fitzpatrick will be remembered as a hardworking and excellent Senator, a Minister for Lands and Minister for Transport under Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave and an excellent Minister for Fisheries and Forestry under Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald in the first of his Administrations in 1981.  He also made a distinguished contribution to the Council of State from 1982 to 1987.  Ironically, or perhaps it is true to Tom's form, the Fianna Fáil Party, which was then in Opposition, has every cause to remember him very fondly in his role as Ceann Comhairle because he was utterly resolute and impartial to the extent that his innate and, dare I say, sometimes exasperating fairness was often the cause of very considerable frustration to the Fine Gael-Labour Government of the dayAs Ceann Comhairle, Tom Fitzpatrick welcomed the late President Ronald Reagan to the House on 4 June 1984, when he spoke of the huge role the United States played in terms of the social, historical, political and economic connections and, indeed, the psychology of the Irish people.  As he put it from the Chair: "For the Irish, it could with truth be said that America did, as the inscription for the Statue of Liberty proclaims, ‘Lift her lamp beside the golden door'."For all his kindness, humility and good humour, there were dark times too in Tom's personal life.  He was well acquainted with grief, losing both his first wife, Betty, and daughter, Fidelma.  All who knew him at that time were aware of the immense sadness he carried within him.  He then met Carmel and his friends, colleagues and wider family were delighted that, with her, he should have found obvious and lasting happiness.Today in Dáil Éireann, in remembering Tom Fitzpatrick, statesman, politician and Fine Gaeler, we, too, remember the friend and confidante that one would always want on one's side.  We can truly say this, with hands on our hearts and in a more special way the plain people of Cavan who were everything to Tom Fitzpatrick, the men and women of Ballyjamesduff and Butler's Bridge, Cootehill and Clover Hill who knew they could count on him to fight their corner and fight the good fight on their behalf.  Today, however, is largely about those who knew him best and miss him most, his family.  On behalf of the Fine Gael Party, I offer my sincere sympathy to Carmel, to Tom's daughter, Geraldine Madigan, and his son and namesake, Tom, who are all with us here today.  I do likewise to his brother, John Brendan, who cannot be here.  In the little group in the Distinguished Visitors Gallery are Tom's extended family, Katie, his son Tom's wife, Geraldine's husband, Colm Madigan, and their children, Emma, Lucy, Edward and Susan.  The children of the late Fidelma, Caroline and Denis Dwyer, are here too to hear these tributes to their grandfather.  Today, you can be proud of him as you value him and miss him.Paddy Kavanagh's, The Call, is a fitting tribute:Did you call meOr was it the windOn my ill-carpentered window?I am awake nowAnd all your prophecyIs turned to dust.Go ndéanfaidh Dia trócaire ar a anam dílis.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	138	On behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party and on my own behalf, I extend our deepest sympathies to Deputy Kenny and the Fine Gael Party on the death of Tom Fitzpatrick.  In particular, my party and I wish to join Deputy Kenny in extending our sympathy to Carmel and Geraldine, Tom's son, Tom, his brother, John, his extended family and all his friends back in his native home.Tom was a very well respected and senior Member of this House.  In recent years, I had the opportunity of meeting him when he came back for former Members' occasions.  He was a good attender and whenever he could he would come back to those occasions, which was much appreciated by all our parliamentary colleagues from the past.Tom was born in Scotshouse in Clones in February 1918 and educated in St. Macartan's College, the Incorporated Law Society and UCD.  He was a very bright and talented individual and took second place in the country in his examinations as a solicitor.  In his political activity, he was a member of Cavan UDC and Cavan VEC for a long, extended time and was elected to the Seanad and then the Dáil where he held his seat in every election until he retired at the end of the 1980s.As Deputy Kenny said, Tom had a career in many ministerial posts, including lands, transport, fisheries and forestry and we all remember his period as Ceann Comhairle.  He also showed his vast experience because if one adds in his portfolios in defence, health, social welfare, justice and the environment in his days in Opposition, he covered almost the full ambit of responsibilities a Member can have.  That shows the depth of his intellect, parliamentary knowledge and experience and the service he was able to give to his constituency and the wider country.The factual account of a long and distinguished career does not convey the regard in which he was held both as a wise and respected voice within his own party and as a very well regarded Ceann Comhairle of the whole House.  Tom was a gentleman and very able man who was always easy to talk to and always prepared to give a view and advice.  As Deputy Kenny wrote of him at the weekend, he possessed a sharp intelligence and steely determination in support of his cause.  Like all good representatives in this House, he served the people of his constituency — Cavan-Monaghan — with diligence and integrity for almost 40 years, both locally and nationally.  This is a huge commitment from one's life.  He was personally and politically warmly regarded on all sides of the House and while he was of an opposing party, we on this side respected him highly.I remember well when I entered the House as a Government backbencher with a large majority that Tom was a member of the Front Bench who always came into the House with a copy of Standing Orders and the decisions of the House.  The Ceann Comhairle will recall, as he knew Tom very well, that he was absolutely determined that whatever happened, one could only follow what was in Standing Orders and the judgments of the House.  He fought strongly in order that the laws and their interpretation were not there to be moved.  He fought those in opposition for his party and when he became Ceann Comhairle, he scrupulously upheld them.  His example should be followed by this generation of politicians.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	140	He held those faithfully and would lecture us on that from the benches opposite or the Ceann Comhairle's seat.  He firmly held the view that precedents were important and that there should be respect for Parliament and positions.  He fought for that and with his sharp legal mind he was able to use those standing orders eloquently.As Whip for Government and Opposition I was lucky enough to go on a number of overseas visits which he led as Ceann Comhairle on behalf of this House.  He always excelled on these occasions.  I visited the United States and many other countries and parliaments with him and he always put the case for this country, for parliamentary democracy and our political process in a forthright way.  With him I met George Bush Snr. to put forward how we deal with our business in this House and this democracy, and I held him in high regard for all that.As Deputy Kenny said, while we remember him as a parliamentary colleague, we extend our sympathies to his close family and friends.  On behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party, I extend our sympathy to his wife Carmel, his daughter Geraldine, his son Tom, his brother John and all his extended family.  I thank them for being here today.  He was a great person, politician and friend, and it was an honour to serve in this House with him.  I held him in great regard and respect and thanked him many times for the encouragement he gave me, some of which he offered in recent times.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	141	On behalf of the Labour Party, I join Deputy Kenny in commemorating the memory of Mr. Tom Fitzpatrick and extending our sympathy to the Fine Gael family and in particular to Tom Fitzpatrick's immediate family.  He reached a venerable age, but that does not make one's passing easier.  As the Taoiseach said, he had a long service as a public representative.  He was regarded as a wise public representative dedicated to public service.  I never heard anybody on either side of the House complain about his distinguished period in the chair, when he was regarded as fair and impartial.  I met him recently at a former Members' function here and he was still able to offer his opinion, of some value, on current issues.  His service is greatly appreciated in this House and his constituency.  On behalf of the Labour Party I am pleased to join leaders of other parties in offering our sincere sympathy to his wife, daughter and son and his extended family on this sad occasion.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	142	Deputy Kenny has described Mr. Tom Fitzpatrick as one of nature's gentlemen and, from my first meetings with him when I was in Fine Gael and on every occasion since, I regarded him as belonging to that category.  In his oratorical skills from the backs of lorries in places such as Bailieborough, there was a fierce and combative side to him, but in this House, where I first encountered him, I thought he was like a kindly uncle, always with a smile on his face and always decent to younger people in the political system.When I was elected to this House in 1987 he was just finishing his career in the House.  He was a senior Member of this House and always displayed charm, integrity and decency.  I am glad he held so many ministerial offices and that of Ceann Comhairle.  He discharged all his offices and his role as a representative for the people of Cavan and Monaghan with dignity, decency and compassion.  When he entered this House he was a fierce champion of the causes he believed in but never with malice and always with honesty.  We were privileged to know him, to be served and presided over by him.  Today it is an honour to be able to pay tribute to him.  For his family it is a sad occasion but also one of which they can be fiercely proud.  Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam uasal.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	143	On my own behalf and on behalf of the Green Party, Comhaontas Glas, I pay respect to the venerable memory of Mr. Tom Fitzpatrick.  Tom Fitzpatrick will be remembered as a great Clones man, a great family man, a great legal man, a great statesman and a great Irishman.  Ní raibh aithne rómhaith agam air, cé go raibh clú agus cáil air i gcónaí mar iar-Cheann Comhairle, chomh maith le polaiteoir le blianta fada.  Ba mhaith liom mo chomhbhrón a chur in iúl dá bhean chéile uasal, Carmel, dá chlann, dá chairde go léir agus don Teachta Kenny, ceannaire Fhine Gael, agus don pháirtí.

It is interesting people speak of the Cavan-Monaghan constituency and of Tom's association with the area of Scotshouse in Clones, but I think in the minds of many people throughout the length and breadth of the country, his association primarily would have been with the county of Cavan, not the county of his birth, as he represented Cavan as a single stand-alone constituency before the coming together of Cavan and Monaghan some years into his service in political life.A native of Scotshouse, County Monaghan, as the Taoiseach indicated, he had his second level education at St. Macartan's college in Monaghan town.  For 24 years he was a Member of this House, having previously served in the Seanad for four years.  He served on Cavan Town Council, County Cavan VEC and many other local authority and other bodies in the service of his community and adopted county.I had the privilege to engage with Tom Fitzpatrick on a number of occasions.  During the election contests of the 1980s I had the opportunity to meet and get to know him in a small and quiet way and he impressed me.  As other speakers said, he was a gentleman not only in my eyes but, I believe, in the eyes of anybody who had the honour and privilege of engaging with him and getting to know him a little.  That would have been enough to confirm that fact.  While we held different views on many issues, I say without hesitation that his life was spent in service to his party, constituency and country.  That can never be contested.On my behalf and that of the Sinn Féin Deputies, I convey to his wife, Carmel, his son, Thomas, his daughter, Geraldine, his brother, John Brendan — who cannot be present and who I have also had the pleasure of meeting and knowing in the past — and the other members of the extended Fitzpatrick family our sincere sympathy on their very personal bereavement.  I wish to adjoin to that my sympathy to the Fine Gael colleagues of the late Tom Fitzpatrick in the Dáil and Seanad — he served in both — and to those in the Fine Gael organisation in Cavan and Monaghan who have lost someone who was clearly an important and guiding influence over many years.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	145	I join other Members in paying tribute to the memory of the late Tom Fitzpatrick.  As stated by previous speakers, Tom Fitzpatrick served with great distinction as a member and chairman of Cavan Urban District Council and as a member and vice chairman of County Cavan VEC.  As a member of the Seanad and the Dáil, he worked extremely hard and with great diligence on behalf of his constituents in Cavan-Monaghan and, for one Dáil period, part of north Meath.Having served in government twice in a number of different Departments and as Ceann Comhairle, he rightly earned the respect of the entire membership of the House and the respect of the public.  The clear evidence of the esteem in which Tom Fitzpatrick was held by his constituents was the excellent votes he secured at successive general elections during the period in which he served in the House, namely, 1965 to 1989.  Tom Fitzpatrick was a committed member of many local voluntary organisations in the Cavan area.  In latter years, it was always a pleasure for me to meet him and discuss issues of local and national importance.To his wife, Carmel, his son, Tom, his daughter, Geraldine, his brother, John Brendan, and his extended family, I offer my sincere sympathy.  Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam uasal dílis.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	146	Tom Fitzpatrick was a decent, honourable man who was respected by all who had the privilege to know him.  He served his people for many years as a solicitor in Cavan and then as Member of the Oireachtas from 1961 to 1989 with honesty and distinction.  He never forgot those who helped and supported him along the way and right up to his death he always highlighted how much he appreciated their friendship and support.  Tom was one of the people who encouraged me to become involved in politics and I appreciated his advice and support.  He set a high standard from which all Members of the House could learn.Tom was not only a good politician, he was a man of strong faith.  We thank God for what he achieved as a Deputy, Minister, Ceann Comhairle and, above all, as a family man and servant of his people and his nation.  Of all of this, he was very proud.  As already stated, Tom was not just involved in politics.  He had a great interest in the arts and in the community in general.  He served at local level through his chairmanship of the then Cavan Urban District Council and Cavan VEC.To his wife, Carmel, children, Geraldine and Tom, brother, John Brendan — who for many years was chairman of Monaghan County Council — grandchildren and extended family, I pass on my sympathy and that of the Fine Gael Party in Cavan-Monaghan and all his friends.  I am sure he is smiling down on us because I have no doubt about where he now resides.

Tom was a Monaghan man but he became an adopted Cavan man and represented the county with great distinction for 28 years.  His impressive CV was well outlined by Deputy Kenny.  As previous speakers indicated, Tom was a gentleman and always displayed kindness and respect.  He had no political enemies and it says a great deal for someone who spent so long in politics that he was held in such high esteem.I did not know Tom in earlier life and it was only when I became a Member of the House that it came to my attention that he and his wife, Carmel, visited the Oireachtas on many occasions.  It was only six weeks prior to his death that he last visited the Houses and I saw him here on at least three occasions during the year.On my behalf and that of my Independent colleagues, I offer my deepest sympathy to the members of the Fitzpatrick family, Carmel, Thomas, Geraldine and John Brendan, who is not present.

#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	148	I also wish to be associated with the tributes being paid to my former constituency colleague and one of my illustrious predecessors as Ceann Comhairle, Tom Fitzpatrick.  Tom held high office on many occasions and served this House and his country with distinction.  On 7 April 1965, he took a seat in Dáil Éireann which he successfully retained until 1989 when he retired from national politics.  Following the general election in November 1982, Tom was elected to the office of Ceann Comhairle.  The task of being Ceann Comhairle is never easy.  It calls for patience, skill and a thorough knowledge and understanding of parliamentary practice and procedure.  All of these qualities Tom had in abundance.  His wish to uphold the dignity and traditions of the House and to be fair and courteous to each Member was appreciated by all.  Many of his wise rulings are still in use.  Tom performed his duties as Ceann Comhairle in exemplary fashion and made an invaluable contribution to upholding the dignity and decorum of the House.Tom served with distinction in both local and national politics and commanded wide respect not only in Fine Gael, but also in the wider political arena.  He was an excellent parliamentarian and was one of the best orators of his time.  He was also a distinguished member of the legal profession.  Tom worked tirelessly for the people of Cavan and Monaghan and built up many friendships, both inside and outside politics.  I had the honour of serving with him on behalf of the people of Cavan and Monaghan for many years.I extend my sincere sympathy to his wife, Carmel, his children, Geraldine and Thomas, and his brother, John Brendan.

I have spoken to Deputy Timmins, a former member of the Defence Forces who has served overseas.  It may be appropriate, given what may come down the line regarding North Korea, the Irish experience in Liberia and possibly elsewhere, to provide for a short debate on this important issue.  While the Fine Gael Party and I support the measure, given the Minister's comments it may be appropriate to allocate 30 minutes to this subject.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	163	As for No. 10, it is proposed to refer this motion without debate to the committee.  The proposal to send Irish troops to Lebanon is such an important issue that as part of the triple lock, this House should debate it for some time.  Moreover, the situation is compounded because not alone is the motion being referred to the committee without debate, it is proposed to return the motion to the House on Thursday without the possibility of debate at that time either.  The Chief Whip has ordained that there can be no debate when the matter comes back from the committee to the House.  In many ways, this pre-empts a possible decision of the committee and it would be better to clarify the matter now.  Perhaps the Taoiseach will give some indication of a period of time for debate in this House.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	164	The Green Party cannot agree to this proposal, as any motion to send troops abroad should be debated in this House.  This mission to Lebanon is not without risk and could be one of our more dangerous missions.  While the Taoiseach might argue that it is not a chapter 7 mission, Condoleezza Rice noted that Resolution 1701 has chapter 7 powers in all but name.  Consequently, this matter should be debated in this House.

Any proposition pertaining to service overseas of the Irish Defence Forces should be debated in the full Chamber, not referred to committee without debate in the first instance.  The import of Irish troops serving overseas is such that it deserves such attention in this House.  In this specific instance, in which service in the Lebanon is under consideration once again, particularly against the backdrop of Israeli actions during the summer in which UN personnel suffered losses, Members must see the gravity of the situation to which Defence Force members are being sent.  It is important and I concur with previous speakers that time should be afforded for a proper debate in this Chamber on all that is entailed in this proposition.  I join with other Members in urging the Taoiseach to accede to this request.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	166	I accept the point made by Deputy Kenny.  If the Whips can consider the matter, we can have the debate first or afterwards — I do not mind.  I will give a commitment to have a debate.  The Government Whip should talk to the Minister for Defence.  The debate can be held before the motion goes to committee or we can allow it go to the committee and have the debate on its return, depending on what is agreed to by the Whips.  I agree with the principle of a debate.

Has the Order of Business been amended in order that there will be a debate in the House on No. 10, subject to the agreement of the Whips, either this evening or, in all probability, after the committee has debated the matter?

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	171	Members have asked for a debate in the House, one way or another.

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	173	It is not agreed.  For such an important issue, the Green Party has been allocated five minutes to make a contribution on a Green Paper which will have an impact, good or bad or most likely indifferent, as it does not rise to the challenges we face.  It is completely unrealistic to try to pass it off with a five minute contribution and does not take into account the seriousness of the issue.  This is an issue that must engage all of society at every level, as well as every single person, particularly the Government, which has a leadership role to play.  It does not deal, for example, with the transport issue, the biggest challenge we have, or the planning issue which is giving rise to that challenge.  If we are to take this issue seriously, we need much more time than that allotted by the Government.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	174	I wish to speak briefly about the same issue.  A great deal of work has been done by the Government in the preparation of the Green Paper.  Comments made on the floor of the House carry more weight than the issuing of press releases or participation in seminars, etc.  Can I suggest, without disrupting the Order of Business, that the House leave the proposed energy debate open?  Members should be able to return to the debate on another occasion after today's debate adjourns.  I suspect that many Deputies on all sides of the House want to participate in it.  Can it be left open?  After all, it is on a Green Paper rather than on a legislative measure.  I sincerely ask——

We have had some political rows about political issues in recent weeks.  As the Head of Government, the Taoiseach will join the Tánaiste in travelling to Scotland tomorrow to attend an important series of meetings aimed at bringing the parties together to reach agreement on the restoration of the Stormont Assembly and the fulfilment of the Good Friday Agreement.  We support strongly the efforts which the Taoiseach will make at the meetings in Scotland.  Our good wishes are not only with him, as the Irish Prime Minister, but also with the British Prime Minister during what will be his last major attempt to sort this out.  I hope the parties will understand the importance of the occasion and act accordingly.  I hope further conclusions will be reached by Friday in order that the Assembly can restart.  I wanted to say that now because the Taoiseach will not be here tomorrow morning.I would like to comment on the extraordinary circumstances which have followed the Government's decision to float Aer Lingus.  I refer to the serious bid made for the acquisition of the airline.  Will time be allocated next week for a discussion in the House?  Will Members be able to express their views on the situation as it has evolved to date and will evolve over the weekend?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	180	I thank the Deputy for his comments on Northern Ireland.  I would like to give some thought to the other issue because a number of legal and stock market considerations arise from it.  We will examine the suggestion made.  The Minister is severely constrained in what he can say.  We will try to construct a debate or discussion that does not create any difficulty.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	181	I wish the Taoiseach, his Ministers and advisers well tomorrow.  This is an especially critical week in the search for an accord in Northern Ireland.  As I understand it, the two Governments are determined to adhere to the stated deadline of 24 November.  The discussions in Scotland between now and Friday afternoon which are taking place in a good environment are absolutely critical.  All that can be done by Members on this side of the House is to offer the Taoiseach and his colleagues our full support and best wishes for success in their endeavours on this important issue.Let me ask about the legislation announced by the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste today.  What will it be called?  When will we see it?  Who is sponsoring it?  Will it deal with the issue I raised during Leaders' Questions?  The Standards in Public Office Commission recommended two years ago that it should have the power to initiate investigations into matters of this nature.  Will the Bill announced today come before the House before the general election?  I presume it will.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	189	The Government will give priority to the legislation in question which will amend the Standards in Public Office Act 2001.  The Minister for Finance and his officials will have responsibility for the legislation which will deal with the question of significant loans or gifts from friends which do not have to be recorded at present.  That is the key issue on which the Tánaiste and I have agreed.  If the Department of Finance wants to include any other matters in the legislation, it can do so.  We have agreed to provide for that measure and no other.

Given that the Ombudsman for Children is about to speak and take questions at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Child Protection, I would like to know whether progress can be made with the legislation putting in place a register of persons who are considered to be unsafe to work with children.  I realise that many issues will arise in Scotland, but apparently this is one of the ones that has led to the impasse which has been a feature of Northern politics for so long.  Regardless of whatever else is achieved by the Taoiseach during the forthcoming talks, I expect he will be able to bring home some good news on that front.  I am certain the Ombudsman for Children wants progress to be made with the legislation in question.I would like to ask about legislation that my colleague, Deputy Gormley, the Green Party's spokesman on health, has called for in this House on many occasions.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	199	The register of persons considered unsafe to work with children is an issue being considered by the North-South Ministerial Council.  The development of the register will depend on what happens with the Council in the forthcoming period.  The work has concentrated on developing procedures whereby convictions can be vetted through the vetting unit.  The development of the register will give rise to a range of legal, policy, practical and implementation issues.  We are not yet in a position to proceed with the North-South aspect of the register.When I was asked last week about the alcohol products Bill, I said voluntary agreements had been reached with the alcohol and advertising industries.  I informed the House that the Department of Health and Children had chosen to postpone the introduction of the legislation pending the outcome of the voluntary agreements.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	229	I thank the Whips for organising this debate so soon after the publication of the Green Paper.  I think it is important that we have such a discussion in this House and perhaps, towards the end of the consultation period, it may be opportune to discuss the matter further.  There have been many policy papers and a great deal of analysis of the Irish energy sector in recent years.  Following consultation, the Government published a Green Paper on sustainable energy in 1999 which set out the framework for sustainable energy strategies.  This framework has served as a solid basis for energy policy, notably regarding renewables.  Seven years on, there have been significant worldwide developments in energy.  The Government's new Green Paper sets out the energy challenges in light of those developments.  The Green Paper is set against a global and EU backdrop of high energy demand, volatile oil and gas prices and environmental challenges.  It is also set in the context of the specific challenges facing Irish energy policy.The Government attaches the highest significance to energy policy.  There is almost no other policy area which is so fundamental to the economy and society.  We have crucial decisions to make in terms of energy policy options for the country into the future.  The new energy policy framework will meet the national goals of ensuring safe and secure energy supplies, a sustainable energy future and competitive markets for Irish consumers and business.  Previously held assumptions about security of supply and costs must now be seriously challenged.  Those challenges are being confronted globally and by the European Union, as well as by Ireland.  Addressing these challenges requires an integrated approach across Government.  Cohesive thinking by Departments and agencies will be the hallmark of energy policy from here on, as outlined in the Green Paper.The Green Paper underlines the imperative for energy policy to address the three pillars of energy policy in a fully integrated way.  Those three pillars — security of supply, sustainability and competitiveness — are mutually reinforcing.  It is in that context that we have set out the vision for 2020.  By 2020, Ireland will have met the challenge of security of energy supply through integration and interconnection, a diverse fuel supply regime, world class energy storage facilities, enhanced infrastructure and robust emergency planning and expanded oil and gas strategic reserves.More integration and interconnection with other markets is crucial.  This will deliver increased security of supply as well as positive competitive effects for the benefit of consumers.  It will also support the renewable energy agenda.  There will be enhanced electricity interconnection with Northern Ireland and the development of a new electricity interconnector.  Further interconnection, possibly with the European mainland, will be under way or in place by 2020.  This will add to our security of supply while increasing our competitiveness.  The all-island energy market project is the logical first step towards creating a regional market with Britain and in due course with Europe.The single electricity market will be completed in 2007.  It will have the capacity to deliver the conditions needed to promote an efficient and secure electricity market that contributes positively to competitiveness and it will also boost our security of supply.  Increasing our fuel diversity is another way to ensure security of supply.  Long-term high dependency on piped natural gas from distant suppliers will result in increased exposure to price volatility and interruption of supply.  We have already witnessed a period of sustained global price increases for oil and gas and we are currently witnessing a period of volatility, with prices seesawing on the global market.By 2020, a much changed fuel mix in our electricity, transport and other sectors should be the norm.  To achieve this, key actions will include using clean-coal technology, co-firing peat with biomass and significantly expanding renewable energy production to reach the 30% target.  Renewable energy is a key to sustainability and we have emphasised it in terms of meeting our environmental obligations, which is extremely important.  Renewable energy is also a key to ensuring future security of supply.  We must tackle energy demand itself through systematic energy efficiency strategies.The Green Paper envisages an ambitious target of having 30% of electricity produced by renewable energy by 2020.  There has been a fair amount of comment on this target.  Some believe it is too conservative while others argue about the significant technical and competitive cost challenges it will pose.  However, I believe we struck the right balance and have set the bar high.  We are backing up realistic ambition with concrete measures.One feature of the Green Paper which has not been subject to much comment is the fact that instead of allowing a full 30-year period to pass before we produce another Green Paper, White Paper or policy document on energy, we will be able to review the existing Green Paper, White Paper or policy document every five years.  If targets need to be changed or increased because of significant technological advances in some of the areas we are outlining, this can and will be done.There is a distinct possibility of our being able to raise targets in the area of ocean energy technology.  It is the stated aim of the Government to ensure the best commercial ocean energy technology will be Irish.  Our ocean energy strategy is aimed at positioning us at the cutting edge of development in this area.Biofuels and biomass will play a major role by 2020.  This is underpinned by the new bioenergy strategy which is being led by the ministerial task force.  Through greater energy efficiency, individuals and businesses have the power to contribute to the 2020 vision.  This will mean a change in behaviour and attitudes to achieve a 20% reduction in energy demand by 2020, as outlined in the Green Paper.I recently launched the national energy efficiency campaign, Power of One, which will extend well beyond encouraging behavioural change.  It is a multifaceted campaign.  Setting higher standards, regulating for change and, where necessary, incentivising such change will be part of the agenda to secure increased energy efficiency.  The campaign will also target individual sectors.  I and other Members believe very strongly that the public sector, for example, must set the pace and lead by example.  The national priority being afforded to energy efficiency is in line with EU policy in this area.On research and development, by 2020 we will see a vibrant Irish energy research sector and a significantly ramped-up energy research capability.  That research capability will reflect an energy research policy aligned with wider energy and sectoral policies.  Our energy research effort will be strongly focused on the renewables areas as well as innovative approaches to infrastructure and grid challenges.  This is fully reflected in the Government's Strategy for Science Technology and Innovation 2006-2013.We need a stable and transparent, regulatory and investment market framework underpinned by infrastructure technology.  This will enable the energy sector to be competitive and support a high-growth economy and inclusive society.  High global energy costs are now a fact of life.  The current volatility in oil and gas prices does not herald a long-term return to low prices, as underlined by recent decisions by OPEC.  A large proportion of the higher prices experienced in Ireland is currently explicable by our fuel mix and the existing structural constraints of the market, including its size and the fact we are not interconnected.  The current volatility does not help medium-term to long-term planning either.These factors limit our ability to manage or mitigate future energy price increases.  Our focus in the Green Paper, therefore, must be on addressing controllable costs.  One option for dealing with controllable costs relates to the funding of strategic energy infrastructure.  The scope for funding strategic energy infrastructure initiatives in the national development plan is highlighted as an issue for consideration in the Green Paper.  I will be interested in the views of Deputies thereon.By 2020, the Irish energy market must be characterised by its having a number of players and a light-handed regulatory regime.  We commissioned Deloitte & Touche, in the context of preparing the Green Paper, to undertake a review of the electricity sector to provide us with comprehensive, in-depth analysis of institutional arrangements and market structures.  Its report was published at the same time as the Green Paper.  Deloitte & Touche confirmed that the size of the Irish market is a significant factor, as is the perceived and actual dominance of ESB arising from its ownership of a large and diverse portfolio of plant and from its ability to set prices.  The report states that, without changing the current structure, we will continue to face difficulties in attracting new entrants to develop competition and choice for consumers.  The market will evolve slowly without competitive downward pressure on prices.  As I made clear at the launch of the Green Paper, this scenario is not in the interest of market players or consumers, nor is it in the interest of the ESB.  It is certainly not in the interest of economic competitiveness.The Deloitte & Touche report is a useful contribution to the energy debate and provides much useful analysis of the electricity sector.  It informed the Green Paper and was of great help in this regard.  It makes a number of specific recommendations, one of which is to fragment the ESB.  The Government recognises the fundamental role played by the ESB in economic and social development and the strategic value of maintaining it as a strong and commercially viable company, particularly in the context I have outlined.  The Government does not favour the fragmentation of the ESB for the very simple reason that it would not reduce prices and could endanger security of supply and economic competitiveness.  Deloitte & Touche acknowledges that the creation of a number of smaller companies from the existing ESB would take very substantial time and resources.  It would also, it has to be said, be costly.However, significant investment in power generation is needed.  This presents us with the opportunity to break out of the current cycle and deliver more competition, more innovation and more choice.  Structural reform is necessary in the interests of the market, the consumer and the ESB, and we intend to deliver that reform.  The need for rationalisation of the ESB power generation portfolio is part of that window of opportunity.  We need a radical repositioning of ESB power generation in its own interest and in support of a competitive electricity market.  The introduction of a single all-island electricity market next year is a key context.Increased competition in generation will act as a catalyst for improvements in operation and maintenance costs, productivity, availability, flexibility and innovation.  The Green Paper suggests the creation of a landbank, giving access to suitable generation sites in Ireland for new entrants.  This would remove a significant barrier to new entry and has been used successfully elsewhere to encourage new entry.  The Deloitte & Touche report laid considerable emphasis on the benefits of such an approach and I agree with it.  I have already had initial discussions with ESB and CER.  The Irish market is not very attractive for someone coming in to try to put a power generation plant on a greenfield site, where the extra costs involved in strengthening a grid would be prohibitive.  That is why the use of the landbank and its availability for new entrants to the market is crucially important.The launch of the Green Paper opens a two-month period of consultation.  It is a tight timeframe but we intend to use the interval productively — including direct dialogue with all key stakeholders.  Informed by the outcome of the consultation process, we will finalise the energy White Paper early in the new year.The policy choices and targets set out in the Green Paper provide a coherent basis on which to position the Irish energy sector.  I believe that we have set ambitious aspirations, which will be underpinned by concrete action.  We will build in regular review and benchmarking to take account of developments over the years ahead.  By 2020, Ireland will be a sustainable, secure, efficient, affordable and competitive all-island energy market, supporting environmental, economic and social policy objectives.  The market will have secure and reliable supplies, competitive prices and more diverse energy sources underpinned by robust interconnection, optimum infrastructure and ambitious technology investment.The Green Paper is a proposed blueprint for building that sustainable energy future and I commend it to the House.

We could have done with this a year ago.  It would have been useful to have had it in the public arena.  We should have had the opportunity to put proposals to the Minister, to ensure that as we proceed into the future, energy supplies would be soundly based, incorporating security of supply and the need to serve the customer in a competitive, reliable and cost-effective manner.The Green Paper is vague in certain areas.  While I know this is just a discussion document, any debate of this nature should entail some degree of costings.  Members on this side of the House who had to produce policy in this area, had to review the dangerous area of costings in order to maintain some degree of reality, and that was worthwhile.  There are some matters that should be touched upon in this debate, which have not been covered.  The experience we have had so far as regards regulation has not been a happy one from the viewpoint of either industrial or domestic consumers.  That is a sad fact of life which needs to be addressed.  It is not addressed in the Green Paper and neither is it likely to be unless some major changes occur.All the emphasis, for example, seems to be on driving prices upward in order to make it attractive for more people to enter the marketplace.  What is actually needed, as referred to elsewhere in the Minister's speech, is real investment in research and development which in turn will bring to the market the required expertise, as well as a manufacturing and processing capacity that will be cost-effective and competitive.  If we proceed as we have done in the past year or so, it will augur poorly for policy in the future in this particular area.  I must emphasise, as will others, the absolute importance of energy at this juncture, for two reasons.  First, we have a heavy energy requirement at present, which is likely to increase dramatically as time goes on.  More important,  however, if we are to be serious players in providing alternative energy in our economy, then we must take the investment route now, as a matter of urgency.  We must bring together the various Departments that have an input and have them singing from the one hymn sheet — not like the nonsense we have had in the past year as regards the phasing out of the sugar industry, where those being forced out could only receive compensation provided they did not grow sugarbeet which might be used for alternative fuel purposes.  That is not how we shouldproceed.The Minister needs to drive his ministerial colleagues along the right course.  I know the pursuit of alternative energy is Government policy at present, although sadly, the initiative came from the Opposition.  I agree with what the Minister has to say as regards the national development plan.  It is a positive step, since the energy providers will be major players in the industrial sector and this must be incorporated in the national development plan.  It must be brought forward at the same time to avoid a serious problem in the future.I am not so certain about the effectiveness of the landbanks.  The only way to introduce proper competition in the marketplace is to encourage those who have a tendency, interest and willingness to go the route of alternative energy, and who are doing so, albeit on their own to a great extent.  The way forward is to encourage them, providing them with the necessary scientific backup and research and development right across the board to ensure they can get into the marketplace much more easily than at present.  There is some practicality, however, in the landbanks initiative, in that they are adjacent to existing installations and obviously will be readily convertible from the point of view of gaining access to the grid, etc.We are all agreed on one issue, namely, that the break-up or fragmentation of the ESB is debatable.  Some pundits are in favour and others are not.  Personally I believe it could be dangerous.  We have seen, for example, the way deregulation or the lack of regulation has worked in other areas in recent times.  The vulnerability of the economy in a vital utility sector must be borne in mind in this regard.  The grid should be totally independent of the ESB, however.  A move has been made in that direction, but I am not sure it has been progressed to the extent it should be.  There is only one rider. It should remain within the State or semi-State sector.  We must learn from our mistakes such as the sale of Eircom and perhaps others.  We must introduce new measures to prevent the continuation of a monopoly.  However, in order the protect the consumer — industrial or domestic — we should add the rider that within the marketplace there must be a major player to ensure some part of the infrastructure will remain within State control and cannot be used for monopolistic purposes.  We would then have the benefit of both ideologies.  We would have a free moving private sector feeding into the grid and a national controlling interest provided through ownership of the grid.The grid and how it operates will be important issues in the future.  Ready and inexpensive access will be hugely important.  For example, there would be no sense in allowing delays in accessing the grid for companies providing alternative energy supplies.  The integrity of the grid is another crucial issue, on which much discussion has taken place in the committee, the House and elsewhere.  The grid is only as reliable as the components feeding into it.  If there is an unreliable component, there must be a backup to compensate for it.  Circumstances where there may be a delay in providing a supply must not be allowed to arise; a supply must be readily available at all times.We must realise our commitments under the Kyoto Protocol.  Whether we like it, we must live up to them.  If we do not, we will have to pay large fines.  I am sorry the Green Paper does not deal with this issue more realistically.  We must balance the likely cost of fines against the much more attractive but similar cost of investment in research and development to ensure the consumer is looked after.For several years we have listened to discussion on the importance of and need for competition.  What can we tell our constituents, consumers in the industrial and domestic markets, in the light of recent events?  International fuel prices are on a downward trajectory and have been for several months.  It has happened to such an extent that the oil producing countries are now discussing reducing oil production to prop up the price.  What do we do?  We decide to increase the prices of gas and electricity and hammer the unfortunate consumers as if to teach them a lesson.  There were no circumstances under which this could have been justified.  I am sorry to be critical of the Minister on this issue but the time has come for him to review his observer status in this area.  He should clearly indicate to all and sundry, including regulators, that this is not acceptable and the economy cannot stand it.  Neither manufacturing industry nor the domestic sector has any provision made for it where it can offset the imposition indicated in the recent raft of price increases.The degree to which competition can be introduced and the benefits this delivers to the consumer must be examined as a matter of urgency.  The Minister will know there are a number of heavy energy users in his constituency that are under severe pressure as a result of the most recent price increases.  He should look seriously at requesting a review of the price increase decision and seek to restore prices to their previous level.  That would be a positive gesture and do an awful lot for the competitiveness of the economy.I do not want to overreact, but today a committee of which I am a member discussed the concept of European regulations on competition and how we must conform to them.  However, there are problems and the regulations do not seem to be working for us as yet.  The Minister should spend serious time on getting this moving in order that it will deliver a positive, beneficial impact for the economy.  He needs to meet the various bodies involved.  We cannot afford the luxury of another year floating along as regards energy, regulation and the apparently unjustifiable price increases.  I feel churlish in having to repeat this to the regulator and the providers.  However, there is only so much consumers can withstand.  The time has come for ministerial leadership, to acknowledge what is happening and ensure changes are made to have a beneficial impact.We must move the industry forward as one, whether it is the production of one fuel or another, one technology or another, or in one area or another.  This is not a nuclear country, nor is it likely to be.  We all welcome this.  While some suggest we should have a debate on the issue, we should conserve our energy and use the debate to provide the alternatives.

Each Department with responsibility — five or six have such responsibilities — has a major contribution to make.  One will not be able to do it on its own.  However, serious progress can be made with a co-ordinated approach.I have referred to the cessation of the sugar beet industry.  This was a lost opportunity from the perspective of utilising an existing industry and converting it to another use.  There is no reason those who previously had contracts for growing beet for sugar production purposes could not receive compensation in the same way.  However, by virtue of its interference, the European Union decided it must proceed in a particular fashion.  Neither the Minister nor the Government had the courage or wherewithal to stand up and stop it.I hope this debate generates positive elements.  We need to call upon all our national resources, whether onshore or offshore, including  wind, tidal and wave energy.  Each has a contribution to make in its own way.  No single alternative will provide the answer.  The answer will come from a combination of contributors from various areas who together will be able to provide this country with a reliable energy grid which we hope will be independent of all others in terms of import substitution.  It will be economically beneficial but, most important, nobody will be able to switch off the interconnector and leave this country without a power source.The Minister might clarify further the issue involving the interconnectors.  One of the Minister's colleagues, showing divine capabilities, said he could be certain that nuclear generated electricity would not be imported here via the interconnector.  It is a unique technique to be able to tell where such electricity is generated.  I will not elaborate on that further other than to say it is, without doubt, necessary to put the east-west and the north-south interconnectors in place as soon as possible to ensure security of supply and continuity of service.The Minister indicated in this paper and associated documentation the proposal to build an interconnector.  I understand private sector investment and considerable research and development in terms of the preliminaries have gone into that area.  The Minister might give some indication as to the way he intends to operate the mix of the private and public sectors in that regard or if it is intended to devote more to one or the other.  If we can generate confidence among those likely to provide services in the area, we must be equally aware that private and public sector investors in that type of project must have advance warning.I welcome the publication of the paper but am concerned about its limitations.  I hope that in the discussion that takes place from now on there will be an improvement and that when the final White Paper emerges, it will be something to which we all made a positive contribution and that the consumer will be the winner in the end.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	233	Since its publication, the Green Paper has been rightly characterised as being high on aspiration and low on action.  That characterisation arises from the fact that a lengthy policy vacuum has developed in respect of energy policy.  It is only in the past few years that the Government has begun to address the issue, which is the most important facing our country, and give the subject the importance it deserves.  I welcome the fact that at long last we have this Green Paper.I welcome also the commitment from the Minister — although it may not be a commitment he will carry out; other Members here might be involved in it in the future — that reviews will be done at least every five years.  I know there are long lead-in times in developing new fuels and renewables and in developing generation but even taking account of that, five years is a long time.The three pillars upon which the Green Paper is based — security of supply, environmental sustainability and economic competitiveness — are a valuable basis on which to build our energy strategy.  Like the Green Paper, the goal of the Labour Party, at its most fundamental, is to deliver affordable energy for all consumers, ideally resourced locally, which will last into the future and that does not do long-term damage to the environment.  In that context, the Minister might have extended his three pillars to include and stress affordability and energy equality.  Since access to energy resources is a basic human necessity, a critical component of any responsible energy strategy must be to ensure it is affordable for everyone, including the poorest in our society.It was deliberate that on the very day Irish families and businesses were being hit with the massive 34% increase in gas prices, the Government finally released the Green Paper, accompanied by the Deloitte & Touche report.  A statistic in the Deloitte & Touche report that leaps out at the reader is the fact that almost one in five Irish people is defined as being fuel poor.  That is an astonishing and unacceptable statistic and it is amazing that it did not lead the Minister to put much more far-reaching measures in tackling fuel poverty at the core of this document.There is nothing new in the Green Paper on fuel and energy poverty apart from a vague pledge that consideration will be given to the extension of current policy initiatives to address the issue.  Those programmes include the remedial works programme, the warmer homes scheme and the central heating scheme.  A review of the design guidelines for local authority houses is also promised but there are already numerous existing energy efficiency regulations in the building sector which are not being properly implemented and monitored.  As I said on the day the Building Control Bill was passed by this House, a huge tranche of new housing — up to one third of our housing stock — has been developed without reference to improving energy efficiency or developing renewable energy sources.While there are valuable elements to some of those programmes, the existing policies have not prevented a huge number of our people being condemned to fuel poverty.  Figures from Bord Gáis and the ESB show that the average household in the Republic currently pays approximately €1,658 a year in fuel bills and with the onset of the new price hikes, the total average cost will rise to a massive €2,107 by the new year — a 27% increase — while in Britain the average annual bill is approximately 42% less at between €1,230 and €1,291.  As a result of that the Society of St. Vincent de Paul stated recently that approximately €3.5 million of its annual budget of almost €34 million will be used in the coming winter months to help families pay gas and electricity bills.  It is striking that in the Green Paper before the House less than a page — six lines in the introductory section and two thirds of the second last page — is devoted to fuel poverty.  The Labour Party believes strongly that the poorest in our society should not have to pay for regulatory failure or for the real cost of introducing renewable energy technologies.No single renewable energy technology can meet all our energy needs.  It is clear there may be limits to renewable energy but a much strengthened renewables policy must be pursued from energy security, environmental and economic perspectives.  With Ireland's frightening statistic of having over 90% dependence on imported fossil fuels and the declining global supply of fossil fuels accompanying climate change, it is a well acknowledged imperative that we must diversify our fuel supply as a matter of urgency.I realise it is easy to set targets and much more difficult to ensure they are realised but the 15% by 2010 and 30% renewable target for 2020 set by the Minister show a lack of ambition.  A more energetic Government might have sought to supply the bulk of Ireland's electricity supply by renewables by 2030.  Due to systemic Government failure, Ireland remains at an incredibly low base of 2.6% of total primary energy needs coming from renewable sources.I am sure most of my colleagues from the Opposition parties who attended the recent Irish Wind Energy Association conference in Ennistymon will agree that we had an interesting and stimulating debate.  The achievements of the wind industry struck many of us at the conference.  The Minister must be commended, and I do so now, on introducing the REFIT programme and attempting to assist the promoters of wind energy through developing REFIT and replacing air.In terms of biomass and biofuels, the Green Paper refers to a national bio-energy action plan that should be ready for the end of 2006 and will set a road map and targets for biomass.  However, with the track record of this Government of delivering policies and programmes on time, especially in the area of renewable energy, it is highly unlikely we will see this much needed plan remotely within the designated timeframe.The Government has rightly ruled out the nuclear power option, which reflects the beliefs and values of this House.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle is interested in the possibilities provided by clean coal technology, given the resources we have available.  One of the failures of the Government is the lack of development of biofuels and the failure to reach the 2% target set for 2005, opting instead for a meagre 0.06% by 2005 and 2% by 2008.  This will make it difficult for us to reach the EU target of 5.75% by 2010.The failure of the Minister and the Taoiseach to insist on establishing a clean fuels ministerial fleet represents a missed opportunity.  The Minister launched his Power of One campaign last week but why did he not start with one Minister?  He could have started the energy efficiency campaign by changing his famous ministerial vehicle.

The target for the period 2006-13 is €3.8 billion.  The Minister might have examined the global allocation for energy research and development.  He launched the Power of One campaign to highlight energy efficiency but we are still awaiting the energy conservation plan.  Will he indicate when it will be published?  It is disappointing that no measures have been launched to introduce smart metering or effective product labelling to show energy use and carbon implications.  The Minister could also propose introducing energy matters to the national education curriculum.As well as failing to discuss fuel and energy poverty, the Green Paper does not refer to microgeneration.  The CER consultation document on the subject was finally received by e-mail today.  It seems strange that this document which is aimed at the period 2025-30 contains very little about the matter.  We receive complaints from constituents about the failure to deliver an effective wood chip transport system and to liaise with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on small wind turbines.  In London Mayor Ken Livingstone has launched a city energy strategy with the ambitious target of 7,000 domestic solar panels and wind turbines in the London region by 2010.  Regrettably, the Green Paper does not address microgeneration.Regarding energy security and the market, the Financial Times stated “energy is too important to be left entirely to the magic of the market”.  The market in gas seemed to be on the verge of collapse at the time.  The Minister has stated he will not support the fragmentation and atomisation of the ESB as discussed in the Deloitte & Touche report and the Green Paper.  The Labour Party will hold him to his pledge.The introduction of an all-Ireland market has been delayed again under the Minister's watch until November 2007.  The ongoing, organic evolution of the Irish market and the commissioning of the east-west interconnector and other interconnector developments means that the ESB will lose its power to set the marginal cost of electricity.  Thus, it will have a much higher residual supply index.In the past few days we have seen the remarkable outcome of the debacle of the privatisation of Aer Lingus following the privatisation of Eircom.  It is critical that the State retains control of the electricity and gas transmission and distribution network.  In view of the energy security issue, the key generation assets of the ESB must remain under public control.  The authors of the Deloitte & Touche report make this point when stating the retention of State control of key generation assets is favoured.  The report makes clear that the retention of a strong, commercially viable ESB, providing certainty of direction for staff, shareholders and customers, must be a key element of Irish energy policy.  This echoes Labour Party policy.  I welcome the commitment given in the Green Paper to developing the second North-South electricity interconnector by 2012 and the delivery of the east-west interconnection by the same date.Members of the House have been irritated by having to jump up and down like a jack-in-the-box during the Order of Business to ask about electricity Bills.  The Minister proposes to recast the current Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill after one day of debate on Committee Stage.  It is regrettable that this legislation was not published earlier, as is the fact that we are still awaiting the single electricity market Bill.  The mathematical calculations necessary do not appear to have been completed.  This is a blow to Irish families and business struggling to meet soaring energy bills.  It is deplorable that the legislative basis will be produced in the dying days of the Government.The Green Paper has high aspirations but lacks meat.  It provides an opportunity for the creation of a White Paper that might serve as a useful blueprint for energy policy.  I regret that energy and fuel poverty have not figured in the paper so far and that microgeneration is barely considered.  I echo my colleague's comments on renewables, biofuels, research and development, and efficiency.  The Minister has taken the first step in a vital national discussion that will be continued at the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.  I commend him for bringing the Green Paper before the House.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	237	I wish to share time with Deputies Ferris and Cowley.Energy is moving up the political agenda because we face two fundamental, long-term challenges, the first of which is the imminent peak in global oil production.  This does not mean we will run out of oil but that after that date we will see an inexorable decline in the availability of cheap oil each year of 2% to 2.5%.  Oil which has fuelled our economy in the past 150 years will become more scarce and more expensive.  Ireland which derives 60% of energy from oil is utterly exposed and will have to seek alternative sources of energy to run cars, heat homes and provide food because of the role oil plays in fertiliser and pesticide production.We also face a second, starker, more urgent challenge, namely, the consequences of having burned fossil fuels in the past 150 years.  This is pushing our planet into potentially catastrophic climate change.  We must urgently reduce emissions by at least two thirds if we are not to see feedback mechanisms remove this matter from our hands.  The melting of the Siberian tundra, methane release and the melting of the Arctic ice cap, leading to greater heat being absorbed, could lead to this.  I will not deal with the science of climate change, as I know the Minister is aware of the significance of the issue.  Coincidentally, both it and the imminent peak in global oil production, although from different directions, require a similar outcome about which we can be clear today.  Whenever the peak occurs in global oil production, we know that the days of easy, accessible and cheap oil will be over by 2050.  Likewise, we know that we do not need to wait for international agreements to be worked out to realise that the correct and moral thing to do in addressing climate change is to reduce our emissions by at least 60% of 1990 levels by approximately 2050.  Therefore, the task ahead of us is very clear.  An energy policy must be honest with the people and set such long-term targets.     There should be an annual, rather than a five-year, review of whether we are following the incremental path we need to take to achieve the two long-term targets mentioned.  If not, the Minister for Finance should be compelled to adjust budgetary policy, the Minister for Transport should be compelled to adjust transport policy and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government should be compelled to adjust housing policy to ensure we move towards the proper path.I regret that this energy paper did not seek the opportunity, as other countries have done in theirs, to set proper long-term targets.  This country has done so before.  In the 1950s it transformed itself from a closed to an open economy.  It took 40 years for this to bear fruit in terms of the current economic boom but this was the long-term thinking which T. K. Whitaker and Seán Lemass brought to this House and it worked.  We need something similar now in energy because we cannot delay.  In that regard, this paper represents a failed opportunity.Where the Green Paper sets targets in electricity generation, the question of whether it is being too ambitious is a matter for debate, whatever about setting a target figure of 30% for renewables by 2020.  If one examines what is happening, the reality is that in the next four or five years we will build at least three gas-fired power stations which will increase our emissions and make us more dependent on security of supply of a distant, volatile and expensive fuel source.  The current cost is 8.6 cents per kilowatt hour.  In the three areas the Minister set out in terms of energy policy, security of supply, price and environmental considerations, the reality is that in the next four years twice as much electricity will be produced with fossil fuels.I agree with the proposal as set out in the Deloitte & Touche report and, I understand, by the Government, that the issue of ESB dominance should be handled by the allocation of certain land banks to alternative players in the market.  I agree with the report that we must go further.  One cannot cherrypick from its recommendations.  I am not in favour of the atomisation or fragmentation of the ESB, as some have proposed, in terms of the division of its generation and supply businesses.  However, I see no reason the assets of the transmission and distribution networks should not be held in State hands in a company separate from the ESB.  The perception of dominance and high prices will remain as long as this recommendation is not implemented.The Minister asked about infrastructure in terms of the funding arrangements we should have under the national development plan.  We have been examining this matter for three or four years.  However, I am far more interested in finding out when the Minister plans to make the decision and proceed with building the interconnectors.  Funding is not the fundamental issue.  The question of how they will be funded has not been worked out in the last three or four years.  I put it down to approximately 14 letters — SEI, CER, DCMNR, ESB.  This matter has been characterised by lethargy.  The bureaucratic institutions responsible for energy matters have been unable to make a decision.  Political leadership is now required to highlight the urgent need to make changes and to ensure infrastructure is delivered quickly.The Green Homes scheme is welcome but a drop in the ocean.  Why does the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government not set proper building regulations standards tomorrow in order that houses of the future, including the 100,000 or so that will be built this year, will be energy-efficient?  The second and possibly larger issue is what mechanisms are we devising to promote the insulation of existing homes and the development of renewable technologies.  Unfortunately, urgency is missing in an area which crucially accounts for one third of energy usage.Another hugely important area is transport.  I again lament the fact that it is not sufficiently addressed in this energy paper.  Our level of oil use is running away from us.  This requires an urgent reappraisal of our transport plans.  The roads programme makes no sense when one looks at the framework for 2050 and the fact that oil and petrol for cars will no longer be available.  This self-evident truth requires a change in government thinking which is not occurring.I have two final words of warning.  While I support the development of biofuels as a strategic energy reserve for security of supply reasons, we must be careful in respect of the emissions reductions which will result from the use of such fuels.  Fundamentally, we need a change in planning systems to recognise the future we are facing.  The sprawl in development which will lock people into energy-inefficient lifestyles cannot continue.  It is the lack of a broad vision and purpose in this energy paper that is disappointing and which needs to be changed if we are to properly address the long-term energy issues we face.
#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	238	It is timely that we are discussing a Government Green Paper on energy at a time when gardaí are enforcing the will of a multinational company on the people of County Mayo.  At the same time as we are debating the implications attached to future fuel supplies and the need to provide alternatives, the Government appears happy to allow the Corrib gas field to be developed with a minimal return to the State in terms of revenue, the price of gas or even supply.  In that context, I am curious to discover what the Minister was referring to when he interrupted a request by my colleague, Deputy Ó Caoláin, to adjourn the Dáil under Standing Order 31 last week to say "€2 billion".  I hope he was not trying to suggest the State stood to benefit from the Corrib development in these terms.  If he was, I am interested in hearing how that might be the case.On the broader issues related to the Green Paper, we all welcome the commitment to increase the share of renewable energy sources and thereby reduce our dependence on the importing of fossil fuels.  As happened in the not too distant past, current oil prices hold us hostage to instability not of our making.  However, I was slightly concerned to note that in the reply to my parliamentary question of Tuesday, 3 October regarding the 5.75% target for biofuel penetration by 2010, the Minister replied that to achieve this target, a significant change in land use patterns or a level of imports might be required.  I certainly agree with the contention that land use needs to be changed and many of us believe this will be facilitated by the new conditions pertaining under the single farm payment.  My concern relates to the reference to imports, given the potential for growing energy crops here.  Why would this country not be in a position to grow the necessary feedstock and process it into biofuels?  The level and structure of grant aid seem to be factors as to why only several thousand acres are currently in receipt of such aid.  However, another key factor is the absence of processing facilities and the apparent absence of any real desire by the State or private enterprise to provide them.  I visited County Wexford two weeks ago.  I met a planter who told me that the potential amount harvested this year was 6,000 acres.  There will be a reduction of 1,500 acres next year, which is very worrying.  I was also told that the only way planters could address this reduction was through imported rapeseed.A good example of the lack of interest on the part of the State and private enterprise in providing processing facilities is the winding down of the sugar sector.  With others, I have made the point that the beet grown and the existing plant could be redirected towards the production of bioethanol.  However, Greencore seems to have no intention of pursuing any productive enterprise and is intent on stripping the former Sugar Company of its assets and using the former factory sites for property development.  One might have thought that the Government might have attempted to persuade Greencore that this was not the best use to make of former public property but this did not happen.  It seems it is also content to see apartments built and large profits made where once hundreds of people were employed and thousands of tonnes of sugar were produced.  What happened to the golden share to protect the workers and growers?If the State does not take greater steps to promote growing and processing energy crops, we will replace our dependency on fossil fuel imports with a new dependency on imported biofuels, which is extremely concerning.  While there is little we can do about the former, it would be an utter disgrace if a country such as Ireland found itself in the latter position.The target of 15% for renewables by 2010 and 30% by 2020 is laudable and I commend it.  However, I am not satisfied the Government's current practice matches its vision.  I see no evidence that what is being done will allow us to reach the point envisaged by the targets being set.  For that to take place we must mobilise our land, forestry, wind and hydropower resources and ensure that in replacing our dependence on imported oil and gas we build a solid basis of indigenously supplied and processed energy sources.
#JerryCowleyIND	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-party	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-dob	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	239	All I have to state is that as far as I can see, we do not have an energy policy.  Similar to health, there is no policy and there are vested interests throughout.  Local people are robbed and abused by forces of the State.  This House is silent on the matter and, shamefully, other Mayo Deputies are also silent.  I was in County Mayo in recent days.  The local community is under attack from the Government.  It is a shameful situation, whereby Shell received concessions such as never before were given to a private company.  It has compulsory purchase order power to take land and foist this illegal pipeline on the people without receiving consent for this ill-fated project.  The purpose is to satisfy the agenda of a private multinational company which, together with its partners, makes millions of euro profit every day.Hundreds of gardaí do Shell's work for it, not at Shell's expense but at that of the poor long-suffering taxpayer who must pay for this terrible abuse of power by the State.  Only five extra gardaí were sent to Moyross.  We read two days ago that the poor lady whose two children had been burnt had to leave her house because of an attack by local thugs.  The hundreds of gardaí should not be in County Mayo; they should be minding that poor woman and her children.The last feeble justification given for the intolerable situation in County Mayo is that we need it to ensure security of supply.  That is a complete and utter laugh.  A few days ago the Financial Times reported that gas had been given away for nothing in the United Kingdom because so much of it had come in from Norway through the largest pipeline in the world.  People were paid to take the gas.What is the sense in all of this?  We discuss waste and electronic voting machines.  What about the hundreds of millions spent on the Bord Gáis pipeline to Rossport, paid for by the taxpayer?  Energy prices have increased by 34%.  All this means to the people is increased costs.  The arrival of Corrib gas supplies will mean nothing to them except more expense.  It will mean more profit for Shell.The fiscal terms governing oil and gas finds must be revised to ensure adequate returns to the people.  We require the taxation, royalties and equity shares which were previously available.  We need a proper deal to compensate the people for the pollution and global warming effects of the exploitation of fossil fuels.  These revenues should be ringfenced and used for investment in and development of renewable forms of energy.Energy policy should be directed towards the development of renewable sources, with oil and gas finds used only as transitional fuels and to finance that transition.  Communities affected by the exploitation of oil and gas finds require compensatory payments and investment funding.  In the Grianan model 10% of gross profits is diverted to affected communities.  This could be enforced through legislation.  In the Shetland Islands the local community exercises considerable control over the industry.  That is another potential model.The debacle of the Corrib gas project illustrates what happens when community concerns are ignored by the industry, and it is continuing.  It is shameful to see what is happening.  The Government has turned upon the local population to progress an ill-fated project which means nothing to the local area or this country but means millions of euro pouring into the coffers of private concerns.  It is an absolute disgrace.  I ask the House to resist what is happening.  Will the four other Deputies in County Mayo speak out about the terrible squandering of resources and use of State resources to further the agenda of a private company and fill up its coffers?

Energy is the most exciting political challenge we face, not only on a national basis but also internationally.

We must agree that what the country and globe face is the question of how we will deal with climate change.  We have issues at national level.  The Green Paper points to the three pillars, namely, security of supply, environmental stability and economic competitiveness, of which we must be extremely cognisant nationally.  Unfortunately, owing to international geopolitical circumstances our security of supply has been put under an increasingly tremendous strain.  In our isolated position at the end of a gas pipeline through Europe, we must be determined to diminish our dependency on gas imports.  The best way to do this is through the opportunities provided by renewable energy industries.I welcome the high target proposed in the Green Paper.  It is good to have ambitious targets because at least if one falls short, one still falls high.  As the Minister stated last Sunday week when he launched the proposal, the target will be well superseded by the time we get there.  Perhaps it was the Taoiseach who stated that but that is the type of thinking we need in the energy debate.  One thing for certain is that we cannot continue with the way we deal with the energy crisis and the energy market in Ireland.The possibilities are endless.  I see major opportunities for Ireland in renewable energy industries such as onshore and offshore wave energy production.  While offshore energy supplies may not be economic, we must think and plan for the future.  That is what is important about the Green Paper on energy which will be formulated into a strong and coherent policy paper.  Most parties in the House agree on what we must do for the country and how we will get there.  It is incumbent on us as political leaders who care about this issue to come together and agree the basis on which Ireland must secure its energy future, particularly in terms of our competitiveness.This month we saw high increases in energy costs, not only for domestic users but also for industrial users.  We heard at the committee last week how detrimental high energy costs were to businesses here, something we must recognise because we cannot continue with these increases.  We must arrive at a solution that will allow for smaller increases in energy costs.I attended a debate last night in Trinity College on energy and the question was asked how we could get the public to engage with the process.  From my experience canvassing in Dún Laoghaire people are beginning to ask about energy, even if only because of the bills they are getting.  They realise that we must change our ways.  The campaign launched by the Minister last week points to how we can make a difference individually.The two month timeframe for the Green Paper provides ample opportunity for discussion, particularly for schools.  I hope there is a programme for them to debate this issue.  As we know from recycling, children are the ones who drive families to recycle.  They have learned the value of such activity in school and know about the climate and nature.  This provides a terrific opportunity to find people who will be great advocates for energy efficiency in the future.  We must try to ensure greater efficiency in appliances, buildings and consumption.  The Power of One campaign deals with our consumption, asking all of us how we use energy in our own homes and if it would be more appropriate for us to walk, cycle or use public transport.The Government also has a responsibility to address this issue through the building regulations in the built environment where a huge proportion of energy is consumed.  We must design buildings correctly.  Public buildings should lead the way.  I was in a school in Ballybrack two weeks ago where the product used for making the roof was very efficient 30 years ago but is not now.  The principal is worried sick about energy costs.  We must have a way to introduce fiscal incentives which will provide for public schools to achieve energy efficient buildings.  All schools are constantly holding fund raisers in order that they do not need to see heat being lost straight through the roof.  In the new built environment regulations must be much more stringent.  It is in all of our interests to keep consumption down to help meet our Kyoto Protocol obligations on CO2.Legislation prohibits nuclear power but there should not be such constant negative prohibitions.  Life is fluid and nuclear power is used through the interconnector, as we must acknowledge.  It is thanks to the strong nuclear industry in France and the rest of Europe that sufficient gas supplies can still enter the market when it is somewhat constrained.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources will have a debate on nuclear energy.  Since we launched our report earlier this year, the whole nuclear industry has been discussed in a calm manner, which is welcome.  Many Green Party leaders in Europe are now looking at nuclear power in a different way because it is seen as clean energy.  We must not have such a negative stance.  As Deputy Eamon Ryan said at the committee, we should look at the science and the economics and make a decision based on these factors, not on populism.I welcome the ministerial taskforce on bioenergy.  It is a huge area with enormous potential, particularly for rural areas.  We could harness a lot energy.  I have met many people who have benefitted from the fiscal measures in previous budgets.  They want the market to be opened up, something I want to see because people have responded to it.  When the Government introduced measures in last year's budget for grants for wood pellet and other heating systems, domestic users were very enthusiastic.  We must encourage people to be as efficient as possible.It shows great maturity on the part of both Government parties that after nine years of marriage and intimacy, we can have a difference of opinion on the future of the ESB.  I read the Deloitte & Touche report with great interest.  While I reserve judgment and accept what the Minister says, there is an argument to be made on the future of the ESB.  We must build efficiencies.I welcome the Green Paper and look forward to the White Paper that will come from it.

I congratulate the Minister on the targets being set for 2010 and 2020 on renewable energy and biofuels but there is no detail on how we might kick start the industry to ensure we reach those targets.Two critical steps must be taken immediately, the first of which is the establishment of grants for biomass and biofuel crops.  At present a huge up-front investment of €3,000 per acre is required to establish an energy crop.  Farmers will get this back over 20 years but it is frustrating that the same recoupment is possible from forestry, where farmers receive afforestation grants with built in incentives that are not provided for energy crops such as willow and miscanthus.A number of farmers pointed out to me at the National Ploughing Championship that there was no mechanism in place to pass on carbon credit savings to those using or producing biomass products.  We must address this if we are to develop a renewable energy biofuel sector.  It is clear that farmers and biofuel processors are interested in developing the sector and that there is huge potential but there is no blueprint for how we go from where we are to reach those targets by 2010 or 2020.  The Green Paper ignores this area when it is vital for us to set out the steps that will be taken by the Government to reach them.  Unless we do this, we will not develop an industry.  The Minister's failure to take a more active role by using the closure of the sugar industry as a vehicle for developing a renewable sector through the production of ethanol was disappointing.  The debate on energy should have formed part of a restructuring of the sugar industry.

#TonyGregory	unknown-#TonyGregory-party	unknown-#TonyGregory-dob	unknown-#TonyGregory-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	246	The Government does not have a strategy to deal effectively with the ongoing supply-control aspect of the drugs crisis.  As one crime correspondent put it last week, when he quoted a senior security source on the private airfields issue: "It is the simplest and most straightforward method of drug trafficking there is."  Despite repeated warnings in this Chamber, the Government has failed to act, continues to be disgracefully negligent on the issue and only now, in its long-winded amendment, does it refer to reviewing the risks involved.Apart from the basic measure of customs cover and aircraft monitoring, the most powerful weapons against the drug gangs are the Criminal Assets Bureau and, at local level, community gardaí, yet the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has taken almost five years to start delivering the necessary community gardaí in local areas.  During these five years of neglect the drug gangs have gathered momentum, with rates of hard drug consumption among our young people now among the highest in Europe.I observe in my constituency a repeat of the failures of the 1990s.  The Criminal Assets Bureau is the other great weapon against drug gangs but I see young, middle-ranking drug dealers in 06 registered jeeps and cars, with lavish apartments and lifestyles, continue to claim and receive social welfare payments, the very practices the bureau was set up to prevent.  Many other young people follow the easy money and drugs.  The Criminal Assets Bureau should be regionalised and given local structures to stamp out this problem.  This is the most effective way to stem the drug tide.  Otherwise the Garda drug units, under-resourced as they are, will only provide a fire brigade service and will have no real impact on the ongoing drugs crisis.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	247	Until recently, most people, if they had heard a description of a €10 million drugs haul at an airfield on the Continent bound for a small unmonitored aerodrome on the outskirts of Dublin using an aeroplane borrowed without the knowledge of its owner, would have assumed it referred to an extract from a television show such as "Miami Vice".  Unfortunately, life is beginning to imitate art in a dangerous and worrying way at Weston Aerodrome on the Leixlip-Lucan border where 50 kg of heroin was to be landed.  According to the aerodrome's website, this consignment would have been delayed by only five minutes between "plane touch down and taxi or limousine departure".  This "key benefit" of a mere five minute delay between landing at and exiting the airport may not be an open advertisement of a non-existent or light security standard but who would be attracted by such an advertisement?  We can all agree that recent events in Belgium give us a clue as to the answer to this question.Following ongoing discussions with local people in north Kildare and west Dublin on the level of security at Weston Aerodrome, I first raised the issue with the Minister for Finance in a parliamentary question inquiring about the customs arrangement at the aerodrome.  I was informed that while the volume and type of business conducted at the aerodrome did not justify the deployment of a permanent customs presence, customs officers visited the aerodrome regularly as a check against the landing or exportation of prohibited goods, in particular, controlled drugs.  In February this year, I tabled a further parliamentary question asking the number of customs visits conducted at the aerodrome and was informed that during 2004 officers attached to the Dublin enforcement district carried out 12 planned and six unplanned visits to Weston Aerodrome and a further ten planned and six unplanned visits in 2005.Effectively, self-regulation is in force at the 27 private airfields in the State.  While the Government deadbolts front door access to the State at our major airports, it has handed out copies of the back door key to anyone who has shown an interest in having one.  Anyone can own, operate or work at a private airfield without undergoing a security check.  Aer Rianta operates under strict Garda and customs supervision and will not even issue a security badge to a person with a criminal record, not to speak of allowing such a person to take an aeroplane for a spin.  How can the Government justify such a relaxed approach to security at private airfields when we are only too aware of the incidence of drug smuggling at larger, heavily monitored airports?Like the customs cover at Weston, immigration arrangements are also limited.  I refer to an article in Village magazine of 24 August:An internal Garda report has highlighted security risks at Weston.  The airport has no immigration officers, no x-ray, baggage or people scanning machines.  The report goes on to say that the airport makes it possible for terrorists to enter England or the rest of Europe with explosives.I raised similar security concerns during the Second Stage debate on the Air Navigation Transport (Indemnities) Bill.  We must remember that the State provides major indemnities to people who require to take them up.  A dedicated operation targeting air shipments of drugs into Ireland was cancelled almost ten years ago because there was no money to keep it going.  That operation must be restored without delay.  While I congratulate those involved in the recent heroin seizure in Belgium, we can imagine how much more success we would see if the Government provided the Revenue and the Garda with adequate resources.  The €10 million pales into insignificance when one considers the cost of drug treatment programmes, drug-related crimes and their prevention and the cost of imprisoning those who have fallen through the cracks and wound up in our prisons.  What about the trail of human misery and destruction that drug gangs, organised crime and drug use causes?I wish to highlight the irony of the destination of the Belgian heroin.  It was headed for Weston Aerodrome, a stone's throw from Lucan Garda station where the Garda worked tirelessly gathering evidence related to the murder of Ms Veronica Guerin, a victim of drug-related crime of the worst kind.  It is the Government's responsibility to ensure that history does not repeat itself and to make adequate provision to stop the existing back-door arrangement.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	248	The Independent Deputies deal with real issues every day and we propose sensible solutions to this matter.  I commend and pay tribute to the late Ms Donna Cleary, a constituent of mine shot down in a drugs-related incident.  I also remember all the victims of crime throughout this State.  These are real people, our citizens, and we should stand up and defend their rights.The heroin crisis that causes much misery in this country is appalling.  Drug-related crime spirals out of control while our Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform seems to have his head stuck in the sand and does nothing about it.  The Independent Deputies challenge the Minister and the Government to do something about it.  We also propose many sensible solutions.  The criminal justice system must be reformed to give greater respect and protection to witnesses and victims during criminal cases so that intimidation can be minimised.  This is the sad reality for many people in this State, particularly for many on the north side of Dublin.I wish to put forward a number of proposals to deal with crime.  We need more judges.  Preliminary hearings should be held with a view to shortening trials.  We must establish a dedicated witness, victim and family liaison officer scheme.  The courts need to operate between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m.  We need more support for disadvantaged schools, which should be targeted with extra resources, particularly counselling and family therapy sessions.  We need more community gardaí on the beat and I urge the Minister to develop Operation Anvil against the armed gangs.  These are sensible proposals which we need to adopt.  The House heard from my colleagues about airports that are open to private aircraft.  Let us not forget that we have a major issue with the coast of Ireland where people use boats and yachts to smuggle in drugs.The Minister is handling the administration of justice in a disastrous way.  For example, the annual cost of keeping a prisoner in custody is €90,000, almost a 10% increase on last year's average.  Some 85% of committals in 2005 were for non-violent offences.  Some 90% of women committed to a prison in 2005 were there for non-violent offences and 78% of all committals under sentence in 2005 were for 12 months or less.  The drug barons and armed criminals should be behind bars, not these people who are involved in petty crime and smaller issues related to broader society.  This is an important debate.  It is essential that we target resources at the most needy in society, put in a proper, honest and decent policing structure and listen to the views of the Independent Deputies.
#JerryCowleyIND	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-party	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-dob	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	249	Hundreds of gardaí are in Rossport, County Mayo, trying to put through an ill-fated project, yet millions of euro worth of drugs are coming into private aerodromes, as has been pointed out.  We have had a problem with alcohol for many generations, but in recent years other drugs have compounded and accelerated the situation.  Heroin has devastated disadvantaged communities in Dublin.  Although it is estimated that there are 15,000 people addicted to heroin in Dublin alone, the State provides only 20 residential detox beds in the entire country.  That is a disgrace.  It can take up to 12 months for a chaotic addict to get on a methadone programme that will stabilise him or her.  It is disgraceful.  During this time, two crimes a day are needed to feed his or her habit.Drugs such as heroin and cocaine are in every part of the country and in every walk of life and section of society, even in rural areas.  These addicts are sons and daughters, real people, mothers and fathers, many of whom are not more than children themselves.  Many grew up in an alcoholic home.  Society has written them off because they generally do not come from middle-class families, so they do not count.  To fund their addiction, many engage in crime, particularly shoplifting.  We place those people in the dustbin that our prison system has become at a cost of €1,600 per week before releasing them to continue the crime-addiction cycle.Our criminal justice system is full of alcoholics and drug addicts.  The only winners are the criminal justice professionals, lawyers who make lottery-like salaries for a process that does not make society any safer.  We must address this issue.  In 2003, the director of the Merchant's Quay Project pointed out that there were only 20 residential drug addiction treatment beds in this country.  Add 6,000 on methadone maintenance in 2001 compared to 400 in 1995 and we have all the proof we need of the growth of heroin and its ability to thrive and spread.A prohibitive mentality has left us hamstrung.  The figure of 20 beds for addicts is embarrassing when we consider the emphasis on creating more prison spaces.  We encourage judges to lock people up, creating even more overcrowding in the prison system.  When that happens we have too many people in too small a space with no meaningful work or education, creating another site for drug abuse.The State was not always like this.  Britain and China fought two wars over drugs, the opium wars.  Up to 1868 one could buy opium and morphine in general stores in Britain.  The Pharmacy Act 1868 stopped this and gave dispensing powers to pharmacists.  Since many of those who can do something are publicly one-dimensional, drugs are merely a problem where it is politically expedient to sit tightly on the fence and wring one's hands or call for more severe action.  Nobody loses votes for saying "lock up drug pushers" or "drugs are evil", but as the people who live cheek-by-jowl with the fallout from the problem on a daily basis we expect a little lateral thinking from our political masters.  Without breaking new ground, more treatment, more beds, employment opportunities, green spaces, proper recreational areas and open education opportunities would help alleviate some of that mess.  It is up to the powers that be to try pilot schemes such as needle exchanges and safe places for addicts to inject.  However, these are mainly cosmetic.  We must address the problem and break the mould.  We need to stop drugs pouring into our airports.

The Government's national drug strategy is implemented and overseen by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  Responsibility in this regard, which in the previous Dáil lay with the Department of the Taoiseach, was bestowed on the Department upon its establishment.  That was a curious decision because those who were involved in dealing with the ravages of drugs in our nation's communities would have thought, when the national drugs strategy was first put in place, that the involvement of the Department of the Taoiseach at least indicated that the then Government was prepared to adopt a joined-up approach to this scourge on society.This well-crafted motion highlights the need for joined-up government and refers not only to the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform but also to the Minister for Finance.  It further refers to the lack of oversight and control at our country's aerodromes.  Even the Department of Transport has a role in investigating how illicit substances are imported into the country and being allowed to wreak havoc on our communities.  Despite his estimable qualities, it is curious that the Government is represented in this debate by the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  I would have thought that his is one of the few Departments whose input would not be required in this need for joined-up Government thinking.  Perhaps his presence indicates a frivolousness on the Government's part towards the seriousness of this motion and the way it needs to be treated.

#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	254	That seems to be counteracted by the effort the Government has invested in producing an amendment that appears to be twice as long as the original motion.  Given recent agreements between the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste, perhaps the Government has adopted a sardonic bent.  In that context, perhaps there is a need to engage with everything it says from a surrealistic perspective.  In its amendment to the motion, the Government claims that Weston Aerodrome is run to the highest possible international standards.  People were appalled by what was discovered in Brussels but I will say little about the individuals associated with the events in question and about those with whom such people might be associated.  The fact, however, that such a huge quantity of drugs was discovered upon a private plane, the egress from and regress to this country of which came about via a route that is obviously unpoliced, means that the Government must take responsibility.I am contributing to this debate not only as a Deputy representing a constituency which, as much as any other, is subjected to these difficulties but also as my party's spokesperson on matters relating to the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  It is curious that this Cinderella Department, which is under-resourced, has responsibility for one of the biggest issues facing society.  If the Government is serious with regard to tackling the problem of illegal drugs, it should begin to reconsider the type of prioritisation it is giving in the areas of resources and policy.  Under this Government, the latter are sadly lacking.The Taoiseach needs to become involved.  I am aware of the existence of Cabinet sub-committees but I would like those responsible for the areas to which I refer, namely, the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Ministers for Transport and Finance, becoming involved at that almost secretive level and issuing public statements as to why they are failing to deal with the problem.  I would particularly like the Tánaiste to do so.  I know it is anathema to him to consider the possibility of failure in connection with any aspect of his brief.  If, however, we are to start to tackle this problem, there must be an acceptance of responsibility and a willingness on the part of the relevant Departments to at least accept that the action that has been taken has failed, that matters are growing worse and that a radically different approach must be adopted.I commend the motion to the House and I reject the Government's amendment.

Tá an Comhaontas Glas ag tacú leis, mar a luaigh an Teachta Boyle.This is an important and welcome debate, particularly in light of what I perceive as a certain amount of ambivalence on the part of the Government when it comes to dealing with addiction and social disadvantage.  The Government has failed to get to the heart of the problem and to provide the necessary treatment to those who have fallen into the clutches of unscrupulous and vicious individuals involved in the drugs trade.On most occasions when we debate this matter, we discuss illegal drugs.  However, as indicated on Order of Business, strong evidence was provided yesterday by Dr. Jean Moriarty to the effect that, as a result of alcohol abuse, people are being affected by liver failure at a much younger age and that half of those admitted at weekends to the hospital in which she works are found to be suffering from the effects of alcohol consumption.  Despite this, an alcohol products Bill has not been introduced and the alcohol industry is governed only by a voluntary code.  Therein lies part of the problem, particularly if the Government wants to be seen as being interested in, not to mention dealing with, the problem of drug abuse.In my constituency, Dublin North, major courage has been shown by members of the community in tackling this problem, providing training and as much treatment as possible and putting in place preventative measures in areas that are prey to drug dealers.  I refer here, for the most part, to the dealing of illegal drugs.  The example to which I refer must be replicated throughout the country.  On a particular housing estate in Balbriggan, the town in which I live, rather than close their doors and hope that the drug dealing on their streets was not happening, parents, especially mothers, came together and effectively faced down the dealers who were gathering on street corners with the intention of luring these people's children and teenagers into their company.  As a result and following a large public meeting, a group that involves input from every housing estate in the town was formed.  As the Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Noel Ahern, will be aware from his visit to Dublin North last Monday, the Balbriggan Awareness of Drugs group has gone from strength to strength and is not in any way given to the kind of knee-jerk reaction that sometimes occurs and that smacks of vigilantism.  The group provides parent-to-parent courses that empower parents to intervene and play a vital role in protecting the health of their children and prevent them from having to seek treatment.  Such treatment is provided, though not to an adequate degree, in places such as the Rutland Centre.The Government must realise that while it may seem to be saving money, the cost will be greater in the long term if it does not put in place the necessary resources in respect of the provision of drug treatment.  Those who emerge from the Rutland Centre having undergone a difficult and long treatment process are, unfortunately, only too likely to relapse for want of the supports that are needed, namely, a mentoring system, employment opportunities, financial incentives and the help required for those convalescing in such circumstances.  Those undergoing medical treatment, many of them on medical cards, are undoubtedly experiencing difficulties and, unfortunately, they are not likely to be cured unless the Government takes more interest in providing ongoing treatment.  Such treatment is not provided at present and that is a matter over which the Government must stand indicted.The motion refers to community gardaí and the Garda drugs unit.  Currently, the Garda is stretched beyond breaking point in towns such as Balbriggan and its environs, which has a population of the same size as Tullamore; Swords, which is the same size as Waterford city; and Malahide and Portmarnock, which are the same size as Clonmel.  In effect, they are cities.  However, these large towns are trying to cope with the same Garda presence as existed in 1988, or even less in some cases.  I ask the Minister of State to get real about this issue by putting resources into it and saving money in the long term.

Measaim gur léir ón leasú nach bhfuil an Rialtas sásta tacú leis.  Ní raibh sé sásta tacú le rún cosúil leis seo a chuir muid os comhair na Dála i mí Mheithimh i mbliana a bhí ag impí ar an Rialtas ceist na ndrugaí sa tír seo a thógáil dáiríre.  Muna ndéanann sé sin, tá todhchaí uafásach do cheantair sa chathair seo agus a lán bailte lasmuigh de Bhaile Átha Cliath.I support this motion.  I apologise to my colleagues in the Technical Group because some Sinn Féin Members will be unable to lend their support to the motion tomorrow evening as a number of us will be travelling to Scotland for the forthcoming talks.Although Sinn Féin tabled a similar motion on the drugs issue in May that also raised the seriousness of this issue, the Government was unwilling to listen.  At the time, we highlighted the failure of the Health Service Executive to provide harm reduction facilities throughout the State.  We also highlighted the emergence of a trade in crack cocaine, the high levels of crime fuelled by the drugs trade, the issue of rights for grandparents who care for the children of their addict sons and daughters, the issue of resources for the Garda Síochána to tackle drugs and drug crime and the provision of resources for educational programmes and campaigns for children, parents and communities as a whole.Had that motion been accepted, it would have underpinned an effective response to this growing crisis.  The motion now under discussion again reminds the Government of this crucial issue for our society.  In the main, it focuses on the crucial supply issue, which constitutes one of the pillars of the Government's national strategy and on which it has failed miserably.  Although the Government's amendment asserts that An Garda Síochána and Customs and Excise authorities are exceeding their drugs supply reduction targets, anyone travelling through Dublin or anywhere else knows this to be an absolute lie.  Such agencies cannot be addressing reduction because there are more drugs available than was the case before the national strategy was meant to take effect.  There are increasing levels of drugs in every town and village.  This is the scale of the failure of the Government to tackle this major crisis.A number of high profile stories and revelations have made the news in recent weeks, including the seizure of heroin worth €10 million which was en route on a private aeroplane through a private airfield both owned by Jim Mansfield.  This makes it clear that the heroin problem still amounts to a crisis.  While one hears more about cocaine than heroin in the tabloid press, the latter still ravages communities in this city and beyond.  The Government must get real in respect of heroin, cocaine, crack cocaine and ecstasy in particular, as well as all other illegal drugs.Last week, a report was published on illegal drug use in counties Cork and Kerry that found that the percentage of people who had used illegal drugs in the HSE south area had doubled from 16% in 1996 to 34% in 2004.  There is "the reduction" for the Minister of State.  The numbers who have used cocaine, crack, speed and ecstasy in that area have increased fourfold in the same period.  The report again demonstrates that all-pervasive geographical reality of drug use in today's Ireland.While the Government may hope to continue to downplay the gravity of the situation, any attempt to so do simply will not wash with members of the public, who know how it affects their communities.  The communities which are worst affected by drugs and drug-related crime have long recognised the extent of the problem and have sought, through many different organisations, to try to change it.  Sometimes, they have had some success, in that the Government has listened.  However, it is extremely slow to listen and has not directed the proper resources to deal with the issue.Recently, Operation Marigold led to charges being brought against approximately 30 drug dealers.  However, many others remain on the streets and still ply their trade openly in Ballyfermot, the Liberties, the north inner city or in any working class community in this city in particular.  Such people may be seen plying their trade openly on the street by day, at night and at the weekend.  It is like meals on wheels, in that one telephones in advance and the order is delivered to one's pub of choice.  This is the scale of the cocaine problem in Dublin.  Heroin, ecstasy and crack are available wherever one wants in this city and, in some parts of Ballyfermot and the Liberties, it is like a supermarket.  In the north inner city, one goes to different places for different drugs.  In some cases, the same drug dealer deals from different pockets.  In some pubs, the drugs for sale depend on the table one visits.Members should consider the effects of drugs to ascertain the seriousness with which the Government should take this issue.  It loses millions because money must be diverted from other fields in terms of the requirements of the Garda Síochána and Customs and Excise to deal with this issue, as well as in terms of education, broken homes, health and the health problems we will bequeath to future generations because of our unwillingness to tackle drugs supply and the effects drugs have on people.  I refer to broken homes, abandoned children, health problems such as HIV, AIDS or other complications due to drugs, high crime levels, dereliction in some areas, deprivation and the running down of community spirit.  While these examples are from my own constituency, all Members could give examples from their constituencies.  There is a lack of confidence among community organisations because the State does not appear to care.  The State ignores them.The illicit drugs market and gangland crime, including gangland shootings, are intrinsically linked.  While dealing with heroin-related crime was hard enough, cocaine and crack have appeared and have hit this city much harder than any Minister has been willing to admit.  One need only consider the problems in both Limerick and my own constituency in respect of gangland shootings.  The dangerous feuds in such areas have needlessly and prematurely taken the lives of young men who have been caught up in the spiralling tit-for-tat violence associated with drug dealing and with the cocaine trade in particular.  It is the same throughout the world and while some might say they deserve their fate or the more the merrier, I do not share their views.  These are young men with families who deserve to be brought up in a different environment and who have been led astray.No one in his or her right mind would tolerate the drug wars that are taking place, the taking of these young lives, or the frequent taking of innocent lives, such as that of a young Coolock woman earlier this year.  While life may be cheap for those young thugs, all Members must do their best to prevent our society from falling into the abyss which faces us.  It may be glimpsed in societies in the United States, England and elsewhere in the world which have been riven by drugs for much longer than has Ireland.  Unless this is done now and unless the drugs crisis is taken seriously before we move beyond the point of no return, we will end up in the same place.Any meaningful attempt to prevent gangland crime and shootings will be dependent on effective steps being taken to tackle the supply of drugs and the demand of the drugs market at an international, national and local level.  Operation Marigold and Operation Anvil must be properly resourced if their effectiveness in terms of meeting their complementary objectives is to be improved.  Proper resources need to be dedicated to the local drugs units, the Garda liaison officers and the Garda national drugs unit.  This can be achieved by targeting Garda resources properly and providing for the civilianisation of appropriate tasks.  The Government needs to recognise the seriousness of this problem, which it has failed to do up to now.  I commend this motion to the House.  I hope the Government will withdraw its amendment and support the motion.

The debate gives us an opportunity to focus our attention on the issue of drug misuse and the related serious and harmful consequences to which it gives rise at individual, family and community levels in society.  We must address the issue in a realistic and measured way, taking account of its extent, complexity and multifaceted nature.  We must be aware of the global and national contexts in which drug trafficking and drug misuse take place.  Drug misuse is a societal and global problem which cuts across many policy areas, including the health, education, employment and training and criminal justice sectors.  While drug misuse is most prevalent in areas of high social deprivation, it cuts across all social divisions.  The Government is aware that appalling human misery is one of the destructive consequences of drug misuse.  The Government has tabled the amendment for those reasons, rather than for the purposes of self-congratulation or political point-scoring.When we consider the drug problem experienced in our communities, we cannot deal with the issue of drug misuse from a supply reduction perspective only, as the Private Members' motion appears to imply.  The Government's national drugs strategy reflects this by addressing the problem under the pillar headings of education and prevention, supply reduction, treatment and rehabilitation and research.  The strategy, which reflects the links between drug use, poverty and social inequality, is firmly in the social inclusion arena.  I report on its progress directly to the Cabinet sub-committee on social inclusion.  As the Government is conscious that it cannot deal with the drugs issue in a meaningful way on its own, its strategy and the structures arising from it are founded on the principle of joint effort, whereby the various interests work to tackle the problem together.  In practice, there is an integrated partnership approach involving the statutory, voluntary treatment and community sectors.  Bodies like the interdepartmental drugs group, the national drugs strategy team and the National Advisory Committee on Drugs are involved.  The regional and local drugs task forces are involved at regional and local levels throughout the country.  The strategy, which will run until 2008, demonstrates the Government's commitment to addressing the drug problem in a proactive, innovative and collaborative way.  It has a balanced focus on seeking to prevent people from using drugs through education, reducing drug-related harm and providing treatment where required.  It also concentrates on continuing to vigorously disrupt the operation of the drug market.The Private Members' motion does not seem to acknowledge the existence of the national drugs strategy.  It does not appear to recognise the progress which has been made over the first half of the strategy's lifetime.  It does not seem to recognise the significant work being done under this policy framework.  The Government remains fully committed to dealing with the problem in an integrated way.  It has noted that the key finding of the mid-term review of the national strategy was that the strategy's aims and objectives are fundamentally sound and that progress is being made across the four pillars of the strategy.  The fundamental point I am making is that a great deal of progress is being made.  One could give a number of examples of the progress that has been made in implementing the specific actions in the strategy.  On the supply reduction side, Garda and customs operations continue to yield drug seizures.  I heard what the previous speaker said about seizures, but he should examine the graph which indicates that the number of seizures is increasing significantly.  The Garda and the Customs and Excise are being resourced, funded and equipped.  It is not long since I was present when the Customs and Excise took possession of a new x-ray scanning machine, like the machines which scan one's suitcases at an airport.

The process of planning for a new drug awareness campaign, which is being co-ordinated by the population health directorate of the HSE, is under way.  On the treatment side, the central treatment list recorded at the end of July 2006 that 8,118 people were availing of treatment.  In addition, a vast range of clients who do not depend on opiates are availing of the HSE's counselling and rehabilitation services.  Since the start of the strategy, there has been a significant increase in the number of people on methadone and in treatment.  We are ensuring that more and more people are receiving treatment.A number of positive messages are emerging from the research results.  The recent research outcome study in Ireland, which was commissioned by the National Advisory Committee on Drugs, highlighted the positive and tangible benefits of the provision of such treatment.  The study followed 400 people who were availing of drugs services.  They were interviewed after six months and again after 12 months.  Significant improvements were recorded in their health and their awareness of the dangers of drugs.  They were not sharing paraphernalia to the same extent, they were not using the same quantities of drugs and they were not involved in crime to the same extent.  There were very significant improvements in the lives of the 400 people in question.  The study, which was professionally organised by the drugs advisory committee, made it clear that treatment does work and is working.  The drug prevalence study, which was undertaken by the National Advisory Committee on Drugs in 2003, indicated the number of people using heroin in the greater Dublin area had decreased since 1996.I do not have any degree of complacency because, as all of us know, it is not easy to tackle the drugs problem.  It is an ongoing challenge, especially as the drugs situation is dynamic and changing.  Our policies need to be flexible to meet those changes.  Some difficulties and problems still have to be faced, of course.  The level of progress is not always as quick as the Government would like it to be.  It is important, in any debate, to recognise the progress which has been made has resulted from co-operation and partnership.  The communities are central to that process.  Many of the ideas which have been pursued and the programmes which are in operation have originated from people in the communities.  The essence of local drugs task forces is that ideas do not just come down from on high — they come from community people on the ground.  Approximately 650 people who started as activists are now in full-time jobs.  They are working on ideas and programmes on the drugs side and on the young people's side.  Such ideas started at local community level.  There is no point in anyone trying to pretend that such people are not making a significant commitment.I would like to turn my attention to the specific measures we are undertaking as part of the drug-supply reduction area of the strategy.  Drugs law enforcement is a key feature in our overall drug policy framework.  The Government's top policing priority for 2006 continues to be the targeting of organised crime, including drug trafficking and the gun culture with which it is associated.The Garda Síochána has never been as well resourced financially with the 2006 budget reaching an historic high of €1.31 billion.  In particular, the 2006 overtime allocation has risen to €83.5 million which represents an increase of more than 36% above the allocation of €61.1 million for 2005.  This increase will allow the Garda Síochána to further intensify its crime detection and investigation capabilities.The personnel strength of the Garda was recorded at a record level of 12,762 on Friday, 8 September 2006 following the attestation of 249 new members.  The increase in numbers which has been achieved will permit senior Garda management to deploy these extra resources to target areas of concern.  Areas with a significant drug problem will be deemed a particular priority.Significant resources are also being invested in technology for the Garda to assist its members in exercising of their functions.  The capital allocation for IT in 2006 is over €33 million and the allocation for communications is just under €13 million.  This demonstrates the resolute commitment of the Government to invest in the criminal justice system.  This increased Garda manpower and additional funding resources will enable the continuation of successful anti-crime measures to tackle drug trafficking and dealing as seen in Operations Anvil, Cleanstreet, Encounter, Nightcap and Marigold.This Government's approach to policing, as has often been emphasised by the Tánaiste, has always been about more than resources alone and has attached significant importance to the development of a real partnership between the Garda Síochána, the local authorities and the communities they serve.  The introduction of the new joint policing committees and local policing fora, which will be coming on stream under the implementation of the Garda Síochána Act 2005, will realise this on a statutory basis.I would like to use this opportunity to acknowledge the work being done over the last number of years in this regard by the community policing fora which are already in place in the local drug task force areas.  Some of these fora are official but many others operate informally and count Deputies in this House as members.  Much good work has been done and this will grow as such groups adopt an official status.The House should be aware that Garda strategies for dealing with drug offences continue to seriously undermine the activities of organised criminals involved in the trafficking and distribution of illicit drugs.  Investigations carried out under these strategies have led to the arrest in recent times of major criminals based both here and abroad and I can assure the House that the Garda will continue to vigorously pursue such strategies.The House should be advised that the tackling of organised crime and drug trafficking is primarily achieved through the use of specialist units and targeted, intelligence-led operations.  National units such as the Garda national drugs unit, the Criminal Assets Bureau and the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation all have specific roles in reducing drug supply and the material benefits which accrue from drug trafficking.  The Garda national drugs unit also works closely with divisional and district drug units in detecting and preventing the sale of illegal drugs.It is important in this debate to put on record the continued operational successes of both the Garda Síochána and the Customs and Excise in preventing large quantities of drugs arriving in our communities.  Both agencies should be commended on their efforts in this regard in continuing to meet and exceed the drug supply reduction targets set in the national strategy.A number of law enforcement initiatives should be highlighted during this debate for the role they play in disrupting the criminal activities of a number of key criminal gangs and families including those involved in the drugs trade.  Operation Anvil is working well and has already led to a number of high profile arrests and the collection of intelligence on the movements of criminals targeted under special initiatives arising from this operation.  This is an intelligence-led policing initiative, the focus of which is the targeting of active criminals and their associates involved in serious crime.  The initiative aims to prevent and disrupt criminal activity through extensive additional overt patrolling and static check points by uniform, mobile and foot patrols supported by armed plain clothes patrols.  The operation remains in place in the Dublin Metropolitan Region and has been extended nationwide in 2006.Outside the Dublin Metropolitan Region, a series of special operations, prepared by senior Garda managers and designed to focus on areas and incidents of high crime, are also in place.In addition, the Garda Commissioner, in November 2005, augmented the organised crime unit at the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation with an additional 55 gardaí to address the problem of criminal gang activity.  Operations carried out by the unit have resulted in firearms being seized and a number of persons arrested, thereby disrupting their criminal activities.  The Criminal Assets Bureau continues to act as an effective element of our overall enforcement efforts against those involved in organised criminality including drug trafficking.  The most recent report on the agency's work, in 2005, demonstrates its effectiveness.In terms of ensuring that we have robust legislation in place to deal with the threat of drug trafficking, it should be noted that it is already often acknowledged that our legislative package for tackling serious and organised crime is already one of the toughest in Europe.The Criminal Justice Act, recently approved by this House, provides a further comprehensive package of anti-crime measures which will help enhance the powers of the Garda in the investigation and prosecution of offences.  A number of specific provisions in the Act of relevance to this debate include the creation of criminal offences regarding organised crime, the strengthening of provisions on the imposition of the ten year mandatory minimum sentence for drug trafficking, new offences of supplying drugs to prisons and the provision for the establishment of a drug offenders register.In terms of the issues which have been raised on the motion that come under the remit of Revenue's customs service, again we should firstly acknowledge the ongoing operational successes against drug trafficking which the customs authorities continue to achieve.The reported recent seizure in Belgium of 50 kg of heroin, the arrest of three Irish nationals and the seizure of an aircraft based at Weston Aerodrome is a matter of major concern to the Government.  The Minister for Finance has been assured that the Revenue's customs service is continually engaged in the analysis and evaluation of seizure trends, routes and smuggling risks and consequential resource deployment.  Given the scale of international travel, all customs operations are risk-focused and staff are deployed to combat areas of risk on an intelligence led basis.The Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs has also been advised that the monitoring of licensed aerodromes in the State by the Revenue Commissioners is in line with international standards.  However, in light of the concerns raised by the Weston incident, the Revenue Commissioners are reviewing the risks attached to the operation of all licensed aerodromes in the State and have initiated an immediate review of the conditions under which approval is granted to licensed aerodromes.  Furthermore this review will examine options for improving the level of control and prior reporting of arrivals from EU and non-EU countries.  The Government has no intention of resting on its laurels in tackling the ongoing drugs problem.  We will continue to address it in an integrated way under our national drugs strategy using the solid partnership between the statutory, voluntary treatment and community sectors.  In my capacity as Minister of State responsible for the strategy, I must say good work is being done in partnership with the communities.The strategy has been in place since 2001 and the local drugs task forces were set up in 1997 and 1998.  There were 14 initially, as is still the case, and they include 12 in Dublin, one in Bray and one in Cork.  In the past eight or nine years, we have spent over €100 million directly through the 14 local drugs task forces.  The ten regional drugs task forces, which have been operating for the past year or so, are covering a much larger area.  The plans they have submitted have been approved and are to be rolled out over a two-year or three-year period.  These task forces received their first allocation of funding this year and now have full-time co-ordinators doing the relevant work.The Department's young people's facilities and services fund addresses the question of prevention and is responsible for a marvellous amount of good work.  Many less well-off suburbs of Dublin built in the 1960s and 1970s and inner-city developments had very poor facilities for young people.  Too often one hears young people saying there is nothing to do, which to them is an excuse for getting involved in drugs.  To date, the Government has spent over €100 million to provide facilities in disadvantaged areas.  Capital funding has resulted in more sports and youth facilities and there are now many staff, including sports development officers and youth workers, helping to divert youths from drug-taking and to offer them healthy lifestyle alternatives.The local drugs task forces and the young people's facilities and services fund have led to the employment of 650 staff.  They represent a great resource and, while some say it is not enough, seven to nine years ago not many people were asked how many workers they believed would be necessary on the ground to try to deal adequately with the drugs problem.  The 650 staff are not employed on a statutory basis but employed in 400 odd projects, the ideas for which emerged from local communities and the local drugs task forces.  They are doing a lot of work.Some €14 million has been spent on the premises fund to date and it helps to provide accommodation for drug treatment services.  Today I opened a project in Ballymun which had received approximately €1.4 million through the fund to provide facilities for staff and their clients with drug problems.  The projects that existed previously in Ballymun were in basement flats and it is therefore good to see the staff and clients are now in very modern office accommodation.  There is no reason somebody who happens to have a drugs problem should not be treated well.The emerging needs fund started small and was originally intended to fund new projects to combat cocaine use.  However, it ultimately funded 67 projects and another €4 million has been committed.  The ideas for the projects came from the community.This year's budget under the drugs head in the Estimates of the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs amounted to €43 million, which represents an increase of approximately 36% or 37% over the figure for last year.  Very few budget heads in any Department refer to increases of over 30% in a given year.  The aforementioned sum is not the only sum being spent on combating drugs because it represents only a very small proportion.  All the programmes in the Department are pilot programmes initially and when they are evaluated they are mainstreamed and the funding is transferred to the Departments of Health and Children, Justice, Equality and Law Reform or Education and Science, or to the local authorities.If one considers what has been mainstreamed, one will note that approximately €70 million is being spent every year on projects that began at community level.  This is in addition to the €80 million or €90 million being spent by the HSE and the sums being spent by the Garda and other bodies.  Over €200 million of taxpayers' money is spent per year under the four or five pillars in the fight against drugs.  More may be needed but the existing provision represents a great resource.I am often asked what we have to show for the €200 million being spent per year or whether it is just money down the drain.  The ROSIE study, carried out by the National Advisory Committee on Drugs, tracked 400 people in receipt of drug services for over a year.  It demonstrated that after a year, they had benefited in a very positive way from the services on offer.  Some of them had come off drugs and some had not, but a very high percentage of those who had not were using fewer drugs and were much more conscious of the health risks they posed.  They were much more aware of the danger of sharing needles and other paraphernalia and were involved in far fewer crimes.  Generally, they were getting their act together so they could make a contribution to their families and communities.  The study showed clearly that drug treatment works.We all have a responsibility to encourage drug services in our communities and to be brave occasionally.  Recently, a certain election candidate for Fine Gael in Dublin West, who is a doctor, no less——

Certain candidates may run for election on such an issue and try to lead those affected over the cliff, but one would expect a doctor, who ought to have an understanding of such matters, to adopt a different approach.  The sort of carry-on whereby candidates thinking of possible votes try to scare middle-aged and middle-class people into being concerned about the possible dangers associated with drug treatment programmes is unacceptable.We offer drug treatment on three scales, the first of which involves big clinics.  The second involves using the local health clinic for an hour or two in the evening and the third involves doctors prescribing treatment to be dispensed by the local chemist.  There are many chemists dispensing it and nobody needs to know.  People go to chemist shops for all sorts of treatment and I would hate to see the day on which individuals stand outside them and ask those entering why they are going in.  In this regard, the Fine Gael candidate's performance was disgraceful.  It was pathetic given the knowledge he possesses as a doctor, and I hope sincerely that Deputy English has spoken to him and tried to sort him out.

If we try to lump them all into one area, we create a great problem.  We should all be brave.  That was a big problem in Dublin.  It now may have moved to other parts of the country.  Everybody here involved in this issue should quote the ROSIE study.  If people have a drug problem, they either steal to feed the habit or they become mini-dealers and recruit disciples to the cause.  The best approach is through treatment.I commend the Government amendment to the House.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	272	The Minister of State finished on time, despite spending a considerable amount of time off-script.  It shows, at least, that he is interested in the drugs problem and is probably aware of how serious it is.  He is probably quietly ashamed of the Government in this regard, as I am.  One of the biggest failures of the two parties in Government over the last ten years is the outright mess that exists as regards drugs.  In that respect I certainly agree with the motion tabled by the Independent Deputies and I will touch on a few facts and figures, accordingly.The position regarding drugs is a disaster.  The Minister of State talked about the need to be brave, and I agree with him.  I do not agree with what that doctor said.  I accept he wants a debate about it and the matter needs to be highlighted and talked about.  The Government does not do this sufficiently.  The Minister of State is not brave enough to have a realistic debate about drugs.  He said "We must address the issue in a realistic and measured way which takes account of the extent, complexity and multifaceted nature of the problem."  We did not have that from the Minister of State who is far from reality every time he talks to the House about drugs and what the Government is doing about it.  That is the problem.It would be very brave of him to come in here and face the facts so we might have a good discussion about how we might work together to solve the problem.  That is not happening.  Not enough is being done interdepartmentally and among leaders of society as regards saying how dangerous is the drug threat.  It is almost a taboo subject.  The Minister of State is almost the only person on the Government side who ever talks about drugs.  It should be uppermost in the mind of every Minister to try to deter people from going down the drugs route.  There is no interdepartmental effort as regards drugs.  The Department of Health and Children has virtually disappeared when it comes to tackling drugs.  Still, the Minister of State asks people to be brave.This is one of the massive failures of the Government.  I shall correct the Minister as regards one figure, since we were attempting to clarify how much had been spent.  He mentioned €200 million.  He appears to have jumped €5 million in the last week.  He answered a question last week to the effect that the figure was up to €195 million, so that €5 million seems to have arrived out of nowhere.  The Minister of State in reply to a question as regards drugs said: "Overall, I am satisfied that current Government expenditure on drugs is sufficient to meet the needs of those involved in tackling the effects and misuse of drugs."  That is a joke, which is proven by the fact Ireland is ranked towards the top of the European drug league for cocaine and Ecstasy use according to a UN report in 2005 — not 20 years ago when the Minister of State is convinced this drugs problem started.  The problem has to be fixed now.   The World Drug Report 2005 puts Ireland in joint third place for cocaine use and joint sixth place for Ecstasy use out of 230 states.  Ireland had a higher annual drugs prevalence rate than the world average for four of the main five illegal drugs.  As regards Europe, Ireland is above the average for three of the five drugs, cannabis, Ecstasy and the opiates, mainly heroin.Irish teenagers are much more likely to use cannabis than their counterparts in other European countries, according to a Government report.  An Oireachtas committee report published earlier this year found that 38% of Irish 16-year olds have used cannabis at least once.  As many as 5,000 16-year olds admit to using the drug at least thee times per month, double the EU average.  The Oireachtas report also found that as many as 300,000 people regularly used cannabis, with 10% admitting to being dependent on the drug.  That is the reality and the Minister of State says he is happy with what the Government is doing and with the money being spent in this area.  If we do not seriously tackle the issue the only culture many people will know in Ireland will be a drug culture.  That is how serious the problem is.  Parents do not realise yet how serious it is, because the reality of the drug problem is being down played deliberately by the Government and hidden at every turn.  That is a shame because I do not think the Minister of State believes matters are as good as he says they are.  He knows how bad things are but is not allowed to say it, and that is even more of a shame.  We must face reality or the problem will never be tackled properly.Let us examine some of the targets of the national drugs strategy: a reduction of 0.5% in 2007 in the estimated prevalence of opiates, based on the 2001 data; a reduction of 5% by 2007 in the prevalence rate of recent and current use of illicit drugs in the general population based on the 2002-03 rate; substance use policies in place in 100% of schools; and early school leaving in local drug task force areas to reduce by 10%, based on the 2005-06 data.  It appears unlikely that three of these four targets will be reached.  They were not even mentioned.  The Minister of State only referred to one of them, concerning schools and substance abuse, which was a start.  I have only picked four items from the drugs strategy.  The Minister of State had half an hour to tell the House how well we were succeeding, and he did not do that.  Instead, we got a lecture probably written by the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, in relation to his Garda figures.  Again, it was more waffle about how great the money is and how much it has increased over the last couple of years.He said the amounts being spent on Garda resources were historic.  We are living in historic times.  The population has grown seriously in the last couple of years.  Do we even realise what is happening in the greater Dublin region?  The Minister, Deputy McDowell, does not leave Dublin.  He would not know what is happening outside it.In my town, Navan, there are less gardaí now than there were 23 years ago, yet the population is three times what it was.  That is historic, and we need an historic amount spent in that regard.  The Minister of State need not quote the increased Garda budget to me as the solution to the drugs crisis.

The reality is far from that.  There is a massive cocaine problem.  It runs to billions of euro and the Minister of State is quoted as saying €200 million is being spent in tackling it.  Some €200 million in profits are being made every weekend in the sale of drugs.  If we want to tackle the problem, real money must be spent on real resources or we will not win the war on drugs.  This Government has to declare war on drugs once and for all.  The current position cannot continue.The Minister of State mentions people on treatment and quotes the study which shows great results for people who are getting treatment, and how beneficial it is.  Yet only half of heroin users are on methadone and more than half cannot get treatment.  Only a few hundred beds are available to get people fully off drugs.

The reality is that there is a serious problem, but the Minister of State does not admit that.  He should not try to quote international figures to defend it.  That is not good enough.  According to his own figures on the waiting lists for methadone treatment from May 2006, some people are waiting 18 months to start a maintenance programme — not for treatment for drugs, just a maintenance programme to keep the habit at bay.  The average wait is six months to a year, and yet the Minister of State can tell the House about the great study that was done which shows that treatment works.  If it works why do we not increase its availability?  He mentioned access to methadone and clinics all around the country.  There are 76 methadone treatment centres in Dublin and 16 outside the capital.  It is not very easy to get it, and yet the Minister of State talks about it as if everything were grand and freely available in every town.  That is not the case, because not enough is being done to encourage pharmacists and doctors to participate and implement the programme.  It is a failure and the Minister of State should admit this.I will not touch on the mental health area because Deputy Neville will speak on that.  I have two quick points to make.  Every time there is a drugs seizure, and someone is shot or affected by drugs, we are told the person concerned is known to the Garda.  People who are dealing in drugs all around the country are known to the Garda.  They are known to the Minister of State and everyone else in the various areas and yet nothing can be done.  Surely to God the law can be changed or something can be done to get such people off the streets, since they are known by the Garda to be drug dealers.

It is not good enough that people known to gardaí are running round the streets every night of the week.

One can stand in estates and watch people going to collect their drugs.  That is how obvious it is, yet these people who are known to gardaí cannot be touched.  There is something seriously wrong there.RAPID is also part of the Minister of State's responsibilities.  We recently discussed where the money is being spent and while it is sometimes hard to follow where the money is going and what results are being achieved, it seems to be working in some areas.  However, the planning of our housing estates is bringing us down the same route again.  Houses are been thrown in all over the place.  We have not learned from experience.  In years to come, RAPID areas will be three times the size they are now if we do not learn from the mistakes we made in the past.  Young people need a community — not just hundreds of houses built in estate after estate — with facilities they can access at an affordable price.  This is not happening.  Instead, we are creating more areas for drug dealers to peddle death.  We are not tackling it properly.
#OlwynEnrightFG	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-party	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-dob	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	287	I want to deal with this from the perspective of prevention and treatment.  I commend the gardaí for the work they are doing in this area.  I endorse the point Deputy English made that this is only the tip of the iceberg.  I have spoken to gardaí both in Dublin and in my constituency.  Drugs sales on the streets of Dublin are a non-stop, 24-hour operation.  The gardaí arrest the peddlers and bring them to court, but by the end of the day the same people are back selling on the streets.  There are units of the gardaí in this city that do not have 24-hour cover for their drugs squads.  Those peddling drugs know that the gardaí cannot possibly deal with the situation on that basis.In 2004, An Garda Síochána had two drugs trained sniffer dogs in the whole country.  These dogs had to be booked in advance.  What was one to do if one wanted to conduct a drugs search in south-west Cork?  Book the dogs two weeks in advance and hope that the ship landed on that particular night?  It is just not practical.  Gardaí cannot do their jobs with such resources.  I know there are now a few extra dogs but it is no more than a handful.There must also be an attitudinal change regarding drugs.  This is not a criticism of the Government.  There is still an assumption that drugs are a phenomenon restricted to disadvantaged areas, and I acknowledge that it is particularly severe in some areas.  However, it is just as much a middle-class problem as anything else.  I link it to the notion of child pornography.  Just because someone does not see the child in front of them does not mean the child has not suffered elsewhere in making the pornographic material.  Likewise, just because an individual is not breaking into someone's home to fund their drug habit does not mean that the consequences for communities are any less.  I do not think the public sufficiently accepts this principle.  People think it is all right if they are using drugs in the privacy of their own sitting rooms.  It is not right and the consequences are just the same.My biggest criticism is the lack of treatment places.  I know people in my constituency of Laois-Offaly who have been on a treatment waiting list for a year.  I have met mothers whose sons and daughters have agreed to go on a treatment programme.  They go through the hoops only to discover they will have to wait a year to get on the programme.  Those parents fear their children will die before they get onto a programme.  It is difficult to give a real answer to those people.  I cannot give them any words of comfort.  I cannot help them skip up a place on the treatment programme waiting list because someone else will lose out.  The doctor in the Laois-Offaly treatment centre spends a day and a half in Portlaoise, another day and a half in Athlone, and the rest of the time is spent catching up on paperwork.  He cannot take any more patients because of safety considerations and no other doctor is willing to come in.  There is no point in shrugging our shoulders; it is a problem we have to address.  We must put doctors in place by whatever means.

It is too late for the Minister of State to say that they have to be trained.  The Government has been in office for nine and a half years.  It has had its chance to do this but has not done so.I know what the Minister of State means when he says that young people will claim there is nothing to do.  While I acknowledge money has been spent to address this aspect, there are still places where young people genuinely have nothing to do.  They will get into trouble if there is nothing to do.  Providing one skateboard park for teenagers in County Offaly is fantastic.  Great improvements have been made in the provision of playgrounds.  However, children lose interest in playgrounds by the age of ten or 11.  After that, there are not sufficient resources available for young people.  The youth work sector has not been sufficiently resourced.  This must be addressed as it will prevent young people from embarking on a chain of events.  It is not the case that there is plenty for young people to do now.  I can empathise with them when I hear them say that they have nothing to do.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	291	I welcome the opportunity to address this debate and congratulate the Technical Group on tabling it.  Today is World Mental Health Day.  I asked for a debate today on this serious national issue.  However, the Ceann Comhairle decided, as is his right, that this is not a serious national issue.  I believe that the lack of resources being invested in our psychiatric services is a serious national issue.  The Government has failed to respect the human rights of people with mental illness.  The psychiatric service is out of step with international best practices and, as such, fails to comply with international human rights law.More than 50% of young people who die by suicide have a history of drug or alcohol abuse.  Many young people who consider suicide suffer from depression.  Suicide is not random.  Each one occurs for a particular reason, such as depression or drug or alcohol abuse.  Studying such high risk groups is an important way to prevent suicide.  Studies have shown that young adults who drink heavily or have a high level of drug abuse have an increased risk of suicide in middle adulthood.  People who are dependent on alcohol or drugs have an increased risk of death from accidents, disease and suicide.  Suicide is among the most significant causes of death in both male and females who are substance abusers.  The strongest risk factors for attempted suicide in adults are depression, alcohol abuse, cocaine use and separation or marriage break-up.  The strongest risk or factors for attempted suicide in young people are depression, drug abuse, alcohol abuse and drug use disorder, including binge drinking, substance abuse and aggressive and disruptive behaviour.The frequency of suicide attempts among substance abusers is five times greater than the frequency among people who do not abuse substances.  This is particularly true for alcoholics.  Major depression is 50% more common among alcoholics than non-alcoholics.  Most people drink alcohol or use drugs such as cocaine to reduce feelings of depression.  However, drinking and drug use can actually lead to greater anxiety, depression and thoughts of suicide.  Many people recovering from heroin addiction make suicide attempts.  Drug abusers often have feelings of being unwell or unhappy.  Although these feelings may not last long enough to qualify as a major depression, they may nonetheless increase drug abusers' risks of attempting suicide.  In addition, there is a relationship between injecting drugs and suicide attempts.Addicts who inject drugs are aware that they are engaging in high risk behaviour and may be less concerned about their overall well-being.  Alcoholics and drugs addicts often lose their jobs and have troubled relationships.  These problems increase the risks of making a suicide attempt.  The major risk factors for completed suicide among alcoholics and drug abusers are current drinking and drug use, major depression, suicidal thoughts, loss of support from families, living alone and unemployment.Unlike many of the other issues surrounding this problem, less is known about the way these risk factors affect other substance abusers.  Psychiatric conditions such as depression and schizophrenia play an important role in suicide of alcoholics and drug abusers.  The vast majority of suicide victims have symptoms of depression at the time of their death.  I will conclude but I had much more to contribute to the debate on this issue.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	292	I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for choosing this matter.  I raise it to ask the Minister for Health and Children if she is aware that the orthodontic services in the Cork-Kerry region have been severely curtailed by the departure of two dentists from the service; if she is concerned that the delay in replacing those dentists has led to the closure of the five year waiting list in this region for children to see an orthodontist; and if she will make a statement on the matter.That the Minister for Health and Children has not come into the House to hear the debate, despite receiving almost 24 hours notice, is not just disappointing but a reflection of how seriously she takes this issue.  I appreciate that the Minister of State at the Department, Deputy Tim O'Malley, is here to respond but it is not his responsibility.  The Minister, Deputy Harney, should hear this debate.Children who are waiting over four years for specialist dental treatment in the Cork-Kerry area will face further backlogs because of the delay in replacing two dentists who have left the service.  Those dentists did not leave the service of their own volition.  They were removed from their posts for further training and now train at the dental school.  Those dentists were in their positions for ten years.  There was no reason they could not have received on-the-job training but the dental service, and particularly the orthodontic service, is organised in such a way that it does not benefit the clients of the public dental service.The current situation in Cork and Kerry is intolerable.  The Minister should take note of what I am about to tell him but he is probably already aware of it, although he will not admit it.  A total of 4,201 people are awaiting assessment.  I am talking about children aged 12 to 16 years.  A total of 3,524 are in Cork and 677 are in Kerry.  A total of 3,558 patients are awaiting treatment.  A total of 7,759 children are waiting to have their teeth examined.  That is appalling.  Of those, 72 patients in Cork and 171 patients in Kerry have been waiting more than four years for treatment.  Those children are approaching their 16th birthday and will very soon be out of the scope of that service.On the treatment waiting list, in the Cork region 767 people are waiting one to two years; 820 are waiting two to three years; 412 are waiting three to four years; and 72 are waiting four years and more.  That is a total for Cork of 2,642.  In Kerry, 173 people have been waiting one year, 262 have been waiting one to two years, 129 have been waiting two to three years, 181 have been waiting three to four years and 171 have been waiting four years and more.  That is a total of 916.  In total, 3,558 people are on a waiting list of between one and four years.Patients are divided into three categories — A, B and C.  Urgent cases — patients with cleft palate — are in category A.  Patients with a large overbite are in category B and patients with severe overcrowding are in category C.  Incidentally, overcrowding can often be as detrimental to one's dental health as an overbite, sometimes it can be worse.  The patients in category A begin treatment immediately but the less urgent categories — B and C — are placed on the waiting list to which I have just referred.  The children with what are considered less serious complaints such as overcrowding must wait a lengthy period.Failure to deal with this waiting list means that increasing numbers of patients are forced to seek private treatment at enormous cost.  Parents are taking out loans to avoid their children suffering from low self-esteem because of dental problems.  Also, according to orthodontists in the Cork-Kerry region, the Department has been urging them to narrow the criteria so that it is more difficult for people to be eligible for treatment.  The problem in Cork has been further compounded by the block on the Cork Dental School training programme, which is forbidden from training dentists to orthodontic level until a professor of orthodontics is appointed.  The delay in that regard is scandalous.  We were talking about that ten years ago but the problem persists.In recent years progress has been made in reducing the waiting time.  That was only as a result of the total dedication of a number of dentists but the waiting list has been closed and any improvements made have been set aside and will be set aside even further as a result of the delay in producing two more dentists to fit into the dental scheme.  I understand no children are being assessed currently.  The Minister must outline the way the Department will deal with this crisis.I would point out to the Minister of State that a similar situation as this one occurred in Dublin five years ago.  At that time the waiting list had been reduced from approximately 18,000 to 6,000 but because of the lack of urgency in replacing the two dentists involved at that time, 1,000 children whose braces were left on for too long a period without further examination ended up with severely damaged teeth as a result of the Department's inaction.  I hope the Minister of State will have some good news for the children of Cork and Kerry tonight.

The Minister and I are aware of the waiting list for orthodontic treatment in HSE south.  We are pleased to note that in the period June 2002 to June 2006, there has been a decrease of 2,326 in the assessment waiting list in this area.  At the end of March 2006 there were almost 25,000 patients receiving orthodontic treatment in the public orthodontic service nationally.  Over twice as many patients are getting orthodontic treatment as there are waiting to be treated.  Nearly 7,000 extra patients are getting treatment now compared to four years ago.  This tangible improvement will be further enhanced as the HSE develops the orthodontic services.Developing the quality, standards, treatment capacity and outcomes of our orthodontic services in a sustainable way are objectives shared by the Department and the HSE.  To ensure the best use of resources and develop treatment capacity in a sustainable manner, guidelines were introduced by the Department to enable the HSE to prioritise resources for those with the severest orthodontic condition.The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children carried out a review of orthodontic services in Ireland which culminated in the publication of its report, The Orthodontic Service in Ireland, in 2002.  The joint Oireachtas committee has also published a follow up to its 2002 report in June 2005.The HSE has established a national orthodontic review group to draw together an agreed national approach under four principal headings: guidelines, training, service provision and manpower planning.  The group consists of representatives from the Department, the dental schools in Cork and Dublin and consultant orthodontists and management from the HSE.  The Minister and I are advised that this review group will conclude its report in the coming months and that will guide the implementation of service improvements in the coming year in line with the recommendations contained in the joint Oireachtas committee reports.Training more orthodontists will make a significant impact on the increasing demand for orthodontic treatment.  Until recently there was only one centre in this country offering a postgraduate course in orthodontics, the Dublin Dental School.  The HSE is now funding the post of Professor of Orthodontics at the University Dental School and Hospital in Cork to the tune of €1 million.  This has enabled the establishment of a postgraduate training programme in orthodontics in Cork, which has commenced with the first intake of four postgraduate students this month.  This training programme will provide services for an agreed cohort of patients on the north Cork waiting list, which will help to reduce the waiting times for orthodontic assessment and treatment in the area.The HSE will recruit a specialist orthodontist to replace the dentists who have been successful in securing specialist training places.  The HSE south is also developing proposals on a waiting list initiative to reduce waiting times and ensure that treatment programmes commenced by the two dentists leaving the service will be completed in a timely fashion.  Orthodontics is unique in that the treatment period for a child is between 18 and 24 months and each year thousands of children, with varying degrees of need, are placed on assessment waiting lists.  Our aim is to continue to make progress and to develop a high quality, reliable, sustainable service in HSE south and all other areas of the executive for children and their parents.
#JerryCowleyIND	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-party	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-dob	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	294	I am grateful for the opportunity to raise the delay of BreastCheck for the women of Mayo, a matter I raised on my first occasion speaking in Dáil Éireann.  It is scandalous and unforgivable that hundreds of women have died and at least 300 more will die before BreastCheck is available to women in Mayo.  The former Minister, Deputy Martin, stated that BreastCheck would be available throughout the country by 2001 or 2002 at the latest.  Many deadlines have passed since then and last month the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, stated that BreastCheck would be available at the start of 2007.  This would be eight years after it was in place for almost half the population of Ireland.  Today, we read in the newspaper that BreastCheck will not be available until the end of 2007.These deadlines are more examples of broken promises by the Government, which does not give a damn about the women of Mayo.  I have seen these people as patients, and women could have availed of three screenings if the service had been available.  I know women who have died.  There are hundreds of them in the south and west and at least 300 more will die before this negligent Government sets up BreastCheck.  In 2003 I brought the board and executive of BreastCheck before the Joint Committee on Health and Children, of which I was a member.  Dr. Sheelagh Ryan, chairperson of the BreastCheck board and the former Western Health Board, stated that no one should question the Government's commitment and that the service would be in place by 2005.  So much for the commitments of the Government, which are worth nothing.There is no reason that this service should not have been extended to the entire country in 2000.  I have spearheaded the campaign for the extension of BreastCheck but I have not made much progress.  If we could find a drug that would save the lives of hundreds of women, would we not want to make it available?  That drug is the extension of BreastCheck and it has not been provided.  This is scandalous and negligent and I hope someone sues every Minister in this Government for everything they have.  People need and deserve this service.The Government would pay lip service to the abolition of apartheid in South Africa but what about apartheid in Ireland, apartheid in Mayo and apartheid for the women in the south and west of Ireland?  Some 700 women die of breast cancer each year, yet 20 years of evidence proves that screenings can reduce the mortality rate of breast cancer cases by 20% to 30%.  This was achieved in Northern Ireland by 1998, where the mortality rate for the disease was reduced by 20%, and in Scotland, where it was reduced by 30%.The Government stated that it was better to provide the service properly than not to do it at all, but I disagree with that strongly.  BreastCheck was made available to only half the population of Ireland and predictably it was the half on the east coast.  There is no excuse for this because research from the USA and Europe demonstrated that mortality rates can be reduced.  The service was not extended because of money, filthy lucre.We will not tolerate any more delays.  When we held a march, an extension to BreastCheck was announced within 48 hours.  Of course, it never happened, but I can guarantee another march on the Dáil.  I want to hear when the people of Mayo will be able to avail of this service and how many more must die before it is provided.

The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, met representatives of BreastCheck and they are fully aware of her wish to have a quality assured programme provided for the remaining regions in the country as quickly as possible.  Essential elements of the roll-out must be in place, including adequate staffing, effective training and quality assurance programmes.  At a meeting with Department officials this morning, BreastCheck reported that significant progress has been made in preparation for the roll-out.  Additional revenue funding of €2.3 million has been made available to BreastCheck to meet additional costs of roll-out and an additional 69 posts have been approved.  BreastCheck has appointed clinical directors for the southern and western regions and both will take up their positions in November of this year.  The clinical directors are currently undergoing additional training.  The recruitment of consultants and other staff, including radiographers, is under way.BreastCheck requires considerable capital investment in the construction of two new clinical units and in the provision of five additional mobile units and state-of-the-art digital equipment.  An additional €21 million in capital funding has been made available to BreastCheck for this purpose.  BreastCheck reported this morning that it has appointed construction contractors for the static units at the South Infirmary Victoria University Hospital, Cork, and University College Hospital Galway.  The BreastCheck clinical unit in the western area at University College Hospital Galway will have two associated mobile units.  Almost 58,000 women are in the target population for invitation to screening.A breast screening programme is a complex, multidisciplinary undertaking that requires considerable expertise and management involving population registers, call and recall systems, mammography, pathology and appropriate treatment and follow-up.  A programme must be quality assured and acceptable to women who attend for screening.  The first phase of the programme is of a high quality, and a similar quality in the south and the west is essential.  BreastCheck is confident that the target of next year for the commencement of roll-out to the southern and western regions will be met.  However, it has advised the Department that it is not possible to issue timelines for individual counties at this stage.

Tá mé ag caint faoin ghéarghá le freagra dearfach ar iarratas an chomhairle bainistíochta Gaelscoil Dara, An Rinn Mhór, cathair na Gaillimhe.  An rud atá fíor-phráinneach anois ná buan-chóiríocht a chur ar fáil don scoil.  Tá an scoil ann le 21 bliain agus ag an phointe seo, fiú go bhfuil a lán litreacha curtha go dtí an Roinn, níl sé soiléir an bhfuil suíomh aimsithe aici, cá bhfuil an suíomh aimsithe, cé mhéid acra atá ag baint leis agus cén toradh a bhí ar na cainteanna idir an Roinn agus na Bráithre Carthanachta.Tá mé ag cur na gceisteanna seo toisc go bhfuil na tuismitheoirí, múinteoirí agus na daltaí ag cur suas le caighdeán scolaíochta nach bhfuil ceart le níos mó ná 20 bliain.  Tá freagra dearfach ag teastáil ón bhord bainistíochta, ón phríomhoide, ó na múinteoirí agus ó na tuismitheoirí ar na nithe a luaigh mé.  Cathain a bheidh an suíomh aimsithe?  Cé mhéad acra atá ag baint leis?  An bhfuil sé aimsithe ag an Roinn go bhfuil le suíomh trí acra a oireann do 16 múinteoir nó an bhfuil suíomh níos lú ná sin i gceist?I raise this matter because it concerns Gaelscoil Dara.  Its pupils have put up with temporary accommodation for 22 years.  The parents, teachers, children and board of management should not have to wait any longer for an answer to definite questions.  What potential sites in Galway were examined by the Department of Education and Science?  What conclusions did it draw, what decisions did it arrive at, what decisions remain to be taken and what is the size of the site under discussion?  Is it three acres and is it suitable for 16 teachers?  Is it less than three acres?  Where is it located?  Can the board of management have access to the maps and details of the site under discussion?  When will the final decision be taken in respect of this necessary school?What will happen if, for example, more than one site has been examined?  Mention has been made of the site held by the Brothers of Charity.  If another site is being examined, such as the site owned by the Galway Institute of Technology, what is the position in respect of both sites, their scale and the timescale for delivery?  If there are any further technical difficulties, as has been mentioned in correspondence about this school, what are they?  When can we look forward to their resolution?  This matter is of the utmost urgency.  It has dragged on for almost all of my years as a Deputy representing Galway West.  It concerns the provision of a proper and permanent home for this gaelscoil, which makes such an outstanding contribution to language, culture and basic education in Galway city.

Dá ainneoin sin, tá sé léirithe ag an Rialtas ó chuaigh sé i mbun oifige go bhfuil rún daingean acu feabhas a chur ar bhail ár gcuid foirgneamh scoile agus a chinntiú go bhfuil na saoráidí cuí ann chun gur féidir curaclam leathan cothrom a chur i ngníomh.Mar fhianaise ar an rún daingean sin, beidh tuairim is 1,300 tionscadal foirgníochta agus athchóirithe ar siúl inár gcuid bunscoileanna agus scoileanna iar-bhunoideachais le linn na bliana 2006.  I mbliana, tá thart ar €500 milliún á chaitheamh ar na tionscadail bhunoideachais agus iar-bhunoideachais ar fud na tíre i gcomparáid le tuairim is €90 milliún sa bhliain 1997.Tá mé cinnte go n-aontóidh an Teachta gurb ionann an leibhéal seo infheistíochta, nach raibh a leithéid ann roimhe seo, agus comhartha dearfach ar an ardtosaíocht a thugann an Rialtas don earnáil seo.  Chun laghdú a dhéanamh ar mhaorlathas agus chun gur féidir tionscadail a chur i gcrích ar shlí níos tapúla, tá an fhreagracht as tionscadail bheaga tugtha do scoileanna.

#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	299	I thank the Leas-Chean Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter.  I previously raised this issue on the Adjournment on 28 April 2005 and have raised it with the Minister during Question Time on a number of occasions since then, but to no avail.  Despite welcoming the Minister of State, I am disappointed the Minister for Education and Science is not here this evening.  It reflects the interest in this subject.  At least a Minister of State from the Department should be here.The present enrolment at Scoil Eoin, Balloonagh, is 614 students.  Of those students, 54% are accommodated in prefabricated buildings which are 20 years old.  That amounts to 331 students.  A further 24% of the students, more than 147 children, are accommodated in a building built 46 years ago which has never been modernised.  A further 22% of the students, or 135 children, are accommodated in a building between 86 and 116 years old.  That building has never been modernised either.In 2000, it was agreed the long-term accommodation needs for Scoil Eoin would be to provide accommodation for a staffing of principal plus 22 mainstream teachers and ancillary staff.  In 2001, the Department commissioned a feasibility study, which was carried out by Healy & Partners, Limerick.  Five options for a rebuild were proposed.  A meeting was held in Tullamore on 26 September 2002 between Department officials and the board of management to discuss the options.  Unfortunately, despite the urgency of the situation, no further development of the project has taken place.One of the main reasons for a rebuild is to accommodate all students in one permanent modern building.  The Tuairisc Scoile report of 1999 concluded:The school has been carefully maintained and looked after and is indeed a credit to all who have had responsibility for its upkeep.  However, there is need here for a major improvement in accommodation.  It is anticipated that the adjacent post-primary school will move to new premises within a few years.  This would facilitate a re-development of this important educational centre to provide modern classroom facilities, better entrance and parking arrangements, and overall refurbishment of the existing accommodation.In 2000, a report on the mechanical and electrical services in Scoil Eoin, commissioned by the Department of Education and Science, reached the following conclusion.  I want to emphasise this because it is a major health and safety issue and an argument for the provision of a new school at Scoil Eoin:We believe it is of paramount importance to install a completely new electrical system in the entire school complex.  The present electrical system falls very much short of the requirements of current electrical regulations.  A new electrical system is the most satisfactory way in which the safety and integrity of the electrical services at the school can be guaranteed and in which the school will have an electrical system which complies with current stringent ETCI, RECI and ESB regulations.Department of Education and Science planning guidelines for primary schools recommend a minimum area of 76 sq. m, made up of 70 sq. m for teaching and wet play area and 6 sq. m for two toilet cubicles.  None of the permanent classrooms in the school meets these criteria in area or en-suite facilities.The energy rating of the school does not reach minimum standards.  ESB and heating bills at Scoil Eoin are exorbitant.  Evidence of this is available from the principal on request.  Maintenance costs are also mounting due to the ageing structure.  The ESB bill, which does not include oil, is approximately €3,500 every month.  The building has no insulation and is completely outdated.The issue of parking provision and set-down areas at the school must be addressed urgently as the volume of traffic outside Scoil Eoin has increased dramatically in recent times.  Due to the fact the school is divided into five different buildings, it is difficult to keep cohesion between staff and students.  In winter months the buildings are cold.  Conditions are particularly miserable in wet weather because the school has so many external doors and students and staff must travel between buildings throughout the day.I hope the Minister of State will state more than the information I was given in April 2005.  I want definite news for the principal, the board of management, the parents, the teachers and particularly for the children.  This will be a case for the Ombudsman and the courts unless the Department of Education and Science is prepared to act.

Nonetheless, since taking office the Government has shown focused determination to improve the condition of our school buildings and ensure the appropriate facilities are in place to enable the implementation of a broad and balanced curriculum.As evidence of this commitment approximately 1,300 building and modernisation projects will be active in our primary and post-primary schools during 2006.  This year alone, approximately €500 million will be spent on primary and post-primary projects throughout the country, compared to approximately €90 million in 1997.  I am sure the Deputy will agree this record level of investment is a positive testament to the high priority the Government attaches to this sector.Turning to the specific matter in hand, Scoil Eoin, Balloonagh is designated an all-girls' primary school which caters for infant boys to first class.  The school had a September 2005 enrolment of 608 pupils.  The September 2006 enrolment has yet to be confirmed in the October returns to the Department of Education and Science.  However, I understand enrolments are stable at this school.The school authority applied to the Department of Education and Science to relocate to the adjacent secondary school campus which became vacant with the opening of the new secondary school at Mounthawk.  When the application was initially assessed in the Department it was agreed the long-term accommodation needs for Scoil Eoin would be to provide——

A feasibility study was received which outlines a number of options for the future development of Scoil Eoin.  To ensure the appropriate level of accommodation is provided, the Department is re-assessing the long-term projected staffing figure on which accommodation needs will be based.  Once the long-term projected staffing figure is agreed, a technical visit of the site and buildings will be carried out by Department officials with a view to determining how best to deliver the required accommodation.  As soon as a decision is taken on the best solution to meet the school's current and future accommodation needs, the project will be progressed in the context of the school building and modernisation programme 2006-10.I thank the Deputy for providing me with the opportunity to outline the position on this particular school project and to highlight the enormous work undertaken by the Department of Education and Science in implementing the school building and modernisation programme to ensure infrastructure of the highest standard is available for all our schoolgoing population.

A second inspector was assigned to the Bureau in August, 2006.There are no figures available for savings specifically due to Operation Gull.  However the work of the Social Welfare Inspectors assigned to the Garda National Immigration Bureau resulted in the termination of 234 social welfare claims in 2004 which achieved savings of  €1.46 million, the termination of 591 social welfare claims in 2005 which achieved savings of  €2.47 million and the termination of 488 social welfare claims in 2006 (to end September) which achieved savings of €2.51 million.  Operation Gull is an example of the benefits of inter agency co-operation and my Department will continue to support such operations in every possible way.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	306	The social welfare pension rights of those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties are protected by the homemakers scheme which was introduced from 1994. The scheme allows up to 20 years spent caring for children or incapacitated adults to be disregarded when a person's social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes. However, the scheme will not of itself qualify a person for a pension. The  standard qualifying conditions, which require a person to enter insurance 10 years before pension age, pay a minimum of 260 contributions at the correct rate and achieve a yearly average of at least 10 contributions on their record from the time they enter insurance until they reach pension age must also be satisfied. Accordingly, the scheme will not benefit someone whose social insurance record includes only contributions at the modified rather than the full rate.In general, the social insurance class paid by those who were required to retire because of the marriage bar was a modified rate which now gives coverage for widow(er)'s and orphan's pensions and occupational injury benefit, bereavement grant and carer's benefit only. This level of coverage reflected their occupational pension position and general contract of service at that time. Accordingly, even if they had continued in employment, contributions paid at this class would not have entitled them to an old age pension under the social welfare system.That said, the Government is anxious to ensure that as many people as possible can qualify for contributory pensions in their own right. A number of measures have been introduced over the years which make it easier for people to qualify for contributory pensions. These include the reduction in the yearly average number of contributions required for pension purposes from 20 to 10 and the introduction of special half rate pensions based on pre-53 insurance contributions. Pro-rata pensions are also available to allow people with mixed rate insurance records to receive a payment.This set of measures is of particular benefit to women who may have less than complete social insurance records due to working in the home. It is estimated that approximately 88% of women aged 65 years of age or over are at present receiving social welfare support, either in their own right or as qualified adults on the pension of their spouse or partner. Also in 2002, facilities were introduced to allow for the payment of qualified adult allowances direct to spouses or partners. The administrative and legal implications of improving these arrangements to provide more direct payments to spouses and partners is being examined.The new enhanced standard State pension (non-contributory) for those over 66 years, which I introduced at the end of last month, features significant improvements in the means test which will allow some who are currently outside the social welfare pensions system to qualify for a payment.The Government is committed to producing a Green Paper on pensions as part of the new social partnership agreement Towards 2016 with a view to developing a framework for future pensions policy. This will deal with pensions in general but it will include outstanding issues relating to social welfare pensions, including those who remain outside the system. The Green Paper will be published within months. A consultation process will then take place and the Government will publish a framework for future pensions policy.

Applications for the allowance may be made between the beginning of June and the end of September each year.The scheme provides a one-off payment to eligible families to assist with the extra costs when their children start school each autumn. The allowance is not intended to meet the full cost of school clothing and footwear but to provide assistance towards these costs. From June 2006, an allowance of €120 is payable in respect of qualified children aged from 2 to 11 years, or €190 in respect of qualified children aged from 12 to 22 years. Separately, the Department of Education and Science operates a book grant scheme for primary and secondary schools.A person may qualify for payment of a back to school clothing & footwear allowance if he or she is in receipt of a social welfare payment (including family income supplement), or Health Service Executive payment, is participating in an approved employment scheme or attending a recognised education and training course and have household income at or below certain set levels.Budget 2006 provided for a number of improvements to the scheme. These include –an increase of €40 in rates from June 2006Extension of entitlement to the back to school clothing and footwear allowance to recipients of guardian's (formerly orphan's) payments for the first time.An increase in the additional income disregard for entitlement to the scheme from €50 to €100 over the relevant social welfare rate.These improvements are very significant when viewed in the context of clothing and footwear price trends.  According to the Consumer Price Index for August 2006, the overall cost of clothing and footwear has fallen by 3.6% over the past twelve months. Since December 2001, clothing and footwear costs have decreased by 18.8%.While the closing date for applications for the scheme was 30th September 2006, processing and payment of late applications is ongoing. Current indications are that about 84,000 families with approximately 160,000 children will benefit from the scheme this year at a cost of €25.5m. This is an increase on the 2005 figures when some 76,166 families with 157,254 children benefited at a cost of €16.7m.The increase is attributed to the easing of the means test, the information services operated by my Department and the significant level of publicity given to this scheme in the media. In previous years, the national average number of claims granted was 88.3% of all claims received.I consider the back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme to be an important support for parents at a time of financial strain. The improvements to the scheme for this year provide a major boost to meeting the financial costs associated with return to school for those who most need assistance. I will continue to monitor the scheme and to examine opportunities to further improve and expand this important scheme.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	308	I am aware of the excellent work which has been done for many years by the organisation One Family, formerly known as Cherish, in providing voice, support and action for one-parent families through membership, professional services and campaigning. The organisation works with all types and all members of one-parent families, respecting the realities of family life in Ireland. I received a copy of One Family's Annual Report recently and noted the increase of 20% in the number of one parent families and professionals accessing their services.Overall, I believe that the increased demand for One Family's services reflects the greater level of focus there is on lone parent families. The Government, mindful of this, asked the Senior Officials Group on Social Inclusion to examine the obstacles to employment for lone parents and last March I launched the Government discussion paper "Proposals for Supporting Lone Parents" which sought to address the increased risk of social exclusion and poverty faced by lone parents and parents on low income.The report put forward proposals for an expanded availability and range of education and training opportunities for lone parents; the extension of the National Employment Action Plan to focus on lone parents; focused provision of childcare; an improved information service for lone parents and the introduction of a new social assistance payment for low income families with young children. This paper has been the subject of considerable consultation. I have met with One Family, who have participated fully in these consultations, and listened carefully to what they have had to say as I believe that the views of national organisations such as themselves must be used to inform the development of the process.As soon as I am convinced that we have reached conclusions that are equitable, with a fully workable implementation strategy, it is my intention to bring forward proposals for legislation in this area.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	309	I propose to take Questions Nos. 113 and 429 together.Supporting and recognising carers in our society is and has been a priority of the Government since 1997. Over that period, weekly payment rates to carers have been greatly increased, qualifying conditions for carer's allowance have been significantly eased, coverage of the scheme has been extended and new schemes such as carer's benefit and the respite care grant have been introduced and extended.According to Census 2002, there are 148,754 people providing care to someone for at least 1 hour per week. Of these, 48,500 people are providing personal care for more than 29 hours per week or just over 4 hours per day. More than 14,300 of this group are employed for more than 15 hours per week and so would not satisfy the full time care and attention requirement for carer's allowance, carer's benefit or respite care grant. Just over 28,000 people are currently in receipt of either carer's allowance or carer's benefit from my Department.From June 2005, the annual respite care grant was extended to all carers who are providing full time care to a person who needs such care regardless of their income. Those persons in receipt of other social welfare payments, excluding job seekers assistance and benefit, are entitled to their payment subject to meeting the full time care and attention requirement. This arrangement was introduced to acknowledge the needs of carers especially in relation to respite. The grant is also now being paid in respect of each person receiving care.In Budget 2006, I provided for an increase in the amount of the respite care grant from €1,000 to €1,200, from June 2006. Approximately, 7,000 people who are not in receipt of carer's allowance or carer's benefit have received a respite care grant in respect of 2005. Applications for the 2005 grant continue to be received.In line with other social assistance schemes, a means test is applied to the carer's allowance so as to ensure that limited resources are directed to those in greatest need. This means test has been eased significantly over the years. Following Budget 2006, since April, the earnings disregard for a couple has been set at €580 per week which is just at the level of gross average industrial earnings. This means that a couple with two children can earn up to €32,925 per annum and still receive the maximum rate of carer's allowance as well as free travel, the household benefits package and the respite care grant. In accordance with the new social partnership agreement, "Towards 2016", I am committed to expanding, subject to available resources, the income limits for carer's allowance and aiming to keep the level of the disregard in line with average industrial earnings. In Budget 2006, I announced the biggest ever increases in the rates of payment to carers, specifically:the rate of carer's allowance increased by €26.40 to €180 per week for carers under age 66;the rate for carers over age 66 increased by €30.20 to €200 per week, making it the largest single welfare support payment; andthe rate of carer's benefit increased by €17.00 to €180.70 per week,These represent increases of over 17% for recipients of carer's allowance and serve to acknowledge and support the invaluable work of our family carers. I have also made other improvements to the supports available to carers from my Department. From June this year, I increased the number of hours that a carer may work and still receive a carer's allowance, from 10 to 15 hours per week. I also extended the duration of the carer's benefit scheme from 15 months to 2 years. The duration of the associated carer's leave scheme has also been extended to 2 years.Recommendations involving additional expenditure can only be considered in a budgetary context. However, I am always prepared to consider changes to existing arrangements where these are for the benefit of recipients and financially sustainable within the resources available to me. I will continue to bring forward proposals that recognise the valued and valuable contribution of carers in a tangible way.

This Committee has been tasked totake responsibility for drafting and finalising a National Women's Strategy, as committed to in Sustaining Progress;consult with the Social Partners and National Women's Council of Ireland, through a Consultation Group, in developing the Strategy; andadvise in relation to a communication plan for the publication and launch of the Strategy.The draft Strategy is a well structured, broad ranging document which aims to draw together all of the actions of Government which impact upon the lives of women. In relation to my Department, the Strategy will be addressing issues including social inclusion and women's risk of poverty, proposals for supporting lone parents and pension provision for women.The Inter-Departmental Committee is currently finalising a final draft of the Strategy prior to its submission for further consideration by the Consultation Group. It is hoped that the Strategy will be ready for publication before the end of this year.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	311	I propose to take Questions Nos. 115 and 193 together.The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which includes rent supplement, is administered on my behalf by the Community Welfare division of the Health Service Executive. The Value for Money examination undertaken by the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG) looked at the rent supplement scheme over the period 2000 to 2005.One of the main issues raised by the C&AG relates to the substantial increase in expenditure on rent supplement over the period of review. As the report notes, it increased from €151m in 2000 to almost €370m in 2005. In the same period recipient numbers rose from 42,700 to just over 60,000. The factors driving the increase include an increase in the number of recipients, changes in household composition, increased rent levels and policy changes such as easing the means test.During the period under review my Department took measures to address increases in expenditure. For example in December 2002, my Department assumed responsibility for setting limits in respect of which rent supplements are paid. Until 2002, these limits were set by the then Health Boards. Rent supplements are not paid where rents exceed the maximum levels set other than in exceptional circumstances. The limits were again reviewed in December 2003 and June 2005 and a further review will take place before the end of 2006.It is clear to me, and the report acknowledges, that rent supplementation under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme has, over the years, developed beyond the original objective of providing short-term assistance with accommodation costs. In recent years, a significant number of people have come to rely on rent supplements for extended periods, including people on local authority housing waiting lists. For this reason, the scheme needs to be viewed in the context of overall social housing policy, particularly in the case of long-term claimants.In response to this situation, the Government has introduced new rental assistance arrangements including the rental accommodation scheme (RAS) giving local authorities specific responsibility for meeting the longer-term housing needs of people receiving rent supplement for 18 months or more, on phased implementation basis. When fully operational, local authorities will meet the housing needs of these individuals through a range of approaches including the traditional range of social housing options, the voluntary housing sector and, in particular, new public / private partnership arrangements.According to recent information from the Department of the Environment Heritage and Local Government, to date over 11,000 rent supplement cases have been reviewed, 1,600 properties inspected and some 1,700 cases transferred to RAS. An additional 1,200 rent supplement households have also been allocated local authority housing.While RAS is the way forward, I am also conscious of the need to look at other approaches to providing appropriate housing responses for long-term rent supplement recipients. As Deputies are aware, officials from my Department and the Department of the Environment Heritage and Local Government are together overseeing a study to identify possible viable alternative approaches to providing an appropriate housing response for those concerned. These would be in addition or complimentary to the range of social housing options currently provided for by that Department through local government initiatives. I understand that the study is well advanced and I expect to be apprised of its findings in the near future.I have no plans to replace rent supplement with a general housing benefit scheme. The Government's priority is to provide housing, not new types of payments in lieu of housing. I will, of course, keep the rent supplement scheme under review and I may introduce further changes in the means test to improve work incentives, as I did in last year's budget. This targeted approach, together with delivering housing solutions to long-term rent supplement recipients, is likely to provide a better outcome than replacing the rent payment.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	312	I propose to take Questions Nos. 116 and 428 together.One of the key objectives of the 2006 social welfare package was to protect and enhance the value of all weekly rates of payment in relative terms by giving increases which were far in excess of emerging inflation for this year.State non-contributory pensions were increased by €16 per week or 9.6% while the contributory pension was increased by €14 per week or 7.8% with proportionate increases being given to those on reduced rates of payment. These increases mean that the Government is well on its way to completing its commitment to bring the basic State pension to €200 by 2007.  In addition, the Over-80 allowance was also increased by €3.60 per week to €10 and the Fuel Allowance by €5 per week to €14.  The increases in pensions were well ahead of the 4.5% increase recorded in the CPI for the twelve months ending last August, thereby protecting and enhancing the standard of living for all pensioners.Budget 2006 also saw an increase of €17 per week in the weekly rates of payment for persons of working age bringing the lowest rates of payment to €165.80 per week.  This represents an increase of 11.4%, which is once again well above the 2006 projected inflation rate and ensures that the Government remains on course to deliver on its commitments on social welfare rates.By any standards, the levels of increases and other improvements announced in the Budget were exceptional.  I look forward to making further progress for pensioners and all other social welfare claimants in this regard in the forthcoming Budget.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	313	The recently published CORI review Developing a Fairer Ireland is currently being examined in detail within my Department. The Deputy will appreciate that due to the broad ranging nature of the review, it would be impossible for me to cover or indeed comment on all of its detailed policy proposals in the context of this reply.Addressing the problem of poverty and social exclusion in our society should receive the highest priority, as the review states.The commitment shared by the Government and the social partners in this regard is evidenced in the National Partnership Agreement, Towards 2016 and Ireland's National Report on Strategies for Social Protection and Social Inclusion (NSSPI), 2006-2008, submitted to the EU last month, which outlines Irelands main priorities in this area.A more detailed National Action Plan, which will fully take into account the outcome of the consultation process on the plan, undertaken over the last year, and the views of CORI and other key stakeholders is currently being prepared. Preparation of the plan is being coordinated by the Office for Social Inclusion in my Department and will complement the National Development Plan 2007 – 2013, which will include a Chapter on social inclusion.  The strategies will encompass the lifecycle approach recommended by NESC in its report entitled the Developmental Welfare State. This streamlined approach is designed to ensure that Ireland has an over-arching strategic framework governing the major national social and economic strategies.The CORI review also deals in some detail with the issue of child poverty.  This is a complex area requiring coordinated action across a range of Government services and income support payments. Income support is one of the main ways of addressing child poverty.  Towards 2016 contains a number of commitments in this regard, including:Progressing towards the existing NAPS target for those relying on social welfare payments, i.e. that the combined value of child income support measures (currently 31%) be set at 33-35% of the minimum adult social welfare rate,Progressing, as a priority, further work aimed at assisting children in families on low incomes, to include enhancing existing provisions or the introduction of new or reformed mechanisms.Child income supports which avoid employment disincentives will be reviewed by the Department and this work, which will be informed by the NESC study on a second tier child income support, will be completed within one year, andA review of the re-focusing of the family income supplement in favour of larger families with low earnings.Poverty measurement, explored in detail in the review, is a particularly complex issue, and recognised as such in Towards 2016.  There is a commitment in the agreement to review the approach to effective poverty measurement as part of the wider examination of data issues in the lifecycle framework. This work will be progressed by the Office for Social Inclusion's Technical Advisory Group which will be expanded to include technical expertise from the social partner pillars.  Full account will be taken of the analysis by CORI on the issue.It is important to recall in this context the level of progress already made in recent years and the platform which creates for progress in the coming years. Between 2001 and 2006 spending on social welfare has increased from €7.8 billion to €13.6 billion.  During the same period the basic rate of social welfare payment has increased by 55.5 per cent, well ahead of the 16.4 per cent increase in the CPI, and the 28.2 per cent increase in gross average industrial earnings. This represents an increase in real terms of 33.6 per cent, in comparison to a real increase in industrial earnings of 10.1 per cent.I am confident that we can continue to achieve a similar scale of progress in the coming years towards achieving that decisive impact on poverty to which Ireland with the other EU Member States made a commitment at the Lisbon Summit in 2000 and which is a key factor in achieving the fair Ireland sought by CORI.  The National Action Plan currently being prepared will reflect that goal. I can give an assurance that full account will be taken of this important report by CORI, and the views of other stakeholders, in the preparation of the plan.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	314	I propose to take Questions Nos. 118 and 197 together.Many voluntary and statutory bodies such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the Community Welfare Service, credit unions, Citizens' Information Centres, Centres for the Unemployed and local authorities work closely with the programme. I am keen to get more quality information on the nature and trends of the debt encountered as well as the categories of people using the MABS so as to better inform policy around over-indebtedness and also enable the MABS to be even more responsive to its clients' needs.In this respect, a new integrated software computer system, that is now being rolled out  countrywide for use throughout the MABS network, will gather comprehensive statistical information that will provide valuable insights into the nature of the problems for people. The computer system, known as MABSIS, was delivered on time and within budget.Last year almost 27,000 people used the service as compared with almost 18,000 some 4 years earlier. The growth in demand for the service can be attributed to the increase in the availability of credit and to the quality of the service provided by the MABS staff.  This year I have increased the allocation from my Department to the MABS Service by in excess of twenty percent to assist the MABS in dealing with this increased workload.I believe the support structure put in place by my Department for the MABS in recent years has worked well for clients of the service, for local management and for the staff.  I also believe that a national system with delivery at the local level is the direction for the future. The MABS is highly regarded and respected and it is important that this continues to be the case.My proposals for legislation aim to build on the best features of the MABS model of service to the public. The proposals will combine a continuation of local voluntary involvement with national leadership and ensure a high quality, coordinated budgeting and advice service for the future, in particular for people on low incomes.  It is my intention to bring proposals before Government on this matter in the near future.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	315	I propose to take Questions Nos. 119 and 180 together.My Department administers a wide range of social welfare benefit and assistance type payments to provide income support payments for periods of illness, unemployment, retirement and other lifetime events.  Illness benefit and occupational injury benefit is mainly claimed by persons who are in employment and the claim is for short durations of illness after which the claimant returns to his/her employment.The number of persons in employment grew from 1,793 million in 2003 to 1,998 million in the first quarter of 2006, an increase of 204,700 or 11% in total.  This increase in employment has resulted in an increase in numbers of persons with PRSI contributions and would be expected to lead to an increase in illness benefit and invalidity pension claims.  A period of increase in employment would be equally expected to lead to a decrease in unemployment, now jobseeker's benefit and assistance claims.There was a decrease in the numbers registered for jobseekers benefit between 31 December 2003 and end June 2006 while there was an increase in the numbers in receipt of disability payments and jobseeker's allowance.  The most significant increase in the numbers in receipt of disability payments was on the disability allowance scheme.Improvements in the means test for disability allowance such as the increases in the earnings disregards, increases in the capital disregard to €20,000 and changes to allow persons to retain disability allowance on entering hospital have increased the numbers in receipt of this payment over the years.  In addition a new weekly personal payment of EUR 35 to persons who were not generally entitled to receive the Disability Allowance as long as they continue to reside in an institution was introduced in Budget 2005.  This was payable to over 2,800 persons who were not previously in receipt of any social welfare payment.In principle where a person satisfies the criteria for more than one social welfare payment they are entitled to receive the payment that best suits their own individual circumstances.  Of the 8,203 people awarded disability allowance in the first nine months of 2006, 42 were in receipt of Unemployment Benefit and 843 were in receipt of Unemployment Assistance at time of application for disability allowance.In the case of jobseeker's benefit and allowance, the claimant must be unemployed, be capable of work, be available for work and be genuinely seeking work.  In the case of jobseeker's allowance the claimant must satisfy the means test and for jobseeker's benefit must satisfy the PRSI contribution conditions.In the case of disability allowance the person must be suffering from an injury, disease, illness, congenital deformity or mental disability which has continued or may be expected to continue for at least one year, and as a result of the condition, be substantially restricted in undertaking work.  The person also must satisfy a means test similar to unemployment assistance.  For illness benefit the person must be incapable of work due to illness and for invalidity pension there must be permanent incapacity for work and for both schemes the person must satisfy the PRSI contribution conditions.Where a person claims a payment from my Department in respect of disease or disability, an opinion regarding the claimant's medical condition is given in the first instance by the person's own medical doctor.  Where required, a second opinion is provided by Medical Assessors employed by my Department for the guidance of the Department's Deciding Officers who ultimately determine entitlement.  When a claimant is called for a medical examination, the Medical Assessor will have available to him or her the initial medical diagnosis, supplemented, where appropriate, by relevant specialist and other reports.  These arrangements ensure that payments are made only in appropriate cases.I will continue to have the situation monitored to ensure that payments are made only in appropriate circumstances.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	316	I propose to take Questions Nos. 120, 139 and 191 together.My Department tries to assist and encourage long term unemployed, people with disabilities and other long term welfare recipients to return to work, training or further education through a range of measures administered by my Department's social and family support service.The back to work allowance scheme incentivises and encourages long-term unemployed people, lone parents and certain persons with disabilities to return to work by allowing them to retain part of their social welfare payment for a period when they take up employment or self-employment. The back to education allowance programme is available to certain social welfare customers who need support to obtain educational qualifications before re-entering the labour market.My Department also operates a special projects fund, administered by facilitators based in local social welfare offices, which enables facilitators to provide enhanced supports to people who need additional help to progress to further training and employment.  Groups who may need special help of this nature include the long-term ill and people with disabilities.In addition my Department operates small scale family services projects in certain areas, which are designed to focus supports towards specific target groups with complex needs, including people with disabilities.  The provision of this additional support involves individual attention, customised information and enhanced access to services.  It can increase the capacity of those in the most difficult circumstances, including people with disabilities, to improve their self esteem and personal situations through access to basic education, training and developmental opportunities.The special projects and family services initiatives are based on the application of a partnership approach between my Department, the voluntary and community sector, the private sector and other local players in identifying and addressing local needs in terms of training and development for people dependent on social welfare payments including people with disabilities.Customers in receipt of certain illness related payments such as disability allowance, illness benefit and invalidity pension are not debarred from working while in receipt of these payments subject to meeting certain criteria. Disability allowance is means tested and any income received would be assessed as means subject, however to the current income disregard.  Illness benefit and invalidity pension customers may, in certain circumstances, be allowed to undertake work for rehabilitative reasons with a view to improving their prospects of returning to full-time work at a future date.My Department's Sectoral Plan under the Disability Act, 2005 sets out an ambitious programme of support for people with disabilities to help them achieve their full potential both in terms of participation in the labour market and wider society. Over the period of the Plan (2006/2009), my department will seek to deliver support to people with disabilities which will reduce their risk of dependence.  The approach will be to encourage them to meet their income needs to a far greater extent from  employment, as well as achieving other social outcomes, such as further education and developing life skills in a way that will ensure that the contributions, talents and aspirations of no individual is overlooked.The specific details of the plan include matters such as examining the incentive effects of the disability payment levels, addressing benefit traps and employment disincentives within the structure of welfare disability schemes and examining the potential for extending, improving and rationalising schemes to better support people in their efforts to take up training opportunities and participate in employment. In this regard, last month I was particularly pleased to be able to lift the peak hour restriction on the use of the free travel pass so that people with disabilities may now use their passes going to work and they no longer need to apply for a restricted pass for travelling in connection with the educational, rehabilitative and therapeutic courses that are, very often, central to improving their lifestyles.The National Action Plan against Poverty and Social Exclusion (NAP/inclusion) details a range of actions targeted at those groups who are most vulnerable in society, including the long-term unemployed and persons with disabilities. The Office for Social Inclusion, based in my Department, has overall responsibility for implementation of the plan, and works closely with all departments to ensure effective and integrated delivery on actions in several policy areas including health, education, employment, housing and transport. While consistent poverty rates for the unemployed and people with disabilities are still higher than the average, Government policies have led to a downward shift in this regard, with the consistent poverty level for the unemployed falling from 28.2 per cent in 2003 to 19.2 per cent in 2004, and for persons with disabilities from 22.4 per cent to 21.7 per cent over the same period. The next NAP/inclusion, to be published later this year, will maintain a strong focus on removing those most vulnerable out of consistent poverty.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	317	At my request my Department was in discussion with CIE over recent months with a view to agreeing the necessary arrangements for the implementation of the Government decision in relation to the free travel peak travel restrictions. These discussions resulted in the removal of all restrictions with effect from 25th September 2006.More than 600,000 customers are in receipt of the Free Travel scheme, of which 430,000 are aged over 66 years. Some 145,000 are in receipt of an invalidity/disability type payment and a further 25,000 are carers. The peak time access restrictions have applied up to now on all Dublin Bus services and on Bus Éireann city services in Cork and Limerick.The lifting of all travel restrictions at peak times will benefit many people, particularly older people and those with disabilities, who up to now have been severely curtailed in the times they have been allowed to travel in the main cities, and surrounding areas, on public transport services. It is also a recognition that many eligible people, especially those with disabilities, are becoming increasingly more active in the workforce and availing of other activities.The ending of these restrictions also removes the need for people to have to go through the process of having to apply for special passes so that they can attend hospital appointments, or educational, rehabilitative and therapeutic courses that are, very often, central to improving their recovery and improving their lifestyles.My department has been assured that any capacity issues arising as a result of additional passengers travelling at peak times can be met through the provision of additional buses as provided for under the Transport 21 initiative. Detailed discussions and arrangements for the implementation of Transport 21 are a matter between the CIE group of companies and the Department of Transport.

The first under the competition articles of the EU Treaty was examined by the Commission and closed in March 2001 with no action taken against Ireland.In relation to the second complaint, under the Procurement Services Directive, the Commission issued a reasoned opinion against Ireland to the effect that the An Post contract falls within the terms of Annex 1B of the Council Directive 92/50/EEC. In addition, the Commission stated that an awarding authority should respect the EU principles of non-discrimination, equal treatment and transparency which would place an obligation on my Department to advertise the payment delivery service on a European wide basis and to uphold the principles of non-discrimination, equal treatment and transparency in the award of any contract.My Department, in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General, rejected the reasoned opinion. The Commission referred the case to the European Court of Justice and a hearing of the case took place in Luxembourg on the 4th April 2006. The Advocate-General gave an opinion on the case on 14th September 2006 and upheld the European Commission claim that Ireland breached competition rules by not publicly advertising the contract. The opinion concluded "that the Court should declare that, in deciding to entrust the provision of services to An Post without a prior notice, although there were no circumstances which would have allowed no advertising at all, Ireland has failed to comply with its obligations under the (EU) Treaty.”  It is expected that the Court will give its judgement within a three to six month period.My Department is consulting with the Office of the Attorney General on the legal implications of a Court decision, should it be in line with the Advocate-General's opinion. Pending the judgement, and recognizing the essential payment delivery service which An Post currently provides for my Department, the Company will continue to provide these services.An Post and my Department have been partners in the delivery of social welfare payments since the foundation of the State and I see no reason the network of post offices should not continue to play a significant role in the delivery of social welfare payments in any changed circumstances which may arise in the future.

For example, separate payments are made in case of domestic difficulty where a spouse might otherwise have no other form of income. Also, for certain categories of Old Age non-Contributory Pension, where the couple are both aged 66 or over, payment is made individually to each partner.In October 2002, my Department introduced administrative arrangements to provide an option to have the qualified adult allowance paid directly to the spouse for all new applicants to State Pension (Transition), (formerly known as Retirement Pension) and State Pension (Contributory), (formerly known as Old Age (Contributory) Pension). Since these arrangements were implemented, some 1,400 couples have indicated their preference to have the qualified adult allowance paid directly to the spouse. This represents around 8% of the pension claims awarded with an increase for a qualified adult since October 2002.I am aware of the desire of certain sectors of the community to have direct payment to qualified adults implemented and that various groups and reports have recommended that direct payments to qualified adults be progressed within the social welfare code. I am also conscious of the need to take account of the views of our customers regarding this matter. These issues are under active consideration by my Department and I intend to progress the matter in the coming year.

The objective of the review is to identify policy and administrative changes that would rationalise and simplify means testing in the Department. It is expected that this review will be completed by the end of 2006.The possibility of creating the central means database to which the Deputy refers arose in the context of proposals drawn up in the early 1990s aimed at achieving integrated delivery of social welfare and other services.  It was recognised at the time that there were considerable complications in this area which would have to be addressed before such a database could be developed.It was concluded that it would not be possible to develop a common database at that time because of the breadth of the project and the business and technical issues to be addressed.  It was clear that the technical infrastructure available in the mid-1990s across the public service would not support the requirements of a cross-organisational database.In these circumstances, this Department undertook a project to develop within the Department a central computer based means recording system to enable staff across the organisation to access means information recorded on it.  That system was developed using internal technical resources.  Development work was completed at the end of 1992.  Over time, as other systems were developed, for example, to support the work of the Department's investigators, the system became less critical as means were recorded on these other systems.It is now intended to develop an enhanced means database which can be integrated with the Department's principal payment schemes and which could ultimately support a shared means service with other public sector organisations.  This is a major programme which will take a number of years to complete.

The scheme is under the remit of the office of the Minister for Children, who is responsible for policy and legislation in relation to the scheme. The administration of the scheme is being undertaken by my Department.As part of the introduction of the scheme, customers who would qualify for the payment were contacted in April 2006 with information on the new payment, including method and frequency of payment and the approximate date of the first payment. In August, customers were advised of the confirmed date of the first payment and payment dates for the remainder of 2006 and 2007. Approximately 265,000 letters issued on both occasions.A number of letters were returned undelivered by An Post as the customer was no longer at that address.  From the April mailing, approximately 6,000 letters were returned and from the August Mailing 3000 have been returned to date.In the case of the April mailing, following checks and contact from customers, new addresses were updated for almost 2500 customers prior to the end of July.  In 3500 cases, where a new address could not be found, payment of Child Benefit was suspended from August 2006.  In the last two months, 2700 of these customers have contacted us with new addresses and confirmation of their continuing residency in Ireland. The remaining 800 or so are still suspended and have not received Child Benefit payments since July.  These cases will be terminated if investigations currently ongoing indicate that they are no longer entitled to child benefit.In the case of the August mailing, of the 3,000 letters returned to date as undelivered, 400 new addresses have been found, 500 customers have had payment suspended from September as no new address can be found for them, a further 2100 are still being checked and will be suspended in the coming weeks if no current whereabouts can be confirmed for them.In total, payments of Child Benefit is still suspended for 1330 customers as a result of their ECS information letter being returned as undelivered by An Post.Work is continuing to establish the whereabouts of these customers and if it is confirmed that they are no longer resident in the country or otherwise not entitled to child benefit, their claims will be terminated and overpayments assessed where appropriate.My Department has put in place measures to ensure that customers in receipt of both Child Benefit and Early Childcare Allowance are reviewed on a regular basis to ensure they still fulfil the qualifying conditions for the receipt of the payments. These measures will include mailshots to confirm residency of the children in Ireland and confirm insurable employment of a parent in cases paid under EU regulations. In addition home visits by Investigation staff will be used to verify and validate information given.

This preserves the incentive for them to remain in employment in circumstances where they might only be marginally better off than if they were claiming other social welfare payments. FIS is a central element of a programme of reforms targeted specifically at addressing child poverty.There are at present almost 19,400 families in receipt of a weekly FIS payment, which benefits more than 38,000 children. This compares with approximately 17,450 families (34,000 children) in December 2005 and represents an increase of 60% since 2002. Families can receive top-up supports of between €20 and €400 a week, depending on their income and the size of their family. The current average weekly FIS payment is €105.With regard to the level of take up, it is not possible to estimate from administrative sources the number of families who may be eligible but do not apply for their FIS entitlements. However, research undertaken by the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) in 1997, which was based on the results of the Living in Ireland Survey 1994, suggested that, at that time, fewer than one in three of potentially eligible claimants had actually made a claim and been awarded payment of FIS. Since those with a higher entitlement are more likely to avail of the scheme, the take-up in expenditure terms was then estimated to be somewhat higher, at between 35% and 38% of potential expenditure.The provision of information is an essential element in the effective delivery of social welfare schemes and services. The underlying objective of my Department's information policy is to ensure that all citizens are made aware of their entitlement and other supports and are kept informed of changes and improvements to schemes and services as they occur.Improvements to the family income supplement scheme, including the new increased income limits announced in Budget 2006, mean that it is now easier for families to qualify under the scheme. To ensure that families are made aware of these improvements, my Department undertook a nationwide awareness campaign last March to promote and encourage a greatly increased take up of the Family Income Supplement scheme for working families on low incomes.This extensive week-long campaign included advertising on TV, on national and local radio and in the national and regional press. A nation-wide poster campaign was also undertaken. The total cost of the advertising campaign was €272,000. During the media campaign, my Department provided a LoCall helpline for the public to answer their enquiries regarding eligibility under the improved scheme. The helpline responded to over 2,800 calls.In addition, the scheme was promoted through my Department's network of Local Offices, Citizen Information Centres and Citizens Information Phone service and by Comhairle, the national information support agency. Information was also made available through my Department's website.I am very pleased with the response so far to the campaign. For example directly after the advertising campaign in the months of March and April this year, my Department received 3,013 new FIS claims; this compares with 1,337 received in the same 2 months in 2005. My Department has received 10,357 new claims in the first 9 months of this year compared with 5,489 for the corresponding period in 2005. The advertising campaign has resulted in a higher than normal number of claims on hand and I would expect a high percentage of these to translate into awards. The full impact will not be known until all of these claims have been decided.My Department has been working closely with the Revenue Commissioners to ensure that families on low incomes are made aware of the availability of FIS. Improvements in the scheme were outlined in an information leaflet distributed by the Revenue Commissioners with the 2006 Tax Credit certificates to all PAYE taxpayers. My Department will continue to work with Revenue on other initiatives to ensure that people are made aware of their entitlements in a timely manner.Every effort is being made to ensure that families eligible for FIS are encouraged to apply for the scheme, and every opportunity is taken by my Department to promote the benefits of the scheme.In order to establish an up to date view of the factors influencing the level of FIS take up, my Department is commissioning a specific research project with the objective of designing and undertaking a proactive take-up campaign for a sample of 1,000 persons who have children and who may have earnings within the FIS income thresholds.The project will also examine if access barriers exist, if so, how they can be mitigated or removed. In addition, it will assess whether alternative mechanisms to enhance take up of FIS can be implemented and finally, if customer service and access to family income supplement eligibility for low income families can be improved.The increase in the numbers of persons receiving FIS is a positive development, reflecting the success of a range of Government measures which have improved net incomes for the low paid. Efforts are continuing to ensure that families eligible for FIS are encouraged to apply for the scheme, and every opportunity is taken to promote the benefits of the scheme.

They generally work by paying a percentage of salary from the time they become ill. Payments cease when a person recovers or reaches normal retirement age.Income Continuance Products are established and administered by undertakings authorised under the EC(Life Assurance) Framework Regulations, 1994. They are insurance products and so the competent authority for these products is the Financial Regulator.Income Continuance Plans can be closely allied to occupational pension schemes but, in fact, are totally separate in their legal structure, status and operations. However, very often by virtue of their association with the occupational pension arrangements, misinterpretations arise.The Pensions Board was asked to review, in consultation with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the position and regulation of Income Continuance Plans. A report was undertaken by Watson Wyatt and Matheson Ormsby Prentice, solicitors, and was published on the Pensions Board website at the end of 2005.The report found that there are some 238,000 people insured under income continuance plans, with 85% being arranged through employer sponsored or voluntary group schemes.The report identified problems in two main areas. Firstly, it found that lack of adequate disclosure has been the most significant source of misunderstandings in relation to the interaction of income continuance plans and related pension plans. In order to overcome this it was suggested that the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment should introduce regulations to improve the flow of information to employees in relation to income continuance arrangements.The second area of major concern identified in the report was the question of redress for individuals experiencing difficulties with the income continuance arrangements. Because the employer is normally the beneficial owner of the insurance policy underpinning the income continuance arrangements there is no access for the individual to the Financial Services Ombudsman, who is the authority with jurisdiction in relation to insurance arrangements.The current position is that my Department, the Department of Finance and the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment are working together to try and identify the gaps which exist in relation to the regulation of the schemes in question and to decide the best way of providing an avenue of redress for workers who are covered by employer sponsored income continuance plans.The issues are quite complex because they span a number of areas, financial services, employment law, employment conditions and, in some cases, pensions. The views of the two Ombudsmen operating in this area – Financial Services Ombudsman and the Pensions Ombudsman – will be important in deciding the best way forward and they are being consulted.

In its report, the Commission noted that over the years, the health system had been assigned responsibility for a number of activities that are non-core in the context of a health service. In view of the range of challenges facing the health sector, it recommended that the Government consider assigning such non-core activities to other bodies.The Government considered this issue earlier this year and has decided to transfer certain functions. The functions to be transferred include the General Register Office and various payments, including supplementary welfare allowances and payments made to or in respect of persons with a disability, namely domiciliary care allowance, mobility allowance, infectious diseases maintenance allowance and blind welfare allowance. The mechanics of transferring dental, optical and other treatment benefits from my Department to the health sector are also being examined.As part of the National Disability Strategy, my Department has produced a Disability Sectoral plan which was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 21 July 2006. The objective of my Department's plan is to ensure that, as far as is practicable, the schemes and services provided to people with disabilities operate in a manner which facilitates their full participation in society and meet the mainstreaming principle of the equality agenda.In this regard, the Sectoral Plan takes account of the Government decision to transfer certain non-core activities from the Health Service Executive (HSE) to my Department.An interdepartmental implementation group comprising officials from my Department, the Department of Finance and the Health Service Executive, and chaired by the Department of Health and Children, has been established and has begun to address the implementation of this element of the transfer of functions programme. The timing of any transfer, the enabling legislation that may be required as well as any associated costs will be identified as part of the group's deliberations.A separate interdepartmental implementation group comprising officials from my Department, the Department of Finance, the Department of Health and Children and the Health Service Executive and chaired by my Department has been established to progress the transfer of other aspects of the community welfare service. The group's work to date work centred mainly on providing the necessary foundation for a detailed and comprehensive programme to oversee the successful transfer of the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme.This includes identifying all of the functions at present carried out by Community Welfare Officers and Superintendent Community Welfare Officers within the community welfare service for the purpose of establishing how these will fit within the transfer of function process. The timing of the transfer and of the enabling legislation required will also form part of the part of this group's deliberations. Naturally, implementation of this programme will involve organisational, human resource and service delivery issues and the working group will undertake extensive consultation with all relevant stakeholders throughout the change process.I recognise that a change of this magnitude can create concern for those currently carrying out the service. I would like to take this opportunity to allay any concerns that community welfare officers may have in this regard. Any issues that staff may have with regard to their terms and conditions of service will be addressed through the normal industrial relations machinery.The Community Welfare Service plays a vital role within the overall social welfare system. The existing mechanisms of delivery allow the service to be responsive, flexible and outcome focused. These are attributes for which there will be a continuing need into the future.I do not expect that costs will arise specifically in relation to the transfer of Departmental responsibility. The services in question will continue to be delivered as here to fore from the locations at which they are currently available. Costs, or indeed administrative savings, may arise in the future as these services are modernised and improved but any such costs or savings would accrue because of modernisation and service development rather than because of the transfer per se.Throughout the change programme, I will be giving a high priority to supporting the continued delivery of the high standard of service currently provided by the staff concerned. Overall, I am confident that the transfer of services as envisaged will be embraced successfully and will ultimately further enhance the delivery of services to our customers, in particularly those most disadvantaged in society.

In relation to employee's contributions, the amount payable is determined by reference to the reckonable earnings in a weekly period, subject to a range of thresholds and an annual ceiling. The PRSI contribution which is due, which may include payment of the health contribution where appropriate, is based on a tiered contribution system, with weekly non-cumulative thresholds, a non-cumulative PRSI-free allowance and is subject to an annual cumulative ceiling on employee contributions. The employee PRSI ceiling is reviewed annually in accordance with the legislative stipulations of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 2005. I would point out that the ceiling does not apply in respect of the health contributions.The employee ceiling is currently set at €46,600 per annum, and is likely to rise in line with earnings for 2007.  The benefits which accrue on foot of the paid contributions are for the most part paid on a flat-rate basis. The flat-rate payment system, as opposed to a pay-related benefits system, is based on the policy of directing available resources towards those most in need by increasing the basic rate of payment, rather than through pay-related supplements. This is in line with the views expressed in 1986 in the Report of the Commission on Social Welfare which recommended that pay-related benefits be phased out as basic payment rates were increased.I am satisfied that the policy of having an annual employee ceiling is appropriate in present circumstances and will monitor the need for any amendments to the current policy in a budgetary context.

All carers in receipt of carer's allowance and carers of people in receipt of constant attendance or prescribed relative's allowance, regardless of their age, receive a free travel pass.The scheme is also available to people under age 66 who are in receipt of certain disability type welfare payments, such as disability allowance, invalidity pension and blind person's pension.  People resident in the State who are in receipt of a social security invalidity or disability payment from a country covered by EU Regulations, or from a country with which Ireland has a bilateral social security agreement, and who have been in receipt of this payment for at least 12 months, are also eligible for free travel.The scheme provides free travel on the main public and private transport services for those eligible under the scheme. These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus Átha Cliath, Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann, as well as Luas  and services provided by over 80 private transport operators.The free travel scheme applies to travel within the State and point to point cross border journeys between here and Northern Ireland. In line with the Government objective to put in place an all Ireland free travel scheme for pensioners resident in all parts of this island, I am committed to significantly improving the North/South element of the current arrangements.There have been a number of requests and enquiries in relation to the extension of entitlement to free travel in Ireland to Irish born people living outside Ireland, or to those in receipt of pensions from my Department, particularly in the UK, when they return to Ireland for a visit.I have been advised that it would not be possible to extend entitlement to free travel simply to Irish born people living abroad as to do so would be contrary to European legislation which prohibits discrimination on the grounds of nationality.  More recently, the European Commission has indicated that to extend the scheme to people in receipt of an Irish pension could also be considered discriminatory.I have raised the issue with Commissioner Špidla and officials from my Department met with European Commission officials on two occasions in an effort to clarify the legal issues involved.  I am keeping this issue under review and contacts with the European Commission are ongoing.In relation to centenarian's bounty, the Government has approved in principle the extension of the scheme for the payment of the centenarians' bounty to any Irish citizen who was born in the Island of Ireland, regardless of where he or she may currently reside.  Up to now the bounty, which currently amounts to €2,500, was payable only to centenarians living in the State.The bounty is a discretionary grant and not a service or scheme and accordingly it does not come within the scope of the EC Treaty. In this way, it differs from any proposed extension of the free travel scheme.

My colleague the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs has primary responsibility in this area and his department, together with the Department of Agriculture and Food, is currently preparing a major rural development strategy covering the years 2007-2013.  This strategy will have a significant impact in rural areas.In addition, the National Action Plan against Poverty and Social Exclusion (NAP inclusion) details a range of measures, across several policy areas, to tackle rural poverty. These include: the Rural Transport Initiative which will be placed on a permanent footing in 2007 following the successful piloting of the project; the CLAR programme, which is a nationally funded investment programme aimed at areas which have experienced more that a 50 per cent drop in population since the foundation of the state; and the Local Development Social Inclusion Programme. The agreement of social inclusion development plans within the local authorities will also constitute valuable tools for identifying and tackling social exclusion and poverty at a local level.A revised National Action Plan is currently in preparation, coordinated by the Office for Social Inclusion (OSI), based in my Department.  It is due for completion by end of year.  Full account is being taken of the views expressed at consultation seminars in relation to what the plan should contain.  These consultations highlighted the importance of the Plan having a strong regional and local focus given the differences that exist between the needs of the different regions and localities.  A key aim, therefore, will be to ensure that a strong regional and local focus will be accommodated in the plan.My Department makes a number of social welfare payments to assist rural communities. Farm Assist is a weekly means-tested payment for low income farmers, payable up to a maximum rate of €165.80 per week personal rate with increases of up to €110 per week for a qualified adult and €16.80 per week for each qualified child. Expenditure on Farm Assist was €67.2m in 2005 and there are currently some 7,531 households benefiting from the payment on a weekly basis.  In addition to the weekly state pension my department also pays a special additional weekly payment of €12.70 for persons over 66 years of age living on certain offshore islands.An additional weekly payment of €7.70 is made to pensioners who are living alone and an additional €10 per week for persons over 80 years old.My Department is also cooperating with the Combat Poverty Agency, Sustainable Energy Ireland and other organisations in an action research project to improve energy efficiency in selected older dwellings and to monitor the outcomes in terms of improved cost efficiency and household comfort and health levels.  A total of 300 houses are involved in this project.  The project is comprised of urban houses in the Cork area and rural houses in Donegal. In addition to this, Budget 2006 provided a grant of EUR2 million to Sustainable Energy Ireland to enable further research to be undertaken into fuel poverty issues.

In order to be ‘consistently poor', a person needs to fall below an income line and be unable to afford one of 8 basic deprivation items.While the risk of poverty results for older people are higher than for the general population (40% compared to 21% based on the EU common indicators), consistent poverty results for people aged 65 and over are lower than the general population (3.3% compared to 6.8%, from the National EU-SILC results for 2004). Consistent poverty is considered in Ireland to be a more accurate reflection of long-term accumulation of resources than relative income measures.EU measures of poverty risk concentrate on relative incomes. When looked at in this way, the position of pensioners compared to other groups disimproved over the past 10 years. This was despite pension increases that exceeded earnings growth and price inflation. The main reason for this apparent disimprovement was that household incomes were driven by tax reform and increased employment participation, in addition to earnings growth, and not all of these factors fed into pensioners' incomes whereas people on social welfare incomes throughout the 10-year period would in fact have benefited from substantial income improvements (at least as high as earnings growth).Over the decade to 2004, while prices (CPI) increased by 35% and average industrial earnings increased by 63%, social welfare payments increased by 86%. However, the ‘at risk of poverty' threshold increased by 122% reflecting a significant shift from one to two incomes in middle-income households. In Ireland's particular circumstances of rapid economic growth, the ‘at risk of poverty' measure has not proved to be a reliable indicator of Over the decade to 2004, while prices (CPI) increased by 35% and average industrial earnings increased by 63%, social welfare payments increased by 86%. However, the ‘at risk of poverty' threshold increased by 122% reflecting a significant shift from one to two incomes in middle-income households. In Ireland's particular circumstances of rapid economic growth, the ‘at risk of poverty' measure has not proved to be a reliable indicator of the experience of poverty. Instead, it reflects the changes in household incomes, driven by a substantial increase in female participation in the labour market. A decrease in the ‘at risk of poverty' rate from 19.7 per cent in 2003 to 19.4 per cent in 2004 was recorded by EU SILC and shows that the distorting effect of significant structural changes may well be on the ebb.The needs of older people have been, and will remain a priority for this Government and this had been demonstrated by the numerous initiatives which have been taken in the last ten years in the area of pensions, supports for carers and household benefits. For instance, since 1996 pensions have increased by almost 104%, or nearly 50% in real terms. We are committed to achieving a target rate of €200 per week for social welfare pensions by 2007.The question of targeted measures to improve the position of women over 65 specifically will be kept under review in the context of the forthcoming budget.

The National Disability Authority, on behalf of the working group and in line with its own remit, commissioned research into the feasibility of introducing such a payment. The purpose of this research was to advise regarding the additional costs incurred by people with disabilities, owing specifically to the direct or indirect costs of disability and the appropriate mechanisms or instruments by which to address identified additional costs. The resultant report, Disability and the Cost of Living, was subsequently published by the National Disability Authority.The group considers it vital that comprehensive data is available on which to base consideration of the introduction of a cost of disability payment, in addition to a structured process of the assessment of need.The working group recommended that steps be taken to improve the quality of data relating to disability in Ireland, for example, adjustment of existing data gathering exercises undertaken by the Central Statistics Office or other relevant bodies to include questions on the numbers per household with disabilities, the nature of disability and severity of impairment.The group has also examined the scope for addressing barriers that exist for people with disabilities who wish to undertake or increase their employment and thus move to a position of greater economic independence. In this regard, as part of the Social Welfare Budget package 2006, I introduced a change to the withdrawal rate of Disability Allowance and Blind Pension for income in excess of the current earnings disregard level which means that a single person can earn up to a maximum of €390 per week from rehabilitative employment before their Disability Allowance or Blind Pension is fully withdrawn. The outcome of this change will be monitored to assess its effect on increased employment participation and to identify any further policy changes required.In terms of ensuring adequate levels of income for people with disabilities, the current ten-year Social Partnership Agreement, In terms of ensuring adequate levels of income for people with disabilities, the current ten-year Social Partnership Agreement, Towards 2016, includes the commitment to work for the continued enhancement and integration of supports in line with overall social welfare targets. These will include a rationalisation of existing allowances for people with disabilities in the context of the Government's policy of mainstreaming and the proposed transfer of functions from the Health Services Executive to my Department which includes a number of disability-related schemes, including the Domiciliary Care Allowance, Mobility Allowance and Blind Welfare Allowance. An inter-departmental working group has now been established to progress the implementation of this transfer. Other issues around the cost of disability will be considered following the development of a needs assessment system provided for under Part 2 of the Disability Act, 2005.My Department's Disability Sectoral Plan similarly contains actions in relation to the rationalisation of existing allowances for people with disabilities. The Plan also includes agreed protocols with the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment on actions required to ensure that income supports and associated benefits do not create financial barriers to people with disabilities participating in the labour force or availing of training, educational or other developmental opportunities.I look forward to the implementation of the sectoral plan over the next three years and to maintaining the commitment to expand and deliver services that best support, recognise and encourage people with disabilities as well as those who provide a caring role.

Of the ten areas of concern, entitled steps to equality for all families which are set out in the submission, a number, including the issues of adequate incomes for one-parent families, adequate supports for employment and the issue of poverty traps deterring a move off social welfare dependency were all covered in the Government discussion paper, "Proposals for Supporting Lone Parents" which I launched in March this year.That paper puts forward proposals for reform of the income support system for all parents on a low income. It also put forward proposals for the expanded availability and range of education and training opportunities for lone parents, the extension of the National Employment Action Plan to focus on lone parents, focused provision of childcare, improved information services for lone parents and the introduction of a new social assistance payment for low income families with young children.Long term welfare dependency is not in the best interests of parents, their children or society in general. This new social assistance payment will have the long term aim of assisting lone parents and parents on low incomes to achieve financial independence through supporting them to enter employment – for it is employment that offers the best route out of poverty.I fully realise that any new payment cannot be introduced without co-ordinated supports and services being put in place by other Departments and Agencies.  This is why the Government has instructed the Senior Officials Group on Social Inclusion to draw up an implementation plan to progress the non-income related recommendations in tandem with the development of the legislation required in my Department to introduce a new payment scheme.Work on the development of this implementation plan is underway. Issues including access to childcare support, education, training and activation measures and options for further research will be considered. As soon as I am convinced that we have reached conclusions that are equitable, with a fully workable implementation strategy, it is my intention to bring forward proposals for legislation.In the meantime, my officials continue to be in contact with the lone parents' representative groups, whose ongoing support I am grateful for and whose views continue to feed in to the development of the proposals. The proposals in the Pre-Budget submission will be considered in a budgetary context.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	331	I propose to take Questions Nos. 138, 147, 177 and 185 together.I was very glad to recently launch the 2005 Annual Report of the Combat Poverty Agency. In addition to outlining the work of the agency, the report includes a commentary on translating strategy into action.The need for a strategic approach reflects the complex nature of poverty, which is multi-faceted in its causes and effects and, as a consequence, requires a multi-policy response. Since 1997, with the National Anti-Poverty Strategy (NAPS), the Government has adopted this approach. Ireland also actively promoted and engaged in EU-wide developments in this area and produced National Action Plans against Poverty and Social Exclusion (NAP inclusion) in 2001 and 2003, in accordance with EU guidelines. The most recent such development is, Ireland's Report on National Strategies for Social Protection and Social Inclusion 2006-2008 (NSSPI), which also incorporates strategies on pensions, healthcare and long-term care, submitted to the EU in September.In tandem with the EU arrangements, a new National Action Plan is being prepared which will outline in more detail on the Government's strategies and will be completed before year-end. The Plan is also being prepared in tandem with and will compliment the forthcoming National Development Plan 2007-2013, which will contain a specific chapter on social inclusion.The National Action Plan will build on the social inclusion priorities and objectives contained in the NSSPI and the Towards 2016 social partnership agreement. All three strategies encompass a new lifecycle approach within which the key social challenges are addressed, by assessing the risks which individuals face and the supports available to them at each stage in the life cycle. The key areas for attention are Children, People of Working Age, Older People and People with Disabilities. This strategic framework will help to create more coherent and integrated structures and facilitate better and more effective reporting and monitoring across the spectrum of government activity in the area of social inclusion. It is being designed to more systematically overcome difficulties in implementation arising from insufficient coordination and integration.A key priority for this Government has been to reduce and, if possible, eliminate consistent poverty. The EU-SILC survey in 2004 showed a significant reduction in the consistent poverty rate, from 8.8 per cent in 2003 to 6.8 per cent in 2004 continuing a downward trend over the period since 1997. The low levels of unemployment achieved, and the substantial resources devoted to social welfare and other social services, which have been increasing in real terms since 1997, are bringing about this downward trend. It is estimated that some 250,000 people have been lifted out of consistent poverty over the past ten years.In the ten years since the first NAPS, much has been achieved in Ireland towards the EU aim of making a decisive impact on poverty. Much has also been learned, both from our own experience in Ireland and from that of other Member States, on how more effective, coordinated implementation of strategies can be achieved.One key priority is to apply what has been learned to the National Action Plan being prepared and in the arrangements being made for its full implementation.Strategies for social inclusion include a range of actions on employment, social welfare, education, health, housing, disability, equality and other areas. Achieving the necessary results requires institutional arrangements encompassing Government, senior Departmental officials, social partners, key State Agencies, local authorities, community and voluntary groups and the general public. The Office for Social Inclusion (OSI) in my Department works closely with these bodies to ensure effective implementation of the National Action Plan targets. Arising from a commitment in Towards 2016, the Office will have wider responsibilities in relation to oversight of social inclusion policies.The availability of appropriate data is necessary for monitoring policy impacts and the lack of such data is a barrier to evaluating progress towards the achievement of outcomes. The OSI will continue its work to ensure that robust and reliable data is available to facilitate effective monitoring.. The greater availability of comprehensive data will also assist the formulation of effective evidence-based policies. The OSI also recently produced new guidelines for Poverty Impact Assessment to enhance the current poverty proofing of policies. These will be an effective tool in ensuring the mainstreaming of poverty and social exclusion considerations in all policy making and by requiring a rigorous assessment of the impact of policies on those who are most vulnerable.

#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	333	The primary objective of my Department's information policy is to ensure that all citizens are made aware of their rights and entitlements and that they are kept informed of changes and improvements in schemes and services as they occur.  The provision of information in a clear and accessible manner is an essential element in the achievement of this objective.My Department takes a pro-active approach in advertising its schemes and services, by using an appropriate mix of national and provincial media, information leaflets, fact sheets, posters, direct mailshots, advertising on plasma television screens in over 60 Credit Unions nationwide and the distribution of information booklets to health centres throughout the country.  Selective use is made of LoCall and Freephone services to provide information on new schemes and services at particular times of the year such as Budget time.In addition, national advertising campaigns are undertaken periodically to promote greater awareness of a specific scheme or highlight easing of qualifying conditions for schemes and services.  During 2006 to date, three such campaigns have been undertaken.In March, my Department undertook a nationwide awareness campaign to promote and encourage take up of the Family Income Supplement (FIS) scheme.  An extensive week-long campaign included advertising on television, on national and local radio and in national and regional newspapers.In August, the Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance was advertised in national and regional newspapers.During the last week of September, an information campaign was conducted on television, on national and local radio and in national and regional newspapers to raise public awareness of supports for carers.  The campaign promoted Carer's Allowance, Carer's Benefit and the Respite Care Grant.A LoCall helpline was provided for all three campaigns.  In addition to the LoCall number, our campaigns also highlight other sources of information available to the public, including my Department's network of Social Welfare Local Offices, Citizens Information Centres and my Department's website. The response to the campaigns have been encouraging and resulted in increases in the numbers applying for, and qualifying for, each of the support schemes.In view of the wide and varied range of services available from my Department, nationwide campaigns are designed to highlight specific schemes and services.  Targeted advertising campaigns focusing on specific schemes and services will continue to be a key priority for me in the drive to ensure that citizens are aware of and claim their social welfare entitlements.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	334	Earlier this year, I welcomed the publication by the Combat Poverty Agency of its report "The Distributional Impact of Ireland's Indirect Tax System" and the associated policy statement "Promoting Equity in Ireland's Tax System".The report addressed whether and to what extent the Irish system of indirect taxation, namely VAT and excise duties, is regressive. The report outlines that over the period 2000 to 2005, the share of total Current Exchequer Revenues represented by VAT and excises duties combined has remained unchanged at 44.5%. The authors concluded that the indirect tax system appears to be regressive in the sense that households in the lowest decile pay a higher proportion of their income in indirect taxes relative to households in the higher deciles. However, they also noted that the indirect tax system includes some elements of progressivity such as low tax rates on food and fuel and zero tax rates on children's clothes and footwear. They also pointed out that changes to some tax elements could have negative effects elsewhere. For example, lowering taxes on drink and tobacco could have a negative health impact.In conclusion, the authors do not recommend adjustments to indirect taxes.This Government has greatly increased the levels of income support provided through the social welfare system and remains committed to improving the standard of living of welfare dependent and low-income households. Since 1997, the lowest rates of welfare payments have increased by almost 100%, well ahead of the 49% accumulated inflation over that period.In the last Budget, the personal and qualified adult rates of payment were increased by unprecedented amounts. The lowest rates of social welfare payments were i increased by €17 per week to €165.80, or by 11.4%. This increase is well ahead of projected inflation for 2006 and, therefore, improves and enhances the living standards of all recipients.The Combat Poverty Agency report also highlights the need to make work pay for low earners. This has been an important focus of Government policy and I introduced a number of important measures designed to address poverty and to reward work and enterprise in Budget 2006. These included a Child and Family Poverty package of nearly €155 million which involved major improvements for low-income families and for single parent families.I also introduced a wide-ranging employment support package of €28 million. This contained a range of measures which will alleviate poverty and support activation by improving income disregards and tapers for people with disabilities, the unemployed and qualified adults. These arrangements maximise the benefits of work for low-income households.I look forward to considering further improvements in income support and allied measures designed to assist low income households in the context of the forthcoming Budget.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	335	I propose to take Questions Nos. 144 and 183 together.EU migrant workers have an entitlement to Child Benefit and other "Family benefits" including Early Childcare Supplement (ECS) under EU Regulation 1408/71.  Where a national of an EU State with a family is working in Ireland, the worker is entitled to payment of such benefits, even if the children are resident in the worker's home country.Applications for family benefits from EU migrant workers who come to live in Ireland with their families are dealt with under domestic legislation. Entitlement to Child Benefit is based on the applicant satisfying the Habitual Residency condition and the child being ordinarily resident in Ireland.Currently there are just over 31,000 EU nationals in receipt of Child Benefit for 56,000 children who are resident with them in Ireland.  Of these the majority of recipients, some 16,500 — are UK nationals, with a further 10,500 recipients from the ten States that joined the EU in 2004.EU nationals who come to work in Ireland but whose families remain in their home country may have an entitlement to Family Benefits in Ireland under EU Regulation 1408/71.  Before payment of Child Benefit is made for non-resident children it is necessary to contact the authorities in the country of residency of the children to confirm details and establish what if any family benefits are payable there.This process can take a number of months to complete and, as a result, the number of claims that have been finalised to date is relatively small. There are approximately 10,500 claims at various stages of processing and awaiting finalisation. The number of claims to Child Benefit and Early Child Supplement in respect of non resident children of EU nationals has, since the start of 2006, averaged close to 300 per week. Applications reached a peak of 400 per week in June but have been reducing somewhat in the months since.At the start of 2006, Child Benefit was in payment under EU regulations for 650 families, in respect of 1320 children resident outside of the Republic of Ireland.  Currently there are some 560 families, with 1325 children receiving Child Benefit and resident outside Ireland.  Some 90% of these children are resident in the UK. The reduction in the numbers of families in payment is due to changes in the eligibility of UK residents who, because of increases in family benefits in the UK, are no longer eligible for any payment from my Department.The total child benefit expenditure for EU migrants with non resident children in respect of 2006 is estimated at €36m or 1.8% of overall child benefit expenditure of €2.04 billion. The total cost in 2007 is difficult to estimate but on current trends, the potential accrued cost could be of the order of €80m. The corresponding figures for early childcare supplement are €8m in respect of 2006 and €17m in respect of 2007.

In that context, further progress on aligning the relevant rates would fall to be considered in a Budgetary context.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	337	I propose to take Questions Nos. 148 and 159 together.The function of the Pensions Ombudsman is to investigate complaints that an individual has suffered a financial loss because of maladministration in the operation of an occupational pension scheme or a personal retirement savings account. He also investigates disputes of fact or law concerning pension schemes, between members and others entitled to benefit from the schemes, with trustees or managers or employers. The Ombudsman has powers to make binding determinations in relation to disputes which come before him for decision but I am very pleased at the emphasis he places on resolving issues by mediation. This allows for a certain degree of flexibility in how problems are approached.The Office of the Pensions Ombudsman has been in operation since 2003 but the office was not fully staffed until late 2004, so 2005 is in effect the first full year in which the Office has been fully operational. The recent Annual Report is, amongst other things, an overview of the business conducted by the Office in 2005, which was in effect, the first full year in which the Office had been operational. The Report highlights a range of issues to which the Pensions Ombudsman wishes to draw attention. These include women's pensions coverage, pensions for part-time workers in the public sector, overprotective legislation, the quality of information material supplied by pension providers to customers and problems with the Construction Federation Operatives Pensions Scheme (CFOPs).In relation to CFOPS, the question of employment rights and compliance featured strongly in the recent partnership talks and I was pleased to see a commitment in "Towards 2016" for the establishment of the Office of the Director for Employment Rights and Compliance under the aegis of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and a trebling of the Labour Inspectorate. I am sure that, when constituted, the new body will improve the enforcement of employment rights generally, including registered employment agreements, under one of which this pension scheme is constituted.The publication of the Annual Report and the associated Digest of Cases is a way to highlight issues for a wider audience, particularly those engaged in pensions administration, and to demonstrate what the Pensions Ombudsman can do for individuals. Hopefully, it will also help those charged with administering pension schemes to identify weaknesses in their practices and possibly avoid references of complaints to the Ombudsman.The Office complements the work of the Pensions Board and it also works closely with other regulating bodies in the financial area to ensure that complaints are directed to and dealt with in the most appropriate forum. The Pensions Ombudsman, The Pensions Board and the Financial Regulator represent a comprehensive system of protection and redress for pension scheme members. In that regard, I was very pleased to see that The Pensions Ombudsman has concluded Memoranda of Understanding with both the Financial Services Ombudsman and the Chief Executive of the Irish Financial Regulator in order to ensure that complaints are directed to the most appropriate authority for investigation. This helps to safeguard the interests of consumers of financial services generally.The business of the Office of the Pensions Ombudsman continues to grow and in 2005 the number of complaints received for investigation rose by 31% along with a 79% increase in the level of general enquiries received. The service is still relatively new and it is therefore not surprising that the level of complaints being received is continuing to increase. The Pensions Ombudsman has worked hard to raise the profile of his office and the increase in the level of complaint is partly due to his success in this area.The Pensions Ombudsman provides an invaluable service for pension scheme member and he can be assured of my full support for his work.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	338	The primary responsibility for the administration of a pension scheme rests with the trustees of schemes. The trustees must, at all times, act in the best interests of the members and are required under the Pensions Act, and subject to regulations, to provide for the proper investment of the resources of the scheme. In order to discharge their responsibilities to scheme members they should ensure that they secure the best value available in terms of administration charges when arranging for the investment of scheme resources.There are no controls on the administrative costs of occupational pension schemes. Such costs do not impact on the benefits of those in defined benefit schemes. In the case of Standard Personal Retirement Savings Accounts, the administration charges that can be applied are limited by legislation.However, in the case of defined contribution arrangements, it is important that administration costs are kept to the minimum to ensure the maximum return on funds invested. Some defined contribution schemes provide a degree of choice for members in the manner in which their resources are invested. In such cases the Occupational Pension Schemes (Disclosure of Information) Regulations 2006, require that a description of the charges levied on each investment must be provided to members within 3 months of such a request.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	339	I propose to take Questions Nos. 152, 163, 179 and 192 together.The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders on long-term social welfare or health service executive (HSE) payments with meeting the cost of their heating needs during the winter season. I have no plans to extend the scheme to people who are not in receipt of a weekly social welfare or HSE payments.  Issues in relation to VAT on fuel are a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Finance.Fuel allowances are paid for 29 weeks from end-September to mid-April. The allowance represents a contribution towards a person's normal heating expenses and is not intended to meet those costs in full.  A number of improvements have been made to the scheme in recent years including the easing of the means test and extending the duration of payment from 26 weeks to 29 weeks.  Most recently, Budget 2006 provided for an increase in the rate of fuel allowance of €5.00 from €9.00 to €14.00 (€17.90 in designated smokeless areas).Eligibility to the fuel allowance scheme is subject to means and other conditions.  The main conditions that apply to the fuel allowance scheme are that a person must be in receipt of a qualifying payment, must satisfy a means test and must either be living alone or with a qualifying dependant.People who already qualify for means-tested pensions or allowances such as the State (non-contributory) pension, long-term jobseekers allowance (formally unemployment assistance) or one-parent family payment do not have to undergo a further means test to qualify for fuel allowance.  The majority of people who receive fuel allowances qualify because they satisfy the relevant means test for their primary weekly payment.  In effect, the means limits for these payments and consequently for fuel allowance, increase each year in line with the increase in payment rates announced in the budget.In the case of contributory pensions such as state pension (contributory) — formerly old age (contributory) pension — state pension (transition) — formerly retirement pension — and invalidity pensions, which are not means tested, a person may have a combined household income of up to €51 per week, or savings/investments of up to €46,000, over and above the maximum rate of state pension (contributory) and still qualify for fuel allowance.  The amount of additional income allowed was increased to €51 per week with effect from 1 June 2005.  The overall fuel allowance income limits increase each season in line with the increases in the rate of the state pension (contributory).In addition to the fuel allowance, some 340,000 pensioner and other households qualify for electricity or gas allowances through the household benefits package, payable towards their heating, light and cooking costs throughout the year, at an overall cost of €119 million in 2006.  The annual value of the Natural Gas Allowance per household is currently €313.17. This covers the supply charge and up to 1674 Kilowatt hours per annum.  From October 1st the annual value has been increased to €516 per household.This will cover the recent 33.8% increase in Natural Gas and also increase the kilowatt hours per annum from 1,674 to approx. 3,600 for each household.The Electricity Allowance covers normal standing charges and up to 1800 units of electricity. The allowance also covers the VAT applicable to these charges.  In the light of the recent increase in electricity charges the allowance will be increased to cover increased standing charges and the units will also increase from 1800 to 2400 with effect from January 2007.Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme which is administered on my behalf by the Community Welfare Service of the Health Service Executive a special heating supplement may be paid to assist people in certain circumstances that have special heating needs. An application for a heating supplement may be made by contacting the community welfare officer at the local Health Centre.The term "fuel poverty" has been described as the inability to afford adequate warmth in a home, or the inability to achieve adequate warmth because of the energy inefficiency of the home.  The role of the social welfare system in relation to fuel poverty is primarily to provide income support which the Government does through weekly social welfare payments and specific programmes such as the fuel allowance scheme and the household benefits package.  My Department is also cooperating with the Combat Poverty Agency, Sustainable Energy Ireland and other organisations in an action research project to improve energy efficiency in selected older dwellings and to monitor the outcomes in terms of improved cost efficiency and household comfort and health levels. In addition to this, in Budget 2006 I made a grant of €2 million to Sustainable Energy Ireland to enable further research to be undertaken into fuel poverty issues.Fuel allowances are incorporated in the recipient's weekly social welfare payment.   The Government's objective is to ensure that the recipient's total weekly income, including the fuel allowance, is sufficient to meet all of their income needs, including heating costs.   Budget resources have been concentrated on providing significant real increases over and above inflation each year in all primary social welfare pension, benefit and assistance rates.  This is a more costly approach than increasing fuel allowances because the increase is paid for the full year and not just for the 29 weeks of the winter heating season.This approach delivers a better outcome for pensioners and others by substantially increasing their income in real terms over the whole year, to better assist them in meeting their normal basic living costs, including heating.  It is estimated that some 274,000 people (151,000 with basic fuel allowance and 123,000 with smokeless fuel supplement) will benefit in 2006 at an estimated annual cost €125.1m.Any changes to the fuel allowance scheme such as rates of payment, income limits and eligibility — and indeed any changes in income support for particular groups through primary welfare payments — would have significant cost implications.  Any such changes would have to be considered in the context of the Budget and in the light of the resources available for improvements in social welfare generally.

Charges vary across local authorities and even within local authorities where there is more than one provider. In addition, some local authorities already operate waiver schemes. Any system put in place to assist people who rely on private domestic waste collection would have to be sensitive to the different local arrangements.I have asked my Department to continue to explore possible options and to keep me regularly informed of developments.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	341	I propose to take Questions Nos. 154, 156, 167, 182, 189 and 420 together.The most recent results from the Central Statistics Office (CSO) Quarterly National Household Survey show a 0.9% point decline in supplementary pensions coverage from 52.4% of the working population aged 20-69 in quarter 1 of 2004 to 51.5% in the same quarter of 2005. The decline is within the margin of error for the survey so the position appears to be that there was little change in the rate of supplementary pensions coverage over the period in question.  Workers aged 35 to 44 have the highest rate of coverage at 61.3%.  The survey also shows that 43% of those in self-employment aged 20-69 have private pension cover.Pensions coverage for women increased from 46.8% in 2004 to 47.5% in 2005. Even though the coverage rate for men fell between 2004 and 2005 from 56.3% to 54.2%, men continue to have a higher rate of coverage than women. The coverage rate for women is also below the overall average for the workforce as a whole.The reasons for this may be quite varied and could, for instance, include issues such as the interrupted nature of many women's working careers, the disparity in male and female earnings, which may make pensions less affordable for women, and the number of women who work reduced or part-time hours. Coverage for supplementary pensions for part-time workers can vary considerably depending on the number of hours worked. Those working less than 10 hours a week have a coverage rate of just over 9% while, of those working between 20 and 29 hours, just over 34% have a pension.The Government is concerned about the adequacy of retirement income and has introduced a range of measures to encourage people to participate in occupational and private pension arrangements so that they can, when they retire, maintain their pre-retirement standard of living.  These include Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs), mandatory employer PRSA access where occupational schemes are not available, and an ongoing National Pensions Awareness Campaign run by The Pensions Board.Because of the lower than average pension coverage rates for women, the National Pensions Awareness Campaign has launched a number of initiatives targeted specifically at women.  These include teaming up with a recruitment company, most of whose clients are women, to provide those seeking employment with a checklist of the main items that people need to address to ensure that they will have an adequate income when they retire.This checklist was also provided to delegates at the Annual Conference of the Institute of Career Guidance Counsellors earlier this year.  Other initiatives include promotional work around women's events such as the women's mini marathon, women's world exhibition and information booklets dealing exclusively with women's pensions.The National Pensions Policy Initiative report which was published in 1998 outlines the fundamental policy on which current pension targets are based. It set a target of 70% for supplementary pensions coverage for those aged over 30 years. Pensions coverage for the key National Pensions Policy Initiative target group, those aged 30 years and over, stood at 58.6% in the 1st quarter of 2005. This coverage rate has moved little in recent years.In early 2005, I asked the Pensions Board to undertake a review of overall pensions strategy because I considered that, on the basis of the progress being made at that time, there was little prospect of reaching our targets for pensions coverage within a of reasonable timescale. The Pensions Board completed its work in November 2005 and I published the National Pensions Review report in January 2006.The Board has reaffirmed the various targets recommended in the original National Pensions Policy Initiative which included a retirement income, from all sources, of 50% of pre-retirement income, a social welfare pension equating to 34% of average industrial earnings and a supplementary pensions coverage rate of 70% for those aged over 30 years.  The Pensions Board has recommended enhancements to the current voluntary system of supplementary pensions as it considers that it has the potential to deliver significant improvements in coverage.However, no truly voluntary pensions system has delivered the sort of coverage rates for which we are aiming. In that context, I asked the Pensions Board to explore in more detail the issues in relation to a mandatory or quasi-mandatory system which had been set out in the National Pensions Review.The ideas explored range from a mandatory system built on the existing private sector system to a greater role in pensions provision for the PRSI system.In August, the Government published the Pensions Board report on mandatory pensions, Special Savings for Retirement. In this report the Board suggested a model which could be considered if it were decided that a mandatory system of supplementary pensions was required. The model was aimed at low to middle earners and entails mandatory contributions of 15%, shared between employers, employees and the Exchequer, on earnings between €15,000 and €60,000. This would be backed up by an improved social welfare pension, which would increase from a current level of 33% of Gross Average Industrial Earnings to 40%. A timescale of 10 years was suggested for full implementation.The Government has committed itself to producing a Green Paper on pensions as part of the new social partnership agreement Towards 2016 and future pensions policy will be considered in that context. The Green Paper will outline the major policy choices, the challenges in this area and the views of the social partners.The two reports completed by the Pensions Board — the National Pensions Review and their report on mandatory pensions, Special Savings for Retirement —  will be major inputs to the Green Paper.  It is my intention to produce the Green Paper within months.  A consultation process will then take place after which the Government will publish a framework for future pensions policy.

The cost of the scheme for the years 2004 and 2005 was as follows:YearOutturn€m€m200466.343200567.3The level of take-up is less than had been anticipated when the scheme was first introduced in April 1999.  This is due to the significant increase in off-farm employment in recent years and the take up of the Rural Social Scheme which is operated by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and which also specifically targets low-income farmers.The conditions which apply to unemployment payments such as being available for and genuinely seeking work do not apply to the Farm Assist scheme nor are customers required to ‘sign on'. Eligibility is based on the actual means assessed being within specified income thresholds dependant on family size.  This means test is quite favourable to the customer. 70% of self-employment income (including off-farm self-employment) is taken into account for means testing purposes.   There are also child-related disregards of €253.95 for the first two children and €380.92 for each subsequent qualified child.  Capital is favourably assessed, with the first €20,000 held by a claimant disregarded.The farm assist scheme has brought about a worthwhile improvement for low income farmers and particularly for those with children and it makes a valuable contribution to supporting those who are at the lower end of the farm income spectrum.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	343	The figures referred to are contained in a Central Statistics Office Report, published on the 27th of June 2006, entitled "Measuring Ireland's Progress, 2005". The information is based on figures published by Eurostat, the Statistical Office of the EU, which publishes comparisons of social protection expenditure as a percentage of GDP across the EU. This encompasses not only social welfare expenditure but also expenditure in other areas such as health care, social housing, employment support programmes and other social inclusion programmes.The latest such statistics were released on 20 October 2005 and deal with developments up to and including 2002.  No comparable figures are yet available for the period 2003, 2004 or 2005 during which the Irish economy continued to perform exceptionally.When examining such data it is important to remember that gross expenditure measures do not take account of social charges or taxes which may be levied on benefits after they are paid, nor do they include transfers made by means of tax concessions, as opposed to direct cash payments.  For example, tax relief on contributions towards occupational and private pensions, which are an important feature of Ireland's pension system, is not counted as expenditure. The EUROSTAT release draws attention to the fact that the EU average masks major national differences in the structure of social protection funding, partly related to differing levels of wealth between countries, and also reflect differences in social protection systems, demographic trends, unemployment rates and other social, institutional and economic factors.The level of expenditure is also significantly influenced by the age profile of the population. Ireland, currently with one of the youngest populations in the EU, needs to spend less on pensions and healthcare/care of the elderly than most other member states.In addition, social protection expenditure as a percentage of GDP is crucially dependent on the pace of economic growth and the level of unemployment.  The statistics show that at EU level, between 1993 and 1996, social protection expenditure relative to GDP stabilised at a level below the peak of 28.8% in 1993.  This was due to renewed GDP growth and slower growth in s-ocial protection expenditure, particularly related to unemployment benefits.  Over the period from 1996 the EU average dropped from 28.4% to the level of 27.7% in 2002.  Ireland's position mirrored that of the EU as a whole, except that the level of economic growth and the decline in unemployment were much greater in Ireland than in most other EU countries and consequently the drop in the percentage of GDP accounted for by social protection expenditure was greater.The fact is that under this Government there has been a sustained and substantial increase in social protection expenditure.  The EUROSTAT report states that the increase in Ireland's per capita expenditure (8.7% per annum and the highest of all EU countries) from 1998 to 2002, in comparison to that of the EU as a whole (2.5% per annum), was "particularly pronounced".Moreover, it should be noted that social welfare expenditure will have increased substantially during the 4 year period 2002 to 2006.  The overall spending on social welfare in 2006 will increase to over  €13.6 billion, an increase of over EUR 1.4 billion from the 2005 figure, representing the highest ever spend on social welfare. Indeed, between 1997 and 2006 the basic rate of social welfare payment has increased by 99.7%, well ahead of the 34.2% increase in consumer prices and the 67.7% increase in gross average industrial earnings.This Government will continue to address the scope for further improvements in Ireland's social protection infrastructure, guided by the National Anti Poverty Strategy, while at the same time continuing to take the measures necessary to maintain economic growth and competitiveness and thereby generate the resources for further social investment.

The figure for males is 54.2% while 47.5% of females are contributing to a pension. The Government is aiming for a coverage rate of 70% for those who are 30 years of age and over. The coverage rate for this group is currently about 59%.Because pensions coverage for females is below average there is a particular focus on them in the National Pensions Awareness Campaign. This has involved special initiatives and promotions, aimed at women, built around appropriate events.  The objective is to encourage women to avail of opportunities afforded to them to contribute to an occupational or a private scheme and the most recent coverage figures have shown a small improvement on the 2004 figure.The Pensions Ombudsman has drawn attention to difficulties being experienced by women in relation to pensions in particular areas and, if possible, I would like to see these resolved.  The comments made by the Pensions Ombudsman related to certain public service pension schemes.  My colleague, the Minister for Finance, has overall responsibility for public service pensions policy.  Each public service pension scheme operates under specific rules and conditions.  The issues raised by the Pensions Ombudsman are matters for the individual public service bodies in the first instance, in consultation with the Minister under whose aegis they operate and the Minister for Finance as appropriate.  In this context, the points made by the Pensions Ombudsman in July are being considered further by those concerned.

The fuel allowance is paid for 29 weeks from end-September to mid-April.  Budget 2006 provided for an increase of €5 per week in the rate of fuel allowance, from €9.00 to €14.00 per week and to €17.90 per week in designated smokeless areas.In order to qualify for the national fuel scheme, a person must be in receipt of a qualifying payment, satisfy a means test and be living alone or only with certain excepted people.The household benefits package, which comprises the electricity/gas allowance, telephone allowance and television licence schemes, is generally available to people living permanently in the State, aged 66 years or over, who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment or who satisfy a means test.  The package is also available to carers and people with disabilities under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.  Widows and widowers aged from 60 to 65 whose late spouses had been in receipt of the household benefits package retain that entitlement to ensure that households do not suffer a loss of entitlements following the death of a spouse.  People aged over 70 years of age can qualify for the household benefits package regardless of their income or household composition.Last month, I announced improvements in the household benefits package to protect recipients from the increased costs of gas and electricity.  As a result of these improvements, the present entitlement of 1,800 free units of electricity per annum will be increased to 2,400 free units per annum from 1 January 2007.  There have also been pro rata increases for customers who avail of the gas allowance which came into effect on 1 October.  The allowances will continue to include payment of the standing charges.At present, there are approximately 315,000 people in receipt of the electricity allowance and approximately 26,000 people in receipt of the gas allowance.  I am confident that these increases will be of major benefit to these recipients.Proposals to increase the value of the electricity and gas allowances or to increase further the fuel allowance are kept under review for consideration in a budgetary context.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	346	While there were no specific measures in relation to the leasing of land in the recent Budget, it did contain a number of important measures which are designed to target resources at particular groups of older people, including the farmers in question.  In considering these measures I was anxious to target resources at those who are at the greatest risk of poverty; to encourage saving, and to simplify the system of income support for older people who do not receive contributory pensions.Budget 2006 provided for an increase of €16 per week (9.6%) for all non-contributory pensioners, bringing the weekly rate of pension to €182 per week with effect from last January.  This meant that significant progress was made towards the achievement of the Government's commitment to bring the basic state pension to over €200 per week by 2007.   In addition, I increased the fuel allowance by €5 per week, from €9 to €14 and the over 80 allowance by €3.60 to €10. These measures will be of considerable benefit to many thousands of non-contributory pensioners.On Budget Day, I was also pleased to announce the establishment, in September of this year, of a standardised State (Non-Contributory) Pension, replacing the six different non-contributory schemes heretofore available to persons aged 66 and over.All the schemes in question featured a common means disregard of €7.60 per week, which had not increased since the 1970s.  The means disregard for the State (Non-Contributory) Pension is now €20 per week, an increase of €12.40 per week. Up to 34,000 pensioners who were in receipt of a reduced rate of payment have gained from this change.  The increase in the personal rate of payment is up to €12.50 per week while the qualified adult rate, where applicable, has increased by up to €8.30 per week.  This measure, in particular, has benefited all those farmers who were in receipt of an old age (non-contributory) pension, including farmers who have leased land.By any standards, the levels of increases and reformed means test arrangements announced in the Budget 2006 are exceptional.  The introduction of the State (Non-Contributory) Pension is also a further demonstration of our commitment to all those who are elderly, including those who continue to farm or lease land.  Further improvements for pensioners generally will be considered in the forthcoming Budget.

There is a statutory obligation on employers to register eligible employees in the scheme and to pay the necessary contributions.Compliance with the terms of the scheme is enforced through the Construction Industry Monitoring Agency, The Labour Court and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The Pensions Board also has a role in relation to the scheme in so far as compliance with the various aspects of the Pensions Act is concerned.In this regard, employers who deduct pension contributions from employees and who fail to remit these contributions to the scheme trustees are in breach of Section 58A of the Pensions Act. The Pensions Board will fully investigate all such cases which are brought to its attention.The main difficulties with the scheme relate to failure to register employees and/or to deduct any contributions to the scheme. These issues are a matter for the Construction Industry Monitoring Agency, The Labour Court and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.Given the ongoing controversy in relation to the scheme and compliance with its terms, the Pensions Board, in 2005, facilitated a report on the scheme in conjunction with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. This report, which is referred to by the Pensions Ombudsman, was undertaken by Mercer Human Resource Consulting. It found that 80% of the estimated 80,000 eligible employees in the industry are covered by the scheme. However, the report does highlight the fact that an estimated 70,000 operatives are classed as self-employed and are therefore not eligible to join the scheme. The consultants are of the view that many of these workers are not genuinely self-employed.With regard to self-employment, designations are, in the first instance, generally made by the Revenue Commissioners. However, it is open at any time to an individual to ask for a determination on his or her employment status for social insurance purposes from the Scope section of my Department and the Pensions Ombudsman refers to the role of the Scope section in that regard.Dealing with the issues of non-compliance with the Registered Employment Agreement is, in my opinion, the way forward. As the House will be aware, employment rights and compliance featured strongly in the recent partnership talks and I was pleased to see a commitment in "Towards 2016" for the establishment of the Office of the Director for Employment Rights and Compliance under the aegis of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and a trebling of the Labour Inspectorate. When constituted, the new Office will play an important part in improving enforcement of employment legislation, including registered employment agreements, under one of which the construction industry pension scheme is constituted.In the meantime, I have asked my Department to consider to what extent it can assist generally, having regard to the powers it has available to visit employers and inspect records. My Department carries out a significant number of employer inspections each year and, in this context, a greater emphasis will be placed on the construction sector.It is understood that the scheme sponsors and trustees are in the process of closing the CFOPS scheme and replacing it with a new defined contribution scheme to be known as the Construction Workers Pension Scheme. The operative date of the new scheme is a matter for the sponsors and trustees.

The question of what is a person's "habitual residence" is decided in accordance with European Court of Justice case law, which sets out the grounds for assessing individual claims.The Social Welfare Appeals Office Annual Report 2005 refers to earlier concerns as to the application of the habitual residence condition to certain categories of migrant workers who are nationals of the EEA and the possible conflict with relevant EU Legislation.  The report notes, however, that EU legislation introduced in 1995 has alleviated their concerns and reduced the number of cases coming to appeal.The report also drew attention to the need for adequate safeguards to ensure consistency in the decision making process for those cases and referred in particular to instances of inconsistency between decisions in the different schemes such as unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance.The Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) scheme is administered by the Community Welfare Division of the Health Service Executive (HSE) on behalf of my Department.  For schemes administered directly by my Department, straightforward decisions on habitual residence are dealt with at my Department's local offices and relevant headquarters offices while complex cases and cases where there is a doubt are dealt with in specialised units.  Any applicant who disagrees with the decision of a Deciding Officer has the right to appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.For the period 1 May 2004 to 30 September 2006, the number of habitual residence cases decided in specialist units was 41,571.  The total number of cases deemed not habitually resident was 9,841 (24%).   The number of appeals against HRC decisions determined by the Social Welfare Appeals Office for the period 1 May 2004 to end March 2006 was 832, of which the Deciding Officer's decision was upheld in 514 cases and the decision was overturned in 312 cases.A review and ongoing contact with the HSE have confirmed that the approach taken by the HSE in relation to determination of HRC is consistent with the approach taken in my Department.  The outcome of the review suggests that variances in decisions made were as a result of the provision of additional information being notified more readily to the CWO than to the Department's Specialist Unit at time of claim.I have noted the findings as contained in the Annual Report.  The fact that only a small percentage of rejected cases are brought to appeal and the fact that the majority of those appeals are not allowed suggests that the habitual residence condition is being operated in a careful manner, while at the same time ensuring that people whose cases are appropriate to the system have access to it when they need it.

Traditionally, such schemes were organised on a defined benefit basis. However, in recent years defined benefit provision has been under pressure because of volatility in the stock markets and increasing liabilities arising demographic pressures, low interest rates, increasing wage costs which translate into higher benefits and regulatory requirements. New accountancy standards, which make pensions liabilities very apparent on a company's balance sheet, are also making a major contribution to the pressures under which defined benefit schemes are now operating.A drift from defined benefit to defined contribution schemes is now very apparent, even in cases where firms are very profitable. This is, in my view, a regrettable development. Unfortunately, there are no accurate statistics available on the number of schemes that are introducing change, as unless the defined benefit scheme is actually being wound-up, there is no requirement to notify the Pensions Board of alterations to the terms of a pension scheme.There is no provision within the Pensions Act for employers to consult with employees in relation to proposed changes to schemes though, in many cases, this happens as part of the normal industrial relations processes within companies.The Pensions Act and the associated regulations provide for a range of information in relation to a scheme to be made available to scheme members so that they can monitor their benefits and the financial soundness of their scheme. Certain basic information, mainly about the contribution and benefit structure of the scheme must be given by the trustees to every member on joining the scheme and to members and other specified persons on request. Material alterations to a scheme must also be drawn to the attention of members.The Government has committed to producing a Green Paper on pensions as part of the new social partnership agreement Towards 2016. The Green Paper will outline the major policy choices, the challenges in this area and the views of the social partners.  Also, as part of the agreement the Pensions Board is being asked to research benefit design options in the occupational pensions area and to examine current design issues in both defined benefit and defined contribution arrangements with a view to producing guidance as to designs which encompass the positive elements of each arrangement while adjusting the costs and risks to the parties involved.It is my intention to produce the Green Paper over the coming months. A consultation process will follow this and the Government will respond to these consultations by developing a framework for comprehensively addressing the pensions agenda over the long-term.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	350	I propose to take Questions Nos. 169 and 199 together.Supporting and recognising carers in our society has been a priority of the Government since 1997. Over that period, weekly payment rates to carers have been greatly increased, qualifying conditions for carer's allowance have been significantly eased, coverage of the scheme has been extended and new schemes such as carer's benefit and the respite care grant have been introduced and extended.One of the key Government commitments in the new national partnership agreement "Towards 2016" is the development of a National Carer's Strategy.  This strategy, which will focus on supporting informal and family carers in the community, will be developed by the end of 2007.  All relevant Departments and Agencies will be involved in the strategy and there will be appropriate consultation with the social partners."Towards 2016" also commits my Department to leading the development of a structured consultation process to inform future policy in relation to carers.  This will involve an annual meeting of carer's representative groups as well as relevant Department and Agencies.It is intended that the first such meeting will be held this November.  My officials have been in contact with their counterparts in the relevant Departments and Agencies in order to finalise arrangements.   Carer representative groups will shortly be contacted in this regard.  This consultation meeting will give the representative groups an opportunity to discuss issues of concern to them with all the relevant Departments and Agencies.The consultation meeting will also provide a good opportunity for all involved to tease out the issues to be covered by the strategy.  While social welfare supports for carers will clearly be a key issue, other issues such as access to respite and other services, education, training and employment will also feature strongly.Co-operation between relevant Government Departments and Agencies is essential if the provision of services, supports and entitlements for carers is to be fully addressed.  I am committed to working for, and with, carers to deliver increased benefits, supports, and services for them and their families.  In that regard, I will continue to review the scope for further development of the supports available.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	351	The ‘at risk of poverty' indicator identifies persons or households who fall below the relative income threshold, which in the EU has been set at 60 per cent of median income. Results from the first two years of the EU Survey on Income and Living Conditions (EU–SILC) show that there has been a slight decrease in the percentage of persons classified as ‘at risk of poverty' from 19.7 per cent in 2003 to 19.4 per cent in 2004. This rate, however, does not reflect the enormous improvements made, especially over the past decade in improving living standards, especially of those on low incomes.One of the main difficulties with the "at risk of poverty" indicator is that it measures relative poverty and is thus related to two income streams.  The first income stream is average household income.  In Ireland as a result of our economic success there has been a major increase in overall incomes due to the fall in unemployment, more and better paid jobs, increasing female participation in the workforce leading to more two income households, and tax reform, to name the main ones.  The second income stream relates to those on lower incomes.Although there were major increases in real terms in social welfare payments, including pensions, these incomes did not increase at the same rate as those of people in employment, and therefore, the proportion on relatively lower incomes, classified as at risk of poverty, was increasing at a time when their standard of living was substantially improving.Income measures of poverty also provide only a snap shot of the situation of individuals. They include people who may only be temporarily on a low income such as students, as well as those who are more persistently poor.  Neither do they indicate the level of poverty intensity, namely the extent to which levels of income on average are below the 60% median threshold.  Poverty intensity in Ireland is shallow compared to the EU average, with many people classified as at risk of poverty having incomes close to the threshold. This applies especially to the elderly. The indicator does not provide either a full picture of a person's command of resources in relation, for example, to consumption of public services such as education, health, housing, care services, transport, or to home ownership, ability to benefit from shared living expenses with family, and to draw from accumulated savings.  Home ownership, for example, is relatively high in Ireland especially for older people and the income saved from not having to pay a market rent or a mortgage adds significantly to a person's real income.In order to establish who are actually in poverty, Ireland has developed an indicator, consistent poverty, which measures actual deprivation relative to prevailing basic standards of living.  This has been developed by the ESRI in consultation with my Department and the Combat Poverty Agency.The latest EU SILC survey found that 6.8% of our population continues to experience poverty, hardship or deprivation in some form in their lives. This mainly includes those who live in households which are jobless and primarily dependent on social welfare for their incomes, particularly families with children, especially lone parents and large families, people with disabilities, the unemployed, and the elderly, especially those living alone. These findings clearly indicate what the priorities should be in our strategies to combat poverty and social exclusion.International organizations such as the EU and the OECD are also examining the possibility of developing indicators based on deprivation.  The findings of preliminary studies by both organizations show that levels of deprivation in Ireland compare favourably with other developed countries, in contrast to the outcomes for the "at risk of poverty" indicator.A recent article in the prominent journal "Development and Transition", published by the UN Development Programme and the London School of Economics and Political Science, concluded that relative poverty indicators can not be used for international comparisons, unless countries are similar in their level of economic development.  The article concluded that reliance on the "risk of poverty" indicator causes a number of problems which include thatThe results too often belie common sense;The "at risk of poverty" label sends the wrong signal to the public and policy makers;The "risk of poverty" logic does not lead to effective national policy.No single indicator can capture the full complexity of poverty, which is why the EU uses a range of such indicators.The "at risk of poverty" indicator, however, has become a headline indicator. As indicated, all the evidence shows that it gives a misleading impression of poverty, and its application to Ireland has now become an example at international level of its limitations. I consider that it is important that these limitations are recognized here in Ireland as well, and especially the distorting effect it can have on policy debate, discourse and, most important, on the future direction of measures targeted at tackling poverty.

The group considers that the free travel scheme and the household benefits package should be available to people experiencing the late effects of polio who are not in receipt of a qualifying payment without their having to satisfy a means test.The household benefits package, which comprises the electricity/gas allowance, telephone allowance and television licence schemes, is generally available to people living permanently in the State, aged 66 years or over, who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment or who satisfy a means test. The package is also available to carers and people with disabilities under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments. People aged over 70 years of age can qualify regardless of their income or household composition. Widows and widowers aged from 60 to 65 whose late spouses had been in receipt of the household benefits package retain that entitlement to ensure that households do not suffer a loss of entitlements following the death of a spouse.The free travel scheme is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years or over. All carers in receipt of carer's allowance and carers of people in receipt of constant attendance or prescribed relative's allowance, regardless of their age, receive a free travel pass. It is also available to people under age 66 who are in receipt of certain disability type welfare payments, such as disability allowance, invalidity pension and blind person's pension. People resident in the State who are in receipt of a social security invalidity or disability payment from a country covered by EU Regulations, or from a country with which Ireland has a bilateral social security agreement, and who have been in receipt of this payment for at least 12 months, are also eligible for free travel.My Department also provides a range of employment supports. In particular, the back to work allowance scheme incentivises and encourages long-term unemployed people, lone parents and certain persons with disabilities to return to work by allowing them to retain part of their social welfare payment for a period when they take up employment or self-employment. The back to education allowance programme is available to people who need to obtain educational qualifications before re-entering the labour market. There is also a special projects fund, administered by facilitators based in local social welfare offices, which enables facilitators to provide enhanced supports to people who need additional help to progress to further training and employment.A range of proposals have been made to extend the coverage of the household benefits package and the free travel scheme. Further extensions to the free travel scheme could only be considered in a Budgetary context and taking account of the financial and other needs of those not covered by the existing arrangements.

All remaining time based restrictions have been removed from the scheme with effect from 25th September 2006.The scheme provides free travel on the main public and private transport services for those eligible under the scheme.  These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus Átha Cliath, Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann, LUAS, as well as services provided by over 90 private transport operators.  The vast majority of the private operators providing services under the scheme operate in rural areas. The underlying feature of the scheme is the use of spare capacity on these transport services.My Department is always willing to consider applications from licensed private transport operators who may wish to participate in the free travel scheme.  However, while my Department pays transport providers to operate the free travel scheme, it is not the competent authority to decide on the award of an Annual Passenger Licence, nor is it in a position to provide transport services where none currently exist.The issue of access to public transport in rural areas is being addressed at present through the Rural Transport Initiative (RTI), which is being managed by Pobal on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Transport.My Department contributed EUR 500,000 in 2004, EUR 750,000 in 2005 and EUR 850,000 in 2006 to the Rural Transport Initiative (RTI). This contribution has been made to ensure that free travel pass holders continued to have full access to community based transport services.   My department's contribution to the RTI is intended as a contribution to the overall cost of carrying free travel pass holders.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	354	The prevention of fraud and abuse of the social welfare system is an integral part of the day to day work of my Department.  In this regard all staff engaged in claims processing are concerned with preventing and detecting fraud and abuse.Systematic risk analysis is a key element of the Department's control strategy.  This  entails the identification,  by  scheme managers, of  areas of  high  risk  of fraud  and abuse  in  the schemes for  which they  are responsible  and putting  in  place appropriate measures to address them  in a systematic way.   The purpose of this approach is to ensure that review activity is targeted in the most effective manner.My Department also carries out surveys of the levels of fraud and error as part of its control strategy and utilises the outcomes of these surveys to ensure that control actually is targeted as effectively as possible. Over 600 staff at local, regional and national level are engaged on a full or part-time basis on work related to the control of fraud and abuse of the social welfare system.Controls are exercised at both the initial claim stage and at subsequent stages during the claim life-cycle.   Claims are reviewed on a regular and targeted basis. During 2005, some 330,000 reviews of entitlements were carried out by staff in my Department.  The records of some 5,700 employers were inspected to ensure compliance with the Department's regulations and in particular to prevent and detect abuses of the system. In 2006, to the end of August, over 220,000 reviews have been undertaken with 2,700 employers inspected.The prosecution of offenders is a key element in my Department's overall control approach. My Department's policy is to consider all cases of fraud for prosecution.During 2005, 440 cases were referred to the State Solicitor's Office to initiate prosecution proceedings. 271 cases were finalised in court, of which 4 were served with prison sentences, 25 received suspended sentences, 130 were fined, 85 received the benefit of the Probation Act. The remaining penalties included cases which received community service, were bound to the peace or adjourned with liberty to re-enter. Up to the end of August ‘06, 213 cases have been submitted for initiation of court proceedings.I am committed to ensuring that social welfare payments are available to those who are entitled to them.  I am also determined to ensure that abuse of the system is prevented and is dealt with effectively when detected.  In this regard the control programme of my Department is carefully monitored and the various measures are continuously refined to ensure that they remain effective.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	355	I appreciate the work undertaken by the Society of Saint Vincent De Paul and others on behalf of the most vulnerable members of Irish society and it is, of course, a matter of concern that the level of demand for the Society's services appears to be increasing.This Government remains committed to greatly improving the standard of living of welfare dependent and low-income households and to making a decisive impact on poverty and social exclusion.  This commitment has been expressed in greatly increased levels of income support provided through the social welfare system during the life of this Government.   Since 1997 the lowest rates of welfare payments have been increased by almost 100%, well ahead of the 49% accumulated inflation over that period.    We remain on course to achieve the income maintenance targets set out in the National Action Plan against Poverty and Social Exclusion next year.In the last Budget, the personal and qualified adult rates of payment were increased by unprecedented amounts. The lowest rates of social welfare payments were increased by €17 per week to €165.80, or by 11.4%. This increase is well ahead of projected inflation for 2006 and, therefore, improves and enhances the living standards of all recipients.I also introduced a number of important measures designed to address poverty and to reward work and enterprise in Budget 2006.  These included a Child and Family Poverty package of nearly €155 million which involved major improvements for low-income families and for single parent families.In addition, I announced a wide-ranging employment support package of €28 million. This contained a range of measures which will alleviate poverty and support activation by improving income disregards and tapers for people with disabilities, the unemployed and qualified adults. These arrangements maximise the benefits of work for low-income households.I will be considering further improvements in income support and allied measures designed to assist low income households in the context of the forthcoming Budget.

Such a payment would be aimed specifically at targeting child poverty by channelling resources to low-income families without creating significant disincentives to employment. NESC has indicated that, as the proposed second tier income support represents a new approach to targeting, the issues involved are complex and there are technical and policy challenges to be overcome.  The Council has stated its analysis of the issues which I believe will be of significant assistance in informing the future direction of child income support policy.In addition, the latest Partnership agreement, Towards 2016, includes a Government commitment to progressing, as a priority, further work aimed at assisting children in families on low incomes, to include enhancing existing provisions or the introduction of new or reformed mechanisms.

All remaining time-based restrictions have been removed from the scheme, with effect from 25th September 2006.Policy relating to the purchase of rail tickets and the restriction of free travel pass holders to day return tickets only, when travelling by train, is a matter for CIE. Where a return journey is not made on the same day, CIE policy dictates that a single journey ticket is required for each journey. While any change in this policy is a matter for CIE, I intend to keep the matter under review in the context of further improvements to the free travel scheme.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	358	The report to which the Deputy refers was produced by the Social Welfare Appeals Office (SWAO) in accordance with legislative requirements. It contains details of the activities of the office in 2005, as well as commentary on other issues which arose during the year.  As previously stated by me on 10 August 2006, the SWAO has a pivotal role to play in ensuring that welfare customers have access to an independent review mechanism when they feel aggrieved by a decision made by my Department and wish to appeal the outcome.My Department makes every effort to deal sensitively with all cases and to deliver entitlements to people based on need and in accordance with the legislation.  However, considering that my Department makes almost one million payments a week that benefit more than 1.5 million people, and received 1.75 million claims for statutory social welfare schemes in 2005, it is understandable that there will be some people who will not agree with decisions made on their entitlements.  The total number of appeals to the SWAO, viewed in the context of the number of claims received, is small.The report highlights that 47% of appeals had a successful outcome for the appellant. It refers to the fact that of the 6,325 favourable decisions on appeal cases, in excess of half of these decisions (3,302) were in fact revised decisions made by statutorily appointed Deciding Officers of my Department, who reviewed the claim following the initial disallowance.  These revised decisions arose as a result, in many cases, of new facts or fresh evidence produced by the claimant after the original decision on his/her claim. In such cases an Appeals Officer decision was not necessary.  In addition, it should be noted that of the 8,484 appeals actually decided by Appeals Officers, a total of 5,461 (64%) upheld the original decision of the Deciding Officer.The right of review to which I referred earlier, was introduced in 2002 in response to the commitment contained in my Department's Strategy Statement 2001-2004. In that Statement we undertook to "develop our systems to ensure that any decision will be reviewed in the light of any further information brought to our notice. All customers who receive an adverse decision are advised of their right to have their claim reviewed".Customers whose claims are disallowed or who are disqualified from payment or awarded social welfare at a reduced rate are informed that if they have any new fact or evidence that has a bearing on their case, they should send it in the first instance to the Deciding Officer for re-examination and, if appropriate, for revision of the decision. They are informed that this right is in addition to their right of appeal to the SWAO. They can seek a Deciding Officer review before making an appeal or can do both concurrently. The right of appeal to the SWAO remains an option if the review by the Deciding Officer is not fruitful.The success of this strategy has been highlighted in a number of annual reports of the SWAO.  In the Annual Report 2002, for example, the contribution which the Deciding Officer Review process made in reducing the overall number of appeals that were received in the SWAO was noted. In the first full year of operation, it is estimated that 3,738 appeals were cut short as a result of a revised decision by a Deciding Officer and resulted in a favourable outcome for the appellant. The 2005 Annual Report also highlights the success of this strategy.The ongoing discussions between the Social Welfare Appeals Office and my Department on matters of common interest are referred to in the Annual Report. Arising from such discussions, guidelines, procedures and practices are reviewed and changed where necessary.  The role of the statutorily appointed Deciding Officer is to decide entitlement to statutory social welfare schemes and insurability of employment in accordance with the legislation. The conditions of entitlement are kept under review and my Department has been involved in various reviews of schemes as part of its annual business plans. I welcome the continued commitment of the SWAO to providing an accessible and independent review mechanism for people who appeal against decisions made by my Department in regard to their statutory entitlements.

All carers in receipt of carer's allowance and carers of people in receipt of constant attendance or prescribed relative's allowance, regardless of their age, receive a free travel pass.The scheme is also available to people under age 66 who are in receipt of certain disability type welfare payments, such as disability allowance, invalidity pension and blind person's pension. People resident in the State who are in receipt of a social security invalidity or disability payment from a country covered by EU Regulations, or from a country with which Ireland has a bilateral social security agreement, and who have been in receipt of this payment for at least 12 months, are also eligible for free travel.The same qualifying conditions apply regardless of whether the applicant lives in an urban or a rural area. The guidelines for the scheme are available on my Department's website.The scheme provides free travel on the main public and private transport services for those eligible under the scheme. These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus Átha Cliath, Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann, as well as Luas and services provided by over 80 private transport operators. The underlying feature of the scheme is the use of spare capacity on these transport services.The vast majority of private contractors providing services under the scheme operate in rural areas. However, while my Department pays transport providers to operate the free travel scheme, it is not in a position to provide transport services where none exist.The issue of access to public transport in rural areas is being addressed at present through the Rural Transport Initiative, which is being managed by Pobal, formerly Area Development Management (ADM), on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Transport. My Department contributed €500,000 to the Initiative in 2004, €750,000 in 2005 and is contributing €850,000 for the Initiative in 2006. This will ensure that free travel pass holders continue to have full access to community based transport services.Significant improvements have been made to the free schemes, including the free travel scheme, in recent Budgets both in terms of the qualifying conditions and the coverage of the schemes. I will continue to review the operation of these schemes with a view to identifying the scope for further improvements as resources permit.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	360	Child Benefit can be paid in respect of every child under the age of 16 years, who is ordinarily resident in the state.  Payment can be extended to the 19th birthday if the child is in education or disabled and incapable of self support. The benefit is paid to the qualified person with whom the child resides and, since May 2004, the person making the claim for Child Benefit must satisfy the Habitual Residency Condition.In 2004 my Department introduced a new facility to simplify the claim process for Child Benefit.  Since then all births registered with the General Registers Office are notified to my Department electronically on a same day basis. This information is used to automatically issue payment of Child Benefit to the mother for her new baby without the need to submit a claim, if she is already in payment for other children.Alternatively if she has not previously claimed Child Benefit, a partially completed claim form is issued to her, which she simply has to complete and return to activate her payment.  No birth certificate needs to be provided as this information is automatically updated from the General Registers Office.  In addition, my Department has arranged for an information leaflet outlining this facility to be included in information packs given to new mothers at the country's Maternity Hospitals.In 2004 there were 61,684 births registered in the country, the figure for 2005 was 61,042.  The total number of Child Benefit claims received in these years was 75,891, and 79,330 respectively, the difference being accounted for by children born outside the country who moved to Ireland with their parents during these years.Information of the availability of Child Benefit is widely available through my Department's website, network of local offices and An Post Offices. In addition Citizen advice offices and many voluntary groups have access to the information.  As no data on the numbers of children who enter or leave the state is held, it is impossible to state categorically that all eligible children are being claimed for. However I am satisfied that with the structures in place to advise parents of their entitlement, the substantial value of the payment and the recent publicity concerning the payment that there in no significant under-claiming of Child Benefit and that the availability of the benefit is widely known.

I would wish to point out to the Deputy, however, that this Department continues to meet the 3% target set by the Government for the employment of people with disabilities.

The Government has accepted the Review Group's recommendation and legislation is currently being prepared to give effect to it. The Government Legislation Programme published on 26 September provides for publication of the Property Services Regulatory Authority Bill in 2007.It is intended that the functions of the Regulatory Authority will, in addition to its licensing function, include an information and public awareness function in relation to the costs, benefits and risks associated with the provision of property services.  It will also have an investigative function which will allow it to investigate the provision of property services of its own motion or in response to specific complaints.  It is intended that the Regulatory Authority will have a range of sanctions at its disposal, ranging from revocation of a licence, or its suspension for a period, to the issuing of a reprimand or caution.

On completion of its examination of the situation of people with disabilities, its report, "A Strategy for Equality", was presented to the Minister in November 1996 and accepted by the Government in principle in 1997."Towards Equal Citizenship", a special report was published in December 1999 by an Interdepartmental Task Force on the implementation of the recommendations of the Commission. It showed that two-thirds of its recommendations were either implemented or in the process of being implemented.Subsequently, the substance of the recommendations of the Commission has been achieved by way of: establishment of the Disability Equality Unit with responsibility for overall coordination of disability policy, in my Department; establishment of the National Disability Authority; the enactment of comprehensive equality legislation, the disability provisions of which have been strengthened in the Equality Act 2004; establishment of Comhairle; establishment of People with Disabilities in Ireland Ltd as a grass-roots organisation for people with disabilities to make their voices heard in issues affecting them; and the enactment of the Disability Act 2005.Major progress has also been achieved in the area of education, with the enactment of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004, and the establishment of the National Educational Psychological Service. Other, more specific recommendations continue to be implemented within a general framework of statutory and administrative reform, such as the recent extension of travel passes for disabled people and their carers to peak hours, or the enactment of the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act 2006, which incorporates Commission Recommendation No. 287 for the need of a public review of mental incapacity and the criminal law.These are major changes in the legal, institutional, and policy framework which affects people with disabilities in Ireland.  Not only do they implement the recommendations of the Commission, but they provide their own dynamic of change.  The National Disability Strategy, launched by the Government in September 2004, represents Government policy for the necessary sectoral changes in infrastructure, access and the provision of services to ensure the participation of disabled people in society and the funding necessary to achieve those changes.  The Strategy is currently being implemented across all Government Departments and the entire public sector.

It is a national movement with its network comprising of approximately 1,249  local Community Alert groups of which there are 37 schemes in Co. Monaghan and 37 schemes in Co. Cavan dedicated to improving the quality of life of people in rural communities who are vulnerable, in particular the elderly, by crime prevention, neighbourliness and self reliance, general community safety and well-being, accident prevention, promotion of personal safety and having an anti-poverty focus awareness of social inclusion.I am strongly of the view that community organisations have, through their support and co-operation with the Garda Síochána, an important role to play in crime prevention and the promotion of community safety and I very much support the work in this area being carried out by Muintir na Tíre through Community Alert.

One of these conditions is that the applicant has had a period of one year's continuous residency in the State immediately before the date of the application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, has had a total residence in the State amounting to four years.The Deputy will also be aware that Section 16(f) of the aforementioned Act allows the Minister in his absolute discretion to grant an application although the conditions for naturalisation are not complied with where the applicant is or has been resident abroad in the public service. For the purposes of the Act, the term ‘public service' when used in relation to the employment of a person, refers to employment in the service of the Government, whether or not in the civil service, or in the service of any public corporation or authority maintained wholly or partly out of public funds or in respect of which a Minister of State is responsible.If an applicant considers that he/she has an entitlement to a certificate of naturalisation based on his/her employment in the public service, it is open to that applicant to submit such an application.

In addition, a quantity of ammunition has also been surrendered.  The amnesty runs for a period of 2 months, from 1st September to 31st October, 2006, and I am confident that weapons will continue to be surrendered to the Gardaí while the amnesty lasts.My Department has engaged in an extensive advertising campaign to promote the amnesty.  This includes the production of 20,000 information leaflets for distribution through Garda stations throughout the country, a media advertising campaign in the national and provincial newspapers together with an extensive billboard advertising campaign.

These personnel allocations are determined by a number of factors including demographics, crime trends, administrative functions and other operational policing needs.  Garda management state that such allocations are continually monitored and reviewed along with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy.  This ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and that the best possible service is provided to the public.I should add that the current recruitment drive to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000 members, in line with the commitment in the Agreed Programme for Government, is fully on target.  This will lead to a combined strength, of both attested Gardaí and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year.  The first three groups of newly attested Gardaí under this accelerated recruitment programme came on stream in March, June and September of this year and the fourth such group will become fully attested members of the Force later this year.  Further tranches of approximately 275 newly attested Gardaí will follow every 90 days thereafter until the programme is complete.

They are those who joined the Department through special recruitment competitions run by the Public Appointments Service (PAS) for people with disabilities, the last of which I understand was held in 1999; those who more recently joined through the regular PAS competitions having declared their disability; those who did not declare their disability when joining the Department but did so subsequently; and those who developed a disability since joining.While the Department maintains statistics on staff with a disability, the information requested by the Deputy is not held in a readily accessible format and may indeed require contact with a significant proportion of the staff concerned in order to provide accurate data.I can, however, inform the Deputy that the proportion of staff with a disability employed in my Department exceeds the Government's 3% target for the employment of people with disabilities across the public sector and currently stands at over 5%.  My Department's commitment to the employment of people with disabilities is further underlined by its active participation in a work experience programme for graduates with disabilities, under which 5 people have been placed in the Department over the last two years.  I would also like to mention that my Department has appointed a senior official to the position of Disability Liaison Officer, whose role is to act as a point of contact both within and between Departments for information and advice in relation to disability.  The Department's Employee Assistance Service also plays a valuable role in this regard.

Traditionally, Gardaí have been made available for the performance of such duties and the State has charged for their services.  This work is done by members of the Force who would otherwise be off duty.  At present organisers of events pay for the cost of non-public duties performed by Gardaí on duty inside the event location (e.g at sporting events, major G.A.A. or soccer matches, rock concerts etc.).  The cost of policing duties performed by Gardaí outside of the event location such as traffic control, beat patrols and other policing duties which would be additional to those normally performed at the location are not paid for by the organisers of the event and fall to be paid from public funds.  The Garda authorities point out that in many cases, it is difficult to define where public duty ends and where non-public duty liability of the organisations begins but that the safety of the public must be the ultimate consideration.I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the total cost of supplying Gardaí for duty of a non-public nature at events held at Croke Park during the period 1st October, 2005 to 31st September, 2006 was €930,097.  Garda management further state that costs in respect of duty carried out by members outside of the stadium are not currently available.

Because of the characteristics of the State's road network, mobile cameras offer the most effective solution, although the use of fixed cameras may be relevant at a small number of locations.Following the enactment of the Road Traffic Act 2006 there is now a legislative basis for outsourcing elements of the provision and operation of speed cameras.Work has commenced on the necessary procurement process.  Given the complexity of the process and in order to ensure adherence to EU and national procurement regulations, including the prescribed time periods, procurement support services required to facilitate the outsourcing process have been engaged and are working with my Department, the Garda Síochána, the Department of Transport and the National Roads Authority in moving this process forward with all possible speed.Work is well advanced on the preparation of a call to the market for expressions of interest in tendering for the project.  Following the call for expressions of interest, a number of candidates will be awarded pre-qualification status and short-listed to proceed to the next stage.  A request for tenders will be made to the short-listed candidates, and the successful candidate will be selected on the basis of the tenders received.In parallel with this process, work is ongoing with the Garda Síochána and the National Roads Authority on identifying locations that either have a speed related collision history or are of a type where a higher than expected frequency of collisions may be expected to occur.  Monitoring of driver speeds by the outsourced service provider will focus on these locations.I can assure the Deputy that I attach a very high priority to outsourcing and expanding the speed camera network and to ensuring there will be no undue delay in the procurement process.  I expect that, subject to negotiations, the contract for safety cameras will be awarded and the start up phase commence in the first half of 2007.

The Garda authorities are currently finalising a detailed Request for Tender (RFT) for the outsourced service provision of 17 Garda CCTV systems in the following towns: Athlone, Ballyfermot, Carlow, Castlebar, Clondalkin, Clonmel, Drogheda, Dungarvan, Ennis, Kilkenny, Kinsale, Mullingar, Portlaoise, Sligo, Tallaght, Tullamore and Waterford.  The locations above are listed in alphabetical order.As I have indicated previously, I am anxious to accelerate the implementation of this CCTV programme and reduce as far as possible the workload of the Garda Síochána in this regard.  I believe that the answer is to outsource the installation of Garda CCTV systems to the greatest extent possible, making use not only of the technical but also of the project management expertise in the private sector.Garda Management and my Department are currently in consultation with the Department of Finance with a view to proceeding as quickly as possible with the procurement process to contract outsourced service providers for the development, installation and management of these CCTV systems, including Ennis.  This is now the subject of a "peer review" process organised by the Department of Finance.Following the successful conclusion of this review it is intended to issue the Request for Tender.

This Scheme is designed to provide financial assistance to qualifying local organisations towards meeting the capital costs associated with the establishment of local community CCTV systems.  The Scheme is being administered on behalf of my Department by Pobal.Notice of the call for proposals was published in the national newspapers shortly after the launch of the Scheme. All relevant application documentation was published on the websites of both Pobal and my Department.  Pobal also ran a number of information seminars during August 2005.I am informed that no application in respect of Community based CCTV was received in respect of Kilrush.  It is intended to make a further call for proposals under the Community Based CCTV Scheme in the coming months and it is of course open to any organisation in the Kilrush area to submit an application for funding at that stage.

However, the proposed Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill will, for the first time, make statutory provision for a status of long term resident. An application for long term residency from the person referred to by the Deputy was received on the 21st June 2006.The position in relation to granting long term residency is as follows: Persons who have been legally resident in the State for over five years on the basis of work permit/work authorisation/work visa conditions may apply to the Immigration Division of my Department for a five year residency extension. In that context they may also apply to be exempt from employment permit requirements.The dependants of the aforementioned, who have been legally resident in the State for over five years may also apply for long term residency. This particular long term permission does not exempt the person from employment permit requirements.  Time spent in the State on student conditions cannot be counted towards long term residency. While applications for long term residency are under consideration, the person concerned should ensure that their permission to remain in the State is kept up to date.  I understand that applications received in April 2006 are currently being dealt with.  As soon as a decision is made on the case, the person concerned will be notified.

This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) as at 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 2,060 (or 19%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period. The Garda Budget now stands at €1.3 billion, a 13% increase on 2005 and an 85% increase since 1997 in real terms.I have been further informed that the personnel strength of the Community Policing Unit (all ranks) at Lucan, Ronanstown, Ballyfermot, Clondalkin and Rathcoole Garda stations as at 30 June, 2006 (the latest date for which such figures are currently available) was as set out in the table below. In addition, the percentage of Community Gardaí attached to each of the stations referred to by the Deputy, as at 30 June, 2006, are also included.StationStrength of Community Policing Unit (30/6/06)Percentage of Community Gardaí (30/6/06)%Lucan710Ronanstown1213Ballyfermot810Clondalkin910Rathcoole14It is the responsibility of Garda management to allocate personnel to and within Divisions on a priority basis in accordance with the requirements of different areas.  These personnel allocations are determined by a number of factors including demographics, crime trends, administrative functions and other operational policing needs.  Garda management state that such allocations are continually monitored and reviewed along with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy.  This ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and that the best possible service is provided to the public.I should add that the current recruitment drive to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000 members, in line with the commitment in the Agreed Programme for Government, is fully on target.  This will lead to a combined strength, of both attested Gardaí and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year.  The first three groups of newly attested Gardaí under this accelerated recruitment programme came on stream in March, June and September of this year and the fourth such group will become fully attested members of the Force later this year.  Further tranches of approximately 275 newly attested Gardaí will follow every 90 days thereafter until the programme is complete.  The Garda Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources, and in this context the needs of the Garda Stations referred to by the Deputy will be given the fullest consideration.

At my request Operation Anvil was extended outside the Dublin Metropolitan Region during 2006.  For the purposes of Operation Anvil Lucan, Blanchardstown and Rathcoole are covered by the Dublin Metropolitan Region West Garda Division.I am informed by the Garda authorities that 38,024 hours have been expended by local Garda management in the two Garda Districts which cover the Lucan and Rathcoole areas and that the number of additional hours available to each District is 3,000 hours per month.  I am also informed that 41,619 hours have been expended by local Garda management in the Garda District which covers the Blanchardstown area and that the number of additional hours available to the District is 6,000 hours per month.

In recent years, the Government has increased significantly the supports available through the direct expenditure system for children with disabilities, including those with dyslexia.  As with many areas where State support may be required, the question arises as to whether such support may be more effectively provided through the direct expenditure route rather than through the tax system.  One advantage of the former mechanism is that the support may be better targeted at those in need, irrespective of family income, whereas support through the tax system can only benefit those whose incomes are high enough to benefit from tax relief.I have no plans to extend tax relief to cover expenses incurred by parents who have children with dyslexia.  However, this matter, like any other, can be raised by the Deputies at Finance Bill time.

In general terms, this scrutiny applies to project expenditure in areas that are subject to audit or other examination by the Comptroller and Auditor General under the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act, 1993.As the Deputy will be aware from the five-year capital envelopes published as part of the 2006 Budget, the majority of projects in the State will continue to be procured by means of traditional procurement. A relatively small, but nevertheless significant, proportion of planned Exchequer investment to 2010 will be funded through PPPs.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	409	Prior to 1974 female officers were generally required to resign on marriage and received a marriage gratuity in lieu of any pension benefits.  Following the abolition of the marriage bar, any officer appointed before 1974 has the option of resigning within two years of marriage and receiving a marriage gratuity or of remaining in employment.Officers who received a marriage gratuity and who are subsequently reappointed in an established capacity in the Civil Service may refund the gratuity and have all prior service aggregated with subsequent service for superannuation purposes.Under current arrangements, where the reappointment takes place after 6 April 1995 (the date of the introduction of Class A1 Pay Related Social Insurance contributions for civil servants) then all service, including prior service is treated as post 1995 service and superannuation benefits are calculated to reflect the integration of occupational benefits with the State social welfare payments.  An officer appointed or reappointed to the service before 6 April 1995 is subject, as a general rule, to Class B1 PRSI contributions and their full pension entitlements are met from the occupational scheme alone.The Social Welfare code does not allow a person to claim two Social Welfare pensions at the same time.  This has implications for staff reappointed to the civil service after 1995, who prior to their reappointment were already in receipt of a Social Welfare pension (e.g. Widows Contributory Pension) as the Old Age Pension can not be paid in addition to other Social Welfare entitlements.  This specific issue is the subject of an Internal Disputes Resolution Process and I expect the case to come before me, for determination, in the near future.

In relation to the other areas of the public sector, each Minister is responsible for compliance with and reporting on the target set in the Disability Act 2005 for the employment of persons with disabilities in the public bodies under his or her aegis.In the Civil Service, my Department reviewed the operation of the policy in some detail and commissioned independent research from Goodbody Economic Consultants.  As part of the research, a detailed study of a number of Departments was carried out which showed that 7% of existing civil service staff have disabilities.  In order to review the monitoring, reporting and recording arrangements in relation to staff with a disability in Government Departments and Offices, my Department has employed a Disability Advisory Officer to review this area.A Disability Liaison Officers network involving all Departments has been set up to share information and re-examine the current methods of recording the numbers of staff within their respective Departments.  The monitoring, reporting and recording arrangements in relation to a person's disability gives rise to complex issues about confidentiality and the use of such information.  My Department has met with the National Disability Authority to obtain guidance in relation to potential new approaches to monitoring, including the possible use of a survey based on voluntary self-disclosure both for new staff on appointment and for existing staff.  Such methods of collecting data in relation to people with a disability will also be considered in consultation with the staff unions.

The data for the first six months of 2006 will be available at the end of October 2006 following the meetings of the Operational Programme Monitoring Committees and I will write to the Deputy when this information is to hand.The House will be aware of the general state of play in relation to expenditure in the BMW region from previous debates and questions on this issue.  The figures reported indicate that all demands are being met.  This represents some €12.1 billion or 76% of the total original forecast for expenditure (Exchequer, EU and private), and €10.7 billion, or 88%, of forecast Exchequer expenditure had been incurred by the end of 2005.  This is a healthy implementation rate in view of the slow start up in some areas at the very beginning, the relatively disappointing response in certain demand-led schemes and the fact that Exchequer spending in relation to the Structural Fund OPs for the 2000-2006 period will in fact continue up to 2008.I have made the point previously that the overall outturn for the NDP is expected to be near to forecast by the end of 2006, but with some over-performance and underperformance of expenditure taking place within the Operational Programmes.  It is also expected that co-funded measures under the Plan will achieve their full entitlement to Structural Funds in the BMW Region by the end of 2008, the timetable set out in the Regulations.

The determination of the level of service in any particular area and the related workforce planning is a matter for the Health Service Executive (HSE).  At the end of June 2006 there were a total of 1,617 whole time equivalent public health nurses (1,912 individual public health nurses) employed by the HSE.  This represents an increase of 8.6% since 1998 in the number of public health nurses employed.In addition to public health nurses, care in the community is delivered by a mix of different skills and disciplines e.g. registered general nurses, home helps and health care assistants.  Care provision at weekends is prioritised for emergency cases and public health nurses are compensated for call outs on Saturdays and Sundays.Funding has been provided to the HSE for the establishment of 100 primary care teams in 2006.  These teams, comprising a range of health professionals, will provide enhanced, integrated and accessible health services in the community.  An additional €10 million has been made available to the HSE for the recruitment of an extra 300 frontline professionals to these teams this year.

#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	460	Home care packages, which include home care cash grants, such as a Cúram Home Care Grant Scheme, are designed to facilitate timely discharge of older people from acute hospitals; reduce inappropriate admissions; and support older people to continue to live in their own community.In the first instance, use of mainstream community services are maximised to support and maintain the older person at home.  If further services are assessed as being required, some of these services may be provided through the home care package scheme.  Referral for a home care package can be made by any health professional, whether community or hospital based.  The decision to allocate a home care package is based on the assessment of needs of the individual and the identification of any assessed needs, which are not being met by mainstream services, together with consideration of the appropriateness of care in the community in the individual case.Home care packages are, therefore, an additional support over and above existing mainstream community services and are designed to enhance rather than replace the existing home support services.  The scheme is designed to be flexible and in particular targeted at those who may otherwise require admission to long term care from community, inappropriate admission to acute hospital or requiring discharge to home from acute hospital.The HSE is in the process of finalising National Home Care Packages Guidelines which, when issued, will standardise the process of assessment of patients living in the community requiring such care.  Any person who has been awaiting a Cúram home care grant is being offered mainstream services to address their specific, current requirements.About 1,100 home care packages were in place at the end of 2005.  By the end of 2006 a total of 2,000 additional home care packages will have been provided.  These additional packages will support more than 2,000 persons, as some people will only require a home care package on a temporary basis.  The additional funding to support the provision of these additional packages amounts to €55m in a full year — €30m of which has been allocated in 2006 and the remaining €25m will be available in 2007, when the packages will be available on a full year basis.  This clearly shows the Government's focus on keeping people in their own homes and communities for as long as possible and this continues to be the priority in the Department.

I have made additional revenue funding of €2.3m available to BreastCheck to meet the additional costs of roll out.  I have also approved an additional 69 posts.  BreastCheck recently appointed Clinical Directors for the Southern and Western regions and the recruitment of Consultants and other staff is now underway.BreastCheck also requires considerable capital investment in the construction of two new clinical units and in the provision of five additional mobile units and state of the art digital equipment.  I have made available an additional €21m capital funding to BreastCheck for this purpose.  Demolition works at South Infirmary/Victoria University Hospital were completed last month.  The Department has issued approval to BreastCheck to award contracts for the construction of the static units at the South Infirmary/Victoria University Hospital, Cork and University College Hospital Galway.

I have made enquiries with an tArd-Chláraitheoir and the position is as follows.The Civil Registration Act, 2004 provides for the commencement of the various provisions of the Act on a gradual basis.  Parts 1, 2, 3, 5 and 8 of the Act, which relate to the administration of the service and the registration of births, stillbirths and deaths, were commenced on 5 December 2005.  The new provisions for marriage are set out in Part 6 of the 2004 Act and include universal procedures for notification, solemnisation and registration of marriages, as well as a choice of venue for civil marriage ceremonies.  Before the provisions can be commenced, a substantial body of work needs to be completed, including drafting and publication of regulations, guidelines and detailed procedures; establishment of a register of solemnisers in consultation with religious bodies; establishment of a register of approved venues for civil marriages; and the further development of the computer system to facilitate the administration of the new marriage provisions introduced in the Act: Work in all these areas is underway and is progressing well.In view of the number of complex tasks involved in preparing for the commencement of the marriage provisions, it is not possible to be definitive as regards a date for signing commencement orders, but it is unlikely to be before mid-2007.  I would like to assure the Deputy that a comprehensive public information campaign will be undertaken at the appropriate time.The Deputy's query on the facilities provided for civil marriages in registry offices relates to the management and delivery of health and personal social services, which are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004.  Accordingly, my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have this matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.I am aware that there has been a significant increase in the number of civil marriages in recent years.  For instance, the number of civil marriages countrywide in 1996 was 928; by 2002, this figure was 3,683, an increase of almost 396%.  By way of contrast, the corresponding increase in all marriages, civil and religious, for the same period, was 21%.  I am also conscious of the likelihood of a considerable and continuing increase in demand for civil marriage ceremonies.

It is recommended that those considered to be at risk of influenza related complications should go to their G.P. for vaccination.  The "at risk" groups include persons aged 65 years or older, those with specific chronic illness such as chronic heart, lung or kidney disease, and those with a suppressed immune system.There is no charge for either the vaccine or the administration of the vaccine for those in the "at risk" group who have a medical card.Where a patient is in an "at risk" group but does not have a medical card, there is no charge for the actual vaccine as the vaccine is supplied free of charge to general practitioners from the Health Service Executive.  The fee for administering the vaccine in such cases is a matter between the general practitioner and the patient.

#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	480	In September 2004 a national Task Force on Sudden Cardiac Death was established in order to address the problem of sudden cardiac death in Ireland.  The Report of the Task Force, published in March 2006, makes recommendations on the prevention of sudden cardiac death and on the detection of those at high risk.  Among the recommendations of the Task Force is that Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs) should be placed in facilities where the incidence of cardiac arrest is high, including:inpatient health facilities;G.P. surgeries and primary care facilities;airports, shopping centres, major sports venues and golf courses, bus/rail terminals, ferries/ferry terminals, concert and conference venues;universities and colleges;gyms and fitness clubs; andother venues for major public events.My Department has no fund available to assist in the purchase of AEDs for these or other facilities.  Where such funding is required, the Health Service Executive, which has overall responsibility for the implementation of the report's recommendations, may consider such applications, subject to financial constraints and guided by the priorities identified in the report.  I understand that implementation of many of the most immediate recommendations in the report is already underway and it is planned to start implementing the others before the end of the year.  My Department will continue to monitor the progress being made by the HSE in implementing the recommendations of the Task Force.

The priority is older people living in the community or those who are inpatients in an acute hospital and who may otherwise require admission to long term care.  The home care packages are also available to those older people who have been admitted to long term care and who now wish to return to the community.The packages are delivered through the HSE, by a range of providers including the Health Service Executive itself, voluntary groups and the private sector.  The scheme is intended to be as flexible as possible and highly responsive to the real needs of the individual.
#TimOMalleyPD	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	483	I propose to take Questions Nos. 338 to 341, inclusive, together.I wish to assure the Deputy that the Government is fully committed to the implementation of suicide prevention initiatives and the further development of our mental health services in order to prevent, and reduce further tragic loss of life.In September 2005, Reach Out — a National Strategy for Action on Suicide Prevention, 2005-2014 was launched.  This Strategy builds on the work of the National Task Force on Suicide (1998) and takes account of the efforts and initiatives developed by the former health boards in recent years.  During the two years developing the strategy, wide ranging consultation took place throughout the country to draw on the experience, perspectives and ideas of the key stakeholders and interested parties.  This consultation process, combined with continuous monitoring of evidence and best practice, allowed the project team to take both an evidence-based and pragmatic approach in prioritising actions to be undertaken by the various agencies and groups in order to effect real change over the next 5 to 10 years.Consideration was given to the setting of an overall target for the reduction of our national suicide rate as an outcome measure of this strategy.  At this stage, it has been decided that a specific target will not be set for the following two reasons:The priority is to establish the accuracy of suicide mortality in Ireland.Due to the range and inter-play of factors that influence the suicide rate, a direct cause and effect relationship between prevention programmes and a change in the overall population rates is virtually impossible to establish.Nevertheless, there are undoubted advantages to setting targets for an overall reduction, not least the fact that it focuses the attention of those working at all levels of suicide prevention.  An overall target for the reduction of suicide rates will be set by the Government, on the advice of the Minister for Health and Children, when suicide rates have been accurately determined.Reach Out recommends a combined public health and high risk approach.  This approach to suicide prevention is also that advocated by the International Association for Suicide Prevention (IASP) and is in keeping with the European Action Plan for Mental Health which was signed and endorsed on behalf of ministers of health of the 52 member states of the European Region of the World Health Organisation at the Ministerial Conference on Mental Health in Helsinki, Finland in January 2005.The approach to the national strategy is a straightforward one.  Four levels of action comprise the main body of the strategy.  These are categorised as:General population approach;Target approach;Responding to Suicide; andInformation and research.At each level, Action Areas have been identified (26 in total) and specific points of action have been identified to be implemented in three phases over the coming years (an average of 3 to 4 actions per area).Most of the Actions identified in Reach Out are consistent with the recommendations in the Report of the Joint Committee on Health and Children into the High Levels of Suicide in Irish Society.  The remaining recommendations now require consideration by the National Office for Suicide Prevention and the Health Service Executive.The Health Service Executive (HSE) is taking a lead role in overseeing the implementation of Reach Out, in partnership with those statutory and voluntary organisations that have a key role to play in making the actions happen.  The HSE established the National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP) to oversee the implementation of the strategy and NOSP has made contacts with agencies from the relevant sectors in relation to progressing the implementation.  At Government level, an Interdepartmental Committee will be established with representatives of relevant Government Departments to advise on and provide support in overcoming any barriers encountered in implementing the strategy.In 2006, an additional €1.2 million has been allocated to the Health Service Executive specifically for suicide prevention initiatives.  The following 12 point plan outlines Actions in Reach Out which the 2006 funding is being used to:prepare for the launch of a national mental well being campaign in conjunction with non-governmental organisations;ensure full coverage in hospital A&E departments of appropriate services to respond to presentations of deliberate self harm;deliver agreed training programmes as set out in Reach Out;support the development of bereavement services by funding Console, a national voluntary organisation;action the outcome of research undertaken by the National Suicide Research Foundation into appropriate methods of data collection relating to suicides;complete research into the link between institutional abuse and suicide;pilot a Primary Care/Deliberate Self Harm Service;work with the media to improve reporting of suicide and deliberate self harm;agree a national programme of appropriate research on suicide prevention in Ireland;develop methods of reaching, in particular, young people through the medium of ICT, e.g. email, texting, messaging;establish a national forum of key stakeholders and to brief on current activities and research on suicide prevention; andcommission research into the link between Traveller health and suicide.The Report of the Expert Group on Mental Health Policy A Vision for Change, which was launched in January 2006, highlights the importance of mental health promotion in the prevention of mental health problems through the development of coping and problem-solving skills, help-seeking and resilience.  It also recommends that mental health promotion should be available for all age groups, to enhance the protective factors and decrease risk factors for developing mental health problems.  The recommendations in the Report have been accepted by Government as the basis for the future development of the mental health services.The Health Service Executive now has responsibility for the management and delivery of health and personal social services, including health promotion programme development and implementation and will be guided by national policy in the development of mental health promotion programmes.

Accordingly, the Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have this matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.With regard to the funding available for Home Care Packages, it should be noted that Budget 2006 provided an unprecedented increase in the level of funding for older peoples' services and palliative care.  This investment allocated additional resources of €150 million in a full year to these services.  (€110 million in 2006 and €40 million more for 2007). Reflecting the new emphasis on home and day care, almost three quarters (€109 million) of the full year costs was committed to community care supports. €55million full year cost was allocated to the provision of Home Care Packages with €30million allocated for 2006 and €25million for 2007.  The objective is to provide an additional 2,000 Home Care Package by the end of 2006 and the HSE has informed my Department that it is on target to meet this goal.

My Department is advised by the Health Service Executive that Cork University Hospital received €721,000 of this funding.I am aware of the current deficits which are widely acknowledged and which have been identified most notably in the Pollock Report, and by the HSE Working Group on Cystic Fibrosis which is looking at this issue.  My Department is advised that the report of the Working Group is almost complete and will include recommendations in relation to a range of service improvements required for persons with CF, in particular the need to increase the level of clinical, nursing and allied health professional staffing in CF units around the country including Cork.

The Regulations apply to pre-schools, playgroups, day nurseries, crèches, childminders looking after more than three children and other similar services which cater for children under six years of age.  The Health Service Executive has statutory responsibility for the implementation of these Regulations.Judgments as to whether a pre-school service is in compliance with the Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations 1996 and (Amendment) Regulations 1997 are made on inspection by the pre-school services inspection teams of the Health Service Executive.As the question relates to the management and delivery of health and personal social services, which are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004, my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have this matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	493	Section 38 of the Health Act 1970 is still in force.  Under the Health Act 2004 the functions of the health boards were transferred to the Health Service Executive.  Therefore those functions in section 38 of the Health Act 1970 which were functions of the health boards are now functions of the Executive.
#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	494	The Health Service Executive (HSE) has advised that when a client who resides at home presents with a continence problem they are assessed by their Public Health Nurse using a clinical assessment tool based on Best Practice.  The quantity of continence wear to be supplied is decided in accordance with this assessment.  Normally clients' requirements are met by the supply of up to four urinary incontinence pads every 24 hours.  However, when the assessment determines it, the Public Health Nurse will use his/her professional judgement to issue the required number of incontinence pads to meet the clients assessed needs even if this is in excess of four pads per day.The HSE has asked that if the Deputy is aware of any clients whose assessed needs are not being met, perhaps he could supply the names and addresses to them for follow up.

#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	497	The Deputy's question relates to the management and delivery of health and personal social services, which are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004. Accordingly, the Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have this matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.With regard to your question in respect of the adequacy of the current provision, I would point to the provisions made in Budget 2006 with respect to Services for Older People when an additional €33 million full year cost was allocated for the Home Help programme (€30 million for 2006). This represents a significant increase over the Estimates provision of €112 million for 2005.  The additional funding of €30 million is being used to provide 1.75 million more home help hours.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	498	Where a patient is discharged from hospital with a prescription for a non-standard drug/medicine it is a matter for the hospital concerned to ensure that the patient is able to source that product without undue delay.  If this is not possible the hospital should provide the patient with an appropriate amount of medicine which will maintain him/her until such time as the prescription can be presented and dispensed through a community pharmacy.If the Deputy provides me with details of any particular incidents of which she has been made aware I will have the matter fully investigated.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	499	I recognise that there are many factors which influence the health of individuals and the population including social, economic, environmental and cultural factors.  The Health Strategy Quality and Fairness (2001) identifies a number of key determinants of health, outside the provision of health services, that affect health status and it makes mention of the importance of the built environment.  The Review of the Health Promotion Strategy (2004) also identifies the need to address these broader determinants of health to improve the health status of the entire population.In recognising the influence of the built environment on health, my Department welcomes this report and the evidence provided in it which will help inform future policy in relation to tackling the broader determinants of health.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	501	I will shortly establish a National Cancer Screening Agency to amalgamate BreastCheck and the ICSP to deliver both programmes nationally.  This will maximise the expertise in both programmes, ensure improved efficiency and develop a single governance model for cancer screening.  The plan is to have cervical screening managed as a national call/recall programme via effective governance structures that provide overall leadership and direction, in terms of quality assurance, accountability and value for money.  All elements of the programme, call/recall, smear taking, laboratories and treatment services must be quality assured, organised and managed to deliver a single integrated service. This includes an acceptable turn around time for test results. My Department understands that the current annual volume of testing of cervical smears is similar to the volume required for a national programme.I wish to see the Irish Cervical Screening Programme (ICSP) rolled out nationally by 2008, based on an affordable model and in line with international best practice.   Significant preparatory work is well underway involving the introduction of new and improved cervical tests, improved quality assurance training and the preparation of a national population register.  An additional €9m is available to the Executive for cancer services development in 2006, including the continuation of preparations for the roll out.

There are however, a number of technical and administrative issues which we are currently addressing and which will need to be resolved in order to make further progress in this area, and my Department is working with the relevant agencies, including Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI), the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), ESB Networks and the Electro-Technical Council of Ireland in this regard.Sustainable Energy Ireland provides grant assistance, under its Renewable Energy Research, Development and Demonstration programme, to suppliers for demonstrating small wind turbines in domestic and small business applications. The specification, installation and performance of the wind turbines supplied will be closely monitored in this programme. The results of the monitoring will be used in SEI's public information material on domestic scale renewable electricity and may inform future policy on any Government supports, which may be required for this sector and the manner in which they might be implemented.As part of the ongoing work to progress this area, CER is today launching a public consultation on micro generation. Much work needs to be done to ensure that the appropriate administrative, technical and safety standards and practices are in place before we can proceed with any programmes for the widespread deployment of micro generation technologies. I am confident that appropriate solutions suited to the context of the Irish electricity grid and for non-grid connected technologies will be identified as a result of this work so that we can further develop this emerging sector.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	506	The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter in the first instance for the private sector companies operating in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg), the independent regulator. The majority of towns now have at least one provider offering broadband services.  However, it has been clear for some time that the private sector has failed to invest at the level necessary to keep pace with the demand for broadband. My Department's regional broadband programme is addressing the infrastructure deficit by building high speed open access broadband networks, in association with the local and regional authorities, in 120 towns and cities nationwide. These Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) will allow the private sector to offer world-class broadband services at competitive costs.Phase One of this Programme has delivered fibre optic networks to 27 towns and cities throughout the country, supported by State and EU funding of almost €80 million. E-Net, the Management Services Entity, is currently managing those completed networks. Phase II of the MANs Programme will involve the construction of over 90 networks between 2006 and 2008. The total cost of the Phase II MANs will be 90% funded by State and EU funding.

My Department's regional broadband programme is addressing the infrastructure deficit by building high-speed open access broadband networks, in association with the local and regional authorities, in the major towns and cities. These Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) will allow the private sector to offer world-class broadband services at competitive costs. The networks offer towns opportunities to attract inward investment in advanced technology and knowledge based enterprises.Twenty-seven MANs have been completed under the first phase and are currently being managed by ENet, the Management Services Entity. Two of which were built in Co. Westmeath, one in Mullingar and one in Athlone. The second phase extends the programme to over 90 towns with a population of 1,500 and above that do not have a satisfactory broadband offering from the private sector. In this second Phase there is a MAN to be built in Moate, Co. Westmeath.My Department also administers a Group Broadband Scheme, which offered funding assistance for smaller towns and rural communities. To date, over 160 projects have been approved for funding including projects for Rochfortbridge, Kilbeggan, Kinnegad, Clonmellan, Moate (Urban), Rathowen, Street, Ballinalack, Ballinacargy, Castlepollard and Coole, Co. Westmeath.The most recent phase of the scheme is now closed and the question of a further round of financial assistance for the provision of broadband in rural areas is currently under consideration.A joint industry/Government fund of €18 million has been established for the Broadband for Schools Programme to resource the provision of high speed broadband connectivity to all primary and post primary schools in the country by end Autumn 2006, at no cost to the schools themselves. 95% of schools have broadband installed to date; the aim is to complete the outstanding schools in the coming weeks.However, there are some parts of the country where the private sector will be unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband connectivity. I am currently examining options to address the delivery of broadband services to these areas and I hope to be in a position to bring proposals to Government shortly.There are a number of platforms for delivery of broadband and service providers are now offering broadband by wireless, satellite, fibre or standard telephone cable in all areas of the country. My Department operates a dedicated website, www.broadband.gov.ie where broadband customers can ascertain the availability of services in their area.

Wicklow County Council did not submit any further applications for funding to the Department for the current development project at Greystones Harbour.Wicklow County Council applied to An Bord Pleanála (ABP) for planning permission for the Greystones Harbour and North Beach project. In accordance with the Planning and Development Act 2000, due to the nature of the proposal and as the proponent is a Local Authority, An Bord Pleanála is the deciding authority for the foreshore element of the proposal as well as the land based planning permission consent. The Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources acts as a consultee to An Bord Pleanála in such cases.An Bord Pleanála invited the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to make a submission on the proposed work. This submission was forwarded on 16 March 2006.

Applications for licences in "open door" areas may be received at any time and licences are awarded subject to the licensing terms in force at that time.Licences for frontier areas may only be received when the area is declared open, as happened in the North East Rockall area last year and the Slyne/Erris/Donegal area earlier this year. These licences are also awarded subject to the terms in force at the time of the award. I have signalled my intent to hold a further licensing round in the Porcupine Basin next year. It is my intent that any licences awarded pursuant to that round will be subject to the licensing terms as amended following the review that is now ongoing.Regarding licensing and development of minerals regulated by the Minerals Development Acts 1940-1999, a review of the current fiscal regime will be undertaken following enactment of a comprehensive new Minerals Development Bill being drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government. In the meantime, the current system will continue.

This analysis included the following:An evaluation of the current fiscal framework as an efficient means of increasing long term investment and revenue generation in the petroleum sector for the benefit of both the Irish State and investment from oil companies.An examination of the current Irish terms as an effective and robust taxation system that best reflects the public interest.A review of alternative options to the current system.Recommendations for changes applicable to future licences.My Department has engaged independent external experts to review the work undertaken internally. The external experts terms of reference are as follows:Consideration of the Department's views on how the licensing regime could best be changed, as set out in two reports covering fiscal and non-fiscal terms respectively.Advice on any alternative fiscal regimes which could better achieve the objectives.Advice on peer countries (comparable in terms of size or petroleum development) considering relative tax and royalty burdens and other licence terms vs. objectives.A quantitative analysis of the preferred regime (underlying model, specific details – thresholds, rates etc.).Advice on any additional non-fiscal features considered beneficial to the State.The report of the independent experts is due in early November.

Analysts have pointed to the rapid development of renewable energy sources to date within the EU market but continue to question whether that rapid progress will be sufficient to deliver the 22% target in the planned timeframe.The target addressed to Ireland in the RES-E Directive is to increase the consumption of electricity from renewable energy sources to 13.2% by 2010. I recently announced plans to exceed this target and to achieve 15% by 2010. I am confident that the progress made to date and ongoing progress under the REFIT programme, which I introduced this year, will deliver this higher national target on time.The Energy Policy Green Paper proposes an ambitious national target of 30% by 2020. Our ambitions for renewable energy fully accord with the priority being given at EU level to accelerated growth of renewable energy in the fuel mix over coming years.

In relation to Postpoint, this is a separate non-post office network and therefore not operated directly by An Post.I understand that the total number of post offices that have closed nationwide since the year 2000 is 241 while the number that have closed in County Cork, including Cork City, is 32.In relation to the status of the pilot project on automation, I understand that it was finalised at the end of September 2006. I understand that the company will now review the data and assess the impact of the trial at the offices concerned in relation to various factors including additional costs of automation, additional levels of business and revenues generated as well as displacement of business. It is my understanding that the question of extending automation to non-automated offices will be guided by the outcome of the evaluation process, which I have been informed, should be completed by the first quarter of 2007.

The pipeline is one part of the infrastructure required to transport natural gas from the Corrib gas-field to the national gas network.Earlier this year the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) directed BGÉ to implement a new Gas Connections Policy, which determines the economic viability of connecting towns to the gas network. The new policy allows for the appraisal of a new town either on its own or as part of a regional group of towns. Having regard for this new policy, BGÉ is carrying out a comprehensive review of towns being considered for connection to the national gas network. The review is being conducted in two phases and phase 1, which covers the towns in the proximity of the Mayo-Galway Pipeline, will be completed shortly.I hope to be in a position to make an announcement on the outcome of the BGÉ review and CER's assessment of it shortly.My Department has also engaged consultants to undertake a Gas to the Northwest Study, in the context of the Government's objective for regional policy in the National Development Plan and having regard to the National Spatial Strategy.The scope of this study is firstly, to determine the feasibility of bringing gas from the Mayo-Galway pipeline to Donegal Town via Sligo, considering three specified alternative routes; secondly, to examine and assess options for and issues surrounding the development of gas-fired power generation along the pipeline routes; and finally, to present options for the provision of gas pipeline infrastructure and gas-fired power generation, with recommendations as to how best the options may be pursued.The study is scheduled for completion by end of year.

The Institute will bring our high performance system to a new level, providing our best athletes with a world-class support structure.  The Institute will be completely athlete focused and dedicated to meeting their needs and will help them to achieve their potential in top-level sport.In the Institute's initial phase, up to 2008, the Sports Council intends that the work will concentrate on the fifteen focus sports whose high performance programmes are funded by the Council.  It is envisaged that this will embrace around 90 athletes who are currently graded at the required standard under the Sports Council's International Carding Scheme.  I am arranging for the Council to send the names of the athletes concerned to the Deputy.The role of the London 2012 Olympic Taskforce is to ensure that Ireland can identify and maximise the complete range of opportunities, including the facilities and services available for our top athletes, arising from its proximity to the Olympic and Paralympic Games in London 2012.

The programme is advertised on an annual basis.An application was submitted to the 2006 sports capital programme by Dublin City Council in respect of a proposed Crumlin Sports and Leisure Centre to be located at Willie Pearse Park. The amount of funding sought by the application was €11 million towards an estimated cost of €17.25 million. It was one of 28 applications from Dublin City Council under the programme, of which 14 were successful and were allocated a total of €3,650,000.  The application for Willie Pearse Park was unsuccessful on this occasion, though two grants totalling €250,000 were allocated towards facilities there under the 2003 and 2004 sports capital programmes. These grants have still to be drawn down by the Council.All allocations under the 2006 sports capital programme have now been made. I intend to seek applications shortly under the 2007 programme and it will be open to Dublin City Council to submit an application for the project in question under that programme. It should be noted, however, that the programme does not provide funding for playgrounds, for which the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government has responsibility.

The attached tabular statement sets out the number of jobs created in each county in each year.The marketing of individual areas, including Cavan and Monaghan, for new or expansion FDI investments and jobs is a day-to-day operational matter for IDA Ireland. While I may give general policy directives to the Agency, I am precluded under the Acts from giving directives regarding individual undertakings or from giving preference to one area over others.IDA Ireland adopts a focused approach to marketing the country, selecting specific towns in each region and setting targets for new investment.  This year, for example, IDA has a target to secure a new investment in the medical devices area for Cavan town as it believes the existing 23,745 sq ft facility in its Cavan Business Park is particularly suited to this sector.  Should a project be secured for Cavan the focus would then shift to Monaghan.This does not preclude IDA Ireland from marketing each town, including Monaghan, on an ongoing basis and the Agency responds to all enquiries by potential investors.  Ultimately decisions regarding where to locate are taken by the investors and IDA Ireland can only advise and market the attractions of potential sites, and work towards convincing investors that these sites meet their requirements.I am confident that the completion of the M3 motorway, which will improve access to the airport, will improve the prospects for additional investment and jobs for the people of Cavan and Monaghan.2002200320042005Cavan5212310Monaghan571004

These applications were submitted by means of the new redundancy on-line application system.The matter was referred to the Attorney-General for advice on whether or not a genuine redundancy situation exists in this case and therefore, whether or not the rebate can be paid from the Social Insurance Fund.  On receipt of this advice from the Attorney-General, a decision will be made on the issue.It is the policy of the Government to pay a rebate only in situations where the strict criteria stipulating genuine grounds for redundancy under Section 7 of the Redundancy Payments Acts, 1967, as amended by Section 4 of the Redundancy Payments Act, 1971 and Section 5 of the Redundancy Payments Act, 2003, are applicable.Statutory Redundancy Rebates are paid to employers who qualify under the provisions of the Redundancy Payments Acts 1967 to 2003 out of the Social Insurance Fund.  Employers pay contributions to the SIF in respect of redundancy through the PRSI system.As a result of the recent Social Partnership Agreement "Towards 2016", a proposal has emerged which is designed to address exceptional cases of compulsory collective redundancy.Under this proposal, a new body to be known as the Redundancy Panel will be established through an amendment to the Protection of Employment Act 1977.  The only function of this Redundancy Panel, having been requested either by employee representatives or the employer and having invited submissions from both parties, would be to request the Minister to ask the Labour Court to issue an opinion as to whether or not the proposed dismissals involve a collective redundancy proposal, on a compulsory basis with the planned replacement of staff by direct employees employed by the employer effecting the compulsory collective redundancy or the use of replacement workers by the employer.  The establishment of the new body will be enshrined in new legislation due to be published in the coming months.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	525	Entrepreneurship in Ireland is encouraged by the active and constant pursuit and promotion by the Government of an economic environment that is supportive of entrepreneurial activity combined with a wide range of targeted interventions by various State enterprise development agencies.There are, in the first instance, thirty-five City and County Enterprise Boards (CEBs) spread throughout the Country whose function is to provide a source of support for micro enterprise in the start-up and expansion phases, to promote and develop indigenous micro-enterprise potential and to stimulate economic activity and entrepreneurship at local level.  The CEBs offer a series of Programmes to underpin this function.The CEBs can provide both financial and non financial assistance to a project promoter. The forms of financial assistance which are available, subject to certain restrictions, include Capital Grants, Employment Grants and Feasibility Study Grants.The basic criteria under which financial assistance is available is based primarily on factors such as the sector of the economy in which an enterprise is operating or intends to operate and the size or proposed size of the enterprise. The enterprise must be in the commercial sphere, must demonstrate a market for the proposed product/service, must have a capacity for growth and new job creation and must not employ more than 10 people. The CEBs give priority to enterprises in the manufacturing or internationally traded services sector which over time can develop into strong export entities and graduate to the Enterprise Ireland Portfolio and the CEBs must always give consideration to any potential for deadweight and displacement arising from a proposed activity.As well as financial assistance the CEBs can offer non-financial assistance in the form support Programmes designed to help new and existing enterprises to operate effectively and efficiently as well as offering a generalised business advice and information service. Where a CEB cannot be of assistance to a person they will endeavour to re-direct that person to another more appropriate source of assistance.The CEBs exist alongside a number of other enterprise support agencies including Enterprise Ireland and the local LEADER Groups. Enterprise Ireland is the national development agency with primary responsibility for assisting the development of larger indigenous enterprises in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sector while the LEADER Groups support small enterprises outside the main urban areas.

#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	527	Further to my reply to the Deputy's previous questions on this matter on 28 March 2006, representations were made to my Office enquiring about the Commercial Agents Directive — EC Council Directive 86/653 EEC of 18/12/86 as transposed into national law by Statutory Instruments No. 33 of 1994 and No. 31 of 1997.I understand from these representations that a number of this company's Area Managers are in dispute with the company over a number of matters including the amount of commission paid, changes to sales territories and the issue of whether or not these Area Managers are self-employed commercial agents and entitled to protection under the aforementioned Commercial Agents Directive. I understand further that these matters are the subject of legal proceedings before the High Court.With regard to whether my Department or any of its agencies has a role in policing compliance with the relevant statutory requirements of the Commercial Agents Directive, the matters raised by the Deputy are essentially private civil matters between disputing parties and the Courts are the appropriate adjudicators of such matters.I remind the Deputy that self-employed commercial agents are not employees and, as such, are not covered by employment rights legislation.I am satisfied that the Commercial Agents Directive, as transposed into Irish law, provides a framework for the regulation of the relationship between self-employed commercial agents and their principals. I have no evidence to suggest that there are widespread difficulties with its operation and I have no proposals at present to amend the legislation.

#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	529	I am not aware of any issues relating to increases in production costs, including labour costs, affecting Glanbia in particular.Terms and conditions of employment are determined in the main by a process of voluntary collective bargaining between the employers and employees or their representatives. Within this system parties are free to negotiate or not to negotiate. To support the process and ensure a level of fair play, a floor of statutory rights (e.g. minimum wages, holiday entitlements etc.) are in place that can be improved upon by negotiation but which cannot be taken away.The State facilitates the bargaining process by providing a framework and institutions through which good industrial relations can prosper. Institutions have been established that can assist in the resolution of disputes between employers and workers such as the Labour Relations Commission, including its Rights Commissioner Service, and the Labour Court.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	530	Finding alternative employment for the workers in question is a priority for the State Development agencies and, last week, myself and the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources met with a representative group from Ballivor, including some former workers, and outlined ongoing developments and stressed the priority efforts being made in Ballivor.The Industrial Training agency FÁS has briefed all staff on the range of services available to them and many of them continue to participate in the various programmes run by the agency.  Since the announcement of the job losses, Enterprise Ireland has participated at a number of meetings with the company concerned, outlining the various types of assistance that are available. In conjunction with Meath County Enterprise Board, Enterprise Ireland is participating in a series of workshops, which started in July 2006.  These workshops concern Ideas Generation and how to Start Your Own Business.  These courses are on going.A major financial services project which will provide 700 jobs over 5 years was recently announced for Navan and this will be of significant benefit to County Meath and the adjacent Counties.  Notwithstanding this, IDA Ireland continues to promote Ballivor as a priority location within the County and is actively promoting the facility in question for new investment.  To date, three potential investors have been introduced to the management of the existing facility.  I am aware that the State Development agencies have strengthened their marketing efforts in County Meath, in partnership with local interests, in order to increase job opportunities for Ballivor and the surrounding areas.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	531	Grant agreements between Enterprise Ireland and companies are a matter for those parties and for which the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment does not have a direct function.I am advised that the company in question has been paid a total of €1.368m in supports by Enterprise Ireland since 1986. All funding provided by Enterprise Ireland is subject to a legal grant agreement between the company and Enterprise Ireland.  Enterprise Ireland grant aided companies must meet the obligations to creditors and employees in the event of closure or liquidation.When Enterprise Ireland funded companies cease manufacturing, close or liquidate and there are still contingent liabilities outstanding on the grants paid to the companies, the liabilities crystalise.  In these circumstances, it is Enterprise Ireland's policy to seek revocation of grant monies paid.  If there are sufficient assets available to repay secured and unsecured creditors, Enterprise Ireland expects to be treated in the same way as the latter.  In terms of preference share investment, this is recovered after named creditors and before ordinary shareholders.Statutory Redundancy has been paid to the workers in the factory named by the Deputy.  Ex gratia payments are a matter of negotiation between the company concerned and the workers, represented in this case by SIPTU.  The Labour Court operates as an industrial relations tribunal, hearing both sides in a trade dispute.  It then issues recommendations setting out its opinion on the dispute and the terms on which it considers the dispute should be settled.  Responsibility for the settlement of a dispute ultimately rests with the parties themselves.

The recommendations of the 2001 Taskforce were implemented.One of the recommendations in the 2005 Report of the Expert Advisory Group was  that a follow up survey on workplace bullying, similar to that commissioned for the 2001 report, be conducted as soon as practicable to establish a baseline from which the effectiveness of the new structures and processes would be measured.  I am implementing this recommendation in order to have up-to-date information on which to base further action.  The contract for that survey was awarded to the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) following a competitive tendering process. I understand that the Institute's report is expected by next January.In the meantime, I have asked the Health and Safety Authority to update the 2002 Code of Practice on Workplace Bullying (one of the recommendations of the 2001 Report) and bring it in line with the 2005 Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act.

While I am empowered under the Development Acts to provide funds to the agency to discharge its obligations and to issue general policy directives, I am specifically precluded from giving directives to the agency concerning individual undertakings or directives that would require the Agency to give preference to one area over another.As part of its day-to-day operational activities IDA Ireland maintains regular contact with a wide range of national and local bodies, including planning authorities and infrastructure providers, with a view to advising and/or convincing them of the importance of meeting the needs of potential overseas investors. This is a core activity of the Agency and imperative if Ireland is to remain a preferred location for foreign direct investment.I am informed by IDA Ireland that it has offered it's views on Metro North to the Rail Procurement Agency (RPA) in the context of the RPA request for submissions from interested parties and that the Agency considers Metro North to be a significant infrastructure project in terms of FDI promotion into Ireland and the East region.

However, the Council subsequently indicated that it required the freehold interest on the site.  This meant that IDA had to seek a new valuation for the property.  The new valuation has now been received from IDA's agents and the Agency will enter into further discussions with Cork County Council with a view to agreeing a sale price for the site.

In addition to outlining the work of the agency, the report includes a commentary on translating strategy into action.The need for a strategic whole of Government approach reflects the complex nature of poverty, which is multifaceted in its causes and effects and, as a consequence, requires a multi-policy response.  Since 1997 with the National Anti-Poverty Strategy (NAPS), the Government has adopted this approach.A revised and updated National Action Plan is currently being prepared and will be completed before year end. This Plan is being prepared in tandem with and complementing the forthcoming National Development Plan 2007-2013, which for the first time will contain a specific chapter on social inclusion.The National Action Plan will build on the social inclusion priorities and objectives contained in Ireland's recent progress report to the EU on Social Protection and Social Inclusion and in the Towards 2016 social partnership agreement.  All three strategies will encompass a new lifecycle approach within which the key social challenges will be addressed by assessing the risks which individuals face and the supports available to them at each stage in the life cycle. The key life cycle stages are Children, People of Working Age, Older People and People with Disabilities.  This strategic framework will help to create more coherent and integrated structures and facilitate better reporting and monitoring across the spectrum of government activity in the area of social inclusion. It is being designed to more systematically overcome difficulties in implementation from insufficient coordination and integration, which may have hampered progress in the past.A key priority of this Government has been to reduce and, if possible, eliminate consistent poverty.  The EU-SILC survey in 2004 showed a significant reduction in the consistent poverty rate, from 8.8 per cent in 2003 to 6.8 per cent in 2004 continuing a downward trend over the period since 1997.  The low levels of unemployment, and the substantial resources devoted to social welfare and other social services, which have been increasing in real terms since 1997 are bringing about this downward trend. It is estimated that some 250,000 people have been lifted out of consistent poverty over the past ten years.In the ten years since the first Strategy, much has been achieved in Ireland towards realising the EU aim of making a decisive impact on poverty. Much has also been learned from our own experience in Ireland and from that of other Member States on how more effective, coordinated implementation of strategies can be achieved.Strategies for social inclusion include a range of actions on employment, social welfare, education, health, housing, disability, equality and many other areas. Making the strategy and its further development happen requires the direct involvement of a network of different entities through institutional arrangements encompassing the Government, senior departmental officials, social partners, key State Agencies, local authorities, community and voluntary groups and the general public.  The Office for Social Inclusion (OSI) in my Department works closely with these bodies to ensure effective implementation of the targets. Arising from a commitment in Towards 2016, the Office will in future have wider responsibilities in relation to oversight of social inclusion policies.The availability of appropriate data is necessary for monitoring policy impacts and the lack of such data is a barrier to evaluating progress towards the achievement of outcomes.  The OSI will continue its work to ensure that robust and reliable data is available to enable effective monitoring. The greater availability of comprehensive data will also assist the formulation of effective evidence-based policies. The OSI also recently produced new guidelines for Poverty Impact Assessment to enhance the current poverty proofing of policies.  These will be an effective tool in ensuring the mainstreaming of poverty and social exclusion considerations in all policy making and in requiring a rigorous assessment of the impact of policies on those who are most vulnerable.

There is a statutory obligation on employers to register eligible employees in the scheme and to pay the necessary contributions.In 2005 Mercer Human Resource Consulting carried out a review of the scheme and found that 80% of the estimated 80,000 eligible employees in the construction industry are covered by the scheme. However, the report does highlight the fact that there is a very high level of workers in the industry classed as self-employed.As the House will be aware, the question of pensions coverage featured prominently in the negotiations on Towards 2016. As part of the final agreement the Government is committed to publishing a Green Paper on pensions outlining the major policy choices, the challenges in this area and the views of the social partners.  It is intended to publish this within months and there will then be a consultation process. The Government is committed to responding to the consultations on foot of the paper's publication by developing a framework for comprehensively addressing the pensions agenda over the long-term.The appropriateness of introducing a mandatory system of pensions provision, as well as the different approaches available to achieve this, will be considered as part of this process. The two reports completed by the Pensions Board in the last 12 months – The National Pensions Review and their report on mandatory pensions, Special Savings for Retirement – will be major inputs to the Green Paper.As already indicated, there is a high level of self-employment in the building industry and this places those involved outside the terms of the registered employment agreement. However, a Labour Court decision of December 2005 has implications for the interpretation of the registered employment in so far as self employment is concerned.  That said, revenue rules in relation to occupational pensions preclude self-employed persons from contributing to an employer sponsored scheme. Given the restrictions which apply at present, the most appropriate way of addressing the pension needs of those in the building industry who are registered as self employed is being considered in consultation with the revenue and other interested parties.

Under these circumstances, it is not considered appropriate that the Exchequer should provide assistance towards the accumulation of a capital asset where an imminent capital return may be realised and where an alternative means of financing, such as agreement with the bank, can be reached during the sale period. In the circumstances, I do not consider the existing arrangements unreasonable.

Claimants over 55 years of age are exempt from this ‘no fault' disqualification.  The threshold was increased to €19,046.07 (£15,000) from May 1994.It should be noted that, due to the application of the disqualification on a gradual basis, a person must receive a sum in excess of €69,850 in order to attract the maximum nine week disqualification prior to payment.While all such provisions and thresholds are kept under review, any proposal to amend the provisions regarding entitlement following receipt of a redundancy payment could only be considered in a budgetary context and in the light of competing priorities.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	550	The figures that the Deputy refers to are derived from the recent Central Statistics Office publication ‘Measuring Ireland's Progress', which provides an analysis of the economic, social and environmental situation in Ireland. The source for the statistics on poverty used in this report is the EU Survey on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC), which was launched last December.It should be noted that, for the ‘Measuring Ireland's Progress' report, the CSO used a different methodology for calculating the ‘at risk of poverty' rate than is normally used for national consideration of poverty figures. This national methodology, also using the EU-SILC results, found that the ‘at risk of poverty' rate was 19.4 per cent in 2004. This was a slight decrease in the percentage of persons ‘at risk of poverty' from 19.7 per cent in 2003. These figures represent a halting of the upward trend of previous years in the numbers in the broad category of ‘at risk of poverty' and reflect the impact of improvements in employment and social provision over the past number of years.EU statistics also show the level of poverty intensity i.e. the extent to which levels of income are below the "at risk of poverty" threshold. The level of poverty intensity in Ireland is shallow, with the proportion of those with incomes close to the threshold being higher than the EU average, especially in the case of older people.Levels of relative income poverty are affected by increases in incomes generally. During periods of high economic growth increases in household income can outstrip even substantial increases in the incomes of households with relatively low earnings or on social welfare. This is precisely what happened in Ireland in recent years. There were particular circumstances in the period from the mid-1990s when a combination of increased female participation in the workforce, reduced unemployment generally, tax reform and, crucially, high earnings growth caused very large increases in household income. These increases in household incomes were substantially higher than increases both in individual earnings and social welfare incomes over this period, despite virtually unprecedented improvements in employment and social provision across the board in this period.A recent article in the prominent journal "Development and Transition", published by the UN Development Programme and the London School of Economics and Political Science, insisted that relative poverty indicators can not be used for international comparisons unless countries are similar in their level of economic development. Overall, it concluded that reliance on the "risk of poverty" indicator causes a number of problems.I am strongly of the view that a more appropriate indicator is the "consistent poverty" measure.  This tells us that 6.8% of our population continues to experience poverty, hardship or deprivation in some form in their lives. This survey also tells us that women are at greater risk of poverty than men, which reflects the findings of other surveys, with 7.4 per cent of females being in consistent poverty in 2004 compared to 6.2 per cent of males. Furthermore, the surveys and indicators show that the families with children most at risk of poverty are large families and those headed by lone parents. Many of these families have not been able to avail of the greatly increased employment opportunities and the related higher incomes that accrue from employment.  A range of reforms and increased welfare supports, child-centred services and child care are addressing these problems. These include: proposed reforms of the schemes for lone parents and the qualified adults of social welfare beneficiaries; payment of the new €1,000 a year early childcare supplement for all children under 6 years; increases in welfare supports and entitlements in real terms; and the creation of additional childcare places.It is estimated that some 65,000 children remain in consistent poverty, and moving these children out of poverty remains a priority. I intend in this regard to build on the good progress we have made so far. Some 100,000 children have been lifted out of deprivation inside the last decade as a result of targeted measures and supports.The most significant measure my own Department has taken in recent years to support families with children has been the very substantial real increases in child benefit rates.  Between 1997 and 2006, the rate of child benefit rose from €38.09 per month for the first two children and €49.52 for each child thereafter to €150.00 per month for each of the first two children and to €185.00 per month for the third and each subsequent child.  Child benefit is paid to over half a million families in respect of approximately 1.1 million children at a cost in 2006 of more than €2 billion.These increases reflect the fact that under this Government there has been a sustained and substantial increase in social protection expenditure. When examining comparative social protection data it is important to remember that gross expenditure measures do not take account of social charges or taxes which may be levied on benefits after they are paid, nor do they include transfers made by means of tax concessions, as opposed to direct cash payments.  For example, tax relief on contributions towards occupational and private pensions, which are an important feature of Ireland's pension system, is not counted as expenditure. The level of expenditure is also significantly influenced by the age profile of the population. Ireland, currently with one of the youngest populations in the EU, needs to spend less on pensions and healthcare/care of the elderly than most other member states.In addition, social protection expenditure as a percentage of GDP is crucially dependent on the pace of economic growth and the level of unemployment.  The statistics show that at EU level, between 1993 and 1996, social protection expenditure relative to GDP stabilised at a level below the peak of 28.8 per cent in 1993.  This was due to renewed GDP growth and slower growth in social protection expenditure, particularly related to unemployment benefits.  Over the period from 1996 the EU average dropped from 28.4 per cent to the level of 27.7 per cent in 2002.  Ireland's position mirrored that of the EU as a whole, except that the level of economic growth and the decline in unemployment were much greater in Ireland than in most other EU countries and consequently the drop in the percentage of GDP accounted for by social protection expenditure was greater.Moreover, it should be noted that social welfare expenditure will have increased substantially during the 4 year period 2002 to 2006.  The overall spending on social welfare in 2006  increased to over €13.6 billion, an increase of over €1.4 billion from the 2005 figure, representing the highest ever spend on social welfare.Indeed, between 1997 and 2006 the basic rate of social welfare payment has increased by 99.7 per cent, well ahead of the 34.2 per cent increase in consumer prices and the 67.7 per cent increase in gross average industrial earnings. This represents an increase in real terms of 48.8 per cent, in comparison to a real increase in industrial earnings of 25.0 per cent.This Government will continue to address the scope for further improvements in Ireland's social protection infrastructure, guided by the National Action Plan against Poverty and Social Exclusion, while at the same time continuing to take the measures necessary to maintain economic growth and competitiveness and thereby generate the resources for further social investment. Indicators show us what groups in society are most at risk of poverty and deprivation and the intensity of that poverty, and these clearly indicate where our priorities lie in combating poverty and social exclusion.

Fuel allowance as paid for 29 weeks from mid-September to mid April. The allowance represents a contribution towards a person's normal heating need.Budget resources have been concentrated on providing significant real increases over and above inflation each year in all primary social welfare pension, benefit and assistance rates.  This is a more costly approach than increasing fuel allowances because the increase is paid for the full year and not just the 29 weeks of the winter heating season. I consider that this approach delivers a better outcome for pensioners and others by substantially increasing their income in real terms over the whole year, to better assist them in meeting their normal basic living costs, including those associated with heating.A detailed review of the fuel allowance was carried out in 1998.  This review looked at alternatives to the weekly payment method including a single lump sum payment. A survey of recipients with the allowance on a customer panel showed that the majority (58%) preferred weekly payment, 22% wanted a once-off lump sum payment, 12% favoured direct debit to a supplier while 8% would rather have two lump sum payments during the fuel season.  The review recommended continuing with the weekly payment method.It is estimated that some 274,000 people (151,000 with basic fuel allowance and 123,000 with smokeless fuel supplement) will benefit in 2006 at an estimated annual cost €125.1m.  In addition to the fuel allowance, some 340,000 pensioner and other households qualify for electricity or gas allowances through the household benefits package, payable towards their heating, light and cooking costs throughout the year, at an overall cost of €119 million in 2006. The annual value of the Natural Gas Allowance per household is currently €313.17. This covers the supply charge and up to 1674 Kilowatt hours per annum.  From October 1st the annual value has been increased to €516 per household. This will cover the recent 33.8 % increase in Natural Gas and also increase the kilowatt hours per annum from 1,674 to approx. 3,600 for each household.The Electricity Allowance covers normal standing charges and up to 1800 units of electricity. The allowance also covers the VAT applicable to these charges.  In the light of the recent increase in electricity charges the allowance will be increased to cover increased standing charges and the units will also increase from 1800 to 2400 with effect from January 2007.If a person has an exceptional heating cost by virtue of a particular infirmity or medical condition which he/she is unable to meet out of household income, it is open to him/her to apply to the local community welfare officer for a special heating supplement under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.The purpose of the fuel allowance scheme is to provide an additional contribution towards heating costs throughout the winter months for those who most need it.  While I am satisfied that the present payment arrangement is adequate in that regard, I will continue to keep the matter under review.

A person must be insurable at PRSI class A, B, D, J or M on the day of their accident or the date of development  of a prescribed disease.   There are no conditions requiring a minimum number of contributions to have been paid as is the case with other Social Welfare contributory schemes.  Disablement benefit, payable under the occupational injuries scheme, is a compensation payment for loss of faculty arising out of or in the course of insurable employment. The legislation provides entitlement to benefit for persons suffering from certain prescribed diseases which are listed in the legislation and where that person has contracted that disease in the course of their employment.Where an insured person has developed a disease prescribed in the legislation and they were employed in any occupation prescribed in relation to that disease, within certain time limits, it will be presumed that the disease was due to the nature of the employment unless there is evidence to prove that the disease was contracted in some other way.   In cases of prescribed diseases other than tuberculosis and pneumoconiosis the employment must have been within one month immediately preceding the date on which the person is accepted as having the disease.   With regard to tuberculosis, the disease must have developed not less than six weeks after the date on which the person was first employed and not more than two years after the date on which they were last employed in a prescribed occupation associated the disease.  There is no time limit set in respect of pneumoconiosis except that the person must have been employed in an occupation set out in the legislation for a period of two years.  Periods in several qualifying employments may be aggregated.  Periods prior to 1 May 1967, the commencement date for the Occupational Injuries Benefit Scheme, in similar employments may also be counted for this purpose.The minimum employment period is required because pneumoconiosis is a lung disease caused by prolonged exposure to inorganic dusts.  Usually it takes some years for this condition to develop and cause symptoms.  By comparison, exposure to toxic fumes or smoke inhalation would usually cause immediate or rapid onset of symptoms. It has been the administrative practice to pay disablement benefit to pneumoconiosis and byssinosis customers by way of a pension only for assessments of 10% and less than 20%.  I now propose to arrange for the necessary legislative change so that in future payment by gratuity will be an option available to customers claiming disablement benefit in respect of the prescribed occupational diseases pneumoconiosis and byssinosis where loss of faculty is assessed as being under 20% percent and not less than 10% in line with all other recipients of disablement benefit.The medical qualification guidelines in respect of former miners are regarded as being acceptable and no review is considered necessary at this time.

In particular, I wanted to ensure that the Budget reflected the evolving new social agenda that has at its core a social welfare support system that is active instead of passive, that assists people to live with dignity and enables them to make a valuable contribution towards society.  A key objective of this reform agenda is the removal of employment disincentives and the avoidance of welfare dependency.In this context, I was pleased to be able to announce a number of significant and focused improvements to a range of means testing arrangements including: income and means disregards and the extension of tapered assessment as such; the introduction of a tapered withdrawal rate for disability allowance and blind pension recipients who engage in rehabilitative employment or self employment and have a weekly income over €120 and under €350; an increase in the income disregards for entitlement to carer's allowance, thereby fulfilling the commitment in the Programme for Government to enable all those earning up to average industrial earnings to qualify for carer's allowance; an increase in the upper income limit for the one parent family payment from €293 to €375 per week; the introduction of a 50% tapered withdrawal of earnings between €60 and €90 per week for persons in receipt of rent and mortgage interest supplement thereby increasing the incentive to take up employment or training or to pursue maintenance payments; an increase in the spouse's income disregard for entitlement to the qualified adult allowance (QAA) from €88.88 to €100 a week, as well as an increase of €30 per week to €250 for entitlement to a tapered QAA rate; significant changes to the family income supplement (FIS) thresholds designed particularly to boost child income support for larger low income families, and a weekly means disregard of €20 per week for non-contributory pensioners aged 66 or over, up from the €7.60 per week dating back to the 1970s as well as an innovative special earnings disregard of €100 per week.The measures I have just outlined constitute a significant reform of the means assessment arrangements.  I remain committed to modernising and simplifying the social welfare system and any further improvements will be considered in the context of the next Budget.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	556	I propose to take Question Nos. 430 and 431 together.My Department operates two main types of pension scheme; contributory and non-contributory payments. Contributory payments are paid on the basis of social insurance contributions made over a person's working life.  Missionaries who have made sufficient social insurance contributions can qualify for an old age contributory pension. These pensions are payable abroad and so missionaries who qualify and who choose to settle overseas can receive a payment.Non-contributory pensions are only payable where a person is resident in this country. Accordingly, missionaries who return here and who satisfy the habitual residence condition and a means test can qualify for a pension.  Any move to pay the old age non-contributory pension outside the State could cause difficulties in the context of EU Regulations on social security arrangements for migrant workers generally.The question of paying pensions to missionaries who remain abroad was first raised in the context of a submission to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs by the Irish Missionary Union.  In this submission, they estimated that there are approximately 800 missionaries who could receive a pension immediately, although this may be an underestimate as it is difficult to establish exactly how many missionaries would qualify.Subsequently, officials of my Department made a presentation to the Committee on the issue.  Following that presentation, the Chairperson of the Committee decided to form a working group to look at the issues raised in more detail.A background report is currently being finalised between my Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs.  The report examines the question of pensions for missionaries and the wider issue of social insurance for volunteer development workers in general.  This will be forwarded shortly to the Joint Committee to inform the discussion.  The options for providing pensions for missionaries will be looked at in the context of the final report of the Joint Committee.

This extensive week-long campaign included advertising on TV, on national and local radio and in the national and regional press. I am very pleased with the response so far to the campaign.

The package is also available to carers and people with disabilities under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.  Widows and widowers aged from 60 to 65 whose late spouses had been in receipt of the household benefits package retain that entitlement to ensure that households do not suffer a loss of entitlements following the death of a spouse.   People aged over 70 years of age can qualify for the household benefits package regardless of their income or household composition.A range of proposals have been made to extend the coverage of the household benefits package of free schemes. These proposals are kept under review in the context of the objectives of the scheme and budgetary resources.

Specific exclusions relate to applicants and spouses in full-time employment, those engaged in certain courses of study and those involved in trade disputes.A person claiming rent supplement must be also a bona fide tenant, be habitually resident in the State, have a housing need and satisfy a means test. In addition, the HSE must be satisfied that the accommodation is suited to the persons needs and the rent payable is within the prescribed limits.Overall, I would consider the current rent supplement qualifying conditions to be adequate in meeting the objective of the scheme.  This is evident in the fact that just over 60,000 people were in receipt of a supplement at the end September 2006.The eligibility criteria for the scheme have broadened in recent years with improvements in the means test and, in the context of supporting a return to work, through the provision of special retention of entitlement arrangements for those who have been unemployed for 12 months, for part-time workers and for those on back-to-work schemes.Any further improvements to the existing rules governing the scheme with expenditure implications will need to be considered in the light of future Budgets and overall resources available to me for social welfare payments generally.

The services which have been deployed and are delivering benefits, include the following.  An Inter Agency messaging Service including the Death Event Publication Service which exchanges data relating to life events between the General Register Office, my Department and up to 20 other subscribing agencies. The messaging service has also been deployed between the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Agriculture and Food for exchange of documents relating to exports of agricultural produce.  A project is underway to extend the messaging service to exchange documents between agencies in the criminal justice sector.  A service wide interoperability framework with associated standards and guidelines and transport adapters.  A comprehensive services portal giving information and access to some 1,400 public services.  An identity authentication service is being provided to the Revenue On-line PAYE service in association with my Department.Reach has been operating as a project within my Department since its establishment in 2000. Now that the PSB is operational and services are being delivered, I propose to address the appropriate future structure and operational arrangements. Following an examination of the options in this regard, I intend to bring proposals to Government in this matter.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	561	The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders on long-term social welfare or health service executive payments with meeting the cost of their additional heating needs during the winter season.  Fuel allowances are paid for 29 weeks from end-September to mid-April and are not intended to meet the full cost of heating.Eligibility to the fuel allowance scheme is subject to means and other conditions.  The main conditions that apply to the fuel allowance scheme are that a person must be in receipt of a qualifying payment, must satisfy a means test and must either be living alone or with a qualifying dependant.People who already qualify for means-tested pensions or allowances such as old age (non-contributory) pension, long-term unemployment assistance or one-parent family payment do not have to undergo a further means test to qualify for fuel allowance.  The majority of people who receive fuel allowances qualify because they satisfy the relevant means test for their primary weekly payment.From 2006 a person in receipt of State Pension (non contributory) can also have up to €100 in earnings per week from insurable employment and still be entitled to fuel allowance.In the case of contributory pensions such as state pension (contributory) — formerly old age (contributory) pension — state pension (transition) — formerly retirement pension — and invalidity pensions, which are not means tested, earnings from insurable employment and/or occupational pensions are normally regarded as means for the purpose of determining an individual's entitlement to a fuel allowance.  A person may have savings/investments of up to €46,000 or a combined household income of up to €51 per week over and above the maximum rate of state pension (contributory) and still qualify for fuel allowance.  This income limit was increased to €51 per week with effect from 1 June 2005.Any changes in the means rules for the scheme, such as an increase in the means disregard for contributory pensioners, would have cost implications and would have to be considered in the context of the Budget and in the light of the resources available to me for improvements in social welfare generally.

It contains information in relation to all the schemes and services provided by the Department as well as links to other relevant agencies and organisations.  All leaflets, booklets, scheme application forms and reports published by my Department are available on the website.The Guide to Social Welfare Services is available on the website in a number of languages including Arabic, Chinese, French, Polish, Russian, and Spanish as well as in English and Irish. In addition, my Department has also issued detailed guidance, under Freedom of Information legislation (FOI), regarding the operation of the Habitual Residency Condition and this is available on the website.My Department plans to redevelop the website commencing early 2007 and the provision of specific information on social welfare services for immigrants, in a number of languages, will form part of this redevelopment.My Department has provided funding to the Immigrant Council of Ireland to produce fact-sheets with information on rights and entitlements of immigrants to Ireland.  These fact sheets are available in six different languages (Arabic, Chinese, French, Romanian, Russian and English).  There is also a link from the Department website to the Immigrant Council website where these fact sheets are available.Comhairle, a statutory agency under the remit of my Department, is responsible for supporting the provision of information, advice and advocacy on social services and the Comhairle website provides information on the social and civil rights of everyone in Ireland, including immigrants.Comhairle has also assisted the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed (INOU) in the production of leaflets in six different languages (Polish, Lithuanian, Latvian, Russian, Romanian, Brazilian and English) aimed at meeting the information needs of migrants working and living in Ireland.In addition, my Department is also participating in the EUlisses project which will provide a multilingual website, pooling social security information for migrants from national and European sources. This will provide a single internet access point for Europeans who are seeking social security information.  Work is ongoing on this website at present and its first phase, dealing with pensions, is expected to be on-line before the end of 2006.My Department will continue to develop, enhance and expand the range of information services it provides to ensure that immigrants are made aware of their rights, entitlements, and obligations in relation to social welfare services.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	563	The Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) Regulations 1997 enable each road authority to provide designated parking bays on the public roads for sole use by vehicles that display a disabled persons parking permit and which are being parked for the convenience of the permit holder.I have already provided a series of legislative measures to strengthen and safeguard the operation of the disabled persons parking scheme and I will continue to address this area as required.From 3 April 2006 I extended the application of the fixed charge system to a range of offences including illegal parking offences.  To act as a deterrent against abuse of the designated parking bays I prescribed a fixed charge of €80, which increases by 50% to €120 if not paid within 28 days, for the offence of illegal parking in a designated disabled persons parking bay. This is double the level of fixed charge that I prescribed for other illegal parking offences.The Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) Regulations 1997 provide for the grant of a parking permit to a person who is suffering from a disability that prevents the person from walking or causes undue hardship to the person in walking. The permit scheme for use of the designated parking bays is only intended therefore for persons who are unable to walk i.e. wheelchair users or persons who have very restricted mobility.To assist the bodies who issue the permits and the authorities who enforce the parking law to safeguard the scheme against abuse another measure that I advanced is the amendment of section 115 of the Road Traffic Act 1961 that is provided in section 20 of the Road Traffic Act 2006.The amendment expands the scope of the offences covered by section 115 to include offences related to any permit issued under the Road Traffic Acts. The disabled persons parking permit comes within the ambit of this provision. The amended section 115 provides that it is an offence to knowingly give particulars that are false or misleading in connection with an application for a permit and that it is an offence to forge or fraudulently alter or use any permit, or fraudulently lend to, or allow a permit to be used by, any other person.In addition, section 35 of the Road Traffic Act 1994 was amended in section 20 of the Road Traffic Act 2004 to provide an enabling provision to facilitate the issue of permits and enforcement in relation to the use of permits. This amendment gives a power of inspection to Gardaí and traffic wardens in relation to permits and it is intended that the permits issued under the disabled persons parking will come within the scope of this provision.Finally, the present statutory scheme for grant and use of parking permits is under review in my Department in consultation with the relevant bodies with a view to strengthening the provisions further and to ensure that the scheme is confined strictly to those who meet the restricted mobility criterion.

Following agreement with my Department and the Department of Finance the Joint Global Co-ordinators, who were responsible for marketing the IPO, entered into an agreement with all of the main stockbrokers concerning the conditions under which the brokers would participate in the offer.One of the conditions set was that the maximum brokerage commission that could be charged would be capped at 1% of the aggregate Offer Price of the Shares allocated to each applicant in the Intermediaries Offer.  Without a cap on commissions, investors may have been charged higher commissions by stockbrokers as they set their own commission levels in respect of other transactions.I am not aware of any Competition Authority investigation into the matter.  That would be a matter for the Authority.

Member States had the option to allow children to travel without child restraints in the rear of small public service vehicles if restraints are not available and this option was exercised in the recent regulations.  However, children who are 3 years of age or over and 135 centimetres or more in height travelling in the rear of small public service vehicles not fitted with child restraints are required to wear safety belts.  There is no concession in relation to the requirement for child restraints for children travelling in the front seats of cars (including taxis, hackneys and limousines) and goods vehicles.Notwithstanding the legal position, it would be my desire that owners of small public service vehicles would endeavour to provide child restraints in so far as it is practicable to do so.  To that end, I have written to the Commissioner for Taxi Regulation requesting that he engage with the industry with a view to devising guidelines on best practice in relation to the carrying of children in small public service vehicles.My Department wrote to the Irish Taxi Drivers' Federation, the National Taxi Drivers' Union and the National Private Hire and Taxi Association on 9 May 2006 informing them of the making of the 2006 regulations and enclosing copies of the regulations.

The classes of vehicles that I mentioned, and which includes heavy goods vehicles, are subject to a maximum vehicle related speed limit of 80 km/h whereas the default motorway speed limit is 120 km/h.  I do not propose to change the regulations in this regard.

Design work for this phase is currently underway.Subject to further studies, it is proposed to extend the rail line to Navan within the 10-year period of Transport 21. Iarnród Éireann and Meath County Council have developed terms of reference for a scoping study that will commence shortly in respect of the extension to Navan.  This scoping study will examine possible alignments for the line including its interface with the M3.  There are no plans to extend the line beyond Navan to Cavan.An essential element of the re-opened Navan rail link will be the provision of park and ride facilities to maximize use of the railway service. In this context I understand that provision is being made in Phase 1 for a major park and ride facility near the Pace interchange on the M3.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	583	This Government is providing unprecedented levels of funding under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 and Transport 21 to ensure that Iarnród Éireann can fulfil its statutory duty to operate a safe railway and that the company can expand its services and increase capacity through the purchase of additional rolling stock.  In particular, the DART service has seen significant improvements over the last six years. Since 2000 peak capacity on the service has been doubled following the introduction of an additional 78 cars to the fleet, the lengthening of platforms to accommodate 8-car trains, the renewing of overhead lines and the enhancement of the power supply along with the development of sidings to accommodate the expanded fleet. Despite this increase in capacity I understand that overcrowding occurs at peak times but that the issue is one of discomfort and inconvenience and does not give rise to safety concerns. An increase in the number of 8 car DART operating in the peak period is planned by Iarnród Éireann for implementation before the end of the year.I understand from Iarnród Éireann that the position in relation to ventilation is that 40 of the most modern DART cars are fitted with air conditioning, while the remaining cars in the fleet have the traditional hopper windows for ventilation.  These matters are operational matters for Iarnród Éireann.

However, in the case of a first offence, the court has the option, where it is satisfied that a special reason, which has been proved by the convicted person, exists, to decline to make a consequential disqualification order, or to specify a period of disqualification in the disqualification order of less than one year. In view of the penalties applicable to the offence of dangerous driving penalty points do not apply.Driving licence records are established under section 60 of the Finance Act, 1993.  Under section 60(3) only an officer of a Minister of the Government, a licensing authority or the competent authority for licensing vehicles and drivers of vehicles in another Member State of the European Communities, an officer of the Revenue Commissioners, a member of the Garda Síochána or such other persons as may be prescribed in regulations may have access to driving licence records.

In 2004, 569 specimens were tested for the presence of a drugs or drugs. 354 specimens tested positive and 215 were found to be negative for the presence of a drug or drugs.There is no feasible basis for introducing a scheme of preliminary roadside testing for drugs at present.  Roadside  testing devices are still in the prototype stages.  However, the Medical Bureau of Road Safety is keeping abreast of developments in this area.The offence of driving under the influence of an intoxicant to such an extent that the driver is incapable of having proper control of the vehicle attracts a disqualification of not less than 2 years in the case of a first offence, and, not less than 4 years in the case of a second or any subsequent offence.  The courts can also impose a fine of up to €2,500 and/or 6 months in jail.

Under the EU Energy Crops scheme, aid of €45 per hectare is available for energy crops intended for use in the production of biofuels and electric and thermal energy produced from biomass. In addition to this scheme, set aside land can be used for a variety of non-food uses including the growing of crops for energy purpose and will therefore qualify to activate set-aside entitlements under the Single Payment Scheme. The EU has agreed that sugar beet will be eligible for aid under the scheme and may also be grown as an energy crop on set aside land. At the February Council of Agriculture Ministers meeting I called for a review of the energy crop premium as it was not proving effective in Ireland. The EU Commission has just published a Report on implementation of the scheme and my Department is currently studying the Report.A number of policy initiatives are now underway to increase market penetration of biofuels in Ireland. These initiatives will help drive additional demand for the production of energy crops.  The recently announced Mineral Oil Tax Relief Scheme valued at €205m which, when fully operational in 2008, will deliver some 163 million litres of biofuels per year and should result in Ireland achieving 2% market penetration of biofuels.In the recently published Green Paper on a Sustainable Energy Future for Ireland, the Government made a firm commitment to promote an indigenous biofuel sector in Ireland. In this regard, I am working closely with Ministerial colleagues, as part of the Ministerial Taskforce on Bioenergy to prepare a road map to develop Ireland's bioenergy resources to 2020. This will ensure a cohesive approach to the development of this sector across Government Departments, state agencies and relevant stakeholders. The Taskforce will prepare a comprehensive national Bio-energy Action Plan by the end of this year.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	593	Decisions on the future use of the former sugar factories at Carlow and Mallow are primarily a matter for the owners, Greencore Group plc. Anybody who expressed an interest in the possibility of utilising these factories for bioethanol production was advised to pursue the matter with Greencore.The future use of the Mallow factory is, of course, linked to the EU restructuring scheme for the sugar industry, introduced under the agreement on reform of the EU sugar regime. Restructuring, in this context, refers to the abandonment of sugar quota production, the dismantling of the factories concerned and the allocation of restructuring aid to the affected processors, growers and machinery contractors. In Ireland, the restructuring scheme applies only to the Mallow factory since factories that had closed prior to July 2005, such as the Carlow factory, are not eligible.The restructuring aid scheme as provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No. 320/2006 is subject to the submission by the processor of a detailed restructuring plan for the industry. The Regulation provides for payment of the full amount of restructuring aid where a sugar processor undertakes as part of the plan to fully dismantle the redundant sugar factory. A reduced rate of aid (75%) may be paid where a factory is partially dismantled and converted to non-food production, such as bioethanol. A decision on whether to fully or partially dismantle the factory is entirely a matter for the sugar processor concerned.  Greencore submitted an aid application for restructuring aid in July under which they undertook to fully dismantle the Mallow factory and sought the maximum amount of restructuring aid.  As the application met the requirements of the EU Regulations it was approved subject to the outcome of the Judicial Review proceedings instituted by Greencore concerning, inter alia, the percentage of aid reserved for growers and contractors.Before the application for restructuring aid was received from Greencore I raised the possibility of using Mallow for bioethanol production with the Company having regard to the incentive under the restructuring scheme, the inclusion of sugar beet in the energy crops scheme and the extension in the last budget of excise relief of €205m which, when fully operational will support the use and production of 136m litres of biofuels annually.  The Company informed me that it did not intend to produce bioethanol in Mallow.The Government will be bringing forward further initiatives to support the development of the biofuels sector as set out in the recently-launched Energy Green Paper. The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, who has overall responsibility for developing the biofuels sector, announced the new excise relief scheme for biofuels at the end of July and indicated that capital grants for biofuels facilities are also being provided as part of the Government's overall programme to promote biofuels and biomass. I understand that the capital grants programme is currently being designed and will be rolled-out as a separate initiative to the excise relief scheme.

The persons named were not successful under this category as the land acquired was not leased out during the reference period.Category B caters for farmers who, between 1 January 2000 and 19 October 2003 made an investment in production capacity in a farming sector for which a direct payment under Livestock Premia and /or Arable Aid schemes would have been payable during the reference period 2000 – 2002.  Investments can include purchase or long-term lease of land, purchase of suckler and/or ewe quota or other investments.  The persons named were not successful under this category as there was no evidence of investment, which is required for this category.Category C caters for farmers who sold the milk quota into the Milk Quota Restructuring Scheme and converted their enterprise to a farming sector for which a direct payment under Livestock Premia/or Arable Aid Schemes would have been payable during the reference period 2000 to 2002.  The persons named were not successful under this category as they were not the herdowner who sold the milk into the restructuring scheme.Category D caters for farmers who commenced farming after 31 December 2002, or who commenced farming in 2002 but who received no direct payments in respect of that scheme year.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	603	As the Deputy will be aware the current milk quota arrangements were extended until the end of the 2014/15 milk quota year as part of the 2003 Luxembourg Agreement on the reform of the CAP. While a review will take place in 2008, any further proposals for reform are a matter for the EU Commission, while the Council will make decisions on such proposals. Should the Commission come forward with further proposals in the milk sector I will participate fully in the Council to ensure that the best interests of the Irish dairy sector are protected.At national level my focus is on the need to secure greater levels of efficiency at both producer and processor level in the face of considerable future challenges on international dairy markets. I recently announced the establishment of a new Milk Quota Trading System to supersede the Milk Quota Restructuring Scheme. The new system, which was agreed following extensive consultation with the farm organisations and ICOS, will release larger quantities of quota to active and committed dairy farmers through the combined operation of a market exchange and a maximum price priority pool.The detailed rules for the new system will be available shortly, and milk producers will be invited to submit applications to sell or purchase quota by 24th November 2006, with the first exchange being run as soon as possible thereafter. The operation of the system will be reviewed after the first exchange, and a second exchange will follow in spring of 2007. These arrangements will allow milk producers the opportunity to bid for the amount of quota required to meet the development needs of their farm enterprise at a price that will generate a commercial rate of return. Given the different levels of efficiency at farm level, such decisions are best made by individual farmers.

SPHE has a specific personal safety strand within the programme, and this provides a vehicle through which road safety issues for all can be best dealt with in an age appropriate way.Specific materials for teaching young people about road safety have also been given to schools. At the start of the 2001/02 school year the National Safety Council, with assistance from my Department, distributed copies of Staying Alive — a road safety resource for Transition Year and the Senior Cycle — to all second level schools. This pack contained a wide range of learning opportunities and activities on topics such as personal responsibility and decision-making, environmental issues and risks and rules for road users. A CD-ROM with additional material downloaded from the internet was included in the pack along with copies of the Rules of the Road. This is also supplemented by Garda visits to primary and second level schools during which the themes of crime, road safety, personal safety and substance abuse are explored as part of the SPHE programme. There were some 1900 school visits in 2005.The Minister for Transport recently formally established the Road Safety Authority (RSA). The RSA has already commenced work on a number of key areas including the development of a Road Safety programme for use in Transition Year. This work is being undertaken in co-operation with my Department and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment. I am aware of the DriveSafe programme and my Department will bring it to the attention of the Road Safety Authority in the context of this work.   The programme in question includes provision for driving instruction, and I have no plans for including this aspect in schools.

However, I can confirm that my Department provided funding totalling €1.137 million during the period 2000 to 2003, for the provision of car parking facilities at the Institute. These facilities are available to students, staff and visitors.The Deputy may wish to contact the management authorities of the Institute directly regarding any specific difficulties arising.

This approach gives school authorities a much greater degree of control over the timescale for the delivery of their projects.  The school authorities are therefore best positioned to provide the detailed information sought by the Deputy. I can assure the Deputy that the transformation over recent years on the quality of school accommodation throughout the country is testament to the ability of school authorities to deliver their projects in a timely and efficient manner.

An advertisement was placed in the Official Journal of the European Union for design build teams and the short-listing of these teams is currently being undertaken. A project manager has also been appointed to manage the delivery of the project and the site acquisition process is at an advanced stage.While it is not possible to be definitive at this early stage as to when the new school will open, the target date for delivery is September 2008.School Planning Section is also examining the need for further post primary provision in the area.

School Planning Section is working with Fingal County Council to acquire a site for this purpose.  As soon as an appropriate site has been identified, the Department will move to acquire it and provide a permanent building for the school.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	614	I am not aware of the scheme referred to by the Deputy.However the home tuition scheme which is administered by my Department provides funding to parents to provide education at home for children who, for a number of reasons such as chronic illness, are unable to attend school. The scheme was extended in recent years to facilitate tuition for children awaiting a suitable educational placement including pre-school children with Autistic Spectrum Disorders (ASD).My Department considers that school-based education provision is the most appropriate intervention for all children including those with special educational needs and has discontinued the practice whereby children who are in full-time education provision would also be able to avail of home tuition grants.The children for whom the service has been discontinued are enrolled in special schools or special class placements or are attending mainstream schools with additional resource teaching and special needs assistant supports, as appropriate.

At that point, Principals reported that the situation was still quite fluid i.e. some children who had accepted places did not take them up; others started in one school and then moved to another school etc.  On top of that, one school where provision was made for the intake of three junior infant classes filled less than two which means there is vacant accommodation for an extra junior infant intake at that school should the need arise.Overall, the situation would appear to be that all junior infants seeking places were or can be accommodated.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	616	My Department operates four student maintenance grant schemes which comprise the Post Leaving Certificate Scheme and three schemes which relate to third level courses. The Schemes are administered by the VECs and Local Authorities on behalf of my Department.   Under the prescribed conditions of all four schemes maintenance grants are payable at either the adjacent or the non-adjacent rate.In order to qualify for grant assistance, a candidate must, of course, satisfy the prescribed conditions of the schemes including those relating to residence, means, nationality and previous academic attainment.The adjacent rate of maintenance grant is payable where the grantholder's normal residence is 15 miles or less from the college or PLC Centre which he/she is attending. The non-adjacent rate of maintenance grant is payable in all other cases, with the exception of all eligible mature students who, with effect from the 1999/2000 academic year, qualify for the higher non-adjacent rate of grant.Under the terms of the Department's maintenance grants schemes, and in accordance with the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Act 1992, a mature student is defined as a candidate who is at least 23 years of age on the 1st January of the year of entry or re-entry to an approved course.Mature students are categorised as either independent mature students or mature students dependent on parents or guardians. An independent mature student is defined as meaning a mature student who was not ordinarily resident at home with his/her parents or guardians from the October preceding their entry to an approved course. Independent mature students are assessed without reference to The Millennium Partnership Fund, which was established in 2000, is a community-based fund that supports retention and participation among under-represented groups of students in further or higher education. The fund is available to students from area partnerships and community groups that participate in the Local Development Social Inclusion Programme (LDSIP). Application for Millennium funding is made annually by organisations through Pobal Ltd., the state company established to promote social inclusion, reconciliation and equality in Ireland and which has administered the fund since it was established. In 2004-5, the latest year for which figures are available, approximately 3,750 students in higher and further education benefited from the fund. The Fund primarily benefits students through the direct provision of financial assistance.The Millennium Partnership Fund is a targeted funding programme, operating within defined urban and rural areas that are the most socio-economically disadvantaged in the country.  It is well established that participation rates in higher education are significantly lower than the national average in areas targeted under the Local Development Social Inclusion Programme. Indeed, priority in allocating Millennium funding is given to partnerships and community groups that operate within CLÁR — or RAPID-designated areas.The Millennium Fund complements the range of other education actions being implemented at community level through the Local Development Social Inclusion Programme. The Fund also complements the work being undertaken by higher education institutions'  access programmes, many of these programmes working with communities that benefit from the Millennium Fund.In March 2005, the National Office for Equity of Access to Higher Education published an evaluation of the Millennium Partnership Fund. The overall conclusion of the evaluation is that the Millennium Fund serves an important function in supporting students from disadvantaged areas to attend further and higher education. The report identified and considered a number of issues including that of geographical boundaries.In the context of discussions on the implementation of the 2005/6 Fund, the National Office for Equity of Access to Higher Education requested that Pobal consider a number recommendations contained in the evaluation.Currently, therefore, there is nothing specific in the Pobal implementation guidelines referring to individuals residing outside the geographical remit covered by community and area-based partnerships under the Millennium Partnership Fund. However, in very occasional and exceptional circumstances partnerships have used their own discretion and have extended Millennium Partnership Funding to individuals residing outside the partnership geographical remit.  On occasions where this has occurred, partnerships must demonstrate that they had the money to do so in the first instance and that the selection would not ‘displace' students residing in the partnership area.Where partnerships have not extended funding to individuals seeking monetary support and residing outside their geographical remit, they have explored and supported students to the best of their ability in identifying alternative avenues of funding where relevant.As we move towards the beginning of a new national development plan, the National Office and Pobal are considering ways in which the impact and effectiveness of the Fund, and its complementarity with other initiatives, can be improved.  Pobal have submitted a document to the National Office on the future of the Millennium Fund in the context of the new national plan. This is currently being considered by the National Office.

The application has been assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects and has been assigned a Band 2 rating. To move the project forward, the long term projected staffing of the school is being assessed.  This will determine the extent of any extra accommodation to be provided.  Contact will be made directly with the school authority when this has been established.In the meantime, the school authority has been made aware of the recent publication of the Department's devolved capital schemes and it has been asked to consider whether or not it would be appropriate for it to apply under these schemes.  The method and timing for the delivery of the proposed project will ultimately depend on how the school wishes to proceed in this regard.

This is, in my view, in general a preferable approach to putting in place grants for specific cost items such as insurance.There have been significant improvements in the level of funding provided to primary and post-primary schools. Since 1997 the standard rate of capitation grant at primary level has been increased from €57.14 per pupil to €145.58 with effect from 1st January, 2006.  This represents an increase of almost 155% in the standard rate of capitation grant at primary level since 1997.I am committed to further improving the funding position of primary schools in the light of available resources. The significant increases in the funding of primary schools in recent years is a clear demonstration of this government's commitment to prioritise available resources to address the needs of schools.

Similarly tuition fees, under the Free Fees Initiative, are not payable in respect of a second period of college attendance on a course at the same level. These restrictions apply to every student who already holds a qualification at the same level, irrespective of where that qualification was obtained or whether or not funding was previously awarded. Clause 7.6 of the Higher Education Grant Scheme refers in this regard.My Department understands that the candidate referred to by the Deputy already holds a Degree at undergraduate level, and as such is ineligible for funding for further study at undergraduate level.It is not open to me, or my Department, to depart from the terms of the maintenance grants schemes in individual cases.Section 473A, Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 provides for tax relief, at the standard rate of tax, for tuition fees paid in respect of approved full/part-time courses in both private and publicly funded third level Colleges and Universities in the State and any other E.U. Member State. Further details and conditions in relation to this tax relief are available from the local Revenue Commissioners Office.

At the beginning of the current school year there are no less than 4000 extra teachers in our primary schools, compared with 2002. The average class size in our primary schools is 24 and there is now one teacher for 17 pupils at primary level, including resource teachers etc.Children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas are getting more support than ever before to help them to make the most of their time at school.Indeed, with the thousands of extra primary teachers hired by this Government, recent years have seen the largest expansion in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education. Over the next two school years even more teachers will be put in place both for the above priority areas of disadvantage and special education and also under a reduction in the mainstream staffing schedule.As the Deputy knows all primary schools are staffed on a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children. Of course, schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that – with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on — but the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children in the school. Next year (2007/2008 school year) this is being reduced to 27 children per classroom teacher.A further initiative that has been of direct benefit to primary schools has been the change in the criteria for developing schools. For the current school year the threshold for getting a developing school post was reduced specifically to help schools that are seeing large increases in enrolments each year, as is the case in many schools. 170 such posts were sanctioned in the 2005/06 school year, compared with 105 in 2004/05.This Government has shown a clear determination to improve the staffing in our schools and we will continue to prioritise this issue going forward.

The allocation for that year was €3.2 billion as compared with €7.9 billion in the current year.The total provision for educational inclusion programmes in 2006 is more than €640m across all levels of education, as compared with almost €600m in 2005. This includes additional funding for the implementation of measures under the DEIS action plan at pre-school, primary and second-level.DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) addresses the educational needs of children and young people from disadvantaged communities, from pre-school to completion of upper second level education (3 to 18 years). The new action plan represents a shift in emphasis away from individual initiatives, each addressing a particular aspect of the problem, with the new plan adopting a multi-faceted and much more integrated approach.Its core elements comprise: a standardised system for identifying, and regularly reviewing, levels of disadvantage; and a new integrated School Support Programme (SSP) which will bring together, and build upon, some ten existing educational inclusion measures. As a result of the identification process, 840 schools were invited to participate in the SSP. These comprised 640 primary schools (320 urban/town schools and 320 rural schools) and 200 second-level schools. A further 40 schools have been invited to join the Programme following a recent appeal process.Under DEIS, additional financial support is being provided for all primary and second-level schools in the School Support Programme. All schools will also have access to the School Meals Programme, administered by the Department of Social and the Department of Social and Family Affairs.An additional €1m is being made available under the School Books Grant Scheme in 2006/2007 for primary and second-level schools in the School Support Programme to support the establishment, development and ongoing operation of book loan/rental schemes.

The School Support Programme will bring together, and build upon, a number of existing interventions in schools with a concentrated level of disadvantage.The process of identifying primary and second-level schools for participation in the SSP was managed by the Educational Research Centre (ERC) on behalf of my Department and supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through the Department's regional offices and the Inspectorate.As a result of the identification process, 840 schools were invited to participate in the SSP. These comprised 640 primary schools (320 urban/town schools and 320 rural schools) and 200 second-level schools.A review mechanism was put in place to address the concerns of schools that did not qualify for inclusion in the School Support Programme but regarded themselves as having a level of disadvantage which is of a scale sufficient to warrant their inclusion in the programme.The review process operated under the direction of Dr Seamus McGuinness of Trinity College, Dublin who was charged with ensuring that all relevant identification processes and procedures were properly followed in the case of schools applying for a review.  Dr McGuinness was supported by a nominated staff member from the Educational Research Centre and an official from my own Department.Primary schools seeking a review were advised that applications must relate to data on the relevant variables included in the ERC survey of May, 2005 and to the reference date of 30 September, 2004. They were also informed that consideration would be given to major changes in a school's socio-economic composition at the mid-way point between the 2005/2006 and 2009/2010 identification process i.e. in 2007/2008.All applications for review were thoroughly examined by the Review Group. This included making contact with schools where clarification was required on any aspect of their application.An application for review was received from the school referred to by the Deputy. In accordance with the recommendations of the Review Group, the school has not been identified for inclusion in the School Support Programme and the Principal was informed by letter on 4th August, 2006.My Department has recently received correspondence from the school outlining changes in the socio-economic profile of the area and has been informed that the points made will be noted in the context of the mid-term review of schools which have had  a major change in socio-economic composition since September 2004.

Ballinamore Post Primary Schools availed of this appeals mechanism and were allocated a further 0.55 wholetime equivalent teacher post.

For the current school year the threshold for getting a developing school post was reduced specifically to help schools that are seeing large increases in enrolments each year, as is the case in many schools. 170 such posts were sanctioned in the 2005/06 school year, compared with 105 in 2004/05.This Government has shown a clear determination to improve the staffing in our schools and we will continue to prioritise this issue going forward.Class size rangeNumbers of Pupils0-915010-191,74020-243,24225-293,50430-342,47635-3964040 and over41Total11,793The Deputy will be pleased to know that the school referred to in the chart as having a class of 41 teachers in 2005/06 has been allocated 2 extra teachers this year.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	633	As part of the multi-annual school building programme my Department has invested heavily in modernising school facilities throughout the country including science facilities in post-primary schools. Typically this investment involves the provision of modern science facilities in new post-primary schools or the upgrading of science facilities in existing schools either as part of a school building project or as a dedicated investment to facilitate the teaching of science.Additionally I have provided for class materials, basic general equipment and chemicals for practical work for the Sciences.My Department also spent in excess of €13m in 2004 to facilitate the introduction of a revised Junior Science syllabus. Schools received a basic grant of €3500 per science laboratory to enable them to provide the new curriculum. Additional funding was made available to schools where other specified equipment was required. In addition, certain schools identified as needing new or refurbished science laboratories as a result of a 1998 national survey received funding. Funding is also available this year to schools that have yet to apply for the basic grant of €3,500 per science laboratory and for other specified equipment to enable them to provide the new curriculum.Schools have also received funding under the Summer Works Scheme in 2004 and 2005 to refurbish science laboratories. In the application for funding under the 2006 Summer Works Scheme post-primary schools were asked to specifically identify and provide details of any science and technology upgrade or refurbishment projects separate from any other projects being applied for so that consideration could be given to approving these projects for 2006. I approved funding for 26 such projects under the 2006 summer Works Scheme.The Deputy can be assured that my Department will continue to take a proactive approach in the provision of the necessary facilities for the teaching of science in schools.

These scholarships are only tenable in respect of specified third level courses. Applications are required for these scholarships.  The closing date for these scholarships in 2006 was 28th July 2006.My Department also awards seven Easter Week Commemoration Scholarships annually on the basis of the Leaving Certificate results.  An Easter Week Commemoration Scholarship is a highly prestigious award as only one scholarship is awarded annually in commemoration of each signatory of the 1916 Proclamation of Independence.

The position generally regarding my Department's Radon Remediation Programme is as follows. In 1998 my Department commissioned the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII) to conduct a survey of radon levels in all primary and post primary schools. In addition, in June 2001 circular letter M46/01 issued to all Boards of Management informing them of the Department's initiative and advising schools on the course of action necessary for radon mitigation.  During the course of the survey, 4072 schools were invited to participate. The RPII wrote to each of these schools, enclosing a copy of the test results, and advising that the results of the survey be made available to all staff and parents. It was also recommended that a copy of the results be filed in the school's Health & Safety Manual for future reference.The radon reference set for the workplace under the "Radiological Protection Act, 1991 ((Ionising Radiation) Order, 2000" (Statutory Instrument 125 of 2000)) is 400 Bq/m3. Notwithstanding the fact that the radon reference for workplaces is 400 Bq/m3, my Department has issued grants to all schools for the installation of suitable vents in classrooms where radon readings show levels between 200 Bq/m3 and 400 Bq/m3. Schools where the radon readings show levels above 400 Bq/m3 have been advised to secure the services of a suitably qualified consultant architect/engineer to carry out all necessary remedial works and these works are funded by my Department.Following completion of remediation works, post-remediation measurements are carried out by the RPII to determine if the remediation has been effective. This process is ongoing and the RPII continue to carry out post remediation testing in schools.  Radon barriers are included in the design of all new school building projects.

Approval has also been given for the establishment of a further two such facilities.My Department is of the view that children with autism, in common with all children should have access to appropriate provision delivered by suitably qualified teachers within the school system where children can mix with their wider peer group and have maximum opportunities for integration.  Pupils with autism who are fully integrated into mainstream school receive individual teaching support for a number of hours per week as well as support from special needs assistants and specialist equipment if required.  I can confirm that my Department received an application for an ABA stand alone centre from representatives of Clare Autism Action at a meeting held in my Department last July.  My officials requested that the names and psychological assessments of the children proposing to attend the proposed centre should be forwarded to the Department in order to progress the application further.  My Department is awaiting the necessary reports.  I can confirm that a further meeting between representatives of Clare Autism Action and officials of my Department is scheduled for the end of this month.

Accordingly, it would be a breach of my Department's policy for post-primary schools involved in the Free Second Level Education Scheme to demand or levy a fee. However, voluntary contributions by parents, or charges for optional extras over and above what is provided for in the general school programme, are permissible provided that it is made absolutely clear to parents that there is no question of compulsion to pay and that, in making a contribution, they are doing so of their own volition.Day to day funding for our schools has also increased significantly in recent years. In respect of second-level schools the standard capitation grant of €266 per pupil in 2003 now stands at €298 per pupil from 1 January last. In addition, the support services grant for secondary schools has been increased from €127 per pupil in 2003 to €159 per pupil from January last. This per capita grant is in addition to a range of equalisation grants of up to some €15,500 per school per annum that were also approved for voluntary secondary schools. Similarly at primary level, schools have benefited from substantial increases in funding since 2003. The standard capitation grant has increased from €111.58 per pupil in 2003 to €145.58 from 1 January, 2006 while the Ancillary Services grant has been increased from €127 in 2003 to €139 in 2006. This Government is strongly committed to improving participation and achievement at every level of education. We have put the resources and supports in place to ensure that our children get the highest standard of education. With an increase of some 9%, day-to-day expenditure on education will exceed €7 billion for the first time in 2006.

While my consent is required by TRBDI for the re-location proposal (and I have indicated that this consent will only be given on the condition, inter alia, that the TRBDI assists in the matter of the provision of a site for the Gaelscoil) the TRBDI site is in the ownership of TRBDI Ltd. Expressions of interest have been sought by TRBDI from developers that, ideally, would result in a developer taking possession of the Institute’s current location and providing accommodation for the Institute at Ballingarrane Estate at no cost to the Exchequer with the proviso that three acres be made available for the Gaelscoil.  Developers have the option of providing the three acres from the existing site or from an agreed alternative suitable location elsewhere in Clonmel.   This process will take some considerable time and the outcome is difficult to predict at present.  In the meantime, my Department is liaising with TRBDI and the County Manager of South Tipperary County Council to explore the possibility of other suitable options for the permanent accommodation of the Gaelscoil in Clonmel that may, potentially, be in a position to be finalised earlier than the potential option on the existing TRBDI site.

An approved course for the purpose of the Schemes means a full-time undergraduate course of not less than two year's duration and full time postgraduate course of not less that one year's duration pursued in an approved institution. Under the terms of the Department's maintenance grants schemes, and in accordance with the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Act 1992, a mature student is defined as a candidate who is at least 23 years of age on 1 January of the year of entry or re-entry to an approved course.  Mature students are categorised as either independent mature students or mature students dependent on parents or guardians. An independent mature student is defined as meaning a mature student who was not ordinarily resident at home with his/her parents or guardians from the October preceding their entry to an approved course. Independent mature students are assessed without reference to either their parents' or guardians' income or address.Under the terms of the Third Level Student Support Schemes, a student is not eligible for grant assistance in respect of a second period of study at the same level, irrespective of whether a grant was paid previously. The schemes also provide that grants may not be paid to candidates who already hold a postgraduate qualification and are pursuing a second postgraduate qualification. Notwithstanding this condition, candidates who already hold a postgraduate qualification and are progressing to a further postgraduate course which represents progression from the level at which the previous postgraduate qualification(s) was attained, may be deemed eligible for grant aid. Part-time courses are not approved courses under the terms of the Maintenance Grant Schemes. Any extension of the student support schemes to part-time studies would have significant cost implications. I have no plans at present to extend the grant schemes to include part-time students.Under my Department's Free Fees Initiative the Exchequer meets the tuition fees of eligible students who are attending approved full-time undergraduate third-level courses in the State. I have no plans at present to extend this schemes to include part-time students.  Further information and application forms may be obtained from the relevant local authority.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	656	I propose to take Questions Nos. 542 and 543 together.The process of identifying primary and second-level schools for participation in the new School Support Programme under DEIS was managed by the Educational Research Centre (ERC) on behalf of my Department and supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through the Department's regional offices and the Inspectorate. The ERC's overall approach was guided by the definition of educational disadvantage in the Education Act (1998), section 32(9), as: ". . . the impediments to education arising from social or economic disadvantage which prevent students from deriving appropriate benefit from education in schools". In the primary sector, the identification process was based on a survey of all primary schools in May 2005, from which a response rate of more than 97% was achieved.  The analysis of the survey returns by the ERC identified the socioeconomic variables that collectively best predict achievement, and these variables were then used to identify schools for participation in the School Support Programme. The variables involved are: unemployment; local authority accommodation; lone parenthood; Travellers; large families (5 or more children); and pupils eligible for free booksIn the case of second-level schools, the Department supplied the ERC with centrally-held data from the Post-Primary Pupils and State Examinations Commission databases. Based on an analysis of these data, the variables used to determine eligibility for inclusion in the School Support Programme were as follows: Medical card data for Junior Certificate candidates (including Junior Certificate School Programme candidates); Junior Certificate retention rates by school; Junior Certificate exam results aggregated to school level (expressed as an OPS – "Overall Performance Scale" — score). This was based on each student's performance in the seven subjects in which s/he performed best; and Leaving Certificate retention rates by school.  The gender composition of a school was not a factor in determining identification for SSP at either primary or second level.  All schools were assessed in the same way.As a result of the identification process, 840 schools were invited to participate in the SSP. These comprised 640 primary schools (320 urban/town schools and 320 rural schools) and 200 second-level schools. A review mechanism was put in place to address the concerns of those primary and second level schools that did not qualify for inclusion in the School Support Programme but regarded themselves as having a level of disadvantage which is of a scale sufficient to warrant their inclusion in the programme. On foot of this process a further 40 schools have been  invited to take part in the Programme. Approximately 125 schools between primary and second- level, which did not qualify for inclusion in the School Support Programme, are receiving support under the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme. These schools and those benefiting from other pre-existing schemes will  keep the extra resources — both financial and human — that they are getting under these initiatives for the 2006/07 school year. After that they will continue to get support in line with the level of disadvantage among their pupils.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	657	The mainstream staffing of a primary school for a particular school year is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on the 30th September of the previous school year and by reference to a staffing schedule. The staffing schedule for the 2005/06 school year was outlined in Primary Circular 15/05 which was issued to all primary schools.All primary schools were staffed on a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 29 children for the 2005/06 school year. Of course, schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that — with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on. This year (2006/07) this figure has been reduced to 28 children and next year (2007/2008 school year) this is being reduced to 27 children per classroom teacher. For the current school year (2006/07) the threshold for getting a developing school post was reduced specifically to help schools that are seeing large increases in enrolments each year, as is the case in many schools.With the major expansion in teacher numbers provided by this Government in recent years there are now 4,000 more teachers in our primary schools than there were in 2002. Indeed, there are 1,000 more teachers in September 2006 than there were in September 2005.Some schools will find that they are entitled to fewer teachers as a result of having less pupils. The application of the primary staffing schedule in the 2005/06 school year warranted the withdrawal of 272 over quota posts. The Deputy will be pleased to know that the staffing schedule has been improved for the 2006/07 school year and will be improved next year.Teacher allocations for second level schools are approved by my Department on an annual basis in accordance with generally applied rules based on recognised pupil enrolments on the 30th of September of the preceding school year. There were approximately 128 over quota teaching posts at second level for the school year 2005/06.The pupil teacher ratio at second level has improved significantly in recent years. There is now one teacher for every 13 students at post-primary level, down from one for every 16 students in 1996/97.This Government has shown a clear determination to improve the staffing in our schools and we will continue to prioritise this issue going forward.

Teacher allocations for second level schools are approved by my Department on an annual basis in accordance with generally applied rules based on recognised pupil enrolments on the 30th of September of the preceding school year.The pupil teacher ratio at second level has improved significantly in recent years. The ratio fell from 16:1 to 13.2:1 during the period from 1996/97 to 2005/2006.The rules for allocating teaching posts provide that where a school management authority is unable to meet essential curricular commitments, my Department will consider applications for additional short term support. An independent appeals mechanism is available to school authorities who wish to appeal the adequacy of their teacher allocation.In line with Government policy, my Department will continue to provide further reductions in the pupil teacher ratio within available resources and subject to spending priorities within the education sector. Priority will be given to pupils with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas.

The scheme is not designed to facilitate parents who choose to send their children to a post primary centre outside of the catchment area in which they reside. However, children who are fully eligible for transport to the post primary centre in the catchment area in which they reside may apply for transport on a concessionary basis to a post primary centre outside of their own catchment area — otherwise known as catchment boundary transport. These children can only be facilitated if spare seats are available on the bus after all other eligible children travelling to their own post primary centre have been catered for. Such children have to make their own way to the nearest pick up point within that catchment area.Catchment boundaries have their origins in the establishment of free post primary education in the late 1960's. For planning purposes, the country was divided into geographic districts, each with several primary schools feeding into a post primary education centre with one or more post primary schools. The intention was that these defined districts would facilitate the orderly planning of school provision and accommodation needs. They also facilitated the provision of a national school transport service, enabling children from remote areas to get to their nearest school.Reviews of specific catchment boundaries may be carried out where appropriate. A number of reviews have been carried out over the years where, for example a new post primary school is established in an area where previously there was none or, conversely, where a "sole provider" school closes due to declining enrolment.The Deputy should understand that, irrespective of the dates on the maps, eligibility for school transport at post-primary level is determined by way of distance from home to the education centre in the catchment area in which a pupil resides. A catchment area is defined within a boundary line on a map.The Deputy will be aware, also, that a number of families from the Blackwater area lodged an appeal to the Independent School Transport Appeals Board against my Department's decision not to categorise their children as fully eligible for school transport to the Wexford post primary education centre. The Board upheld my Department's decision in the matter.The School Transport Appeals Board is independent of my Department and it would not be appropriate for me to intervene in cases which have been considered by the Board.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	663	My Department has no plans to provide dedicated funding to the Down Syndrome Ireland organisation.  My Department does however provide funding for a range of initiatives within the school system to support pupils with Down Syndrome. The precise level of support is determined by the special educational needs of the particular child.Children with Down Syndrome are entitled to additional provision in primary school, either under the terms of the general allocation system of teaching supports if the assessment places the child in the high incidence disability category or through an allocation of additional resources if the child is assessed as being within the low-incidence category of special need, as defined by my Department's circular SP ED 02/05.My Department's policy is to ensure the maximum possible integration of children with special educational needs into ordinary mainstream schools. The precise model of provision made available will depend on the assessed needs of the pupils involved. Some pupils are capable of attending ordinary classes on an integrated basis with additional teacher and/or special needs assistant support. In other cases, the level of special need involved can be such as to warrant placement in a special school or a special class attached to an ordinary school. A range of such facilities is provided to cater for the variety of levels of need that can arise. Each special school and special class operates at a reduced pupil teacher ratio. The ratios in question can vary from 11:1 in the case of children with a mild general learning disability to 6:1 where more severe disabilities are involved. The pupil teacher ratios applicable in all cases are in line with those recommended by the Special Education Review Committee.Children attending all such facilities also attract special rates of capitation funding and have access to special funding for the purchase of specialised equipment where required.I am satisfied that the mechanisms are in place to provide appropriate resources for children with special needs in our schools, including those with Down Syndrome.

In accordance with the Terms of Reference, the question of who should be responsible for the maintenance of certain shared facilities in the newer type of mixed estate (that is, whether, and to what extent, planning authorities should take these in charge, or what responsibilities residents should have for maintenance) will be a key consideration for the Working Group.

This system of property management is relatively new in this country and a variety of questions has emerged.  A number of responses are under way involving the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Law Reform Commission and the National Consumer Agency.  My Department is also engaging with local authorities and the construction industry on the matter.Arrangements for managing and maintaining the communal elements of private apartment complexes are increasingly being addressed by management companies.  In general these are constituted under the Companies Acts and are required to comply with the provisions of company law which is a matter for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  It is understood that proposals are being developed by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment for amendment to company law which it is expected will include certain provisions relating to management companies.The National Consumer Agency published a report on management fees and service charges on 4 October.  This was supplemented by a booklet entitled "Property Management Companies and You" which is a simple guide for persons thinking of buying or who have bought an apartment.  This booklet will no doubt be of assistance to such persons and help to reduce the information deficit in this area.The Law Reform Commission is currently examining legal aspects generally regarding the management of multi-unit structures and its consultation paper is expected shortly.

The Electoral Act 1992 provides for postal voting by wholetime members of the Defence Forces, members of the Garda, and Irish diplomats serving abroad and their spouses. Subsequent legislation enacted by the Oireachtas has extended postal voting to other categories: electors living at home who are unable to vote because of a physical illness or a physical disability (the Electoral (Amendment) Act 1996); electors whose occupation, service or employment makes it likely that they will be unable to vote in person at their local polling station on polling day – in these cases, the law provides for completion of the necessary voting documentation at a Garda station (the Electoral Act 1997); fulltime students registered at their home who are living elsewhere while attending an educational institution in the State (the Electoral Act 1997); and certain election staff employed at the poll outside the constituency where they reside (the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2001).While electoral law is subject to ongoing review, there are no proposals to alter the existing arrangements along the lines referred to in the Question.

The edited register, therefore, contains only the names of persons who have no objection to their details being used for purposes other than electoral or other statutory purposes.The edited register provisions came into force on 1 November 2004 and it is an offence, under section 13A of the Electoral Act 1992, to use the full register except for electoral or other statutory purposes.  Details in relation to the operation of these provisions are a matter for the local registration authorities in accordance with electoral law.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	678	I understand that the European Environment Agency's report is not yet published but I look forward to examining its findings fully when it is released.Nevertheless, it should be borne in mind that Ireland is experiencing huge levels of population growth across all counties, with the national population rising by over 8% in the last four years alone.  This unparalleled growth, together with unprecedented economic expansion have placed large demands on housing and associated infrastructures.  This represents a new challenge for the regional balance of development across the country, and for dealing with increasing pressures in the urban environs of Dublin.The Government has acted swiftly and on a broad front to ensure that the provision of new houses and apartments is undertaken in a manner that is socially, economically and environmentally sustainable.  A key policy response has been the National Spatial Strategy (NSS), which was published in November 2002.In addition, the Regional Planning Guidelines for the Greater Dublin Area, which were originally published in 1999 and further updated in 2004, translate the NSS into regional strategies and objectives.  These guidelines emphasise the need to consolidate the physical growth of the Dublin metropolitan area, the city and suburbs, while at the same time concentrating development in the hinterland into strategically placed, strong and dynamic urban centres.  The principles of the RPGs are now reflected in city and county development plans and the effects of these policies are being seen in more integrated and strategic planning policies at local level.Moreover, the 1999 Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Residential Density included specific objectives for more compact urban development by seeking to assist planning authorities in achieving high quality residential density at appropriate locations, in conjunction with improved public transport systems.  These guidelines are currently being reviewed and updated to take account of changing population and settlement patterns and the extensive experience built up since the introduction of the 1999 guidelines in the design, assessment and development of higher density proposals.I am confident that the continuing implementation of the policies outlined above will have a positive influence on bringing about more compact urban design and sustainable development into the future.

In order to support and encourage local authorities this Department, with the assistance of the National Archives, put in place a strategy for the development of archives services.A survey of the records and archives held by local authorities was conducted in 1995 by the National Archives on behalf of this Department, and a subsequent report on the development of the local authority archives service was published, and is available on the Department's website.A subsidy scheme was established under which local authorities may recoup 50% of the salary of an archivist employed by them provided the archivist is employed on a regional basis.  This scheme was reviewed and a revised scheme notified to local authorities in 1999.Local authorities may also qualify for up to 50% subsidy in respect of leasing accommodation for the purposes of processing archives, and archives storage facilities have been funded as part of some library projects.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	681	The compilation and publication of the register of electors is a matter for each local registration authority in accordance with electoral law. While I have put in place a programme of measures to assist and support local authorities in their registration work, it is the duty of local authorities to ensure as far as possible the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the register; in carrying out this work, local authorities depend to a significant degree on the cooperation and engagement of the general public.Section 8 of the Electoral Act 1992 states that to be eligible for registration as a Dáil elector a person must be ordinarily resident in a constituency on the qualifying date (1 September in the year preceding the year in which the Register comes into force). Section 11 of the Act places a prohibition on a person being registered as an elector more than once in any registration area or in more than one registration area.Long standing guidance from the Department suggests that students be given the option of being registered at their parents' home or at the students residential address.  While the guidance further suggests that persons who normally return to their parents' home at the weekends and for holidays should be registered where they live for work purposes, the determination of ordinary residence is a matter for decision by the local authority in the light of the circumstances of each particular case. On publication of the Draft Register of Electors on 1 November, individuals, if they wish, can make a claim to have their registration details altered and the matter will be determined by the County Registrar.

The 2001 Act also facilitates improved access, interaction, linkages and service provision for all towns and areas with their respective county councils. Local authorities, as part of the local government modernisation programme, also have extensive capacity to innovate and adapt to changing circumstances and local demands, including those of economic and population growth.I am considering the steps necessary to commence the relevant provisions of the 2001 Act in respect of new town councils and I am in discussion with local government interests, as the opportunities arise, on the prospective functional responsibilities of such town councils. I continue to keep the position under review, while consolidating progress on quality customer service measures, with the aim of ensuring good accessible local government service delivery for all towns.

The controls, which must be observed when the dog is in a public place, require that these dogs, or types and crosses thereof, must be kept on a short lead by a person over 16 years of age who is capable of controlling them and that they be securely muzzled.  Furthermore, the Control of Dogs Act 1986 gives specific powers to the courts to order that a dog, which the court considers dangerous, must be kept under proper control or be destroyed.  I am satisfied that these provisions provide an adequate level of control and it is not proposed to introduce additional measures, including in relation to additional breeds such as the Kerry Blue, at this stage.

#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Prelude	689	I refer to reply to Questions Nos. 1514, 1515, 1516, and 1551 of 27 September 2006.The National Consumer Agency Report in relation to management fees and service charges was published on 4 October.  The report is welcome and its production is timely as there are a number of ongoing developments taking place in this complex area involving a number of different Government Departments and agencies as indicated in the above reply.Two recommendations of the report are stated to be for action by my Department.Recommendation 12 is that the contract between the developer and the management company to convey the title of the buildings and common areas to the management company should include a contractual obligation on the developer to attend to the management company's snag list, prepared by an independent architect/surveyor and that this should be implemented by means of an amendment to planning legislation.  I do not consider that planning legislation is an appropriate vehicle for implementing this recommendation measure.  The regulation of the contract to convey title to property is a conveyancing matter.Recommendation 25 refers to the completion of developments in accordance with the terms of the planning permissions and makes reference to section 35 of the Planning and Development Act 2000.  As I have stated above, planning authorities already have substantial enforcement powers and duties under the legislation.  Section 35 of the 2000 Act provides that planning authorities may refuse to grant planning permission, subject to the consent of the High Court, to any developer who has seriously failed to comply with a previous planning permission: the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006, which was enacted on 16 July 2006 effectively reversed the burden of proof here – the planning authority will now be empowered to refuse permission in such a case and the developer will have to go to the High Court if he wishes to apply to have this decision overturned.  I intend to commence the relevant section of the 2006 Act very shortly.
