#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	0	This is a bad day for the 760 employees of Bank of Scotland (Ireland).  It is a bad day for the bank's 300,000 holders of variable mortgages.  If Bank of Scotland leaves Ireland, it will take with it competition and choice.  We cannot return to the old days of the cosy cartel that operated between Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks.Eighteen months ago, the Taoiseach's Government promised a restructuring of the Irish banking system.  In respect of these 300,000 holders of variable mortgages and others, what does his Government now propose to do to introduce choice and competition to the banking sector?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1	Yesterday I recorded our regret at the announcement of the loss of these jobs in Bank of Scotland (Ireland).  I made the point that I had been assured that all customers of the bank would be looked after and would not be disadvantaged by the changes.  Bank of Scotland (Ireland) will continue to have a presence in Ireland, albeit with the loss of 760 employees now gainfully employed who will no longer be part of the operation after July.  It is also important to point out that the bank indicated it sees itself continuing as an independent entity.In the context of having a viable and competitive banking system, the establishment of NAMA was to ensure that banks are freed of stressed assets and can access cash to lend on to businesses and households.  That will be achieved by replacing property related loans with Irish Government bonds which will strengthen the balance sheets of the banks and increase their capacity to access liquidity in the financial markets and, if necessary, through euro system liquidity operations, making them better able to lend and support businesses and the Irish economy.The contentions from the Opposition have varied from time to time but——

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	3	——it always has been my view that if we are to have proper credit access into the economy and a functioning banking system the NAMA operation has to be, and will be, proceeded with.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	4	That is a bad day made even worse by the response of the Taoiseach.  What effort is the Government making now to introduce competition and choice for consumers in this country?  Did the Government reject any offer, if such were made, by Bank of Scotland (Ireland) to be part of the third banking force?  Based on allegations now in circulation, has the Taoiseach had any indications that there might be thousands of additional bank job losses because of other international banks pulling out of this country?  These are serious matters and they require the immediate attention of Government.When does the Government propose to publish its paper on restructuring the banks?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	5	These matters have the full attention of Government at all times albeit not always with the support of Members of the House.  That is a matter for debate in respect of all the initiatives we have brought forward, all of which have been supported internationally.The next phase of restructuring the banking system relates to the valuation of the distressed assets and their removal to the NAMA operation.  Arising from that is the recapitalisation of the banks affected by the removal of the distressed assets.  As the Deputy will know, that is under way at present.  The Minister intends to take a comprehensive approach to all of that and in the coming weeks and months the Government intends to proceed on the basis that the current valuation method used for the NAMA operation will be completed.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	6	I shall pursue the matter of the 760 people who are to lose their jobs and become unemployed in a employment market in which there are few, if any, other available jobs for them.  When did the Government first hear this bank was going to close its branch network?  Was there any meeting between any Minister and a representative of this bank to discuss its plans?  When the chief executive of the bank informed the staff yesterday that they were to lose their jobs he said other options had been under consideration since last summer.  What were those other options?  Did they include a suggestion of this bank being part of a possible amalgamation or rearrangement with other banking institutions in the State?What is the Taoiseach's understanding of what will happen to the bank's business now that its branch network is to be closed?  In particular, what is his understanding of the position of mortgage holders in this bank?  We recall that this was the bank which arrived to great cheers, with a buccaneer approach to lending.  It was the first to give 100% mortgages, it introduced the tracker mortgage and, apparently, has 7% of the mortgage market.  What is the position of a person who has a mortgage with this bank and who may have difficulty repaying it, as many people now have?  Do we know what is the disposition of the bank with regard to mortgage holders?  I refer, for example, to a mortgage holder who had access to a branch and will not now have that access, in terms of talking with somebody in the bank about renegotiating mortgage terms.  Has there been any discussion with the bank in respect of those matters?Will the Taoiseach tell the House when the Government found out about the bank's intentions?  What meetings, if any, did it have? What actions does the Government contemplate to deal with this matter?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	7	My understanding is that the Government was notified yesterday under the Redundancy Acts with regard to the proposed job losses of 750 workers from this organisation.  With regard to the strategies being devised by Bank of Scotland in terms of its business model for Ireland, these would be a matter under consideration by the bank itself.  On the question of what will happen with regard to people with mortgages or accounts with the bank, my information is their accounts remain unchanged and they will not be disadvantaged by the changes.  If people have difficulties with regard to repayment of mortgages with this organisation, contact should be made with the organisation and arrangements made to facilitate those people in the circumstances in which they find themselves, just as happens with any other financial organisation.  Clearly, yesterday's announcement marks a withdrawal by Bank of Scotland (Ireland) from its operations in Ireland, to the extent that 750 people will lose their jobs.  The retail network will be affected by that.  We must now see what arrangements will be made.  We are assured that all customers will be looked after and will not be disadvantaged by the changes.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	8	I find the Taoiseach's reply incredible.  Is he telling us that the first the Government heard about this bank's intentions was yesterday when it sent a redundancy notice to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment?  This bank has been on the radar quite significantly, not only in respect of its approach to lending.  Arguably this bank's lending practices contributed to our banking problem.  Throughout the past year, it has been engaged in a very high profile advertising campaign, offering deposit interest significantly higher than that of competitor banks.  This should have brought it to the attention of somebody in Government.  Over the past 12 months the banks have been the central issue on the political agenda.  Is the Taoiseach telling us that nobody in Government talked with this bank at any time over the past year?Apparently, Mr. Higgins, the chief executive of the bank, said when announcing this to staff yesterday that the closure of the branch network was something that was under consideration since last summer and that he had hoped to avoid it by exploring other options.  I interpreted what he said in his statement yesterday as meaning the bank was involved in some kind of discussions with Government in respect of the "third force" arrangement for an amalgamation of banks.  However, it seems from what the Taoiseach has said that there were no discussions at all with the banks.How have we got to a situation where, in a year when banks have been the centre of the political agenda, no Minister or Department was in contact with this bank with regard to its intentions?  The bank has a significant share of the mortgage market and has aggressively competed for deposits.  Now it has announced it will close its entire branch network to the disadvantage of its customers and to the personal, income, family and job loss of its 750 staff.  Was the Government asleep while this bank was considering withdrawing from retail activity and closing its branches?  Is the Taoiseach saying that nobody in Government met representatives of this bank over the course of the past year?  Even it had never thought of closing its branch network, one would think somebody in Government — in a year when nothing was being discussed but banking business — would have met and talked with what was a significant player in the banking industry.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	9	In his first question the Deputy asked when we were officially notified of the redundancy announced yesterday.  I have explained when we were notified.  With regard to bank operations generally, the Department of Finance and the Central Bank monitor the banking situation on an ongoing basis.  This credit institution is not part of the State guarantee.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	10	It has a State banking licence.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	11	It is a subsidiary of a large bank, which as we all know has suffered significant losses.  Clearly, the banking strategy and business model for that bank is changing, not just with regard to its subsidiary, but also its parent.  As people will know, the British Government has taken a significant stake in the parent bank.  The situation from our point of view is simple.  It is that this announcement was made yesterday.  We very much regret the fact this has happened.  The Minister for Finance is in the process of restructuring the banking system and has provided a State guarantee which is the means by which we were able to stabilise the system during the course of the past year, something which was opposed by the Labour Party.  We have passed the NAMA legislation, which is a prerequisite in order to take the stressed assets from the banks so that we can improve credit access into the economy through the banking system.  The changed economic realities and the changed economic situation here have meant that other banks, which are not part of the State guarantee, have had to take certain decisions in respect of their business operations here and some 750 jobs are being lost, which is a matter of great regret and concern.  However, during the course of this week, some 250 jobs are being created in the general financial services area.  Yesterday, Dun and Bradstreet announced 100 new jobs, with the potential to grow significantly.  Alcatel-Lucent from Bell Labs has announced 70 new highly skilled research jobs——
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	12	Over five years.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	13	——and Gala Networks announced 100 new jobs the previous week.  While this major announcement of job losses by the bank is a matter of concern and regret for all of us, it reflects the economic and banking realities as they exist here.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	14	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, together.The renewed programme for Government envisages the following potential referenda during the lifetime of the current Dáil, subject, of course, to appropriate Oireachtas approval: to consider children's rights, based on the work of the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children; to consider amending Article 41.2 of the Constitution, to broaden the reference to the role of women in the home to one which recognises the role of the parent in the home; and to consider the establishment of a court of civil appeal.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	15	The Taoiseach mentioned the programme contained three potential referenda, one on the role of women, one on children's rights and one on the court of appeal.  We could support all of these referenda.  Has the Government any firm proposals for a date for these referenda?  If so, is it proposed to hold all three together?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	16	No.  There have been two interim reports on the work of the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children, which was established in November 2007 and is chaired by Deputy Mary O'Rourke.  The first interim report, which recommended the Government establish a statutory scheme for Garda vetting for the regulation of the collation, exchange and deployment of hard and soft information for the purpose of child protection and to require that all persons working with children are subject to vetting, was published on 1 September 2008.  The Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs is working in conjunction with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform on the preparation of legislation which will provide for the establishment of a national vetting bureau for the collection and exchange of information, both hard and soft, relating to the endangerment, sexual exploitation or sexual abuse or risk thereof to children.  The legislation will provide a statutory basis for the vetting of persons to identify those who are unsuitable to work with children and vulnerable adults.The second interim report, on absolute or strict liability in respect of sexual offences against or in connection with children, was published on 7 May 2009.  It contains 39 recommendations, including some which are a restatement of the recommendations of the 2006 report of the joint committee on child protection in respect of criminal justice procedures.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, on behalf of the Minister of State with responsibility for children and youth affairs, obtained Government approval on 8 December 2009 to prepare the general scheme of a Bill implementing the recommendations, including the recommendations of the majority of members where there was no unanimity.  The Bill will deal with the issues of absolute and strict liability that arose in the context of the Supreme Court judgment in the CC case.  The third and final report of the joint committee will deal with the rights of children and family law aspects of the amendment.  I understand this is due to be launched on 16 February next.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	17	I have listened to the Taoiseach read his brief.  Deputy Olwyn Enright in 2003 put forward the view that legislation should be introduced for soft information.  The committee recommended in September 2008 that no referendum was necessary but that legislation should be published.  It was to be published in December 2008, which has now become, obviously, February 2010.  What is the position in respect of legislation being produced to give effect to the committee's recommendation of September 2008?  When are we likely to have approval of the heads of that legislation and when is it likely to be published?Second, the Taoiseach is aware it is now taking 36 months to get a case into the Supreme Court.  The establishment of a court of appeal by way of referendum is an absolute necessity which I support.  What is the position on preparatory work by the Government for accepting the Supreme Court recommendation in this regard?  Has the Government fixed a date for these matters to be dealt with?Finally, what is the position on the Bill on judicial remuneration and when is it to be published?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	18	With regard to the first interim report which was issued on 1 September 2008, as the Deputy said, the office of the Minister of State with responsibility for children and youth affairs, in conjunction with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, is preparing the heads of the Bill for submission to Government at the earliest date.  The preparation of legislation on soft information is a priority for the Minister of State with responsibility for children and youth affairs.On the issue of judicial salaries, provision has been made in the Finance Bill published last week to facilitate voluntary payments of the levy under this measure.  Members of the Judiciary will be able to make payments equating to the pension-related deductions appropriate for their salary levels, as set out in the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009.  The Minister for Finance has also indicated that since the review body would have considered a reduction of judicial salaries, he has decided there will be no increase in judges' pay during the lifetime of the Government.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	19	It would be great if the Taoiseach answered the questions rather than reading a brief he clearly knows nothing about.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	20	Does the Taoiseach acknowledge that a referendum to strengthen the rights of children in the Constitution is necessary?   He is aware that an all-party Oireachtas committee has been addressing this matter for some considerable time and that the earlier reports in regard to soft information and the second report covering a number of areas, including the age of consent, will now be followed by the third and final report in regard to children's rights.  In fact, the 62nd meeting of that committee is scheduled for later today.Will the Taoiseach undertake to the House to join with all of the parties represented in this House in an all-party committed effort to ensure that a referendum based on the recommendations of the committee is put before the people, and that we present an amendment to the Constitution in regard to Article 42 that will secure the support of all the people?  Will he approach this project on a cross-party and all-party basis?  Will he, as a first step, consider meeting the leaders of all of the political parties in the House represented on the committee in order to set in train the united approach which I believe will be necessary in order to help garner the support necessary to ensure that this important and, in my view, essential amendment to the Constitution is successfully steered through a referendum?  Will he undertake to give a commitment that this referendum will take place this year?  Can we have an indication of the Taoiseach's intent in that regard and on the prospect of a referendum before the end of 2010?On the matter of Article 42 of the Constitution, the committee only addressed the first sections of Article 42 but there are other aspects of Article 42 that would need further address.  I refer specifically to the referencing to education.  Given there is now widespread debate on the issue of the control of schools and the need for pluralism in our schools, the role of the churches and religions, the role of the State and the need for local and democratic control of our schools, particularly in regard to primary education, does the Taoiseach agree that a structured debate in regard to all of that needs to take place?  Would he be willing to indicate to the House that such an approach and examination of the remaining aspects of Article 42 is necessary in the current reality of Irish life, given that it broadly reflects 1930s Ireland and needs to be updated?  Will he undertake to the House to commence that process immediately?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	21	I have indicated in my primary reply where we believe the possibility of referenda would be considered, namely, in the area of children's rights in the context of Article 41.2 of the Constitution in order to broaden the reference to the role of women in the home to one which recognises the role of the parent in the home, and then to consider the establishment of a court of civil appeal.  Those are the areas where the Government believes this should be considered.With regard to the question on children's rights, the first interim report brought forward a legislative proposal which is being prepared.  The second interim report, which was about trying to find a consensus on this issue, failed to find a consensus.  One view in the second interim report, held by some members of the committee, favoured a constitutional amendment to permit legislation to be enacted that would remove the possibility of relying on any defence of mistake as to age in two circumstances, namely, where an adult has engaged in a sexual act with a child below a certain age, and where an adult in a position of authority has engaged in a sexual act with any child, that is, a person below the age of 18.  There is, however, a contrary position that is also referred to by the committee — the majority view, as I understand it.  In part, it is based on the view that the Oireachtas should pursue whatever legislative options might be available to put in place a stricter statutory regime that would also pass constitutional muster before proceeding with a proposal to amend the Constitution.Subsequently, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, on behalf of the Minister of State with responsibility for children and youth affairs, obtained Government approval on 8 December last to prepare the general scheme of a Bill implementing the recommendations, including the recommendations of the majority of members where there was no unanimity of the second interim report.  That recommendation, where there is a majority rather than a consensus, is about proceeding by way of legislation rather than by constitutional amendment in the first instance.Therefore, the position has emerged as a result of these detailed deliberations by the committee and the Government has indicated how it intends to proceed.  As I understand it, a third report is due on 18 February next which deals with the rights of children and family law aspects of any prospective amendment as to whether a constitutional amendment would be provided for.  I await the report before I make any comment on that.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	22	The Taoiseach will be aware that the Minister of State with responsibility for children and youth affairs has been an active participant in the deliberations of the committee.  I understand a paper reflective of the Fianna Fáil Party's view in this area was presented to the committee during the course of its work.  Not having had expectation as a participant in the committee's work regarding the early reports of address through the Constitution, I again ask if the Taoiseach will indicate a willingness to take on board the committee's recommendations which unanimously commend address of the children's rights issues by way of amendment to the Constitution, specifically, Article 42.  Is the Taoiseach in a position to indicate the Government's disposition towards this important change which has the support of all parties to the committee?  I have gone further and asked, in relation to the remaining sections of that article of the Constitution, whether the Taoiseach is willing to undertake to accommodate a proper all-inclusive address of those sections that specify the relationship in terms of education.  The Taoiseach will be aware, as we all are, that this is a major issue of discourse and debate at this point.  It is imperative there is political leadership in this regard to ensure what is stated in the Constitution reflects the reality of the Irish situation today.  I urge the Taoiseach to consider that course and to provide leadership in this regard.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	23	As I stated earlier, the Government will, following publication and presentation of the report to the relevant Minister and Government, consider the report.  In respect of the two previous reports, the recommendations of which we have acted upon, if the committee can find a consensus based on its due and full consideration of the issues relating to the third report, the Government will take account of those recommendations.  I cannot give an undertaking until I know what is being proposed.  I believe that is the sensible way to proceed, particularly as publication of the report is imminent.  When the report has been published and considered, as in the case of the previous two reports which also have been acted upon, the Government will take the opportunity to consider it, following which I will confirm the Government's intentions.As regards the other aspects, and in reply to the question asked, it is not envisaged that during the lifetime of the current Dáil we will consider issues other than those referred to.  A structured dialogue on education, future management of schools, how the ethos of schools is to be respected and so on is about to commence.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	24	The Taoiseach stated that there are three constitutional amendments in the pipeline, one of which is the constitutional amendment in respect of the protection of children, the details, content and nature of which will be decided following publication of the committee's third report.  The second amendment relates to the establishment of a court of civil appeal and the third will seek to broaden the reference to the role of women in the home to one of the role of parents in the home.  Will any of these referenda be held in 2010?  The Taoiseach told the House yesterday that it is intended there will be an election for a Lord Mayor of Dublin in 2010.  This means the best part of 30% of the electorate will go to the polls that day anyway.  There are two by-elections imminent which cannot be postponed forever and in respect of which, presumably, people will also go to the polls.  Will the opportunity of people going to the polls in 2010 be availed of to hold one or other or, perhaps, all of these referenda?As regards the role of women and parents in the home, when does the Taoiseach expect the legislation to provide for the wording of that referendum to be presented to the House, given the specific promise in this regard in the renewed programme for Government?  The programme for Government also refers to a fourth issue, namely, the establishment of an independent electoral commission to consider the extension of the franchise for presidential elections to the Irish abroad, to examine and make recommendations for changes in the electoral system for Dáil and Seanad elections, to consider changes in respect of European elections and to make recommendations on the possibility of extending the franchise for local elections to those aged 16 years or over.  When will the independent electoral commission be established to consider these matters?As regards the Taoiseach's reply to Deputy Ó Caoláin that arising from the structured dialogue with the churches he anticipates a constitutional referendum in respect of matters relating to education——
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	25	I did not say that.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	39	I have strong views on these matters.On the question regarding education, I simply stated a dialogue was commencing.  The suggestion that I am anticipating an outcome that would require a referendum is way off the mark in terms of where the discussions are currently.  There are many detailed issues to be discussed.  I acknowledge that in light of societal and social change and so on, there is a need to have in place modern governance structures, taking into account the constitutional entitlements of all citizens in respect of education and all types of education, including ethos based education.  It is a complex issue, one which I am sure the Deputy will be aware will not be resolved overnight.  It would be, in my opinion, a foolish person who would suggest that the outcome will be a constitutional referendum.  We are not yet at that point in respect of that matter.  However, I acknowledge the need for respectable debate in that regard.As regards when the referenda may be held, the programme for Government states in respect of Article 41.2 that full consideration should be given to this matter in line with the renewed programme for Government.  We are considering the matter in terms of how it should proceed.  No decision in respect of timing has yet been made given the need to consider issues such as cost and so on.  With respect, it is better to hold such referenda at a time when more than 30% of the people are voting.  I would like everybody to vote on the issue on the day.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	48	The electoral commission has not yet been established.  As the Deputy said, the renewed programme for Government proposes an electoral commission which will propose reforms to the electoral system, including outlining a new electoral system for Seanad Éireann.  Such proposals could give rise to a constitutional amendment.  They may or may not, depending on the outcome of that work and the Government's view of it.  I understand that parties have been discussing Seanad reform with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  A consensus has not emerged there, as various parties have different positions.  The Minister will have to report to Government in due course to see where we can take it from there.  The establishment of a committee to see if there would be a consensus on that issue did not emerge.

There is a gap in the Dáil schedule in June, which is a week when no sittings are planned.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	52	Does the Deputy want it filled with a referendum?

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	54	Absolutely.  Meeting the Deputy every day is always a pleasure not to be missed.

I wondered what that week was about.  I thought maybe it was the week the Taoiseach might have an election or a referendum.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	59	The Taoiseach has already lined up three items for possible referenda.  In all seriousness therefore, if he is going to have a referendum in 2010 he must have his mind settled now as to whether or not it will happen.  He should tell the House.  He knows well how people respond when a referendum is sprung on them and run at short notice.  If there is going to be a referendum in 2010 on any of these matters he should tell us.The electoral commission is in the programme for Government.  I hate to remind the Taoiseadh that he is well into the second half of the life of the Government.  If he is ever going to do anything about the electoral commission and is serious about it, he will establish it at some time.  When was the renewed programme for Government finalised?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	60	October.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	68	I am glad to see Deputy Gilmore in such great form today.  For the record, I have outlined three areas where a referendum could have been considered.  As I have already said, we are taking the legislative route on two of the interim reports we have on children's rights.  We will have a third report next week, which I am told by a member of the committee has a unanimous view regarding a referendum.  The Government will consider that and take account of those recommendations.  No decision has been made as to when that would arise if we were to proceed along that route.As regards the second matter, the programme for Government says we would consider broadening the reference to the role of women in the home, in Article 41.2, to one which recognises the role the parent in the home.  Consideration has been given to that matter, but no decisions have been taken either on substance or date.With regard to the establishment of a court of civil appeal, a working group produced a detailed report on that issue.  Any decision by the Government on the question of a referendum will be on the basis of a necessary examination of the details.  The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is advancing that as quickly as possible.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	69	Three other Deputies are offering.  They are Deputies Bernard Allen, Alan Shatter and Jan O'Sullivan in that order.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	70	The Supreme Court judgment on the Abbeylara inquiry has had a profound and serious effect on the effectiveness of Oireachtas committees.  The Committee of Public Accounts, which I chair, is seriously handicapped in its deliberations on the performance of Departments.  For example, in our interim report on the State agency FÁS, published in February 2009, we could not say what we really wanted to say because of the constraints placed on our committee by the Abbeylara judgment.  We have had many examples since in other State agencies where we could not say what we wished to say.  My committee and others have sought stronger powers.  The only way we can get them is through a referendum, which would give greater powers to Oireachtas committees.  If we are serious about avoiding tribunals in future and giving real voice to Oireachtas committees, we must have a referendum to deal with the serious Supreme Court decision on Abbeylara.  In any future set of referenda that may occur, will the Taoiseach consider the question of the effectiveness of the powers of Oireachtas committees?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	71	As regards inquiries and tribunals, we have set up by statute a commission of inquiry model, which provides for a more cost-effective and timely examination of matters of urgent public interest.  It has proven to be a far better way than the 1924 Act.  In a number of cases in recent years, it has shown itself to be a good and effective way of dealing with matters, while allowing the Oireachtas thereafter to discuss the substance of reports that might emanate from that commission of inquiry process.  Difficult and sensitive issues have been well and comprehensively handled by that method.  While I would be prepared to listen to the debate, I do not subscribe to the idea that principles of natural justice or constitutional justice can be easily dismissed or disregarded in an effort to ensure people say, to quote the Deputy, "What you'd like to say".
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	72	Based on evidence that we heard.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	73	The point is that the question of evidence is a matter for the courts.  We have a very good separation of powers principle, whereby the Judiciary and our courts system determine guilt or innocence in respect of any potential criminal liability that people wish to ascribe.  In the Abbeylara case, the Supreme Court judgment was quite clear in this matter regarding the ability to make adverse findings.  That has to be respected since that is the constitutional position.  We should of course be open to considering what ways we can reform and assist committees in dealing with matters, but we cannot do so by disregarding constitutional proprieties.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	74	That is why I am saying we should have a debate.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	75	One cannot change the Constitution to forget about people's rights just to make a comment in a Dáil committee.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	76	Why can we not have a debate on having a referendum to give Oireachtas committees more powers to deal with issues that are blatantly contravening rules and regulations of Departments and State agencies?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	77	That is perhaps where we have a different approach.  I do not subscribe to the view that because a difficulty arose, one should provide for a constitutional amendment to get over that difficulty and allow the Deputy to proceed as he wants, given the fact that the Supreme Court has outlined quite clearly that there are serious constitutional issues involved.  One would hope every individual in this State has a right to defend his or her good reputation.  If may often be felt that to meet a populist view on some issue, the right should be disregarded so that people can say what they like.  We have rights of privilege in the House, so there are opportunities for people to use them in order to make certain statements here, but not to abuse that privilege.We need a balanced debate that factors in the constitutional position because it is the Supreme Court that decides and interprets it.  Whether we like it or not, that is the position.  When it comes to individual rights, particularly regarding principles of natural and constitutional justice, people should be very slow to change that balance.  One of the important features of the Constitution is that it has a doctrine of unenumerated rights and principles of natural and constitutional justice, which are adhered to and jealously protected by the Judiciary for citizens' benefit equally before the law.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	78	The Taoiseach is giving a lawyer's view.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	79	I am making a very important point.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	80	The Taoiseach is deliberately confusing the outcome of the Abbeylara decision because it is convenient to members of Government and also to those in the public service that they are not held properly accountable when things go wrong.  Would the Taoiseach not agree that if an Oireachtas committee is empowered to investigate the manner in which public funds are spent or the manner in which public policy is being applied and if it has a full and proper hearing with the principles of natural and constitutional justice respected, it is in the public interest that people be held to account and it is not in the public interest that essentially redacted or censored opinions are published, which ensure that nothing can possibly be contained in the report that reflects badly on an individual's reputation?Would the Taoiseach not agree that the Abbeylara judgment essentially castrated the powers of Oireachtas committees and that Oireachtas committees have lesser capacity to hold people to account than have committees at Westminster, or in many of the Parliaments across Europe or in the United States?  Would the Taoiseach not agree that it is time to blow the cobwebs out of our political system and ensure there is true accountability — not a lynch mob or a pandering to public opinion?  This House and committees of this House should be empowered to do a job in the public interest and for that to occur we need a constitutional referendum to address the consequences of the Abbeylara judgment.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	81	The Deputy has just given some good examples of the benefits of a written constitution over an unwritten constitution.  I prefaced my reply to Deputy Allen who has a strong interest in this area, by saying that we need a balanced and reflective debate.  I am not in any way shy nor am I to be unpersuaded about how we can move from where we are at the moment as a result of the Abbeylara judgment.  However, I believe it will require very careful consideration in order to meet constitutional proprieties.  I believe in accountability and as the Deputy has said we do not want lynch mobs.  In the white heat of political controversy here I have seen attempts in this Chamber to organise a lynch mob which had to be stopped by people going to the courts to ensure it did not proceed.  At that time many in the House suggested that was a very fair and proper way to proceed.The point I am making is that having a judicial system that provides for recourse for individuals to ensure procedures are fair and consistent with the principles of natural and constitutional justice is an important protection both in terms of how we operate our procedures and for those who would be adversely affected in an unjust way or for individuals who might be brought before committees.  I agree and would like to find a way through.  However, it is not as simple as saying that because we have the Abbeylara judgment we should introduce a constitutional amendment that dismisses the rationale behind that decision and proceed from there.  I do not believe that would bring about just or fair operations either.  It is not a question of me not being open to listen to how we can proceed.  However, certain constitutional protections and proprieties need to be factored in.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	82	Will the Government deal with the issue?
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	83	I presume the Taoiseach is aware that the Supreme Court judgment in the Abbeylara case, from my recollection, was delivered very early in 2002.  What consideration has the Government given to date to the constitutional amendment that is required to address that judgment in a manner that would empower committees of this House to operate in the public interest and in a manner that respects constitutional rights?  Would the Taoiseach not acknowledge that if there is to be accountability in public affairs, Oireachtas committees examining issues of public expenditure, the application of Government policy or the approach taken by State or semi-State bodies can only address issues where things go wrong by ultimately determining why they went wrong, where the decision-making process was flawed and in some instances by identifying who was responsible or accountable for the wrong decisions made?  The Abbeylara judgment at present makes it impossible for committees to do the final act which is to determine who, if anybody, was accountable.  As there is a public interest to ensure accountability, there is absolutely no reason a reasonable amendment to the Constitution could not be proposed that empowers Oireachtas committees but at the same time requires them to observe basic principles of constitutional and natural justice.On the other issues that have been raised today, the first report of the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children that was published in September 2008 emphasised the urgency of addressing the issue of vetting because of the large number of children in the State who have been victims of sexual abuse.  Such cases are still going through our courts.  For example, in recent times yet another swimming coach was convicted and sentenced for the sexual abuse of children.  That all-party report asked the Government to publish the legislation by the end of 2008.  The Taoiseach has told the House that heads of a Bill have not even been submitted to Cabinet despite the Minister of State with responsibility for children and youth affairs engaging in some self-promotion in December whereby the media announced that heads of a Bill would be considered by Cabinet in December 2009.  As a consequence of everything we have learnt, read, seen and understood about sexual abuse, we have a very profound obligation to children to fast-track this legislation, bring it through the House and have it enacted before the summer to ensure we have vetting procedures in place of a standard that reflects those in other countries to ensure children are protected from sexual predators.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	85	It is a year and a half late.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	86	The Deputy is entitled to criticise if he wishes.  I am here to give him the information in Question Time as to what is the position and what is the disposition of the Minister of State.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	87	An all-party committee asked for that legislation to be prioritised.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	88	I am aware of that.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	91	On the other matter, as I have said the programme for Government made no commitment to introduce a constitutional amendment to overturn, modify or change the Abbeylara decision.  In the course of the discussion we have been having on the question, which was a related question that Deputy Allen asked, I gave my personal views on the matter as to what is my disposition.  It would require further work on everyone's part to bring forward proposals.  However, I am not committing the Government, if a constitutional amendment is required, to having that constitutional amendment.  I am simply having a discussion based on the questions raised by Deputy Allen.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	92	Would the Taoiseach agree that committees, including the Committee of Public Accounts, are badly hindered in their attempts to do the work they are appointed to do at the moment?  Hindered is a mild word to use.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	93	Deputy Allen, please.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	94	I would make this point about perhaps not just the Committee of Public Accounts or other committees, but committees of the House.  The effectiveness of committees in respect of acting within their remit, whatever it may be now or in the future, is greatly helped by the avoidance of political partisanship on those committees.  If there were confidence among everyone in the House that when matters arise they are not simply used for the purpose of attacking Government, as has been the case in a whole range of issues——
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	95	Such as?

I am talking about people engaging in partisan political behaviour on committees, which greatly militates against their effectiveness.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	101	The Taoiseach's party has a majority on every committee.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	102	I have been in the House long enough to recall that it was in the absence of partisanship, particularly on those major committees we are talking about, in the past that people worked very well.  They did a good public service but were able to do so without the political point scoring that goes on.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	103	Deputy Allen has had a very good innings on this issue and can revisit the matter at a different time.  I call Deputy O'Sullivan.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	104	All reports from my committee are unanimous.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	105	I refer to two issues.  In an effort to be constructive on the matter just discussed, are the Taoiseach and the Government willing to work constructively with all parties in this House, within the terms of the Abbeylara judgment and in advance of what may or may not be an constitutional referendum, to enable Houses of the Oireachtas committees to do as much as they possibly can within the law and the Constitution in terms of investigative procedures?  I was on the committee regarding the Judge Curtin case, which was held behind closed doors.  However, there was a mechanism used in that case whereby a legal team asked questions on behalf of the committee and that was effective in allowing certain things to be done that might not otherwise have been done by Members putting questions directly.  That is just one example.  I seek an assurance from the Taoiseach that the Government will work with all parties to extend, in so far as possible, the ability of Oireachtas committees to probe into matters of public importance.  There are very significant matters of public importance that must be probed by this House if we are to do our duty as Members.I refer to Article 41.2 of the Constitution and the proposed amendment on parents in the home.  I was a member of the Joint Committee on the Constitution in the previous Dáil that made that recommendation and a further series of recommendations in respect of the family, not all of which require constitutional change.  Will the Taoiseach indicate if the Government will re-examine those recommendations?  I realise he is waiting for a third report on family law and so on but certain children are at risk of sexual abuse, including the children referred to in the vetting legislation.  I urge that issue be moved forward as quickly as possible.There are other categories of children to be considered, such as children in foster care or whose parents do not live together and who have great difficulty getting access to their fathers.  For specific groups of children there are a number of areas that can be advanced without a constitutional referendum.  Will the Government commit to whatever actions should be taken in these areas?  I refer to soft information and vetting, a matter that has been around for ten or more years and that has moved from one Department to another.  Will legislation be brought forward in this area as a matter of urgency?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	106	I already answered that question earlier.  It is being prepared and proceeded with.  As people are aware, it is a complex area, but regardless of its complexity I accept it is important legislation and it is being pursued as quickly as possible.I refer to the earlier question on the Oireachtas committees.  There are things to be done and matters to be investigated by people other than those on Oireachtas committees.  Oireachtas committees are not a panacea for every problem.  However, there is a point to be made about how we can make them more effective.  I have indicated that regardless of any other powers they require, it would be beneficial if everyone approached committees and membership of committees in the interests of avoiding what can often descend into party political bickering or defending positions one way or the other and getting away from the merits of the case.  That takes away from the effectiveness of committees and their standing in the public eye, at home and internally.  I acknowledge a lot of good work is done by committees and I am in favour of effective accountability, whereby we are seen to do our job and rise above some of the party political positions that, often, we must take for other reasons related to other matters.I refer to the other recommendations in respect of children's issues generally.  They are part of the brief of and the reason for having brought forward the Minister of State with responsibility for children.  The introduction of the Office for the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs has been an effective means of bringing focus to these issues, a joined-up approach and cross-departmental responsibility where children are affected.  It has been a means of giving greater profile to these important issues and areas.

#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	108	I wish to seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 32 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the rise in unemployment among young people under the age of 25 years during the past two years, from 10% to 31% with an expected further rise this year.  Extra re-training, assistance and facilities should be made available to enable young people to be ready for the jobs market when the economy picks up.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	109	Having considered the matter raised, I do not consider it to be in order under Standing Order 32.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	110	The Order of Business today shall be No. 4, Finance Bill 2010 — Second Stage (resumed).  It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the Dáil shall sit later than 8.30 p.m. tonight and business shall be interrupted not later than 10 p.m.  The resumed Second Stage of No. 4 shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 10 p.m.  Private Members' business shall be No. 76, motion re remuneration of public servants (resumed), to conclude at 8.30 p.m. tonight, if not previously concluded.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	111	There are two proposals to be put to the House.  Is the proposal that the Dáil shall sit later than 8.30 p.m. agreed to?

The Sinn Féin party will not agree to the Order of Business offered by the Government today unless we get an indication or commitment that there will be an opportunity to properly address the disgraceful decision of the Bank of Scotland (Ireland) in respect of the Halifax network of branches and their presence throughout the economy.  Some 750 workers are being thrown on the dole queue, something about which the Government has known and that had been signalled for upwards of 12 months.  We seek an opportunity to have the matter substantively addressed in this Chamber.The Ministers for Finance and Enterprise, Trade and Employment should come in and give us an account of their stewardship, what efforts, engagement and action they propose — even in a last ditch effort — to try to stymy the full effects of this very serious announcement.  Will this be committed to here this week?  This is what we are calling for.  It is a matter of such importance.  We were told there would be a new, almost social, conscience on the part of financial institutions in the advent of the bank rescue scheme and NAMA, albeit this particular institution is not covered by either of these.  Nevertheless, we cannot endure a situation where 750 workers will be just dumped on the pavement as a result of a decision taken outside this jurisdiction and imposed here.  There are political aspects of this matter which must be engaged directly with the British Government and Exchequer and the whole situation in respect of Bank of Scotland (Ireland) and the Halifax presence here over several years.  I am sure it would be a very useful engagement with the Minister.

Since the debate on the Finance Bill was arranged, circumstances have changed dramatically.

It is a courtesy to which we are entitled.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	118	I have put the Order of Business to the House to be accepted.  The Deputy has indicated he wants to raise issues.  During Second Stage of the Finance Bill, he will have plenty of opportunity to raise them or any other matters.  The Whips are to meet this evening to order business later this week or the following week.  I cannot be any more helpful than that.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	119	The Taoiseach could schedule or indicate his intention to consider scheduling a special opportunity to address this very serious matter in the House, with both relevant Ministers present to take questions from Members.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	120	The Deputy is aware that there are procedures quite apart from the Order of Business to allow for that to happen, including private notice questions.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	121	Is the proposal for dealing with No. 4, Second Stage of the Finance Bill 2010, agreed to?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	122	It is not agreed to, not only because there is a guillotine involved, as the Taoiseach and Chief Whip well know.  There are so many Members who want to speak on the Bill that it is unrealistic to propose closing the debate at 10 p.m.  This is a time of great economic difficulty for many people.  We need to focus on the possibilities and proposals in the Finance Bill that can help the Government to put forward strategies, ideas, incentives and opportunities for job creation and make it easier for employers to retain staff, change direction and have new lines.  We need to discuss a range of other options in the Bill that are so important to bolstering a very fragile and fractured economy.  For that reason, it is completely inappropriate to end Second Stage of the Finance Bill at 10 p.m.  Many speakers want to contribute and the very least the Taoiseach could do is lift the guillotine and allow for another day, at least, of Second Stage debate.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	123	We object to a guillotine being imposed on this legislation, which is probably the most important Bill to be considered by the Dáil so far this year.  The Bill has a number of features about which Deputies on all sides of the House want to talk, including the fact that the Minister is imposing VAT of 13.5% on service charges.  This will affect many people.  The Minister is doing the same with regard to tolls and his decision will affect people who go for a swim in a council-owned swimming pool.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	126	We were aware of it before that.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	128	The Ceann Comhairle allowed his colleague from the north east to speak without interruption.  I expect the same courtesy to be extended to me.There is a need for detailed discussion on the change in the employment situation in Bank of Scotland (Ireland).  There are proposals in the Finance Bill on NAMA and banking and the Minister for Finance, in his statement, made a number of assertive claims about how he is to sort out the bank situation at a time when there is no credit for small and medium business.  Members on all sides of the House are entitled to talk about the needs of their constituents and about small and big businesses in every town and village that need to obtain credit, retain employment and generate new employment, yet the Government wants to shut down debate.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	129	If we get the Order of Business disposed of, all those points can be made later during the debate.

It is absolutely unacceptable that such a proposition is put before us in the context of the current grave economic climate and with the measures contained in the Bill in the offing.  Bearing in mind that the Ceann Comhairle did not accommodate my objection to the first item on the Order Paper in the context of bank bailouts, it is imperative that there not be a guillotine.  We are witnessing yet another aspect of the Government's failure to have a strategy for job retention and creation in that a further 750 jobs are being dumped on the dole heap as a result of a decision by a banking institution, which institution should at least be reflecting some of the alleged changed environment that is supposed to exist.  This bank is showing the same attitude that has applied heretofore.  It is riding roughshod over, having no regard for and showing no concern for ordinary employees.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	131	We need to move on with the Order of Business.  Those points have been made several times this morning.

We are proceeding with Second Stage tonight and calling it to a halt.  There will be plenty of opportunity for Members to contribute to the various Stages of this Bill during its enactment, as is always the case during the consideration of the Finance Bill.  For that reason, it is important that the Order of Business be as it is.

At the committee he stated the contract signed by Dublin City Council for the construction of the incinerator in Ringsend was in compliance with Government policy.  The statement issued yesterday by the Government was to clarify this.  As I read the statement, it does no such thing.  First, it has no reference to the incinerator——

It states Government policy on waste management is in the programme for Government and that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, has the Government's full support in implementing it.  It also states there will be a levy on incineration in legislation to appear in the future.  What is not clarified — what I understand was the purpose of this statement and what the Minister, Deputy Gormley, was seeking to have established — is the status of Government policy at the time the contract was signed by Dublin City Council for the incinerator at Poolbeg.

There were statements about the report in the House last Thursday.  The Ombudsman has asked the Oireachtas to reach a conclusion on the matter, which is why she referred the report to it.  I wrote to the Taoiseach on Friday suggesting the report should be referred to the appropriate Oireachtas committee.  Has he considered my letter yet and, if so, what is his response to it?

That association has been in dialogue with the Department of Health and Children and the State Claims Agency for over two years.  As there are fewer than 40 survivors, will the Minister ensure the matter is brought to a conclusion in the interest of ordinary decency?  These people, to whom the State owes a degree of responsibility, should be treated with respect and promptness.  They have been left for far too long without a decent response from the Government.

The original settlement regarding these matters was made back in the 1970s.  The Minister is awaiting a report from the State Claims Agency, which is expected this month.  The Minister has asked the State Claims Agency to examine the Irish Thalidomide Association's claims and to assess them in the context of Irish and international provisions for victims of thalidomide and Irish case law and precedent, and to advise her.  Any proposal which comes out of that process will be considered by Government at that point.

While it is a serious disability, we have ensured that, in comparable terms, Ireland has not been at the back of the queue in that respect.  However, the claims being made by the thalidomide association now include an additional lump sum and increased monthly payments, retrospection and additional supports.  It is in that context that the Minister is expecting a report from the State Claims Agency, based on the criteria I have set out.  They are important criteria in terms of making a proper assessment in the matter.

When will the health information Bill to allow people access to their records come before the Dáil?  I am glad the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, has waited for the reply to the question.When will the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 be implemented to allow tenants in local authority flat complexes and maisonettes to purchase their own properties.  We passed the Bill, but it has not yet been implemented by the local authorities.  When will that be implemented and when will the health information Bill come before the Dáil?

I can only deal with legislation that is yet to be enacted.  If there is legislation enacted and there is a problem, a parliamentary question is probably the best way of getting accurate information.  On the other matter the Deputy raised, it will be the end of the year.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20786	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	283	As the Taoiseach will be aware, the Government has a legislative group working on new legislation to protect people in debt difficulties.  Would the Taoiseach consider extending a moratorium while this policy work is ongoing on repossessions and, specifically, whether that would apply to Halifax Bank of Scotland, HBOS, mortgage holders who are particularly exposed in the current situation?While I am at it, credit card holders have been abruptly told by HBOS that they must clear their accounts by May.  Here again, some provision to provide reasonable consumer protection in this transition would be appropriate.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	284	I understand there has been a statement from the Financial Regulator today that Bank of Scotland has informed the Financial Regulator of its commercial intention to close the Halifax retail banking business and the Bank of Scotland (Ireland) intermediary business in the Republic of Ireland, commencing at the end of May.  The Financial Regulator is working with Bank of Scotland (Ireland) to ensure that customers' interests are protected in accordance with the consumer protection code and as required by the code, all customers will be given three months notice of branch closures.  Mortgages, personal loans and fixed-rate savings with the bank will operate to maturity.  Bank of Scotland (Ireland) has advised that customers do not need to do anything at this stage, the bank's commercial banking and corporate banking operations are unaffected by the development, and Bank of Scotland (Ireland) will begin writing to all customers by the end of February to set out how the changes will affect them and to explain the next steps that they may need to take.The implications will vary depending on the type of account or product consumers may hold and we recommend that consumers read what the Financial Regulator states, that they look at those details very carefully.  The Bank of Scotland has also established various customer contact points which are listed at branches.  The Financial Regulator is taking up his responsibility in ensuring that consumers' interests are protected in the context of the announcement made yesterday.

Will the Taoiseach or the Minister for Health and Children give me and concerned parents a date for the publication of this very important Bill?  The Minister acknowledged more than 12 months ago that legislation would be forthcoming in 2009.  It has not come to hand yet.

Will the Taoiseach share with the House some further information on this legislation?  It is reported extensively in the newspapers today that the new directly elected mayor of Dublin will receive a salary of €200,000 per annum.  Will the Taoiseach confirm that?  Presumably, extensive expenses will be incurred in addition to that.  That seems somewhat offensive in the current climate.

Is it envisaged at any point in the future, or via this legislation, that the Government will introduce directly elected mayors for other cities?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	298	I refer to the programme for Government which makes reference to enacting legislation for a directly elected mayor of Dublin in 2010.  As I said in response to Deputy Gilmore when he asked about it yesterday, heads of a Bill were approved by Government yesterday.  No decisions on remuneration have been made at this point.  When the Bill is prepared, it will be published and debated.  In the meantime, Deputy Gilmore and others will I am sure be able to consult with people about what stage the Bill is at.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	299	I wish to ask about two related Bills.  The first concerns the Cabinet sub-committee, which I understand has met twice, most recently in 2009, and which is considering issues around reform of human rights and the Air Navigation Acts 1978 and 1988.  Legislation was promised.Related to that is the biological weapons Bill, which will prohibit the use, development, production, manufacture, possession, stockpiling and so forth of biological weapons.  I mention this because the biological weapons Bill, as described, would not prohibit the transmission of biological weapons through Irish airspace.  It would be confined in its prohibition to companies registered in Ireland, members of the Defence Forces and so on.To be positive, a great deal of effort went into the cluster munitions legislation in a bipartisan way and before that, into the landmines legislation.

#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	301	Recent reports from Iraq show that babies are being born with immense genetic deformities.  There is evidence of the use of biological weapons in practically every other major conflict, so this legislation is urgent.  It is very important that we not only prohibit any work in this regard but also, as a country interested in international law, that we bring forward the legislation dealing with Shannon and ensure such weapons are prohibited there as well.  When will we see the legislation from the Cabinet sub-committee and the biological weapons Bill?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	302	The heads of the biological weapons Bill were approved this week.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	304	Work will proceed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs on bringing forward the Bill in full.  The issues the Deputy raised are probably best left for discussion with the Minister as he prepares the scope of the Bill, or for Second Stage when it is published.  I understand the other one will be later this year.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	308	What is the current situation in regard to the long-promised legislation dealing with management companies?  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform circulated a two page letter which highlighted all the difficulties he has identified and all the different parties he has consulted, including builders and developers.  It looks as if the prospect of getting this legislation in the lifetime of this Dáil is fading away.In my constituency and in many others, tens of thousands of people, in particular young people, in negative equity are——

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	314	It is really difficult.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform circulated a two page letter but it is a letter of despair because it seems to indicate that no resolution of this really pressing issue will be forthcoming while he is Minister.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	315	Given the amount of interest articulated in the House on a constant basis in regard to this matter, the purpose of the correspondence was to bring people up to date as to what issues are being addressed.  The purpose of the correspondence was to update Deputies in far greater detail than I would be able to give on the Order of Business on what exactly are the issues being addressed and considered.I would like to see the legislation published and enacted as quickly as possible but it is being dealt with by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and it is a matter of priority.  Unfortunately, because there are so many issues involved in terms of getting a coherent legislative outcome, it is complex and difficult to finalise.  It is not a question of the Government being indifferent on the matter.  We are proceeding with this issue as quickly as is possible.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	316	I thank the Taoiseach for the reply.

#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	322	Any queries on the Order of Business must be about promised legislation not a serious elaboration thereon.
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	323	Second Stage of that legislation went through the Seanad.  Suddenly, there was a new Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, all hell broke loose and the Bill was no good anymore.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	324	Deputy——

#TerenceFlanagan	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-party	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-dob	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	326	On the new Central Bank Bill, are there plans to publish it in draft format, similar to the NAMA Bill, so there can be full and proper public consultation and so the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service will have an opportunity to hear presentations from interested parties?  It would be in line with the Government's White Paper on better regulation to publish the Bill in draft format.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	327	I am not aware that is the case.  I understand the first Bill would be introduced in the normal way.  There are two Bills being brought forward to deal with the proposed regulatory changes which the Minister for Finance has in mind.  The work has been divided in that way in order that we can progress with the first Bill at, I understand, Easter.  The Minister has indicated the timeframe and thereafter the second Bill will come forward.  If the Deputy wants to make suggestions to the Minister regarding how it is to be presented, he could table a parliamentary question or a direct discussion with the Minister might bear fruit.

I wonder if the Government is aware of the consequences of its actions, including slashing social welfare, on very poor and low income families.  The Government should have focused on the real economy.  A stimulus package should have been introduced.  Jobs are not going to create themselves; entrepreneurs need some assistance to get the show back on the road.  The Government has been completely lacking in that regard.From reading the newspapers in the past number of days one can see the level of job losses announced.  Halifax announced 750 job losses, some 130 of which are in my constituency, and a further 200 jobs are likely to be lost in the mid-Louth area in Bitech Engineering.  The Government is doing nothing about these job losses.  It is time that it recognised the cruelty of the fact that 20% of those on the live register are under 25 years of age.  Yet, there is no effort from the Government to get such people back to work.  In fact, they are being blocked from getting back to education.  I am sure other Deputies, like myself, have received a huge number of representations from people under 25 years of age who find there are serious obstacles put in their way in terms of trying to get back to education and training, which are not being provided for them.The Finance Bill should have completely overhauled the taxation system.  It has done virtually nothing.  There has been a little bit of tweaking, such as the €200,000 levy on tax exiles.  To a billionaire €200,000 is just pocket money — the levy could be three times its existing rate in order to have some impact on them.  While we should recognise it as a start, it does not go anywhere near far enough.  There are some 6,000 people currently registered with the Revenue Commissioners as tax exiles and the levy does not impact sufficiently on those people, many of whom are extremely wealthy.  To many of us a levy of €200,000 is a substantial sum but to the people to which I referred it is a drop in the ocean.This is a cruel budget and Bill.  It will not solve the problem.  It does nothing to try to sort out the economic mess, which is most unfortunate because an opportunity has been lost.

#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	350	I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on this important Bill.  I wish it was more worthwhile and positive.  The Taoiseach remarked some time ago that we were over the worst, that things were looking up and that there were green shoots but, unfortunately, that was a bit premature.  When we see the major job loses of the last few days in Halifax and other areas, never mind in constituencies like mine where individual jobs are being lost on a daily basis, we must realise that significant stimulus is needed to ensure that jobs are retained and produced.The Minister for Finance, in his opening speech to this debate, advised that there was targeted support for enterprise but, unfortunately, it is extremely limited.  Only this week as a member of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly I visited the United Kingdom to be advised that it understood that our Government was examining what it had been doing in England, Wales, etc., to stimulate the economy and look for jobs but, unfortunately, if this is being examined by the Government there is no sign of it in the Finance Bill.  In his speech the Minister, Deputy Lenihan, said unless we sharpen our competitive edge we will be unable to return to a tried and tested strategy of export-led growth.  It is strange that his speech has that line, and yet the strategy is missing.We were promised that if we agreed to NAMA there would be major benefits to the banking system but, unfortunately, the reality on the ground in my area is that businesses and individuals, especially at farming level, have never been under so much pressure from the banks, not even in the 1980s.  It is unthinkable that the Government should hand over so many millions of taxpayer's hard-earned money without getting any assurance from the main banks that money would be made available for the necessary funding of ongoing businesses.During the recent meeting in London to which I referred we were told by senior Government officials there that they were introducing structures to ensure Government payments would be paid on time, not in a month or two months but in a few days.  It is something which we need to examine.  I am dealing with farmers on a daily basis as that is the background from which I come.  I am trying to get money which they were assured they would get last October.  They cannot get an answer as to why they have not been paid.  They have been told there are some difficulties with their applications.When their consultants tried to find out what those difficulties were they were told it was all right, it was being checked.  This is putting an impossible burden on many families.  I appreciate that the Minister of State spoke of the need to enhance the capabilities of Revenue.  The personnel in Revenue with whom I have dealt are among the better civil servants in the country.  They have moved a long way over the last number of years, often having to deal with very difficult situations.  I find them flexible in that they will co-operate with those who meet them and deal upfront with tax problems.  However, it is vital that those who are abusing the system are actually dealt with and made pay their fair share.The Finance Bill deals with some of the tax relief schemes which were questioned by the Commission on Taxation and verifies the situation regarding mortgage interest relief as introduced in the budget.  However, if some structures are not put in place for the many people who have lost their jobs and are now caught in negative equity with serious mortgage problems, this Government will have failed a large section of the community.  Putting in place the necessary funding to ensure that genuine people must not and should not lose their homes would be money well spent.I welcome sections in the Bill that will lead towards energy efficiency, such as the inclusion of equipment in buildings that will save energy.  Clearly, this is an area in which we can improve our carbon issues and at the same time save money.  Section 40 of the Bill is part of that process.  However, I am interested to note that different sections of the Bill from section 41 onwards will give additional relief and support to some financial areas.  The Minister for Finance stated he is confident that the measures will give tax benefits and improvements to foreign traders which in turn will improve the international business environment here and help to encourage the creation of high quality employment in the economy.  Obviously, I support any increase in employment in the country but I can assure the Minister of State this measure will have little or no benefit to the people I represent in counties Cavan and Monaghan as none of these businesses is being encouraged by the Government or the IDA towards the Border areas.  This is why it is so discouraging to see that little or no help was given to the agriculture or food industries for which counties Cavan and Monaghan are renowned.It is now over two years since the Government removed installation aid from young farmers in spite of the fact that it was one of the incentives used to encourage them into agriculture.  They were advised that if they got their green certificates they would be eligible to apply for installation aid and their parents or relations could apply for the EU farm retirement pension.  The pension scheme has been restored to a small number of people but unfortunately neither installation aid nor any other support has been given to young farmers who desperately want to remain in farming.  At this time no alternatives exist in rural Ireland.I welcome the break being given to people in the farming community who made a great effort and spent a lot of money in their efforts to comply with the nitrates directive.  The change in the taxation structure here is a welcome break from what was otherwise a very unfair system.The food industry has been and still is under pressure from the sterling-euro relationship, along with the high cost of production south of the Border which, of course, will be made worse as a result of the carbon taxes.  It is regrettable that the Fine Gael proposal to allow farm fuel to be removed from the negative charges was ignored.I welcome the fact that from 1 January the rate of VAT in the higher level was decreased to 21%.  Even more importantly, the UK has increased its VAT rate from 15% to 17.5%, resulting in much less of a differential in the two VAT areas.  However, it was a major blow that the lower rate of VAT was not reduced to 10% which would have been a major impetus to tourism and other industries that depend so much on being seen as value for money.In light of the recent breakthrough in Northern Ireland where, for the first time, the main parties seem to have sorted out their problems by direct discussion and negotiation, I believe it is important that the Government and its counterparts in the UK should look at the potential of cross-Border co-operation in tourism, agriculture and infrastructure in general.  The entire Border region has suffered from the 30 years of the Troubles in Northern Ireland.  There has been no inward investment and therefore no employment was created in areas such as counties Cavan, Monaghan, Leitrim and Donegal.  If inward investment is not available then the Government must look at ways in which small industry can survive and increase employment.  Unfortunately, there is nothing in this Bill to give such impetus.After in-depth discussion with small industries, Fine Gael came up with clear proposals which would allow industries to get sufficient finance to keep going and also give a breather to the lower paid in respect of PRSI.  Other people may have better ideas but we have gone past the time when these problems could be ignored.  The creation of jobs must be the first priority to get people off the social welfare treadmill and increase our exports to bring in much needed revenue.The Minister of State's speech emphasised the need to get employment going under the heading "Target Support for Enterprise".  This Bill does not give that support which is absolutely necessary.  If we are to get out of this recession we must get people back into jobs.  It is extremely disheartening to see families again having to say goodbye to their young people as they go to Australia, Canada and other places in the hope of finding a job.  This is causing severe hardship to many families.  Many of these young people are highly educated, at great cost to this country and to their families, but no stimulus has been provided in this Finance Bill when the opportunity was there to do so.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	351	I welcome the opportunity to share my time with Deputy Crawford and contribute to this debate.Ultimately, there are no real surprises in the Finance Bill which simply gives the Government carte blanche to implement its budgetary measures.  The reality is that public sector workers and people on social welfare bore the brunt of the budget.  Its most disappointing aspect was the failure to introduce any stimulus measures which would have helped to kick start recovery in the economy, as Deputy Crawford pointed out.  Yesterday the Governor of the Central Bank, Patrick Honohan, delivered a speech at Trinity College careers network centre where he warned that youth unemployment had jumped from less than 10% to over 31% in the past two years, much faster than the aggregate rate which went from 4.7% to 13.3 %”.I have examples of that in my constituency in County Clare, with which the Minister of State will be familiar.  The rise in unemployment among the under 25 age group is extremely worrying for the county's many young people.  Over the past two years the unemployment rate for this age group has grown by 137%, from 808 persons in January 2008 to 1,215 in January 2009.  These are warning signals in respect of youth employment.  The Government must deal with the situation and put in a stimulus package for these young people.  If not, they will become despondent or do what they are doing, namely, leaving these shores in their thousands.We have a very serious situation yet the Government is not introducing any stimulus measures to assist employers to sustain employment.  In addition, it appears that the Government is not going to take any action to address the serious decline in our tourism and aviation industries.  I know that Shannon Airport is very important to the Minister of State, who is from County Tipperary.  I am hugely disappointed that no transitional measure is included in this Bill to abolish the air travel tax which is crippling the economy and tourism all over the country but especially in the mid-west region.  County Clare is very dependent on Shannon Airport and any decline in passenger traffic at the airport has a very significant knock-on effect on the tourism industry.This tax has been a disaster.  When we see three airlines — Aer Lingus, Cityjet and Ryanair — plead with the Government to abolish it, something is seriously wrong.  The tax is costing us a significant amount and the number of tourists is reducing.  Passenger numbers are collapsing at Shannon Airport.  Some 3.6 million passengers went through the doors of the airport in 2007 and in 2008 the number reduced to 3.16 million.  The 2009 figure has yet to be published, but I understand it will be approximately 2.9 million.  It is expected the downward trend will continue in 2010.  Only last week, Ryanair announced that several of the destinations which were well supported from Shannon, such as Alicante, Faro, Barcelona and Lanzarote will move to other Irish airports.It is time that the Government called Michael O'Leary's bluff and abolished the tax.  We would see then whether he would bring back those services to our airports.  He plans to move the services to other Irish airports, but he will do the same again and remove them when it suits him.  The situation regarding the future of Aer Lingus in Shannon is also very uncertain.  I have heard no commitment from the new director general that Aer Lingus is in Shannon for the long haul.  It will be catastrophic for the region if these services go.  The Government cannot just tax its way out of the recession.  More innovative ideas are important as the recession deepens.  It must introduce a policy that works and admit it got it wrong with regard to this tax.It appears the Government's only solution to the current crisis is to place a further tax burden on people.  From 1 July 2010, local authority services will attract a VAT rate of 13.5% or 21% and hard pressed taxpayers will be faced with the prospect of paying extra money for waste collection and recycling services.  The cost of public car parks and toll charges will also rise.  The number of tolls on our roads continues to increase.  Consumers who pay for waste collection will be hit with a double whammy as tax relief is to be phased out from next year.  Many householders are already up to their eyes in debt and they will not be able to pay their bills.I welcome some of the provisions in the Bill, in particular, the crackdown on the illegal smuggling of cigarettes.  Customs and Excise made record confiscations in 2009, with some 215 million cigarettes worth €90 million confiscated in the first 11 months of last year.  One haul of 120 million was the largest seizure in the history of the European Union.  It is estimated that another 826 million illegal cigarettes are imported into this country, but these go undetected by Customs and Excise.  A ten-fold increase in the fine for people who are convicted of this crime, from €12,695 to €126,970, is welcome.  This should be a deterrent to criminals who cost the State a significant amount in lost revenue.  This increased fine is a step in the right direction.  We need more resources to be put into the Customs and Excise service if it is to be able to seize the significant amount of illegal cigarettes coming into the country.I would like to address the issue of the imposition of carbon tax on farm diesel.  Coming from a farming background, I am aware how much farmers use diesel.  Farm incomes collapsed by over 29% in 2009 and there were cuts in the various farm schemes.  Only half of the farmers in REPS 4 have received their payments to date, including the 376 farmers in County Clare.  Many farmers are now in a desperate state.  This is a time of year when they have no other income and many of them are under severe financial strain.  Now they face an 8.7% increase in the price of diesel, compared to an increase of 4.4% for road diesel.  This will put further pressure on farmers and agricultural contractors.  The Minister must review this decision.  The tax should only be imposed at the same rate which is being applied to road diesel.The extension of the research and development tax credit system contained in the Bill will do nothing for small and medium enterprises or large companies operating here in Ireland.  The changes in the Bill only cover companies operating in a corporate group structure.  There was a golden opportunity for the Government to show it was serious about rewarding innovation and new ideas, but it has failed the test again.Last week, we debated the mid-west task force report in the House. There is huge potential for energy and the development of renewable energy projects in the mid-west region, something I have pointed out on many occasions here.  We have the Ardnacrusha and Moneypoint power stations and the gas pipeline runs from Limerick to Galway and along the Shannon Estuary.  There is so much untapped potential.  Denis Brosnan and his team stated in the report that a compelling case could be presented, in conjunction with appropriate incentivisation to attract mobile international investment.  It is not just international investment we should target.  We should also reward small and medium enterprises that invest in research and development.The future lies in the development of an indigenous renewable energy sector.  It is for that reason I believe Deputy Simon Coveney's New ERA proposal merits a more in-depth response from the Government benches.  Under the Fine Gael plan, start-up funding would be provided for research and development, because we see the importance of the development of our smart economy and of positioning ourselves and supporting innovative ideas.  If we do not invest in the future, we will not see green shoots in our economy for some considerable time.Section 4 terminates the tax relief introduced by the former Taoiseach in the 1994 Finance Act for a benefit-in-kind tax exemption on employer provided art objects, which only benefited one individual.  This is welcome.  However, that exemption should never have been introduced as it is this type of cronyism that has led us into the current situation.  The Taoiseach hopes we will have a  soft landing, but the country has already crash landed.  The Finance Bill, as presented, offers little in terms of creative or innovative ideas.  It is another lost opportunity by the Government to lead us out of the recession.  This is to be regretted.

The fundamental issue over the past 18 months has been, whether we wish, within the supportive framework that eurozone membership provides us with, to undertake the necessary corrective action ourselves, allowing us discretion to decide how the burden is best distributed, or whether we let others simply dictate to us what we must do.In the case of the most recent budget, the adjustment fell almost entirely on the expenditure side, which is outside the ambit of the Finance Bill.  Anyone who studies the gap between nominal or gross pay on the one hand and net or take-home pay that falls within the tax net on the other will need little convincing that we have pretty well used up in the past 18 months any spare headway that may have existed.  There is a considerable gap at this stage between what employers must pay out and what employees receive in their hand which, if it were widened still further, could become a considerable disincentive to employment, as has long been the experience in some continental countries.  Calls for a higher rate of tax mostly focus on the larger headline salaries which exaggerate the scope for increased tax rates and levels rather than actual net pay.  It was striking to note in the table circulated last night by the Minister for Finance with his speech in Private Members' time that, with the exception of only some Secretaries General, the net salary of all other senior public servants  in the Civil Service — deputy secretaries, assistant secretaries and equivalent grades in local government and the HSE — is now well under €100,000.  The public, for the most part, does not realise this.  Protecting those on lower income levels, while they have not been untouched, has been the priority — notwithstanding a barrage of propaganda to the contrary — because they generally have the least margin for manoeuvre.Much of the language surrounding economic debate contains assumptions which bear little relationship to reality.  Outside of public sector employment, which grew roughly from 230,000 to 330,000 over the past decade, a number which now has to contract somewhat because it is more than we can afford, the Government does not create or provide jobs.  It can at best create the right framework for job creation.  We do not live in a command economy where government can summon up at will investment and jobs for places badly hit by unemployment.  It can promote areas, improve infrastructure, and provide retraining.  Capital expenditure, while still high, has to contract also to a level that is sustainable and that we can afford.  Incentives, often costly, have to be carefully chosen.  In the construction area, they contributed to over-capacity, for example, in the hotel industry.  Ministers for Finance in the future will have to turn a deaf ear to most of the pleas from developers for incentives.  I received representations recently on behalf of medical practitioners with regard to extra incentives to build private health centres.  I was totally unpersuaded by the argument on behalf of people who are considerably better remunerated than the average.  Normally profitable industries, wealthy people and politicians will have to get away from the "grants and incentives with everything" approach.  The call for a stimulus package almost inevitably involves higher levels of Government expenditure, much of which is likely to benefit other economies more than ours, or using up the reserves in the National Pensions Reserve Fund, or selling off and privatising assets in a depressed market.There are many in society at present who need help from the Government — there is no doubt about that.  However, the scope for additional help is extremely limited given the State's financial situation.  We have to make the most of the help available.  In the contributions today from the opposite benches, one gets no sense at all of the current financial situation.  It is simply a case of "why don't you reduce this and that tax and increase this and that subsidy".  A more hard-headed approach, realising the realities we are working under, would be helpful.

While, of course, this cannot be achieved or attempted to be achieved in one fell swoop, there is no benefit in unnecessary delay or in the image of a softly, softly, drawn-out approach which would allow us largely to continue business as usual, except that it would not because of the rapid impact of the negative confidence effects of such intentions.  However, limited tax changes relating to business that are not costly in net terms can assist in improving Ireland's competitiveness.  It is primarily improvements in competitiveness and a lowering of the high cost structures in our economy, including wage costs, public and private, that will enable us to recover more quickly.  In times like these, we have to ask ourselves which matters most in case of conflict, the maintenance of jobs or of pay and conditions.The international recession has seen a markedly reduced tolerance for tax havens and for countries whose bank secrecy rules provide a tax shelter for large incomes of citizens resident in neighbouring countries.  I have attended on behalf of this country several European and OECD meetings, the object of which has been to intensify pressure on countries not compliant with accepted international codes.  One of the results has been the extension of double taxation and tax information exchange agreements, which have been brought before the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service.  The attractiveness of Ireland as the headquarters of firms previously based on small islands has improved — Ireland, incidentally, despite what is often said, is a large island, the third largest in Europe.A greater level of tax compliance worldwide is also of benefit to this country.  As a relatively low tax country from a business point of view, our reputation must be carefully guarded.  This is the reason for the provision tightening up on transfer pricing.  At the same time, it is important to make it attractive for leading foreign executives to base themselves here for a few years; hence, the changes to the remittance system.  An innovative provision in the Finance Bill is the accommodation of Islamic finance, in recognition of our increased links with the Middle East.  There are also measures to improve the attractiveness of Ireland with regard to basing UCITS funds here.The North-South relationship in Ireland is a mixture of complementarity and competition.  The Finance Bill reduces our standard VAT rate by 0.5% while, in another move, the British Government has put its VAT rate back up again by 2.5%, thus virtually halving the gap.  There is certainly the possibility that a new British Government will narrow the gap further as a means of dealing with a deficit at least as large as ours.  Deputy Seymour Crawford referred to the British stimulus.  The British are only three months in advance of a general election and I suggest the Deputy observes their policy following the general election.

The reduction in excise duty on a wide range of alcohol diminishes somewhat the incentive to cross the Border to bring back large quantities of drink.  From a constituency point of view, I am always pleased to see a reduction in the excise duty on cider.Mortgage interest relief has been extended, primarily to assist those who may find themselves in negative equity.  It is, nonetheless, to be phased out in a few years' time.  It has long been recognised that, whatever about the psychological impact, the net financial benefit of mortgage interest relief to purchasers has been negligible, as the increased ability to pay has usually been more than absorbed in higher house prices.  In time, the sharp reduction in house prices will be of definite benefit to young new entrants to the market, and it at last sharply corrects the grossly immoral redistribution of wealth that occurred in recent years between generations, to the great detriment of younger people, by creating large windfalls for older people, who in many cases did not really need it.The carbon tax reinforces the message about the need to save energy, while there are incentives to insulate homes and to make greater use of public transport, in which investment is continuing.  While tax relief on service charges may have initially helped us to avail of publicly or privately provided waste services, that incentive should no longer be necessary and, arguably, with waivers in limited cases, the user should pay the full service cost of waste disposal.  There is a strong argument that most tax incentives, though not all, should be time-limited.Deputy Pat Breen raised the question of the travel tax, which was debated on a number of occasions in the House.  It raised €85 million in 2009 and is expected to raise €125 million this year.  It is strange that when a company like Ryanair or, for that matter, Aer Lingus, puts on extra charges for baggage and so on, and adds on many charges to the basic price, there is never a peep out of anybody.  The propaganda is directed entirely against the Government.  Perhaps if airlines were to reduce some of the charges they have piled on, it might assist travel.  The fact is the Government needs money.  While I appreciate and am concerned about Shannon, I do not believe it is the correct diagnosis to consider that the travel tax is the source of the problem.The scrappage scheme has provided a modest boost to the car industry, which has been very depressed over the past year.  Certain generous reliefs that are art-related have been curtailed so as to draw a larger contribution from people and companies better able to make it.  A number of measures contained in the Finance Bill are recommended by the Commission on Taxation.  In conclusion, overall, the Bill implements and underpins the budget but also contains measures which are in general designed to support and to raise economic activity and employment.
#PeterKellyFF	unknown-#PeterKellyFF-party	unknown-#PeterKellyFF-dob	unknown-#PeterKellyFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	359	The Finance Bill puts into effect many of the measures announced in budget 2010.  The Bill comes after what was has been a very difficult year for many people in this country.  Over the past 18 months, the Government has taken the unprecedented step of making budgetary adjustments of more than €8 billion.  This kind of adjustment is huge, and I am deeply aware that many people are feeling the pain.  The many people who have lost their jobs and their families are suffering, as are the thousands of public sector workers who have seen their take-home pay significantly reduced, along with their standard of living.  The reality is that we are borrowing over €400 million a week just to keep going.  Had we not made these budgetary adjustments, our deficit would have ballooned towards 20% of GDP, threatening our very survival.  While the Opposition may have different opinions in terms of what spending cuts it would implement and what tax raising measures it would introduce, it is in agreement that adjustments had to be made.  The Finance Bill is the next step in our approach, which has been to protect jobs, provide a functioning banking system and return this economy to growth.  It puts on a statutory footing the measures introduced in budget 2010.  The Bill, which is pro-business and pro-enterprise, has been welcomed by independent commentators as another step in the right direction.  It provides for a reduction in VAT and a reduction in excise duty on beer, wine and spirits.  This comes at the time when the standard rate of VAT in the UK has risen by 2.5%.According to the EU Commission, unit labour costs in Ireland fell by approximately 2% last year and rose by 4% in the UK, which translates to a 6% swing in relative labour costs.  At the same time, the consumer price index shows that prices here are falling more rapidly than in Northern Ireland, the UK and the EU as a whole.  The value of sterling vis-á-vis the euro plays a role in attracting shoppers across the Border.  It is my hope that the measures announced in the budget will encourage people to shop local and will impact on our exports.  I am sure people will rally round and shop local when they know they can get value for money.The issue of negative equity is a very real one for many young families.  It is one of great concern to many of my constituents in Longford-Westmeath.  The extension of mortgage interest relief to 2010 is particularly welcome.  The measures in regard to the car scrappage scheme are also welcome.  The industry has been badly hit during the past two years and it is estimated that the scrappage scheme will protect 2,000 jobs in the sector.  The Bill reiterates our commitment to a 12.5% rate of corporation tax, which is hugely important and has been welcomed by many financial commentators and experts.  The tax exemption on the income and gains of new start-ups is being extended to companies that commence trading this year.The Bill includes incentives to attract skilled workers to Ireland, which is vital if we are to continue to develop the smart economy and attract the brightest and best from home and abroad.  The significant incentives in relation to research and development and the intellectual property environment introduced during the past two years are retained and enhanced.  Ms Olivia Lynch of the Irish Taxation Institute stated in an interesting article in The Sunday Business Post  that if Ireland is to get its economy back on track, we will need strong indigenous companies that are focused on export markets.  She also pointed out that research and development does not just mean laboratories and white coats.  Real innovation and research can be conducted in other areas, including engineering and financial services.  Ms Lynch quoted a recent KPMG survey of 100 business leaders which showed that 86% of companies in Ireland were not participating in the research and development tax credit scheme because they did not believe they were conducting research and development or that the regime was relevant to them.  It appears that many Irish companies conducting research and development are not aware that they might be eligible for assistance.  Perhaps there is work to do in terms of publicising what is available.A report published late last year by the high level action group on green enterprise identified the potential to create 80,000 jobs through tapping into the €700 billion global environmental goods and services market.  Some 15,000 jobs have been created in this sector to date.  This year, €130 million is being provided for energy efficiency programmes and the national insulation programme will be extended to include an additional €50 million for a national retrofit programme, creating an estimated 5,000 jobs in 2010.The Opposition's criticisms of the Bill are not shared by independent commentators at home and abroad.  The American Chamber of Commerce, which represents the 600 US companies employing in the region of 100,000 people in Ireland, broadly welcomed the measures in the Finance Bill 2010.  It was stated in an article in The Economist  of 4 February that Ireland is small but its Government has shown itself willing to take unpopular decisions to right its public finances. The Irish economy is more flexible, thus its medium-term prospects seem brighter.  The economy grew slightly in the third quarter of last year and there are signs that tax revenues are recovering.
#OlwynEnrightFG	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-party	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-dob	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	360	I wish to share time with Deputy O'Mahony.I welcome the opportunity to speak on this rather unambitious legislation.  I was amused to hear the Minister of State, Deputy Martin Mansergh, criticise the Opposition for commenting on issues which affect their constituencies given he had welcomed the measures in respect of relief on excise duty which will assist people in his constituency.  The Minister of State cannot have it both ways.My concern is that this legislation comprises a multitude of traps which will put further pressure on already crucified Irish households.  When speaking on last year's Finance Bill I described these households as "struggling".  This year, I genuinely believe many are way past struggling.  At a meeting last week of the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs, at which the Acting Chairman, Deputy O'Connor, was present and the issue of mortgage related debt was discussed, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Mary Hanafin, described members of the committee, myself included, as "alarmist".  I am alarmed.  Anyone with any idea of what is going on would be alarmed.  The alarm bells have been ringing and the Government has been given plenty of warning, but it has chosen to ignore them.People are in dire difficulty.  How can I, or any of my colleagues, not be alarmed when I must negotiate with a mortgage provider on behalf of a constituent who is so despairing that he wants to end his life?  That is the reality of the position in which people whose family homes are being repossessed are finding themselves.  The man concerned believed he had failed his family because their home was repossessed.  People are coming into our constituency offices to discuss the financial mess they are in, many of whom were self-employed and are now not entitled to anything owing to the class of stamp they paid.  The reality of what we are dealing with on a day to day basis does alarm me.The Finance Bill 2010 fails to do anything to help people.  While, as Deputy Kelly mentioned, it contains a proposal to extend mortgage interest relief, one can only obtain that relief if one is earning an income on which one pays tax in the first instance.  Unfortunately, hundreds of thousands of people are not in that position, thousands of whom have mortgages.  The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources announced a few weeks ago, prior to the publication of this Bill, that this matter would be addressed in the Finance Bill 2010 but there is nothing in it which does so.  I am sure there were many experts, including financial experts, involved in drafting this Bill.  The Government has set up another group of experts to examine the issue of mortgage debt.  How much advice does the Government need?  This issue has been considered by FLAC, the Law Reform Commission and the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs, and various people in the financial services area have submitted papers on it.  In the meantime, while all this is happening, the Minister of State has set up another group.  Thousands of families and home-owners go further down the spiral of debt and are closer to losing their homes, but they must wait longer for a solution.  While they are waiting their homes become less valuable, their debts rise, and their credit rating is permanently damaged.  Now they face a myriad of extra taxes and charges on top of pay cuts and levies.  People expected some level of pay cuts and tax changes, but the way in which the Minister of State has gone about it is desperately unfair.  The notion that certain people within the public service will take a smaller percentage cut than all lower grades sticks in people's throats.  It makes it impossible for them not to be utterly disillusioned and frustrated.The Minister of State has asked Fine Gael for alternatives, but when they are produced he does not listen to them.  He does not want to know.  He wants us to produce them for the sake of the exercise, but they are not examined.  No doubt several speakers on the Government benches will say "Fine Gael never provided alternatives", but we did.  They should read what Deputy Richard Bruton had to say yesterday on the Finance Bill and even before the budget was published.  There were fairer alternatives.  Last week, I saw one Fianna Fáil backbencher come into a committee and after all the Opposition speakers had made their contributions, he accused us of not providing alternatives.  He was not even there to hear the alternatives we had put forward, which makes a mockery of the exercise we were going through.Fine Gael does not apologise for wanting to protect those on incomes under €30,000 from paycuts because we see how impossible it is for them to survive at present.  Yet the Government looks at performance-related pay as part of a basic package, rather than as an exceptional payment for working harder, smarter, better and being exceptional.  Maybe those who are not going to take the same level of paycuts will not notice the removal of tax relief from bin charges or raising VAT on local authority charges, but hundreds of thousands of others will.  Where has the green influence gone that we were supposed to get?  It is all about money now and the Greens are happy because on paper they think they have an influence.  In reality, however, every household will pay more for refuse collection, coal, briquettes, home heating oil and, let us face it, soon for water.  The purpose of these carbon or green taxes is supposed to change our behaviour and teach us to reduce consumption.  It is supposed to make us more conscious of the value of these scarce resources, but the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has fallen perfectly into Fianna Fáil's web of regarding these charges merely as a means of making money.  It is no longer about using less and changing behaviour.  In fact, many Government Deputies have spoken about the amounts of money they hope to raise through these taxes instead of the target being to reduce usage.  What is worse is that these charges will proportionately affect the worst off the most, taking far bigger portions of the household budgets of less well off people than those who are better off.  This is despite the fact that they cannot afford to make their homes more energy efficient because the grants have not gone far enough.Where is the overall plan in this Bill?  I often wonder about the level of communication Ministers have with each other, both in Cabinet and elsewhere.  We are in an employment crisis of huge proportions, yet there seems to be no co-ordination between Ministers to tackle it.  The Ministers for Social and Family Affairs, Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and Education and Science should work together constantly to co-ordinate solutions.  Instead, however, responsibilities are fragmented between Departments and there is no co-ordination.  Effectively, we need a Minister for work to get Ireland back to work.  That is where the concentration should be.  There is so much nonsense in the system that it makes it impractical.

At the end of the course he or she must sign off from FÁS and sign back on social welfare.  That process involves four different visits to various State agencies just to undertake a short course.  The person involved will receive the same payment — the methodology is nonsensical.Last year, the Tánaiste announced a work placement programme.  In January, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs released a statement telling us how great was this programme.  She congratulated IBEC on doing something similar.  Fair dues to IBEC for that, but as of end-December 2009 only 129 places in the 2,000-placement programme had been filled.  That scheme is not working, yet a Minister releases a statement saying how great it is based on those figures.  That is nonsense.The timing of FÁS courses is important.  They begin at 8.30 a.m., which immediately excludes a large proportion of people.  For example, one-parent families find it difficult to start at that time.  Why can such courses not start at 9 a.m. or 9.15 a.m. just after primary schools open?  Most of the jobs those people wish to be trained for also start at around 9 o'clock.  A bit of common sense is required.  Numbers attending social welfare offices are rising, yet the alternatives do not seem to exist.In the summer of 2008, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs announced a plan to tackle unemployment for the under-25s.  The result was that more people than ever in that category now find themselves unemployed.  What worked in the boom is not enough now.  The same old courses will not equip young people for a very different environment.  People who walked into jobs ten years ago now find themselves facing competition from hundreds of others who are attending interviews.  The unemployed include a new generation of people, many of whom have excellent qualifications.  A six-week FÁS course to retrain them will not cut it.Some schemes have been tweaked but we need a dramatically different approach.  We should examine the option of offering payment for retraining and second-chance education.  In County Offaly, one of the two counties I represent, there is one third-level institute, but there are only 50 PLC places for retraining.  That is the solution we are being given by the Government, despite the current numbers of people unemployed.  It is pathetic.The huge blow of the Halifax closure announced yesterday effectively means another empty shopfront on a main street in my constituency and others.  That will add to the number of shops, pubs and restaurants that have shut their doors in the past few months.  Many of them could not even wait for what they hoped would be a better Christmas period because their level of indebtedness was so high.  They cannot get any relief from financial institutions.  In small provincial towns and villages, they may be small employers but they are crucially important ones.  They need to be supported in the same manner as larger companies, but there is nothing in the Bill to achieve that.Government TDs are concerned with the importance of national and international commentators, but I would give them one word of warning.  The real commentators on what the Government is doing in this Bill will be the Irish people.  Their comments may not be quite so glowing.
#JohnOMahony	unknown-#JohnOMahony-party	unknown-#JohnOMahony-dob	unknown-#JohnOMahony-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	363	I am glad of the opportunity to contribute to this debate on the Finance Bill.  We are all in agreement that following the economic turmoil of the past 18 months in particular corrective measures needed to be taken.  In our opinion they should have been taken much sooner.  We are now reacting rather than being proactive.  There was also a definite acceptance among the general public that savings had to be made.  As long as they were rolled out and implemented fairly, the public was willing to accept some of the pain.  They will accept it if it is meted out in equal measure, but that did not happen with many of the provisions included in this Bill.  A prime example is cited in the Fine Gael Private Members' motion, to be debated later, whereby 600 of the highest paid public servants are being dealt with in a totally different manner from lower paid public service workers who are being crucified with levies and charges from all angles.  It is simply unfair, yet in yesterday's debate on the Bill the Minister for Finance suggested it was populist and begrudging to raise this issue.  I fail to see how anyone could agree with that statement.The Government's position on this matter is grossly unfair and indefensible.  It flies in the face of the assertion that those who earn more should pay more.  The expansion of numbers employed in the public service should be also noted.  In the past ten to 12 years, it expanded at a far greater percentage rate in the higher grades of principal and assistant principal officer, where numbers increased by 462% and 339%, respectively.

Allegations regarding corporate governance misconduct in Shannon Foynes Port Company first arose in 2006.  Throughout this controversy my predecessor and I were, as shareholders, kept informed by the company.  Our advice was that the matter was best left to the company to deal with internally.Regarding the Deloitte report, my legal advice is that I must respect the confidential basis on which the report was given to my Department.  The report contained a number of recommendations for improving corporate governance procedures in the company and the board has confirmed that these have been implemented.  Furthermore in September 2008, I appointed a new chairperson and five other directors to the board of the company to provide renewed leadership and strategic direction to the company.With regard to the memorandum referred to in the Deputy's question, access to most of the response I received from my Department was granted to the Deputy under the Freedom of Information Act.  Under the Freedom of Information Act, the Department is prohibited from releasing certain information, such as legal advice.As stated previously, I am aware that some matters relating to the company have been brought to the attention of both the Garda Síochána and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.I received letters making allegations which I brought to the attention of the Office of the Attorney General, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement and the Garda.

Copies of the newspaper [Limerick Leader] report, please.”The Deloitte report into this and other activities in the Shannon Foynes Port Company found that there was no competitive tendering in the sale of the site; there was no public auction; there was no proper valuation; and there was no record of board approval to enter negotiations.  We now know that a company bought that site, which was valued without proper valuation.  It was sold two and a half years later for €12 million.  There are serious and significant issues regarding corporate governance.  An internal memorandum within the organisation that has been brought to my attention states: "Koala (to the sounds of violins and heavenly Choirs) and hopefully this is teed up for you to make the kill."  The Koala site was 16.6 acres of land that was sold without due and proper process.  It is not acceptable that the Minister will not institute, as this request is, a departmental inquiry into what happened, why it happened and who benefited.  I do not accept the Minister's answer is adequate.

All of this went to the bodies that should investigate if there is wrongdoing, including, first, the board itself.  We have had a newly constituted board since September 2008.  The issues of alleged fraud and anything else are matters for the Garda.  Issues regarding corporate enforcement should be passed to the Director of Corporate Enforcement.  We have done all that and investigations, as I understand it, are not proceeding on the basis of any of the complaints that have been made.

The piece that is blacked out under the heading "Review of the two property transactions" is what I want to know.  What was written for the Minister?  What was his report?  What does he know that he is not telling us?The Minister is also aware that a boat was hired for two years by the company.  It was decided that an executive of the company would make the decision on the successful tender.  The file is missing and the successful tenderer was the official of the company who made the decision to give it to himself.  Is it not time for this to go a stage further and for the Minister, as the only shareholder in Shannon Foynes Port Company, to insist that all these files and all the information, which he has and some of which I have obtained recently, should go to the fraud squad?  Is not time to call in the Criminal Assets Bureau?  Some 16.6 acres of the most valuable land in Foynes harbour is gone and somebody made a killing on it.  It is not good enough that the Minister can pass it off.  He should be proactive in insisting that the Criminal Assets Bureau gets involved.

I have asked local authorities to provide details of exceptional road-related costs associated with the recent flooding and prolonged severe weather, which fall outside the normal financial provision for winter maintenance.  While some information is still outstanding, the total cost is likely to be only a fraction of the €1 billion referred to by the Deputy.  I will assess the returns from local authorities and take this into account when allocating the regional and local road grants for 2010.The figure of €730 million quoted by the Deputy appears to be taken from an NRA document outlining the allocations to local authorities for maintenance, operation and improvement of national roads during 2010.  Copies of the document were placed in the Oireachtas Library last week.  I would like to point out that the total funding available to the NRA for national road related work in 2010 is almost €1.16 billion, not €730 million.Turning to the national roads strategy post 2011, it has been necessary to review the investment priorities across all Departments because of the economic downturn.  My Department's Transport 21 priorities for national roads are the completion of the five major interurban motorways, the M50 upgrade and the progression of the Atlantic road corridor.  I will also be seeking to maintain the current level of funding for regional and local roads in the years ahead.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	376	While I accept the €1.1 billion as a total figure, did the Minister not slash the road maintenance figure by €325 million, or one third?  In this year of all years following the flooding and the big freeze the Minister has slashed the budget by one third.  The Minister has said he has requested a report from the local authorities.  When will he get that report?  Will he be informed, for example, how many kilometres of regional and local roads have been severely damaged?  In other words will he request a total audit of the road situation following the two natural disasters?  Would the Minister agree that local authorities are completely in the dark as to what will happen to the maintenance and repair of these roads?  It is not just a maintenance issue, as my Fine Gael colleague knows very well.  It is also a very serious road safety issue.  I remember receiving a call from my colleague Councillor Willie Quinn in Carlow from a crater in the middle of a major road outside Borris.  Along with 1,000 councillors throughout the country, he is deeply concerned about the state of the roads.  Has the Minister given a deadline to local authorities to go to work to supply the report?  What kind of extra funding will be provided?

We are working on the basis that they have done some type of audit themselves of the roads to arrive at the estimates they have given us.  We will work on that basis.I cannot accept that the local authorities are in the dark.  They know exactly what the situation is and——

That gives us a good basis for clarifying the situation relative to the €1 billion that was being touted by an economist on the radio some months back.  I hope his economic statistics are more accurate that his roads' figures.  We normally give the local authorities permission to spend the equivalent of 10% of the previous year's allocation in the first few months of the current year before they receive their formal allocation.  This year, however, we have allowed them, if they wish, to go as high as 25% of that allocation to deal with the emergency situation.

When will the Minister announce the budget for the regional roads?  The Minister will agree that he will be forever known as the "Minister for snow".  Since the catastrophe of the big freeze, has he made any changes to the protocols for clearing footpaths or estate roads?  Is there any procedure whereby the country can call a national emergency?  What is being done about that?Finally, regarding road safety and N17, for example, besides a small amount of funding the NRA has announced this year, when will the full works on that road be carried out in Galway and Mayo?  When will the Wexford road, the N11, and the Mayo road, the N5, be finished?  When will the Sligo road, the N4, be done?  The Minister says that 2010 will see the end of the national road building programme.  That is a desperate prospect for many commuters all over the country.  The Minister has failed a large part, if not all of the island, as the "Minister for snow".

As regards the national emergency element of the Deputy's question, there are very clear guidelines in relation to what has to happen and who is responsible in the national emergency plan.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	392	I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in relation to the national roads.  The construction, improvement and maintenance of individual national roads is a matter for the National Roads Authority.  Approximately €1.115 billion will be spent by the NRA on national roads in 2010 and the allocations to local authorities were recently published.The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is a function of road authorities under section 13 of the Roads Act 1993.  The selection, prioritisation and carrying out of works on these roads is a matter for the relevant local authority to be funded from its own resources supplemented by State road grants.When Exchequer grants for regional and local roads are allocated each year, my Department does not hold back a reserve allocation to deal with weather contingencies, as this would mean a reduction in the allocations made to all local authorities at the beginning of each year.  The allocations made to local authorities are inclusive of a weather risk factor.  They are expressly advised in the annual road grants circular letter that they should set aside contingency sums from their overall regional and local roads resources to finance necessary weather related works.I have asked local authorities to provide details of exceptional road related costs associated with the recent flooding and prolonged severe weather, which fall outside the normal financial provision for winter maintenance.  I will consider this information when deciding on the allocations, which I will announce shortly.  A key priority will be to safeguard the considerable investment in the road network over the past ten years and to carefully target resources to address on a prioritised basis the most urgently required repairs.

Regarding the roads, I realise the cold weather crisis is over, but the Minister and I are both realists, as well as coming from the same county.  We both travel to other counties and the damage to the roads over and above normal as a result of the weather conditions we have had is only now becoming evident.  No matter how it is done, in the current circumstances, whether through lack of funding or the bodies working on the ground, it is simply not good enough to say the allocations are in place and this what the local authorities can do.I know that I am slow in getting to my point, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.

We are now coming into the busiest part of the year for tourism and agriculture-related business, with people moving out of their houses.  The number of staff in the county councils has been cut by nearly a third relative to what they should be.  Does the Minister not believe it is time for him, along with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, to give the authority to county councils to hire people who are lying idle with their machines for a six-month period to repair all the roads at the one time?  I am hoping the Minister will provide the investment because the current arrangements amount to false economy.  Without the manpower it cannot be done.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	406	I will be providing almost €412 million to the local authorities for their roads programme.  I will also be giving them the flexibility to prioritise the roads that have been damaged.  We will not stick to the normal 13 or 14 headings in the funding.  Now that the local authorities have identified the roads that are damaged, we will ask them to prioritise and repair them.  This could mean other works which might not have been in the pipeline immediately will be done this year.  As this money is being allocated, I am asking the councils to address the concerns that have been expressed by Members of the House and their local public representatives to ensure that the roads which were damaged are repaired as quickly as possible.  There is no bar on local authorities either outsourcing or hiring contractors to do the work.  It must be addressed in the most effective and efficient manner.  No doubt, they will have to get value for money during the summer months, in particular, but they will be given maximum flexibility in that regard.
#ShaneMcEntee	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-party	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-dob	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	407	The figures show that the Minister is spending almost €500 million less but the damage involved is enormous.  Limerick City and County Councils are facing a bill of €2 million in relation to damages, while the figure for Carlow County Council is €7.5 million. The figure for our county is €2.4 million, while it is €2.5 million for Westmeath.  The Minister and other Deputies from County Meath along with those from every other country are aware that the available staff are being curtailed at the moment, regardless of any money the Minister allocates.  They cannot do overtime or take on extra help.  The Minister must give the go-ahead immediately to allow for the repair of all the roads at once and not curtail what we anticipate will be, hopefully, a better summer at home for our tourism trade.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	408	They way in which they go about this work is entirely up to the local authorities.  The grants we give are to supplement the local authority grants.  The local authorities should make the best possible use of the money, whatever that may be.  I do not intend to start micro-managing them.  There is a need to focus on the damaged roads which must be improved and which are important for economic activity and so on.Part of the reason why roads money has been reduced during the past couple of years is because of the economic circumstances in which we find ourselves.  A lesser national cake means a lesser portion of it for transport.  Notwithstanding that, local authorities must look within their resources to prioritise.  From the point of view of road safety and economic activity, road services are and should be priorities for the local authorities this year.  I call on them to try to ensure they maintain or increase the amount of money available for roads work this year.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	409	The European Transport Safety Council's document of January 2010 referred to by the Deputy is being examined in my Department.  Statutory responsibility for the application of special speed limits through the making of special speed limit by-laws is vested in the elected members of county councils and city councils.In 2005 statutory guidance was issued to local authorities on the setting of special speed limits in accordance with section 9 of the Road Traffic Act 2004.  These guidelines were revised and issued to local authorities again in December 2008.  They set out principles to guide local authorities in setting special speed limits and, under section 9 of the Road Traffic Act 2004, application by local authorities of the 30 km/h speed limit must be in accordance with the criteria set in the guidelines.In setting a speed limit, a local authority must assess various factors with the primary focus being on road safety.  It is, quite appropriately, a matter for the local authority to assess the various factors at play in setting a special speed limit, including compliance with the criteria set in the guidelines.  Any assessment of the impact of the new 30 km/h zone in Dublin city centre is a matter for the city council.  The Road Traffic (Signs) Regulations, 1997, as amended, provide for the specification for speed limit signage.  The traffic signs manual provides guidance to local authorities in respect of the erection of such signage.  I am satisfied with the provisions in respect of speed limit signage contained in these regulations and I have no plans to alter them.  Under section 95 of the Road Traffic Act 1961, it is a matter for each road authority to determine if and where a traffic sign is provided on the public roads in their area.Deputy Thomas P. Broughan I have been reading the Survey of Free Speed, sent to me by the Road Safety Authority.  Does the Minister accept that speed continues to be a major problem?  The survey states that 65% of articulated drivers were free speeding or in excess of the speed limit on local roads.  Some 60% of motorists were speeding in urban areas.  Almost 60% of buses were speeding on local and regional roads.  I refer to the collisions report for 2008 which I have in front of me and which the Minister has probably read.  It states some 54% of single vehicle fatal collisions are blamed on speeding.  Clearly, this is a major issue.When Dublin City Council passed the new 3 sq. km. 30 km/h speed limit, only three councillors voted against it from the 52 who voted.  Is it not a major problem that a 40 km/h speed limit was not introduced under the 2004 Act?  Is the lack of a 40 km/h limit not a major gap?  When I was the leader of the Labour Party in Dublin City Council, I sought a 25 mph default speed limit in estates and road near pedestrian areas.  I could not do it for the same reason.  A speed of 25 mph is equivalent to 40 km/h.  Does the Minister have any intention to introduce a 40 km/h speed limit in the road traffic Bill?I welcome warmly the new consultation process taking place on the operation of the 30 km/h speed limit.  Does the Minister accept the report mentioned in the question, that is, the European Transport Safety Council's report?  It states that "if a limit is not credible, drivers will be more inclined to choose their own speed".  Therefore, it is critical to have credible limits that will be obeyed.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	410	I agree with the Deputy that speed remains a major problem in respect of road safety.  It continues to contribute to an unacceptable level of deaths and accidents on the roads.  The faster people go, the more damage is done, whether in the level of fatalities or serious injuries.  I strongly support and endorse what the Deputy has stated in respect of tackling speed and the need to ensure speed limits are enforced.  This is why we always refer to drink-driving, seat belts and speed, a message with which started many years ago.  While there have been great improvements, as everyone has acknowledged, speed remains a major problem.I refer to the Deputy's remarks on speed limits.  I have no difficulty examining a loosening up of the regulations on speed limits, by-laws and so on.  That is not a problem.  I presume he is referring to the limits of 120 km/h, 100 km/h, 80 km/h, 60 km/h, 50 km/h and 30 km/h.  I am unsure whether it needs to be so rigid or whether there is a need to amend the Road Traffic Act.  It may be possible to make changes through the regulations and I will examine that possibility.Deputy Thomas P. Broughan I realise the UK Department for Transport has digital speed maps.  There is such a speed map for most cities and most localities in that country.  Has the Minister any intention of consider that system?  Obviously, there must be a roll-out of speed cameras as well.  I have been informed that the revised traffic signs manual has not been republished since the third quarter of 2006.  There has been no update for road signs.  Does the Minister agree that wherever one may be and on whatever road or street, a person driving should always know the speed limit?  This is not the case in Dublin city and most local authority areas throughout the country.  We should consider signage to be critically important.  A good driver will watch the road in front always.  Why not have more road-painted signs?  If this were the case and one were to enter Cork city, Dublin city or Wexford town, one would always know the default speed limit.  Many people pretend they do not know or are wilfully ignorant.

I am unsure why there are not more speed limits painted onto the roads.  It may be that it is not regarded as effective or whatever but it is a matter I can raise with the RSA.  I am supportive of anything that would make people more conscious of their speed or that would encourage them to reduce it, whether in an urban or rural area.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	412	In the case of commercial State bodies, the salary scales of chief executives are reviewed from time to time by the Minister for Finance and based on comparisons with posts in the private sector.  Salary ranges recommended through this system, known as the Hay rates, were last approved by Government in 2007, with a further general sanction by the Department of Finance for revised pay ranges with effect from 1 September 2008.  In some cases, chief executives are on non-Hay rates.  These are primarily cases where chief executives had been already on salaries higher than the Hay rates and opted not to move to a Hay contract.  Chief executives of non-commercial State companies and agencies come within the remit of the Review Body on Higher Remuneration and have been subject to the salary reductions provided for in the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act 2009.The Minister for Finance has indicated his concerns about top-level pay across the economy and has moved already in addressing this in the non-commercial sector.  He has also confirmed that he will carry out a review of the pay of chief executives of the commercial State companies, including the transport companies.  I understand he will be announcing proposals in this regard in the near future.I have asked my Department to provide the Deputy with the salary scales and ranges for the chief executives in tabular form.

When I asked the Minister the same question on that date, he told me to look at the annual reports.  The figures are not in the annual reports.  We need more accountability.  I welcome the fact that we are now at last to receive the figures.Will the Minister request that figures be provided regarding those who report to the chief executives at the highest level, that is, at board level or just below it?  We need more accountability from them.  The remuneration of the chief executive of Dublin Airport Authority in 2007, the last year for which figures are available, was almost €700,000 per annum.  I presume he was making some hay on that salary.  Has this salary remained the same?Is it the case that the pay cuts may not apply to chief executives subject to the pay rates described by the Minister?  Is this a fair question?  We need total transparency and accountability.Is the Minister pleased or unhappy to hear that while most harbour authorities have informed the Joint Committee on Transport of the salaries of their chief executives, Shannon Foynes Port Company refuses to provide it with the salaries of the chief executive and harbour master and other companies such as that in Cork will not tell us how much they are paying their executives.  State companies, particularly those in which the Minister is the main shareholder, and semi-State companies under his control that he subsidises and which report to him, must be absolutely accountable.

This is the actual pay rate.

The bonus for the chief executive of Dublin Airport Authority in 2007 was €167,000.  He also got fees of €17,000, pension contributions and other taxable benefits worth €181,000.  My interest is not prurient in that we need to know what chief executives of State or semi-State companies are paid.  I welcome the fact that we will.  We need to know a lot more about the salaries.  My interest is based on the lack of accountability of bodies under the remit of the Minister.  Some are not accountable.  Some companies do not report to the Comptroller and Auditor General, yet they spend an awful lot of money.Very serious questions are being asked about what is going on in CIE.  There are allegations of extremely serious fraud in the company, yet we received a letter today stating the auditors will not appear before the Joint Committee on Transport to be accountable for what is happening.  The problem is that we are spending a fortune subsidising State and semi-State companies.  They are not accountable at present in terms of their salaries and they remain unaccountable in terms of audits, reports of audits and secret audits that they will not tell us about but which show up abuse of public funds.

That is a totally false picture.  The only reason the commercial State companies are not within the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General is they act under company law.  They are fully audited and must be audited.  They are commercial and there are competition issues.

The audit report about which the Deputy is talking has been made available publicly, as has the Baker Tilly report on CIE.With regard to the question of prurient interest, Deputy O'Dowd is absolutely correct.  I apologise to him if he believes I was saying the salaries of chairpersons or chief executives of State bodies should not be made public.  They should be made public, as should the bonuses.  I have no difficulty with that.  My point related to people working in the offices, harbour masters and those on salary scales lower than those of chief executive officers.  One must balance a person's right to privacy with the public right to information.

The chairperson and eight ordinary members must be persons who, in the opinion of the Minister for Transport, have wide experience regarding transport, industrial, commercial, financial, land use planning or environmental matters, the organisation of workers or administration.On 1 December 2009, I appointed the following people to the new authority: Mr. John Fitzgerald, chairperson; Mr. Gerry Murphy, chief executive, ex officio; Mr. John Tierney, Dublin city manager, ex officio; Mr. Frank King, ordinary member; Ms. Linda Saunders, ordinary member; Mr. Damian Usher, ordinary member; and Dr. Berna Grist, ordinary member.  I am satisfied the members of the authority have wide experience in relevant areas.  It is my intention to fill the remaining vacancies on the authority at an early stage.  One of those vacancies is reserved for a senior National Transport Authority manager specified by the National Transport Authority chairperson with my consent.

Most of the Minister's appointees — I exclude civil servants and members of State companies such as those mentioned by him — are connected to Fianna Fáil.  He has appointed a plethora of Fianna Fáil henchmen throughout the country to bodies that give incomes of €12,600 or more.  The key point is the need for transparency and accountability.All the Minister's appointments should be subject to the consent of the Oireachtas Committee on Transport.  Appointees would not be asked by the committee whether they have ever been a member of Fianna Fáil, because that would be taken for granted in respect of many of them, but about their knowledge and experience of the business they are about to enter.  The Minister is not being accountable in a transparent way, as is the case with some other Ministers.  In fairness to the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, he has been much more transparent in putting nominations before committees or asking committees to make nominations.  This is better than drawing appointees from cumanna throughout the country.

I always approach appointments to a board in an open and transparent manner.  I try to find the best people possible and if they happen to be members of Fianna Fáil or Fianna Fáil supporters, I will not exclude them for that reason, no more than I would exclude them because they might be supporters or members of Fine Gael.  I do not inquire into their political allegiance.

In this case the Deputy should recall that I invited people to nominate themselves if they had an interest in this and I selected the people from the list of those who applied.  I will examine that list again before I fill the remaining positions and if there are suitable people on that list, I will appoint them.  If not, as the original list was for the DTA, I will try to find the most suitable people.

People could then wear their party colours if they wanted to.  In many countries the transport authority is so important it is elected.I address this question to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  I have had about 140 or 150 questions ruled out in the past year and a half which related to agencies such as the National Transport Authority.  The National Transport Authority is just up and running, the website has only recently been set up and immediately six or seven questions were ruled out.  Can anything be done about this kind of thing — not the events of recent days — brings Parliament into disrepute?

What is the current position?  The mayor was to be the chair of the transport authority, which was then extended to the whole nation.  Will it not be a farce if we do not give the mayor a major input into transport?Second, what is the current status of the National Transport Authority?  How many staff has it got currently?  I am aware the website is operating, its functions are set out, and Mr. Murphy invited Opposition spokespersons to a briefing, but to what extent is it up and running?  Has it taken over the functions of the Dublin Transportation Office or how much further has it gone?In that context, what is the current status of the taxi commission?  Has the taxi commission effectively been abolished, with the National Transport Authority now the regulator of taxis?

As the Deputy rightly said, the original Bill was for the Dublin transport authority and it covered only the greater Dublin region and had specific powers and functions regarding land use, transport, traffic management and so on.  We are devising a mechanism whereby all those powers that were contained within the DTA Bill will be contained within the National Transport Authority, and the mayor will head that particular part of the authority.  He or she will have a meaningful role in regard to transport.  It is important that he or she would have——

He or she will have very strong powers and will be able to head up regional authorities.  We must wait and see what happens.On the taxi regulator, the taxi regulator will be subsumed into the National Transport Authority.  Obviously, discussions have to take place from the point of view of industrial relations and so on but it will be subsumed some time over the course of the next year.

Will he not further agree that it is time to scrap that out of date, Tammany Hall system and move to a new system where nominations are announced in the newspapers and people who wish to apply would go before the transport committee or another committee with accountability to the Minister and the Department.  They would go through the names and appoint to that board the people who are best qualified.  I have seen fine people kicked off boards because they were not of the Minister's kin and colour, and that is not acceptable in modern Ireland.

That was a savage cut.  Is it not a fact that in the recent budget the Minister cut his allocation again by €325 million?  He is very close to over €425 million or €430 million in cuts in funding for roads which are falling apart throughout the country.  Does the Minister believe that is an acceptable amount of money, given the massive problems cause by the recent inclement and disastrous weather which has destroyed many roads in the Minister's constituency and mine, and many others throughout the country?

There is a gap of about €25 billion between what we are taking in and what we are spending.  Everybody on all sides of the House agreed that cuts had to be made.  There is no programme of Government that can be exempt from cuts in the current circumstances.  We cannot have it both ways.  The Deputies opposite cannot attack the Government because we are spending too much, the gap is too great and the deficit will never be closed while at the same time look for us to continually spend more money on various programmes.  We had €411 million this year for the regional and local roads.  We will allow maximum flexibility to the local authorities in terms of how they spend that.  They will be informed it is to be spent on road repairs.  There will be sufficient funding for the repairs outlined in their submissions.  However, the local authorities must make that decision and local authority members have to be answerable for it.

In recent years, Bus Éireann significantly expanded its network of services across the country.  However, the economic downturn has seen a marked drop in demand for public transport.This has resulted in Bus Éireann customer numbers falling by over 10% in 2009, which has impacted negatively on the company's revenues.  It means it can no longer afford to operate the same high level of services as it has previously.  In response to falling passenger numbers and revenue, Bus Éireann is implementing a wide-ranging cost recovery plan to ensure the financial viability of the company and the maintenance of services to the maximum extent possible.The cost recovery plan involves cost reduction and efficiency measures, a wage freeze, changes to work practices and to the terms and conditions of employment, a reduction in staff numbers of approximately 250 and changes to services.  Overall, Bus Éireann is seeking savings of €12 million in 2010.It is a matter for Bus Éireann, with the agreement of the National Transport Authority in the case of subvented services, to decide on service levels and changes to services taking account of customer volumes and needs, fare revenue and the funding available for public service obligation services.  Bus Éireann is seeking to keep as much of its integrated network of services as possible and to minimise the impact on customers, including its most vulnerable customers, by targeting reductions in frequency of services rather than service withdrawal.Bus Éireann's cost recovery plan is urgently required so the company can avoid a projected operating deficit in 2010 of up to €27 million.  The cost recovery plan being implemented is in line with the recommendation of the Deloitte report on the cost and efficiency review of Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann.  The report acknowledged, in the case of Bus Éireann, that its network design and schedules are efficient and that some service reductions would be required to return the company to financial stability.Bus Éireann is strongly supported by the Government.  The 2010 public service obligation provision for Bus Éireann is approximately €45 million which the company will receive through the National Transport Authority.  This provision is an increase of 185% on its 2000 allocation.Investment in public transport in 2011 and beyond will be decided in the Estimates and budgetary processes, taking account of the review of capital expenditure being finalised by the Department of Finance.  However, in the current difficult economic climate Bus Éireann, and the other CIÉ companies, have to take measures to deliver their services more cost effectively and to ensure their continued financial viability.  These measures combined with investment in public transport infrastructure and services will provide a basis for a high quality and economically sustainable public transport system envisaged in the smarter travel action plan.

One of the elements Bus Éireann needs to change is where there is only a small number of people, say less than ten, travelling on certain routes, that the company should change the vehicle and opt for smaller vehicles.  I acknowledge that Bus Éireann co-operates and works with private contractors specifically, but it should extend and accelerate that process.At the heart of Bus Éireann, however, is still the issue that it wants to dominate the market and where it basically has a monopoly, it is crucifying commuters.  Specifically, I ask the Minister to comment on the fact that Bus Éireann runs buses from Dundalk to Dublin and Dundalk to Belfast, where the distance is 52 km either way but the annual ticket is €1,800 more expensive to go north than to go south for the same distance and the same bus.  That is not acceptable.  Bus Éireann is abusing a dominant position in the marketplace.

However, it is an operational matter for Bus Éireann and I do not want to get involved in the company's day to day operation.I accept and acknowledge what the Deputy stated about Bus Éireann generally, that the company is an efficient organisation.  Bus Éireann has modernised successfully over the past number of years.  The passengers are not there anymore for a variety of reasons and the company must cut its cloth to suit its measure.  As the Deputy stated, I acknowledge that instead of taking action that may damage the company's network, the approach it has adopted generally of reducing services on particular routes rather than abandoning routes leaves the skeleton there for some time in the future.  I acknowledge the role of management and, indeed, unions in reaching an agreement to approach it in that way.  That is putting the customer first and it should be acknowledged.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	492	Would the Minister agree again that the Deloitte report on Bus Éireann stated that there was little scope for savings and that the company was largely efficient, after a rigorous examination?  The Minister also agreed with me that the subsidy given to Bus Éireann is among the lowest in Europe for a regional public transport company.  One can look to a range of jurisdictions, such as the Netherlands, Germany and France, and the 12% or 13% that Bus Éireann gets is among the lowest.The Minister and his Green Party colleagues — it is shameful of the Green Party in Government — have slashed the national bus service.  There is a plethora of such important routes: No. 122, Portumna to Dublin; No. 71, Cork to Athlone; No. 231, Ballyvourney to Cork; and No. 271, Tralee to Cork.  There has been a further major cutback on routes such as No. 14, Limerick to Killarney; No. 40, Cork to Tralee; No. 52, Galway to Ballina; the Dungarvan local service; the Navan town service which is the Minister's service; and the Athlone town service.  It is a shocking litany of slashing a service.I repeat I do not agree with the approach of Fine Gael on this matter.  The bus licensing Act is there for anybody who wants to put forward proposals to the National Transport Authority, but I do not agree with this constant, ferocious, visceral attack on public transport because that would end up with vast areas of the country having no public transport as private operators cherry-pick.

In one, from Lifford in Donegal, a constituent writes that she and her daughter with Down's syndrome used the Stranorlar bus every week to get to Raphoe where they got a connecting bus to Letterkenny to meet with speech therapists and other appointments about her daughter's health.  She does not drive and now has no access to transport at all.That is what we have ended up with due to the Minister's action.  Do not land this on to the Bus Éireann management.  It is the Minister who cut the subsidy in real terms, who slashed the national bus services and who must bear responsibility.

He neglects to mention the capital subsidy that was available for the renewal of the fleet of Bus Éireann over many years which was significantly higher than he would like to acknowledge.In the world in which we live now with the new EU directive and everything else, a public transport company must operate in a commercial environment.  In the current financial situation it will not be easy to maintain services.Deputy Broughan mentioned a number of services.  On the Donegal one, for example, notwithstanding the difficulties he outlined for the individual concerned, the average load on that was less than 11.  The average load on the Ballyvourney to Cork service he spoke about was less than nine.  The average load on the Portumna service he mentioned was less than three passengers a day.  I do not care what kind of a system he wants to put in place, but he cannot expect that a full-scale transport service can be run on these routes at the same frequency for an average of three passengers a day.  It is not reasonable.

If An Post has its collection path for mail from many disparate and small local communities, why is the An Post vehicle not licensed to carry passengers as well?  That would make a deal of sense and there would be a fixed definite timetable at least twice a day on which people could travel.

It has been much better at using private companies and sub-contracting.  I agree with the Deputy that the company should do more, either through sub-contracting or through the company's own system, to use smaller buses and vehicles.On Deputy O'Dowd's point about An Post, he will be aware that the Department has put in place a number of rural transport pilot schemes where Bus Éireann is involved.  I take up the point he made on An Post's end of that because we have been mainly focussed on the HSE and health services.  It is something I will raise in the context of that review of rural transport.

I was not aware of the specifics until it came into the public domain.  I understand it was put in the public domain by somebody from the union side when the document was put to the union as part of the negotiations.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	510	As I have said on numerous previous occasions in this House, my policy in regard to the release of cost information on the transport projects contained in Transport 21 is in the first instance to ensure the taxpayer's interest is protected.In that context, the release or publication of commercially sensitive cost information prior to the completion of the competitive procurement processes would seriously prejudice the State's capacity to derive maximum value for money in respect of such projects.  However, I am also conscious that it is in the taxpayer's interest to strike an appropriate balance between ensuring value for money and transparency in the use of taxpayers' money for transport projects.My Department has, therefore, published cost information on completed projects and projects at a sufficiently advanced stage, where such information is no longer commercially sensitive.  It has also released documents under freedom of information as referred to by the Deputy.The RPA light rail investment strategy of 2005, referred to by the Deputy, was part of the detailed preparatory work which contributed to the final Transport 21 programme announced in November of that year.  All the transport agencies and many local authorities and Departments contributed to that exercise.Under Transport 21, one light rail project was recently completed in the docklands and two more are under construction.  The line to Cherrywood in south Dublin will open for service later this year and services will start on the extension to CityWest next year.  Good progress has also been made in progressing planning on projects such as metro north, metro west and the city centre Luas line.  However, it must be acknowledged that it will not be possible to deliver on the original ambitious targets contained in Transport 21 in the timescale envisaged given the current difficult economic environment.Metro north and DART underground are core projects in the strategy envisioned under Transport 21 and continue to be key projects in the revised funding environment.

Has the 2004-14 light rail investment strategy been totally shelved by the Government?  While I accept the point the Minister made about commercial costings, could there not be a general report to the Dáil on indicative costings in regard to major transport projects?In regard to Luas, what is happening to line D and Broadstone?  At what stage is that?  At what stage is the Lucan Luas, a major project the Railway Procurement Agency is progressing?The Minister referred to DART underground and metro north.  What is the current status of the two final bids for metro from the Celtic Metro Group and Metro Express?  I do not expect the Minister to give me costings or prices but a general timeframe.  When will we know whether the Celtic Metro Group or Metro Express has won the contract?We have been getting ready for the big dig at College Green.  Has the Minister had any meetings recently with the Dublin city manager, John Tierney, and the other stakeholders in order to progress this?
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	512	In regard to all the projects in Transport 21 which have started their processes, I have indicated on a number of occasions that I will bring them from planning and design to tender stage.  As I outlined previously, all of them are continuing along that path.  We will then make decisions in regard to provision of the money.  Obviously, metro and the DART interconnector will take up a huge amount of the public transport budget over the next number of years given the current financial circumstances.It was announced some time ago that line D will be post the work on the metro, although some of the work involved in that will be included when the metro work is being done.On the procedure for the tenders, a railway order must be obtained for metro in order that people know the final routes and the costings and so on can be finalised.  We will know which of the two tenderers were successful for some months after that.I stand corrected but I believe the last meeting I had on arrangements for the big dig, as the Deputy referred to it, was approximately one week or ten days before Christmas.Written Answers follow Adjournment Debate.

#JohnOMahony	unknown-#JohnOMahony-party	unknown-#JohnOMahony-dob	unknown-#JohnOMahony-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	515	I wish to pick up on the point I was making in regard to the Private Members' motion on the pay cuts for the 600 higher public servants.  I refer to the percentage increase which these people enjoyed in the good times.  They are now being excused from some of the pain in the difficult times.  These higher paid people made greater gains in the good times but are being exempted for taking their fair share of the pain at the expense of the lower paid public service workers.I have just left a meeting of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  The issue raised at that meeting by many, including Government and Opposition committee members, related to the travel tax and the reluctance of the Government to remove that tax at a time when figures show millions fewer tourists are coming to Ireland.  I am not suggesting all the reduction in the number of tourists is due to the travel tax.  Some of the €80 million collected in the travel tax could have been made up elsewhere.  We all know of hotels and tourism facilities struggling to survive.  Surely the response in this scenario should have been one of support and stimulus rather than one of tariff.  It just does not make sense.  The airlines and all the tourism bodies are in agreement.  A review carried out suggested the removal of this tax yet it is still in place.There are a number of stealth taxes and charges in this Bill which will not register with people until they have to deal with them upfront.  The proposal to end tax relief for bin charges while at the same time introducing VAT on these services will mean a hugely increased charge and will lead to an increase in illegal dumping.We have all heard the calls for business to be more competitive yet we have a carbon tax, increased toll charges and off-street car parking charges.  How will this help business to be more competitive?  It will have the opposite effect.There is no consolation for farmers in this Bill.  The continued hits they have taken not only in this budget but in previous ones will send farm incomes into a tailspin.  In 2009, the incomes of farmers dropped by more than 30%.  The ending of REPS 4 and the failure to pay farmers due money, even though only part of the money is coming from Government coffers, is another scandal.  The figures I released for Mayo today suggest that 1,276 farmers are waiting for their REPS 4 payments, even though when I raised this matter with the Minister before Christmas he said they would all be paid in the lead-up to Christmas or in the first days of January.  This is not good enough.Even one small issue, such as the exempting of farm diesel from carbon tax, failed to materialise.  This is nothing less than another tax on farming activity.  Even the Government's own figures admit the overall effect of this Bill and budget will increase unemployment by 70,000 this year.  Today's newspaper headlines may be the beginning of the confirmation of that, as 750 jobs were lost yesterday in Halifax.Youth unemployment has risen by 150% in the past two years.  There are no supports or stimulus for job protection or creation in this Bill.  The young people who played no part in causing the problems in the economy are suffering the most.  Where is the sense of fairness in this?  In any activity in life confidence is one of the great things which will get people back on the rails.  There is a total lack of confidence in this economy and this Bill confirms that.
#MichaelMoynihan	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-party	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-dob	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	516	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  There are a number of issues in the Bill and in the wider scope of finance to which I wish to refer.  On the points raised by Deputy O'Mahony on agriculture and farming, there is no doubt there is a huge issue regarding farming incomes and the incomes of rural people in general.  On the banks and the announcement yesterday of closures, when competition came into the sector and banks from outside the sector were setting up here, we all welcomed the reduction in interest rates, the terms and freely available credit which was coming on stream.  There is a parallel to be examined regarding agriculture.Multiples have come into the country and are delivering hugely reduced consumer prices.  There is a lot of competition between the multiples regarding the price of produce on the shelves.  At the same time, a fair price is not being given to the primary producer, farmer or processor.  The country will face a major problem if we do not face up to that now, even if what we have to do is unpopular.  In five or six years' time it will be a huge issue.  Some of the multiples are currently showing profits in excess of €90 billion, which is almost twice what it costs to run Ireland.  That is made on the backs of primary producers and small processors throughout this country.  It is an issue which needs to be addressed.Discussions are taking place regarding what should be done at European level.  The issue also has to be tackled at national level because, while we all welcome the reduction in prices, it should not happen as a result of the decimation of what was once a very proud indigenous industry and which is still one of the main employers in the country.  It must be examined in a serious and coherent way.In recent months we have been given information from the stock market and stock brokers about the miss-selling of products to people, in particular to those who are vulnerable.  Media attention was drawn to the effect of this and some matters are before the courts as people have taken cases.  It is something which has to be examined.  One case which has come to my attention in recent months concerns a client who is 75 years of age who had been sold a 26 year investment by one of the major stockbrokers in this country.  The person concerned would have had to wait until she was 101 years of age before she could recover any of the money she had invested.We hear that the stock market or our old friend, the Financial Regulator, is in charge of such practices but these are issues on which we need to zone in because they affect many people.  From an examination of the press cuttings in recent weeks concerning small financial institutions and individuals taking cases regarding the miss-selling of products, one can only conclude that this will become a major issue for us.On the Finance Bill, the Minister, in his speech on 9 December, reduced excise duty on beer and cider.  At that time he made the point that he expected a reduction in prices from manufacturers and wholesalers and he would increase excise if that was not forthcoming.  To date, nothing has happened and it is something which would be very worthwhile for the Government and the Minister to monitor because it is an important issue.  If any direction given by the Minister in terms of excise or taxes is not matched by the industry, we must examine the matter.The Finance Bill gives legislative order to the provisions of the budget.  There is no doubt it was a tough and difficult budget in terms of spending cuts and so forth.  There are a number of issues in the budget and Finance Bill which have to be welcomed, are far-seeing and should give us welcome relief.  The extension of mortgage interest relief for qualifying homeowners who are entitled to it was due to end in 2010 but they will continue to qualify at the applicable rate until the end of 2017.  Qualifying loans taken out before 31 December 2011 will continue to get relief at the current rates until the end of 2017.  Transition measures are also provided for qualifying loans taken out after December 2011 and in 2012 the relief will be provided at reduced rates for the duration.  Mortgage interest relief will be abolished entirely for the tax year 2018 and subsequent years.The introduction of the domiciliary levy of €200,000 on all Irish domiciliary individuals who are Irish citizens will ensure that wealthy Irish domiciled individuals make a contribution to the State during these times of economic and fiscal difficulty.  The contribution of wealthy people is a point which has been argued in this House on numerous occasions and this measure is recognition that the issue needs to be tackled.  The levy will apply to wealthy Irish domiciled individuals with Irish-located capital greater than €5 million, worldwide income in excess of €1 million and all Irish income liability taxed less than €200,000.  Persons liable for this levy will have to pay it regardless of whether they live or are tax resident here.  The increase in the effective income tax rate paid by those subject to the restriction in reliefs for horizontal measured taxpayers availing of specific reliefs will now become subject to the restricted rather than adjusted income levy of €125,000 rather than €200,000.These are some of the measures.Some commentators have spoken in recent days about the worthwhile initiatives in the Finance Bill which are intended to try to generate foreign investment into this country.  Since the foundation of the State we have benefited enormously from foreign direct investment.  We provided a very worthwhile arrangement within our taxation system that encourages foreign direct investment.  We also put in place a very educated workforce which has been to the benefit of Irish society over the years.  Our education system has stood the test of time although in the future there must be new innovative education programmes.  However, the system has encouraged investors and this Bill goes a long way towards ensuring there will be further encouragement.  Many commentators broadly welcomed the Finance Bill and it is encouraging to note that even in these very difficult times it was welcomed.Speaking in a broader sense, this time last year we saw the collapse of the financial markets and the banks and all the subsequent difficulties.  We saw the short-sightedness in the way banking was dealt with.  We must now look to our indigenous industries that have stood the Irish economy very well over the years.  We have to consider foreign direct investment and ensure we have an attractive economy into which to invite people.  I believe we are doing that.  We must be very careful to ensure that message goes out at all times.  That is our encouragement for the future.We must accept also that we are in hugely difficult times and that people throughout the country are suffering severe financial hardship because of loss of employment, from advice given to them in recent years or because of family circumstances and other reasons.  Many politicians on all sides of this House are in constant contact with community welfare officers regarding their constituents, particularly in recent months.  They will know of people who unfortunately lost their employment but perhaps had a redundancy payment or some other savings which got them through.  However, I have seen people across the desks from politicians or with welfare officers who are in great financial difficulty because their commitments still exist.  These are people with young families or with young adults going on to third level education.  We must be very mindful of this.Last week regulations were introduced regarding mortgages and so forth.  I believe there are new regulations in respect of what credit unions can do.  Credit unions have always provided extra money for people, in both urban and rural Ireland, and have been the backbone in providing funding in difficult times.  However, there was need for the new directives and I hope they will be signed shortly as a statutory instrument.  These will allow the credit unions to reorganise loans and repayments for people, some of whom are in great difficulty in this regard.I wish to make a very strong point concerning the Finance Bill.  Many people have asked whether anybody foresaw the collapse in the financial system.  A very large amount of money was freely available from banks and foreign banks introduced competition by coming into this country and competing with indigenous banks.  Everybody had a race to the bottom.  I firmly believe that if corrective action is not taken in respect of the food industry and what the multiples are doing, not only in this country but throughout the developed world, we will have the same situation in agriculture and the food processing industry in the not very distant future within three to five years.  There is a drive or race to the bottom to get the cheapest price possible for the goods on the shelf and to have the cheapest possible product.  This drives margins down further for the primary producer, the farmer, and the indigenous processors we have always known in this country.  Over-regulation has come into play in the meat industry, especially in the beef processing industry, with the closing of smaller abattoirs.This issue is probably too wide to be dealt with within an individual state because it extends across the European Union.  Governments must take corrective action in this regard and take away power from the multiples regarding what they are doing at present where there is bulk buying on a grand scale.  If we do not take away their powers we will end up with a desperately serious situation.  The fear is that our agriculture will end up in the same situation as the financial sector.  I do not say that as a scaremongering tactic but firmly believe it.   Decisions have been taken at all levels with regard to agriculture and food production and the prices given to the primary producer which have eliminated a great raft of our own people who worked in that sector.  During the past 20 years it was always said that big was beautiful, particularly in agriculture, and that it was right to take away many of the processors.  However, it has led to a lack of indigenous processing.I firmly believe that governments, both at national and European level, must take corrective action in regard to this issue and the power of individual multiple companies.  These companies have profits in excess of €90 billion, nearly twice what it costs to run Ireland Incorporated and they must be checked.  How Ireland stood up to the British empire is famed in song and story but there are empires across the world at present that are driving our primary producers and small industries into the ground, in both urban and rural Ireland.  This will continue unless corrective action is taken.  Although we may all believe in the Common Agricultural Policy and the moneys made available to the farming community to support them in producing food for reasons of food security, if we do not return to the basics of paying these people a proper price for their product we will end up in a very serious situation.These are the three points I wish to make in respect of the Finance Bill.  My primary point concerns agriculture and our relationship with the multiples.  The second is the need to look at the way the stock market and stockbrokers have been regulated and the products they sold, especially to vulnerable people.  I outlined the case of one person in her 70s.  She was sold a 26 year product which would come to fruition some time around her 100th birthday.  Some €180,000 was put into that scheme and she was left with nothing except a house.  That business must be looked at in a very serious way.  The regulator and the stock market find it very easy to kick it from one to the other.Third, I welcome the initiatives in the Finance Bill regarding attracting foreign direct investment.  We used to be very good at attracting such investment because of the initiatives of Governments of all parties throughout the years.  We must continue to do that and must continue to have an educated workforce irrespective of the difficulties facing the country at present.  We must ensure we have that system in place for Ireland to go forward.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	519	This Finance Bill, which deals with matters outstanding from budget 2010, attempts to walk a very fine line between taking a first painful step towards the correction of the public finances on the one hand, and squeezing the life, such as it is, out of the economy, on the other.  It is the harshest budget in our history.  The measures to be implemented by this Bill constitute a huge risk.  We seem to be caught in a downward spiral, where savage pay cuts and extension of VAT to public services are piled upon last year's severe tax and levy increases, without any investment strategy to deepen economic activity or retain and create jobs.Taking €4 billion out of the economy is a risk.  Historians will marvel at the depth of the crisis that caused the parties in this House to agree on that figure, even if they differed on how it should be done.  However, that does not mean to say that it is without risk.  Set against a backdrop of rising interest repayments on our borrowings and a credit freeze to the real economy, it is certainly a risk.  That view has its adherents in the ranks of the Labour Party, in the trade union movement and in the views expressed by former Deputy George Lee, if I understood him correctly.  More pertinently, it was a view entertained by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, before he introduced the emergency budget last April, but as the pace of economic decline worsened last year, presumably he changed his mind about the composition of the cuts, or perhaps the change was forced on him by our European authorities.  Either way, we are managing only to run fast in order to stand still.  Talk of having turned the corner or recovery being on the horizon is not a perception shared in the real economy.  If credit has dried up and this remains unaddressed, more people will be forced onto the live register, thus undermining the value of the €4 billion cuts.I accept the need to tackle the public finances crisis, or the structural deficit, and I hope the cuts do not further depress demand and worsen the recession.  However, one thing I am sure of is that the Minister cannot come back for more pay cuts.  Even before his December budget, the Minister told us how his European colleagues marvelled at the cuts he had implemented without provoking widespread public protests.  He revisited severe cuts in December, but targeted the brunt of them at public servants.  Employees on very modest wages were hit very hard, but there comes a tipping point.  On the public pay front, there is no more low-hanging fruit.  Therefore, Government focus must shift to the critical issue of employment.  While asserting that we have turned the corner, the Minister is at the same time planning for a further huge increase of 75,000 in unemployment.  Lack of opportunity is a further constraint on our young educated people, forcing them to leave the country.  As other economies begin to emerge from recession, more and more of our educated youth will emigrate.  If we lose a generation of educated young people to emigration, this will make the Government's objective of a smart economy even more elusive.The most urgent necessity now is to ensure that small and medium enterprises have access to lines of credit.  It would appear that there is an emerging consensus that even if the remaining obstacles in the way of a functioning NAMA can be cleared, it will still not meet the first objective set for it by Government, namely, to make credit available to sound businesses.  All of the indications are that there will be more bumps on the road in respect of NAMA's mission than were anticipated by Government.  The banks will endeavour to use as much of the ECB funds as possible to rectify their balance sheets.  If, for example, a bank can access money at 1% and use it, for example, to buy Government debt, it will get a handsome return without taking any risk.  If the expert advice is that, as the IMF advised, NAMA will not get credit flowing again, then the Government must devise alternative methods of making credit available to sound businesses.  The Labour Party has been examining this question for some time because we have not shared the Minister's confidence that NAMA will unfreeze credit.  There appears to be an extraordinary complacency at the top of Government on this critical issue.  In an exchange yesterday with the Labour Party leader, the Taoiseach made it sound as if all we are doing is gathering up used cloakroom tickets and taking them to a hatch in Frankfurt where the banks will get funds at no expense to the taxpayer.  The truth of course is that the Government is handing over the equivalent of the deeds of the house for ECB funds.  It is mortgaging our children's future.  The Minister must get tough with banks in terms of our national priorities.I welcome the Minister's commitment to a national solidarity bond and hope in his reply to the debate he will elaborate on the conditions.  This was first proposed by David Begg, General Secretary of Congress.  All the evidence is that because of the extent of the lack of confidence in our economy, the savings ratios have shot up.  I have no doubt, depending on how the Minister pitches it, that the bond will be oversubscribed.  It ought to be expressly linked to the jobs effort in its promotion.  Other than the solidarity bond, there is very little in the Bill to stimulate employment except for the provision designed to attract a share of available Islamic finance.  The employment content of that initiative may be small enough.  The Minister's gimmick on the levy for non-domiciled persons is typical of the way Fianna Fáil treats the Green Party.  One does not need to be a tax specialist to know that one could drive a coach and four through this measure as proposed.  Given the collapse in house prices, it will not be difficult to escape this measure.  If it is designed to mollify public opinion, when the yield becomes apparent it will only serve to enrage public opinion.  One would need to want to contribute under this measure as it is drafted.  Otherwise, one would need to be a fool.  Not many tax refugees are fools.It is apparent that the Department of Finance took back control during 2009, having been asleep at the wheel for some time before or so oppressed by its political masters that it was paralysed.  We had the appalling budget of 2007 which fed into the paralysis of 2008, but finally the Department won the battle in the internal row for 2009.  It is difficult to find any Ministers who espoused the finance measures, who espoused, for example, the McCarthy report.  One must admire the chutzpah of the Minister for Finance in coming into the House and seeming to offer remedies for a disaster caused by his Government.  Perhaps he was not in Cabinet, but his colleagues do not have that excuse.Before I hand over to Deputy Sherlock,  I wish to repeat a point I have made previously about the sheltered private sector.  The Minister comes in here seeking to impose new levies, additional taxes, pay cuts and cuts in social welfare, yet nothing is being done about the sheltered private sector.  The prices being levied by professionals, who are cosseted, are only likely to be aggravated by the moneys set aside for professional advice in the case of NAMA.  This issue remains unaddressed.  I would also like to draw attention to a matter being debated elsewhere in the Oireachtas, namely, the manner in which top-level public and civil servants have been treated as compared to people on €30,000 and less.  Competitiveness is not merely a function of pay.  Too frequently, speakers on the Government side of the House come in here talking about competitiveness as if it was only about pay.  The only way I see towards a restoration of pay levels in the public service, down the road, is through negotiation and implementation of the reforms that were on the table before Christmas.  We need to get back there because there is no future in widespread industrial conflict.  Nor is there any future in the Government continuing to provoke the Civil Service and the public service in the way it has done.Finally, there ought to be a law to protect the Greens as we have legislation to protect other vulnerable species.  To offer them an 80% windfall tax in circumstances where there is no development, and to offer them this levy on non-doms when nobody except one who is minded to want to offer to pay it would bother paying it, is really no way to treat a partner in Government.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	13580	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	521	In furtherance of the last point made by Deputy Rabbitte, the fact this is a windfall tax on landowners whose sons or daughters may seek to build a house near the family home in a rural area, based on a genuine housing need, is an issue that needs to be re-examined.I wish to speak specifically to the issue of the carbon tax and the permutations of that tax for the agricultural sector.  Speaking as a Deputy of the Labour Party, a party with no apparent natural ties with the agricultural sector, it could be argued that anything we may say on this subject will not always be taken seriously by those who operate within the rural economy.  I want to put on record that what is vital to the recovery of this economy is how the rural economy will thrive.The imposition of the carbon tax, for example, particularly as it pertains to marked gas oil or agricultural diesel, will have a severe impact in terms of the cost inputs for those who operate within the agricultural sector.  Be they primary producers or agricultural contractors, the very fact a tax of this nature is being levied at 8.7% when road diesel is at 4.4% will cause an undue cost impact for those who are operating within this sector, and it needs to be revised.  There is an irony to the situation.  For the multiples such as Tesco, their lorries on the road are subject to a tax of 4.4% whereas the primary producers such as the farmers who are producing for the multiples are being levied at 8.7%, which will put a further squeeze on those primary producers in terms of their ability to supply goods into the market.  This is an issue that needs to be taken on board, particularly by the Green wing of the Government, who have heralded this carbon tax as the dawn of a new age.In principle, we are all in favour of the tax, but it has to be on the basis that it is levied with some degree of equity and fairness.  I do not believe a proper analysis was undertaken of this measure before it was decided upon.  It should be revised and revisited because it has not been costed and it will have a negative impact on the very recovery that is necessary for this economy, particularly in terms of how the rural economy weighs into that recovery.  I would like a response from the Minister on this issue when he is replying to the debate.I wish to refer the Chair to an e-mail I received from a farmer who is directly impacted as a result of this proposal.  He stated:I too have no problem with CT [carbon tax] but only if it is dealt out in fair way.  To me it seems that this tax at nearly double the road % is a tax on production. ... Another concern I would have is that seeing new engines in tractors are going to cost on average between 20%-50% more than now, this tax would be a barrier to cleaner and newer emission targeted machines being used in agriculture, as people will just make do [that is to say, make do with existing machinery].  It is a fact that these newer tractors burn more fuel due to the nature of the emission recycling that goes on. ... By hook or crook everyone in agriculture will be affected by the rise, any contractor will just have to pass it on to customers, and they are finding it hard enough to get paid as it is.We need to take a more lateral view as to how the carbon tax will be implemented.  From an agricultural perspective, it is proven that agricultural incomes were down significantly in 2009 — the figures are there for everybody to see.  If one is operating a large-scale farm unit, the chances are one will be able to absorb the extra costs because one has the economies of scale to be able to do so.  However, in the case of a small farmer, such as a hillside farmer or sheep farmer on a small margin, any increase in costs of this nature could have the potential to put that farmer out of business.  We need to revise this mechanism on that basis alone.I keep coming back to the idea that if the agricultural sector is to form a part of our economic recovery, what we must not do is place an undue burden on the costs of production.  The costs of production, if one considers the overall economy, have to be the same for agriculture as they are for the lorries that supply Tesco and the other multiples, which take their primary products from those same primary producers.  We need equity in this regard.I also refer the Chair to the proposal by the Irish Farmers' Association, which stated:Farm diesel has excise duty charged at a lower rate than road diesel or petrol.  Furthermore, the rate of VAT applying is the low rate of 13.5% as compared with 21% for normal automotive fuels.  The low rate of excise duty also applies to farm diesel in other EU countries.  This demonstrates recognition by Government and at EU level that a lower rate of taxation is appropriate for farm diesel, which is exclusively used in agricultural production, than is applied to other motor fuels.Again, we need to take cognisance of the fact that agricultural diesel, by its very nature, is used on-farm and primarily for agricultural related purposes — or it should be — and, therefore, if its cost to the farmer is increased, many farmers will be wiped out, particularly those in marginal areas.  I ask the Government to revise this provision.

Everybody in the House will agree it was a very difficult budget which has affected everybody in the country.  Those in work are finding they have less money.  Unfortunately, an increasing number of people are out of work and those on social welfare payments have seen a substantial reduction in their take-home income.  In that regard, I want to praise the Minister for having had the strength to realise the situation the country is in and to put in place measures to correct the awful — I use the word advisedly — situation that is facing us.  In simple terms, we are taking in approximately €32 billion per annum and spending in excess of €54 billion per annum, which obviously is unsustainable.  Our living standards will be severely reduced.  Ireland has had its independence for the past 90 years and it is essential that we sort out our financial difficulties.  This Bill, the budget and plan which the Minister for Finance has put in place for the next three years, which has been approved by the EU, is the start of the difficult and painful road to recovery.  Much time has been spent by this House and the media discussing the reasons we are in the situation we are.  I do not intend to add to that debate which may well take place in other forums.  We must focus on remedying the situation.As I understand it, the main objective of the Finance Bill is the creation of jobs.  The Government is committed to the development of the smart economy, part and parcel of which is sustaining and encouraging research and development.  There are people who believe that research and development is carried out by people in white coats locked away in laboratories of no relevance to the remainder of the country.  I commend Science Foundation Ireland, Enterprise Ireland the Industrial Development Authority on their tremendous developments in the research and development area.  I believe that a strong research and development sector, which brings products through all the stages of innovation and to fruition and manufacture, is the way forward for this country.  There is a much better chance of our sustaining jobs and developing new jobs if products are innovated here.In that regard, perhaps the draftspersons might employ a little plain English in section 50 of the Finance Bill which deals with research and development and occupies four to five pages of the Bill.  The only line I can understand is the final one which states that the section applies to relevant periods commencing on or after 1 January 2010.  Perhaps the Minister will when replying to this debate or on Committee Stage explain the section to us.  As I understand it, research and development is to be encouraged but perhaps the Minister will clarify the matter.I welcome that the Minister has put in place a national solidarity bond, a savings product which will be available and administered through NAMA and will be open to subscription from all citizens.  I am a member of the Joint Committee on the Constitution which is currently considering how the electoral system might be reformed and improved.  One of the great debates occurring in that committee is the distinction between what a Deputy does at constituency level and in respect of legislation.  There are people who look down on what is known as "constituency work".  It is my contention that constituency and legislative work are one in the same: they are different degrees of the same issue.Last September, a constituent, an old age pensioner in his eighties, visited me to discuss his medical card application, which according to the media is a constituency matter.  During the course of our discussions the man stated that he would like to give a couple of euro every week to help the country get out of the situation it is in.  I wrote on his behalf to the Minister for Finance.  I am delighted that a national solidarity bond, in respect of which I am sure the Minister received many representations from Members of the House, is being introduced.  What is considered a basic constituency matter has resulted in the Minister putting in place in this legislation a national solidarity bond to which many people will be willing to subscribe.In the time remaining I would like to touch on an issue of increasing concern, namely, home repossessions, in particular how these repossessions are being driven by mortgage providers who are outside the bank guarantee scheme.  There is increasing fear and concern among homeowners, some of whom have suffered a drop in income and others who through no fault of their own have lost their jobs, that their homes, their primary dwelling, will be repossessed.  While I acknowledge the one year moratorium in this regard, I urge the Minister to seriously consider extending it to two years.  I also ask that he put in place an independent body that can verify when an application in respect of home repossession is made so that the homeowner has been given every chance possible by way of interest only repayments, a two year moratorium or through the bank taking equity in the house, to remain in his or her home.  I would like the message to go out from this House that we are actively looking after this situation on behalf of people.Yesterday, we heard of the resignation of a Member of the current Dáil, which was a unique development.  While I do not wish to get into the ins and outs of the matter, which is of some importance to the political party involved and to the Member who resigned, I believe that one of the factors of that resignation is the need for Dáil reform.  Dáil reform has been on the agenda for many years.  Quite frankly, we are going around in circles.  The time has come to act and to not put this off any longer.  Many Members are frustrated because they do not get an opportunity to speak on topical issues about which they may have much to say.  I, and many Members on all sides of the House, believe the Dáil should be relevant to people's lives.  We need to immediately reform the procedures of this House to ensure all of us elected to this House by the public can contribute in an equal and open manner.
#JohnBrowne2	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-party	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-dob	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	525	I am pleased to have an opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Finance Bill 2010.  It is obvious the Minister put a great deal of thought and effort into ensuring this Bill is relevant to the difficulties facing us.  As Deputy Devins stated, the budget was tough and it impinged on all sectors of society.  While some people were happy with the budget and others were not it reflects the economic times in which we are now living.The Minister set about correcting the difficulties that have come about during the past few years and tried to ensure the budget was fair and equitable.   While we would all like to have more input into the budget it is a matter for Cabinet and the Minister for Finance with some input from parliamentary parties and from the Opposition in terms of the policies it may put forward.  Deputy Devins called on us to immediately commence reform of this House.  I have always believed that good ideas from any section of this House should be taken on board and not thrown out for politics sake, an issue that may need to be addressed in the future.I would like now to make a few points on the Finance Bill on which the Minister might reflect in the coming days prior to the Bill being forwarded to committee and on to the Seanad.  The banks are causing major difficulties for small businesses around the country.  In recent months, small businesses have made representations to me and other Deputies because their overdrafts have been halved or withdrawn.  In addition, previous loan facilities have been withdrawn, which can cause serious difficulties for the small business sector.  It is not good that businesses, which operated within bank guidelines for many years and did not go beyond their overdraft limits or over borrow, should receive a letter notifying them that their overdraft has been cut in half or withdrawn, or that a loan facility is being reduced.  This is being done without any discussion with local bank managers or staff.  Such decisions are now taken in Dublin, which is where many of the difficulties have arisen in the past year.  A local bank manager is usually aware of the circumstances of most small businesses in his or her town or county.  It is no longer left to a local manager, however, to make those decisions.  They are now taken in some ivory tower in the Bank of Ireland, AIB or other bank headquarters in Dublin.  Customers are really at the whim of someone there who decides whether they will get an overdraft or a loan facility for 2010.  This is causing serious difficulties and job losses in many cases because businesses are unable to continue as they are not being paid.Yesterday, the Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Honohan, also reflected some of the views expressed here by Deputies on the Finance Bill.  He reiterated his criticism last year of banks for failing to lend to businesses, saying that "bankers have lost their edge in small business lending after years of property-based lending".  I am not George Lee or a financial expert, but I would expect that Professor Honohan would have some input into the type of criticism he made at that conference yesterday.  The Central Bank was caught out badly on how it operated in recent years.  I have great respect for Professor Honohan, who is a star in this area at present, but what powers does he have to ensure that the banks he is criticising will make loans and overdrafts available to small businesses and others who need them?  Perhaps the Minister for Finance can answer that question and say whether the Central Bank has any such role.  I think it should have, and the Minister should be encouraging banks to act in the national interest.I welcome the car scrappage scheme, which will protect jobs in the motor industry in every county.  Many car dealers have told me that customers may have borrowed money to buy cars in recent years and never missed a repayment.  However, when they want to change their cars, the banks say: "No, we're not going give you a loan because you might lose your job.  In a year or two's time, you might not have the wherewithal to pay it."  That area needs to be examined.Jobs are the way forward to deal with these economic issues.  It might be sacrilege for me to say so, but I do not think there is much room for any more cuts in the public service.  We are at an end in that particular area as far I am concerned as a Fianna Fáil backbencher.  On the other hand, we need to look at how we can create jobs in future by developing and expanding the economy.  Deputy Devins talked about the smart economy, which needs to be promoted and properly financed.The Minister should also examine the wind and wave energy sectors.  The Irish Wind Energy Association produced a report stating that up to 10,000 jobs could be created quickly in this area if incentives were provided along with the right mix of Government policies.  The Minister should look at this possibility because we need to move on and examine how we can create jobs in future.  This is one positive area because the production of fossil fuels is not infinitely sustainable.  Wind and wave energy present an opportunity because we are rich in both commodities.  We should not wait for Europe or the rest of the world to exploit these energy sources when we could become leaders in the sector, given proper incentives and the right approach.The building industry is currently a no-go area, and it is unpopular to promote builders and that sector generally.  I can speak for my own county, however, which is very dependent on the construction industry.  For example, I know of two builders who employed 800 people up to 18 months ago, but they now employ less than 40.  That has caused serious problems in a county such as Wexford.  In addition, there are numerous other building companies there that are no longer employing workers.  There is room for tax breaks in selective areas, such as primary care centres — referred to earlier by the Minister for Health and Children — sports facilities and centres for people with disabilities.  Tax breaks can be selective and one should not throw all such breaks out the window.  There are certain areas in which tax breaks could be used to encourage builders and developers to construct essential services, particularly in the health care sector, including for those with disabilities, where services are required for the future.I agree with Deputy Devins about home owners.  The one-year moratorium is not enough, so we should look at a moratorium of two, three or four years — or whatever length of time it takes people to be re-employed and thus meet the repayments they were making when they had a job a year or two previously when their home loans were originally taken out.  That matter should be examined seriously.Sub-prime mortgage lenders are acting like boot-boys up and down the country.  They are frightening the life out of people.  They loaned money to social welfare recipients and other low earners for houses, home extensions, cars, holidays, new kitchens or whatever was required.  The loans were way above the means of such people who could never pay them back.  I have had people coming to my constituency office who were on social welfare when they obtained such loans.  Perhaps they did not provide full information to lenders at the time, but there is no way some of the people I deal with can ever afford to meet their repayments.  Something needs to be done in that respect in order to help them out.There are tremendous opportunities for development in the agricultural sector to create jobs, particularly in the food industry.  Farmers have had a very difficult year with milk, grain and potato prices on the floor.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has come up with some kind of compensation for potato growers who have suffered severe losses.  Grain growers and milk producers have all lost out in recent times and are in serious difficulty.  The multiples are fleecing the country's primary producers.  A carrot producer explained to me recently that he was getting €100 per tonne, but by the time they ended up in the supermarket, carrots were being sold for €1,400 per tonne.  That is unfair and farmers should be paid more for their produce.I have asked the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Mary Coughlan, to examine this matter.  She is talking about introducing a code of practice whereby multiples would treat producers fairly.  I am not sure a code of practice would work, however, and legislation may be required in this area to encourage multiples to be fairer to producers.  I encourage the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Tánaiste to look at opportunities in the farming sector.  I am grateful for this opportunity to speak on the Finance Bill.  There are large amounts of money lying in credit unions, post offices and banks which people are afraid to spend at present.  The Minister for Finance should consider introducing incentives for people to take out their money to invest it and get a return on that investment.  We should utilise the money that is lying idle at present.

#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	528	I am glad to have the opportunity to raise some issues that are important and I will be parochial in stating them.  When the budget was announced and now when I read the Finance Bill I am struck by the lack of a stimulus package for the economy, and particularly for the significant number of unemployed people, who now number approximately 450,000.  In south Tipperary alone, 8,514 people are unemployed.  Cahir has 1,200 unemployed people, Carrick-on-Suir has 2,339, Cashel has 1,100, Clonmel has 2,479 and Tipperary town has 1,635.  I want to highlight the benefit a jobs stimulus package could bring to an area like Tipperary town.Several small businesses are under pressure and closing down.  Tipperary town has been severely affected by the closure of Dell.  In recent years, not a single IDA Ireland job has come to that area despite having an upmarket, top-class and well laid out advance factory.  No jobs have been created there despite what happened with Dell and how it affected a great number of people in that area.  I had hoped the budget would include a stimulus package for the small businesses, the many young people with ideas and the many young people in the Tipperary town area who are unemployed following the closure of Dell.  A stimulus package would have a very positive impact in that area.The country cannot come out of its difficulties unless we bring confidence back into the economy.  Deputy Browne spoke about the money in credit unions and banks.  This is because people have no confidence about spending money.  They are all minding their money and very careful about where they are spending it because they have no confidence in the future.  Fine Gael has outlined the many jobs a stimulus package could create in the environmental, renewable energy and other areas.  The Government has completely ignored all the advice it has been given on a good stimulus package.On the other hand, the banks that should be lending money to small businesses are not making overdraft facilities available.  They are not allowing people the capital to run their businesses.  On a weekly basis I hear from businesspeople who are not getting funding to the same extent as in previous years to allow their businesses to carry on and, in some cases, expand.  When people talk about how badly the economy is doing and the issues affecting it, I often wonder what ideas the Government has on creating jobs.  What ideas does it have for the 8,500 unemployed people in south Tipperary?  There is no good idea or leadership coming from the Government.  There are real opportunities to create jobs in many areas, including in the tourism industry.  Last week, I spoke about the potential to create jobs in the fishing industry using our lakes and rivers.I refer to existing jobs that are under pressure.  Golf clubs provide employment to approximately 4,000 people.  There is an unfair situation regarding VAT.  There are ordinary old-style, community-based golf clubs which associations own, but private golf clubs are at a very severe disadvantage.  Some of them are in the constituency of the Minister of State, Deputy Tony Killeen, and some are in mine.  I believe there are three, if not four, of them in south Tipperary and they are at a major disadvantage.  This is only a small way but they are great job creators.  However, they are under great pressure because of the weather we have had — the significant difficulties last summer and the summer before then.  They have also had to close down for week upon week in the winter.  That is just one example of the many areas in which jobs could be protected and indeed created.The Government should be far more realistic, should produce better ideas and give better leadership to the communities and the people who are anxious.  A large number of people want to bring the economy from where it is and develop it.  I call on the Government to wake up and help the people, and the people will respond.
#PaulConnaughton	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-party	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-dob	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	529	I am sorry the Minister for Finance is not here.  I have two questions to put to him through the Minister of State, Deputy Tony Killeen.  Is there any connection between NAMA, the banks and the countless numbers of young people about to lose their houses?  I cannot see a connection.  We spent weeks and months debating NAMA here and perhaps I did not pick it up correctly.  We all know that NAMA was set up to save the banking structure and we accept that we cannot run an economy such as ours without a decent banking system.  However, we were also wise enough to understand that the bankers, builders and developers would get first call on anything that was going.  Having read the Finance Bill as published, if I happened to be a householder or I lived in a house where I had lost my job or my spouse had lost their job and I had a very big mortgage, I see no connection between what NAMA stands for and what I and thousands more like me might have to put up with where we might lose our houses.I have been around long enough to understand.  Based on an independent study a few weeks ago, there are 300,000 empty houses.  The courts could be clogged with approaches by the lending agencies to confiscate houses.  They know, however, that they are not going to sell the houses, but instead will attract enormous odium if they put people out of their homes.  This would be a PR disaster, and as bad as things are for them at present, matters would be much worse.The hallmark of any Government, regardless of who is in power, will be to ensure a mechanism is found for the cohort of people who took on mortgages and literally did not know what social welfare was.  They did not want to have anything to do with it, but wanted, instead, to work every day of their lives.  They did not want any help at that stage, but believed they were self-propelled and could pay every penny they borrowed.  It was not their fault that they were bushwhacked on the route.  That had nothing to do with them, I can assure the Minister of State.I do not have the time available to me to talk about the people who caused the crisis, but we can rest assured that they will not end up footing the bill.  My central message is not about waiving interest for three to six months, but something much more fundamental to try to ensure people can recover within, say, five to ten years.  If people are put on the side of the road, the Government will have to go back to the health boards and afford them all types of rental accommodation relief or the county councils will have to build houses for them, thus ensuring that the taxpayers are caught a second time.  It is in all our interests to keep people in the houses they so richly deserve to live in.We all accept that there has to be a serious readjustment as regards the way we do business in Ireland.  Some people at the bottom of the ladder have been very badly hit in the public service and also in the private sector.  I have always believed that as soon as downward pressure is put on all areas of expenditure such as labour costs, the effects would feed into the economy and bring about a state of competitiveness very quickly.  Some things have been reduced in price.  Farmers know that prices at the farmgate have dropped, remarkably, as I can attest, being a farmer.  If there is not an improvement soon we shall lose the world of jobs in agriculture, but I shall return to this on another day.  It does not mean that there is a dent in supermarket profits, however, and that has to be looked at.If one goes to a solicitor, a doctor, a veterinary practitioner or any of the professionals one will find there is no change in what they charge.  The cost of refuse collocation by the local authorities is increasing.  If we are to attain the competitive edge everyone is proclaiming as regards doing business in Europe, the cost of all such services will have to come down very quickly.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	530	I want to highlight a couple of Border anomalies the Finance Bill had the chance to address, but unfortunately did not.  I had highlighted these issues with the Minister for Finance prior to the budget.  One is the VAT on coal, together with the extra carbon tax on coal.  I am glad there is a Member present from the Green Party, Deputy White, to hear what is happening and will continue to happen.  We are going to get an influx of coal with higher carbon content from Northern Ireland, and we need to know what measures  the Minister will put in place to enable the necessary powers to police this.  It is all right to introduce a tax, but what will police the importation of coal from Northern Ireland?A second opportunity was missed in regard to tax administration.  The issue of tax harmonisation in terms of people who live on one side of the Border and work on the other will be difficult to address.  However, if specific issues have to be referred to a complex cases team at a European level, should there not be a more localised solution to such problems?  It is not difficult to appoint somebody on either side of the Border to look at the different taxation anomalies that arise for people living on either side.  That was another opportunity missed.In terms of the Finance Bill and what it is trying to achieve, my colleague, Deputy Connaughton, has hit the nail on the head.  The philosophy behind NAMA, for instance, is to get liquidity moving and finance flowing within the economy.  From the Minister's perspective this would amount to a knight in shining armour in terms of kickstarting the economy.  On the other hand we have increased taxation in virtually every area, not forgetting the increased insurance hikes people will have to face as a result of the flooding.  Everyone is fearful of more and more taxes being imposed on them.  It baffles us on this side of the House.  Even the smallprint of the Finance Bill sets out how every single service in the local authorities, not just dustbin charges, but everything from photocopying to housing applications will incur administrative charges.  All people see are increased taxes.  These will have a knock-on effect on people's psyches.  They are starting to hoard and considering what moneys might be available to them in a year, say, in case they lose their jobs.  People are in a saving mindset and this is happening among those fortunate enough to have jobs.That gives rise to the paradox of thrift, namely, the more people save, they less they spend.  The less people spend the less money there is in circulation.  The less money in circulation the more businesses will close down.  The more businesses that close down the more people on the unemployment register.  It is a negative spiral that can be stopped by this Minister, but the opportunity was missed in the Finance Bill because he is ignoring unemployment in deference to putting his energies into getting the banks to lend.In this regard, in my constituency National Irish Bank is pulling out virtually every single branch in the Inishowen peninsula.  The peninsula is bigger in area than County Louth and has a larger population than County Leitrim.  In the two or three remaining branches everybody has to apply for new jobs.  All those losing their jobs in the different peripheral regions of the county all have to apply for a job, including those working in the office in Letterkenny.  That is a travesty for people who have bought into this idea.  Unfortunately, there are good people within the banking sector who are getting labelled.  One meets them on the street, their heads are drooping and they feel almost embarrassed in meeting the public, because they have all been categorised into that grouping.On the question of international confidence, why is NAMA not being rolled out fast enough?  Why is the simple transaction of moving loans from one balance sheet to another taking so long?  It is raising a sinister question in the minds of many people, namely, whether there are reasons for the delays in moving these loans.  It happened quickly enough in other countries where banks were bailed out and loan books moved.  While it does not happen expeditiously international investors will ignore this country.  This does not inspire confidence.  The banks are being left in a vacuum.  Deputy Connaughton pointed out the reality, namely, that they are not lending.  They are not even lending to good customers with 40 years of seamless credit behind them, who never reneged on a loan or a repayment.  It is a disaster, as the Minister of State appreciates, coming as he does from a constituency such as Clare.  When commerce grinds to a halt it is disaster.  Commerce is not happening.  There is no movement of any kind.  In fairness to the auctioneers they are trying hard to talk up the economy, saying it is bottoming out and so on.  Perhaps it is, but commerce has ground to a halt and local economies are in trouble.While I should have preferred if the Minister for Finance were present, I am glad the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen is here.  He has a good name in the fishing sector because he has met the different fisheries representative groups.  The Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, has gone to Greencastle, Castletownbere and various places throughout this island nation.  He has travelled to such places and he is aware of the issues.  I call on him to use his influence to get rid of the regulation grid lock in terms of quotas and days at sea.  We should consider small ideas in the shellfish and marine sectors, where people have ideas about how to get back to work and what we should be doing at coastal level.  It may be of interest to the Green Party to note the need for a review of the whole philosophy at a European level.  We went down the road of bigger boats, smaller nets and bigger catches.  We should try to facilitate the small men and boats traditionally involved in the marine sector.  Let us consider the small options and start to work from the bottom because to get this country out of the logjam in which it finds itself, we must get back to basics very quickly.
#MaryWhite	unknown-#MaryWhite-party	unknown-#MaryWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	531	I wish to share time with Deputies Cuffe and Cyprian Brady.  I am pleased to have this time to speak on the Bill.  There have been many implications for the budget, which was very difficult for all of us.  It was an attempt to stabilise our public finances, improve our competitiveness, give stimulus to our economy and protect our nation's most vulnerable people, while ensuring our wealthiest make a greater contribution to the financing of the country.  The budget addresses several environmental challenges, to which some speakers have alluded earlier, by investing in environmental protection, the green economy and tackling climate change at national level through the introduction of a carbon levy.Failure to take the tough, necessary and painful decisions in December would have helped no one.  By tackling the tough measures now, we hope the Government is on a good track to ensure we can protect future generations from a great saddle-load of debt.  This year, the interest on our national debt will be €5 billion.  While many people are experiencing the real difficulties of unemployment and low incomes, the country would not thank us in the long run had we shirked our duties to confront the problem of a State living well beyond its means.  The Government has worked hard to balance austerity with protection.  While there were cuts in welfare, there were also protections such as the protection of child benefit rates for those with no income other than social welfare.  Where a carbon levy has been introduced there has been increased spending, amounting to 11%, to protect against fuel poverty, and spending on rural transport schemes.  Since education is the central to investment in the future of the country, I am pleased the Green Party has worked hard in Government to protect funding.I refer to certain sections of the Finance Bill, including those related to the increased progressiveness of the taxation code.  Such measures are to be welcomed.  Section 22 contains provisions to increase the effective rate of income tax from 20% to 30% for those at income levels in excess of €400,000 or those who avail of tax reliefs.  This is a step in the right direction.  While some of these individuals are injecting considerable investment into the economy, that is not reason enough to indemnify them from paying their fair share.  The graduated structure of the income levy is another example of the increased progressiveness in the tax code which my party has tried to ensure.I refer to a separate section of our society that should contribute its fair share, namely, our so-called tax exiles.  I spoke about this issue during the debate on the 2009 Finance Bill.  It is not morally sustainable for people to fully benefit from participation in our society while enjoying the financial convenience of tax immunity elsewhere.I am pleased to see the introduction of the income levy for Irish-domiciled citizens.  The Revenue Commissioners will have to be rather vigilant because efforts to conceal the worldwide income levels of some people will be vigorous.  There may be difficulties with the valuation of Irish-located properties as well, but the challenges must be met.  In a time when the country has only a modest income, it is not sustainable to have people in Ireland paying no tax while living somewhere else on paper.  I am disappointed Deputy Burton is not in the Chamber this evening.  Contrary to what the Deputy might believe, this measure is not a product of campaigning by the Labour Party, it is because of the Green Party in government.  We made progress last year with the ending of the so-called Cinderella clause related to time spent by exiles in this country, and now we have secured the introduction of the levy.With this Bill we have made progress in developing the green economy, contrary to the remarks of some Opposition Deputies this evening.  The additions to the list of accelerated capital allowances for businesses investing in renewable and efficient energy systems are welcome.  We can help meet our national targets of a 20% reduction in energy use and sourcing 40% of our electricity from renewables by 2020 with such incentives, which encourage small and large firms throughout the country to make changes to their energy systems.  This, in turn, increases the competitiveness of such firms.The introduction of the carbon levy is a welcome development, as I remarked earlier, as is the increase in funding to combat fuel poverty.  Other Deputies referred to the problem of fuel tourism in Border areas, a matter that must be examined.  The timing of the commencement order for the levy's application on home heating fuels provides for a balance between influencing our attitudes to carbon and protection of the vulnerable.  Many have spoken about this measure and its likely impact.  We cannot escape the need to de-carbonise our society.  If we do not de-carbonise our country, it will be done for us.I refer to the experiences of other countries such as Sweden, where a carbon tax of 10% was introduced.  The resulting reduction in carbon dioxide emissions in parallel with a great economic development with growth in excess of 50% demonstrates such measures may be a positive experience for an economy.  The levy makes renewables more competitive and incentivises the use of cleaner forms of energy.  I trust the Minister of State will note there is an anomaly here, especially in respect of the levy on bio-fuels.  An exemption for blends of 10% bio-fuel component or more is not feasible.  We need an amendment to the Bill to maintain the incentive for bio-fuels at the conventional 4% to 7% component in motor fuels.  As the Acting Chairman is aware, I have been driving a pure plant oil car for years.  There should not be a levy on the bio-fuel component of fuels.  It does not make environmental or economic sense.  By imposing it on bio-fuel blends less than 10%, we will guarantee that there will be no further investment in an indigenous bio-fuel industry because blends above 7% are not saleable in Ireland.Speaking as a former business person, the Bill provides good supports for businesses which are struggling to cope at this critical time.  The Government should help viable businesses and encourage them in the future.  The extension of corporation tax relief for start-ups is welcome and will, hopefully, encourage those who are considering new enterprises at this time.I welcome the ending of certain tax shelters and reliefs in this Bill and the new powers given to the Revenue to execute its work more probingly.  In particular, section 145 is important to ensure the work of NAMA and the Revenue Commissioners is co-ordinated.  The Government must ensure NAMA does not become a vehicle for people to construct tax avoidance scams.In the context of the current and often misleading debate about the implications of the new Planning and Development Bill before the House I welcome section 24, which amends section 649B of the principal Act and relates to windfall gains.  The move to apply the 80% windfall tax on any gains attributable to a material contravention by a planning authority is welcome.  I refer to Deputy Rabbitte's risible comment here approximately one hour ago regarding the need to protect the Green Party.  The Deputy should note we can take care of ourselves.  It may be of interest to the House that a material contravention was proposed for the local area plan of Muine Bheag, County Carlow recently.  The only people who voted for it were Labour Party councillors.  In Government, we are reforming the planning system——

There was considerable revenue from car sales, VAT and construction.  Those in opposition during the boom said we needed to spend more in many areas and those in Government used a huge amount of the money available for current spending.  Not enough time was taken by all of us to consider what would happen after the boom.  The Green Party, when in opposition, asked how one could create a more steady economy and steadier taxation measures.  It was hard to get that point across.In government, we are seeing a shift away from the good-time taxes.  They are few and far between now and it is right to apply taxation to valuable resources that cost us a lot of money and which involve a lot of carbon emissions.As an environmentalist, I am guided by the principle that the "polluter pays".  Charging for the carbon that is polluting our atmosphere is a useful way of focusing our minds on how we can adapt our behaviour to live in harmony with the world's natural resources.When we use electricity to charge our telephones or watch television, we are already paying an implicit carbon charge.

The more carbon the fuels contain, the greater the charge.

Such a levy will also bring stability to our tax base and ensure that we are not as susceptible to the sharp decline in the moneys used to pay for Government services.  At €15 per tonne of carbon, it will add four cent to a litre of petrol, for example, and should cost households from €3 to €5 per week.  While this is not a massive amount it is important to ensure that the effects on the most vulnerable in society are mitigated. The carbon levy will generate moneys for insulating homes, alleviating fuel poverty and providing better public transport.

When the economy slows drastically, so does the revenue from consumption taxes.  A carbon levy will broaden the tax base, stabilising the source of money used to pay for State services.  By contrast with income tax, which as a tax on labour can have the effect of discouraging employment, a carbon levy taxes the bad stuff, so to speak, and will gradually move us toward low-carbon alternatives.

For the past 18 months, this economy has been bombarded with challenges associated with how we function as a country and pay for the provision of public services.  This Bill must ensure that all sectors of society make a contribution at this particularly dangerous time for the country.  It is now being recognised internationally that the measures taken over the past 18 months, while painful for everybody, are stabilising and will stabilise the economy.  This is the case although nobody likes to see people suffering as a result of cuts or changes to welfare payments.Members should recall December 2008 when the Taoiseach announced and launched the smart economy document.  He set out clearly what we had to do, when we had to do it and how it should be done.  In the subsequent debate, the Tánaiste began one of her speeches by stating the measures being taken were about "jobs, jobs, jobs".  This is still the case.With the unemployment rate of 13% that has been forecast, we cannot afford to take any further hits.  We must plan for the future and position ourselves where we were before the recession hit us.  The targeted measures in the Bill to keep people in employment, create jobs and educate the workforce to take advantage of whatever opportunities arise can only be welcomed.Delegations appear before the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment, of which I am a member, to explain how hard it is to do business and how much they are snowed under by red tape and bureaucracy.  It is up to us to change that, and the measures we take to do that can only be welcomed.We must keep the balance between our low tax burden and the economy we enjoyed while continuing to provide the essential services that people have come to expect from the Government, and the public service has a major role to play in that regard.I have been operating advice centres for many years.  We are back to the time when young men, and older men who have been let go from their jobs, came in with their CVs looking for employment.  Public servants also have come in, not to complain but to state that they felt they were being targeted.  As a direct result of some of the changes that had to be made, which are particularly painful for everybody on all sides of the House, these measure will ensure that we come out of the position in which we find ourselves.We must compete internationally and build up a positive reputation.  In recent years we built up a significant reputation internationally as a good place to do business.  This is the time to be out there selling Ireland.  We did it previously and we can do it again.  Tourism Ireland, whose representatives came before the Joint Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs today, is selling Ireland abroad every day of the week.  That is what we must do.I welcome the change in Revenue's powers, particularly in regard to tobacco smuggling.  That is a major issue and is one we must deal with.

#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	596	The Acting Chairman might remind me when my time is coming to an end.There was a commitment in the budget that this would be a pro-employment Finance Bill.  There is nothing in this Bill that demonstrates that aspiration.  We expected something would be done regarding employers' PRSI but it has not been done.On one side of Leinster House there are mostly "To Let" signs.  I have never seen as many "To Let" signs since coming to Dublin 27 years ago.  On the other side of the building the signs are "To Rent".  That is manifested throughout the country.In recent weeks I have never had as many small businesses contacting me that cannot get finance from the banks, that are in serious trouble in terms of their rent, the tax man and even the council in respect of charges.  Those small businesses will be closing their doors.  I listened to the debate on the monitor and heard a number of speakers refer to finance being available from banks.  The banks have closed down at this stage.  They did not do it before Christmas.  Obviously, they waited to see what would happen over Christmas, but Christmas was a disaster in many instances, especially for small restaurants and shops.  A serious issue now arises that is not fully understood by people who do not move outside urban areas.When we debated the NAMA legislation last summer, I recall saying that NAMA would be there to rescue the banks, which it did in one way, but it would not guarantee any finance for small businesses.  What I forecast then has been confirmed.There was also a major commitment to research and development and intellectual property in the budget, but I see nothing in this Finance Bill that will give that incentive.  If we are to compete in the future with China and India we must provide jobs in intellectual property and other high end jobs if we are to succeed.  There is no provision in this Finance Bill that will guarantee that.The unemployment problem is spiralling out of control.  With all the jobs that will be lost in small businesses, I am convinced that by the end of this year the unemployment figure will be well over 500,000.  That is a staggering figure.  I do not know what those people will be doing when they are trying to find work or how they will pass the time, pay their mortgages, look after their families and so on.  Nationally, the figure for January is 436,936.  In terms of the figures for Kerry, in January 2009 it was 13,303.  In January this year it increased by 3,615 or 27.2%.  It is now 16,918.  That is a record figure in the history of Kerry.  Even in the bad times of the 1980s there were factories in Kerry and things were happening.  There was emigration and we lost many young people, but something was happening.  It is not happening now.Previous speakers mentioned the fact that the IDA has not created any jobs in their areas.  The IDA has not introduced a single new industry to Kerry in the past ten years.  Even during the time of the Celtic tiger the IDA brought itineraries to Limerick but in the main to Cork, especially when the Minister, Deputy Micheál Martin, was there, but not to Kerry.  We got 13 itineraries in five years and I am sure most of those were golf tourists.  They came to Kerry on the pretence of looking at sites but the real reason was to play golf on some of our links.  It has been a disaster from a Kerry point of view.  Kerry has been off the map in terms of Government and IDA policy.I want to refer to one issue in particular, and I am sorry that my Green Party colleagues are not here because it concerns the carbon tax.  At this time there is no great incentive for people in this country to get into the area of bio-fuel energy.  I know that because Federico Pucciariello, who played with Munster as prop, has returned to Argentina to set up a bio-fuel energy business, Rosario Energy.  He had great attachment to Munster and would love to do something similar here but having examined it and got experts to look at it, it would not be viable.  On the one hand the Green Party talks about developing bio-fuel energy but, on the other, it is imposing a carbon tax that will impact on the bio-fuel sector.  That is a contradiction.Green Biofuels Ireland Ltd in County Wexford recently made a good presentation to the joint committee.  It has proposed a number of amendments that no doubt will be promoted by Deputies representing Wexford.  A representative of that company said it is inappropriate to impose a carbon tax on a renewable green fuel that reduces carbon.  He further stated that the biodiesel produced by Green Biofuels Ireland Ltd., some 30,000 tonnes annually, will make up approximately 50% of the biodiesel element of the obligation we will introduce under the Energy (Biofuel Obligation and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2010.  He also said it reduces carbon emissions by 90,000 tonnes annually and should not attract a carbon tax levy.On the one hand, we are trying to encourage people to produce bio-fuels but, on the other, we are taxing them.  We are introducing an obligation that 4% of transport fuels will comprise bio-fuels but we are giving the sector a disincentive.  I hope the Minister of State will bring that to the attention of the Minister.
#FrankFeighan	unknown-#FrankFeighan-party	unknown-#FrankFeighan-dob	unknown-#FrankFeighan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	597	This Bill will do nothing to get credit flowing to small and medium-sized businesses.  In the past ten years most small and medium-sized businesses took their eye off the ball when told to diversify into property investment and blue-chip shares in Irish banks to make up for pension provisions.  When the whole bubble burst, many of those self-employed or small enterprises went bankrupt.  What is obscene about this economic downturn is that those people who got out of bed before eight o'clock every morning to better themselves, create employment and add to the economy are now pariahs.  Most of the self-employed have nowhere to turn.  The banks have put the boot in and they cannot get any social welfare benefits.  They do not have the currency to get back on the first steps of the ladder to recreate the economy.  The economy can only be saved by those entrepreneurial and innovative people.  However, because the banks have turned the screw and decided to repair their balance sheets, the country has lost the cohort that will take the risks and work around to clock to create employment.  That very skills-set is now redundant.These businesses were good customers of the banks but are now considered bad ones.  National Irish Bank, licensed by the Central Bank, despite having 40% of banking business in Roscommon has closed down eight of nine branches there.  It claims it wants to be a cashless bank.  The branch on my road has not issued a loan since last January because the bank will pull out of this country.  There is nothing the Government can or will do about it.  When its staff are laid off, they will go on social welfare.  Unless we can change how the country thinks and works, we will end up a basket economy.Recently I lodged a cheque from the State into my current account which will take five days to clear.  Due to this delay, 15 cheques that I issued just after lodging that cheque will be returned to me by my bank at a charge of €15 per cheque with the claim of insufficient funds available.  I have raised this issue five times with the Minister for Finance but nothing has been done about it.  The Government has no interest in the self-employed, the people who created the economy.  It is only interested in its own survival and for the banks to repair their balance sheets.I agree the non-principal residence tax is a good idea for raising moneys for local authorities.  However, having visited the Roscommon Associations in Manchester, Birmingham and London, I know many emigrants feel let down that the little house they have back in Ireland, some without even electricity or running water, will be charged this tax.  They want to be good citizens but the local authorities are insisting they pay the €200 tax.  That is an insult to the Irish diaspora which actually helped rebuild this country by sending money back from abroad.  The Government must apologise to those emigrants in the United States and the United Kingdom who have tried to keep a link with this country by keeping a small house, some times just a pile of stones, for not considering them when introducing this tax.  It must be amended because the local authorities have not considered all factors involved.Action needs to be taken against the lucrative black economy in tobacco smuggling.  We know the Government loses millions in revenue each year because of this.  What we know is often only one tenth of what we should know.  I welcome the prosecutions that have so far been taken.  However, the Government has created a market in illegal tobacco smuggling which must be more seriously tackled.The Finance Bill contains many stealth taxes.  Credit must flow again for businesses.  The banks must be asked some hard questions.  The Government has no difficulty in letting the banks close down businesses and, therefore, putting people on the unemployment lines yet it has not asked the banks the hard questions.  I have heard it talk about doing so for the past two years but nothing has been done about getting credit flowing again.
#TerenceFlanagan	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-party	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-dob	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	598	Like my colleagues on this side of the House, I find the Finance Bill to be a disappointing follow-up to the cruel December budget imposed on lower paid public servants, the blind, the disabled and others.  The Fine Gael Party disagrees with the budget's measures and last night tabled a motion on Private Members' business on the inequitable move in which higher paid civil servants took less of a pay cut than lower paid civil servants.The Bill imposes more stealth taxes on households and motorists.  Regrettably, it does not contain a jobs policy to get people back to work and contribute taxes so as to ease the tax burden on other workers.  The Fine Gael Party produced a comprehensive policy on transforming the economy, which was, of course, criticised by Ministers.  It proposed the establishment of a new holding company, New Era, to invest in a new green energy infrastructure such as wind and wave energy production and the water infrastructure.  The latter has become crucially important considering events after Christmas with water shortages and 43% of supplies being lost through leaks in the pipe network.  Moneys from the National Pensions Reserve Fund, loans from the European Investment Bank and the sell-off of non-essential State companies would be used to fund the programme which would create up to 100,000 new jobs.  Yesterday, the Minister for Finance admitted the unemployment rate could reach 13% later this year, putting Ireland's rate at the second highest in the eurozone.  Why the Government will not seriously reassess the Fine Gael programme is beyond me.The Bill extends relief on capital gains tax for three years to new companies established in 2010, a welcome provision.  However, the Bill does not address credit flow and helping small businesses which are in difficulties.  The Minister for Finance must do more to resolve their plight.  No provision is made for giving a PRSI break to employers who take on new employees.  The new powers to be given to the Revenue Commissioners are to be welcomed.  It is hard to understand why this was not considered earlier when it was known there was much tobacco smuggling.My party also has stated that people cannot be consistently taxed to the hilt while seeking to get the economy out of a recession, yet that seems to be exactly what the Minister is doing here.  He is hitting households hard, with VAT being imposed at 13.5% on waste collection and on recycling, while motorists also will be hit with higher off-street parking and motorway toll charges.  Ordinary households will find it much more difficult.  In Fine Gael's alternative budget of December last, we stated we would cut the VAT rate down to 10% to stimulate services and get things moving again.The Bill implements six recommendations from the Commission on Taxation but ignores some of the other recommendations in the commission's report, principally about lowering the stamp duty rate which applies to house purchases.  Clearly, if we want to get some kind of housing market moving again in this country, the Government must look at the way stamp duty is impacting on ordinary home buyers.There is nothing in the Bill for the unemployed, to help them retrain and to contribute again, and also to help them receive further education.  That needs to be looked at again.We have not turned the corner.  Unfortunately, this year will be much more difficult for many people.  I welcome the extension of the moratorium on housing repossession.  Clearly, solutions must be found because all it will do is defer the inevitable where we have a problem with people paying mortgage arrears.  A proper jobs policy must be looked at, and perhaps the Government can look again Fine Gael's proposal.

#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	601	I welcome the opportunity of speaking on the Finance Bill 2010.  Before I speak on the specifics of the Bill, it is important to look at the context in which it comes before us.  It's main purpose is to give legal effect to the budget we passed here in December.The main issues framing the Bill are to ensure that the Government took steps to stabilise the budget deficit in a fair way, to safeguard those worst hit by the recession and to stimulate crucial sectors of the economy to sustain and create new jobs.On taxation, because that is essentially what a finance Bill deals with, tax increases have been highly progressive and the rates cannot increase much further.  The top 4% of earners will pay 48% of all income tax and 50% of earners will pay no income tax at all, which is important to bear in mind.  There has been a big change in that pattern in recent times.  Three years ago, one third of income earners paid no tax, one third paid at the 20% rate and one third paid at the top rate.  The position has changed dramatically in recent times.  It probably has to do with many people who are in part-time jobs not on the higher rate of tax.  Essentially, there is a higher marginal rate of tax, at 52% for employees and 55% for the self-employed.A new system will be introduced on PRSI.  There will be a universal social contribution to replace PRSI, the health levy and the income levy and it will be paid by everyone at a low rate, but on a wide basis.  That will come into effect in 2011 and it was included in the Budget Statement.  Income tax will then apply on a progressive basis to those with higher incomes.That is the general background and framework of the Bill.  I will refer now to a couple of individual issues I am keen to see are included in the Bill.The Finance Bill introduces relief from the income levy for 2010 and subsequent years for certain capital expenditure incurred by farmers in meeting the requirements of the EU Nitrates Directive.  After the budget over 12 months ago, one of the biggest issues raised with me by farmers in my constituency was that they could not deduct capital allowances in respect of the income levy.  Many of them had invested up to €100,000 under the farm waste management scheme over the previous year or two.  Notwithstanding the generous Government grants, there was a big net investment by the individual farmers.  It is recognised that this was only done to meet the EU Nitrates Directive and to address environmental issues.  It has not increased farm output and it is good that such investment is being allowed to be offset against the income levy introduced last year.Another farmer taxation issue is that the definition of a qualifying farmer for a number of issues to get especially enhanced stock relief at 100% for the period of four years is now being broadened.  Up to now, a person had to hold what is known as a green certificate, but the definition now adds the bachelor of agricultural science — agri-environmental sciences — awarded by University College Dublin to the qualifications already covered by this section.  I have met people working at farming who held a bachelor of agricultural science but did not technically hold the green certificate and who were excluded from those provisions.  It is good to see that loose end being tidied up here on this occasion.A big issue is that section 11 will abolish the relief from 2011 onwards in respect of service charges due to local authority and those providing waste collection services.  Up until now, people could get tax relief on their bin charges.  The Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, of which I am Chairman, discussed at length this topic of household waste collection.  The Ombudsman published a report on the matter over a year ago and arising from her report, we discussed and compared the cost of the collection of waste services and the charges per household in the different local authorities.  There was a marked difference in the charge to the householders depending on whether it was being collected by the local authority or by the private sector.  For instance, almost 20 years ago my county privatised the service entirely and the local authority has not had a refuse collection bin lorry since then.  That has led to another anomaly on VAT.  Where I live in Castletown, I was able to obtain each year tax relief at 20% on my refuse collection charge, which, at €396, is very expensive, but my immediate next-door neighbours who are on social welfare could get no tax relief because they were not paying income tax.  It was wrong.  I stated on the record here that it was wrong that myself and others with reasonable and high incomes could get tax relief on their waste collection charges when people who were on social welfare or who did not have a taxable income were not able to get it.  I suggested that perhaps granting people on social welfare an amount for waste collection in the social welfare household benefits package, which includes free electricity units and free television licence, to equalise the situation might have been one way of addressing it but, because of the changed economic situation, the decision has been made to level the playing pitch between myself and my neighbour by removing the tax relief for people like myself.  If that is the price I must pay for equality, it is only fair.  It is correcting an unfair system.That leads me neatly on to another matter.  Myself — I take myself as an example — everybody in County Laois and several hundred thousand householders throughout the country have our refuse bins collected by a private contractor.  We have always had to pay VAT on that whereas in other local authority areas where it was collected by the local authority, the authority did not have to charge VAT on that service.  That was wrong, made no sense, was illogical and had to be dealt with.  The European Court of Justice stated where a local authority is competing with the private sector for the provision of services such as car parks or refuse collection, if the private collector must pay VAT and he or she is collecting directly on the same street with the local authority, it is only right that the local authority should have to pay VAT.  Many people will be in a hullabaloo over this issue and the raising of costs, but those of us who have been paying VAT on our charges up to now felt it was slightly anomalous that those in other counties did not pay VAT for the same service.  In a way, I am pleased the anomaly is being removed.This Bill contains several initiatives to improve Ireland's competitive position as a good place to invest.  Throughout the Bill, there is a heavy emphasis on collection, restriction of the existing tax reliefs and enforcement.  Changes to corporation tax relief will make it easier for multinationals to locate their headquarters, research departments and patent and copyright facilities in Ireland.  The financial services industry, which is primarily based in the International Financial Services Centre in Dublin city, will benefit from these changes to modernise the tax rules governing the investment of funds.Another worthwhile measure in the Bill is the restriction on tax reliefs for high earner.  For the first time, this measure will ensure there is an effective 30% rate of income tax for those benefitting from various tax reliefs. Time and again, Deputy Burton complained that high income earners had an effective tax rate of 1%, 2% or 3%.  That is being abolished.  High income earners claiming these reliefs will have to pay a minimum of 30% tax, regardless.  It has been increased from 20%.  Even if they are entitled to reliefs, those reliefs will be restricted to ensure they always pay a minimum of 30% tax.The Revenue Commissioners are being granted significant additional powers of investigation, collection and enforcement across all tax headings.  It must be noted that Ireland already has a good compliance record for tax payment by international standards but I always caution that in a recession there is a tendency towards increased activity in the black economy.  The Revenue Commissioners are aware of that and must be extra vigilant to ensure there is not a drift from the white economy to the black economy because of the recession.  This Finance Bill gives extra powers, which are essential on this occasion.
#BeverleyCooperFlynn	unknown-#BeverleyCooperFlynn-party	unknown-#BeverleyCooperFlynn-dob	unknown-#BeverleyCooperFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	602	Like my colleague, I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Finance Bill 2010.  My colleague set out the context in which this Bill has come about, namely, to give legal effect to the December budget which brought about cuts of more than €4 billion.  It was probably the toughest budget this House has ever seen.  This was set against the background of the number of unemployed being in excess of 430,000.  This is a very regrettable situation, in particular in my home town of Castlebar where today the Halifax Building Society informed people they will lose their jobs by the end of July.  The National Irish Bank branch further down the street will close at the end of the year.  This is an unfortunate consequence of the terrible banking situation in which we find ourselves.Many people are in trouble with their mortgages.  We all know of the problems people face in regard to business.  It is now time for us to rebuild and focus our attention on maintaining and creating jobs.  I disagree with my colleague opposite who said this Bill does nothing in regard to creating and maintaining jobs.  Several measures have been introduced between the budget and the Finance Bill which go a long way towards doing just that.As announced at the time of the budget, €130 million in funding was provided to create 26,000 training places.  Some €165 million was provided, through the stabilisation fund, for the temporary employment subsidy scheme in 2010.  The second phase of that job subsidy scheme will be implemented in the coming weeks and we hope it will provide many small, medium and large businesses with valuable supports at this point.  In my constituency, many companies have applied for that assistance and it will make a huge difference when it becomes available.We are maintaining our low tax base which has been a huge factor in, and benefit to, our economy with a corporation tax rate of 12.5%.  I welcome the extension of the scheme of tax exemption on income and gains of new start-up companies for the first three years.  This will be now available to companies which commence trade in 2010.  That is a very welcome development.  I also welcome the reduction of 0.5% in VAT.  It is a small but important confidence building measure which has been greatly welcomed by the retail sector.  We hope it will have some impact in terms of retaining jobs in that sector.One cannot discuss the Finance Bill 2010 or the budget without referring to the public sector pay cuts which have been tough, in particular on the lower paid.  That must be acknowledged.  It has been tough on everybody in society but in particular on lower paid people and that is why I am pleased that, under section 22, the high earners will have to pay more.  That was spelled out in the budget and it is being given legal effect in this Bill.  People availing of the tax incentive schemes will have to contribute more in these difficult circumstances.  In 2010, the effective rate of income tax for those benefiting from these reliefs will be increased from 20% to 30% on top of which they will also pay PRSI and levies.While I am on the subject of allowances and incentive schemes, it is important we recognise that while many of these allowances are being abolished, they have a place, in particular when they provide for very important infrastructure in our economy.  Today, as a member of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children, I attended the launch of the primary care report which hopes to see in excess of 500 primary care teams set up in the coming years.  There is a very important role for the private sector in building these primary care centres.  It is an important investment in the health infrastructure of our economy and it is of real benefit to the ordinary people.  At a time when there is no capital available from Government to build these centres, this needs to be seriously considered.  The Minister for Health and Children, when she addressed the committee today, referred to that fact and said she would support it.  I would like the Minister to consider that in the near future, if possible.I welcome the domicile levy in section 141 which has been spoken about in this House in the past.  All Irish nationals with a worldwide income in excess of €1 million and whose Irish-located capital is greater than €5 million will be required to pay an Irish domicile levy of €200,000 per annum, regardless of where they are tax resident.  These measures show we are serious about tackling the high earners.  It is important that they are seen to pay more, in particular when we are taking money from the lower paid through public sector pay reductions.  It is important those measures work and are effective.The farming community has been going through a very difficult time in recent years.  There is no money to be made across many sectors, whether milk, beef or sheep.  In my constituency, a large number of farmers are in REPS — in fact, the highest number in the country — and many of them are on, or below, the average income for farming.  It has been very tough and, therefore, I welcome the income levy exemption for expenditure incurred by farmers under the farm waste management in section 2.  This is an important measure.  The Government invested more than €1.1 billion in the farm waste management scheme.  The scheme was set up to improve our environment and I welcome that income levy exemption, which is an important measure.One can discuss the merits and demerits of the carbon tax, but I would like to bring to the Minister's attention how it impacts on the farming community.  From 10 December 2009, the carbon tax applied to fuel, oil, natural gas and peat briquettes.  However, it will apply to other fuels, including farm diesel, from 1 May 2010.  The farming community is extremely concerned about this and I have received many representations from it in my area.  It estimates that it will increase farm production costs by €13.2 million in one year.  Will the Minister consider this at a time when the farming community is already struggling in terms of its income?  While I welcome the fact that the Minister made provision in the budget for those not availing of REPS 4, in that they can now get up to €5,000 under the new agri-environment scheme, I ask him to reconsider the date for commencement in regard to farm diesel because of the impact it will have on the farming community.I refer to the windfall tax of 80%, with which I disagree.  Any tax of 80% is crazy.  By the time one adds any additional costs involved for the disposal of land, the overall tax take increases to approximately 90%.  It is inequitable, unreasonable and unworkable and I hope it will be removed in the foreseeable future.  It should not be included in the Bill.On job protection, I welcome the fact that the Bill contains a number of measures to restore confidence in some industries which have been dying on their feet.  I refer in particular to the car industry.  It is worth bearing in mind that in my constituency there were as many people working in the car industry as were working in the construction industry.  Sadly, thousands of those jobs have gone in recent times.  The introduction in section 102 of the car scrappage scheme which, in effect, reduces the price of a new car by €1,500 when a ten year old car is traded in and scrapped is a welcome measure.  It is something for which we have asked for the past number of years and it is long overdue.  It has come too late, unfortunately, for many companies but I welcome its introduction.I also welcome the changes regarding the extension to mortgage interest relief in section 6, which gives some help to people who have been struggling with their mortgages.  As Deputy Feighan mentioned, it is not popular or cool to discuss the construction industry and how we might support it at the current time.  One can discuss property developers ahead of any company, but we often forget that beneath that there are many thousands of people, such as blocklayers, plasterers, plumbers or electricians who are out of work and are currently in a very difficult position.  We have to do something to kick-start our construction industry, whether through the introduction of allowances for, as I mentioned earlier, the creation of new primary care centres around the country or the building of schools.  It is important that at a time when costs are lower than they have been for some time that we introduce such measures.The solidarity bond is something about which I wrote to the Minister for Finance approximately 14 months ago.  I welcome its introduction in Finance Bill 2010 in order that ordinary people can now contribute to the funding of our economy.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	603	The Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance must be very grateful for the news sensation of this past week, that is, the departure of George Lee from the Dáil and Fine Gael.  It has taken the public eye, in some considerable measure, off what I can only describe as a rotten Finance Bill.  It is yet another chapter in the story of this Government's disastrous mismanagement of the economy.  George Lee's decision is ironic given the former Deputy's proclaimed passion was for fixing the economy.I do not want to discomfit Deputy O'Donnell, but if George Lee wanted to bring about something radically different from the Fianna Fáil-led Governments of the past 12 and a half years he made a strange choice in going to Fine Gael because there is little basic policy difference between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.  Perhaps George Lee decided to go before people started talking about Tweedledum and Tweedle-Lee.  It is a question on which I will leave the Labour Party to ponder as it eyes up its hoped-for Fine Gael partner in Government after the general election.  In the meantime those of us who remain in the Dáil representing our constituents have to deal with reality and this Finance Bill is a very harsh reality indeed, and there is no way of prettying it up.This Bill implements a savage budget which targeted the weakest in our society to pay for the economic mess created by the wealthiest.  It has targeted children with cuts in child benefit and education.  It has penalised carers and others dependent on social welfare.  It has hit medical card holders, hospital patients and PRSI workers.  The Government, to put it bluntly, is making war on public service workers and on young people.  Our youth are bearing the worst of the unemployment crisis and have started to emigrate in droves once again.  What is the Government's solution?  It is not to retain or create jobs but, rather, to cut social welfare supports for the young unemployed.  Well over one in four young men between the ages of 18 and 24 are now unemployed in this State.  In this dire situation disadvantaged communities are being penalised with cuts to community infrastructure such as drugs projects and payments for people on community employment and jobs initiative schemes.All the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance seem capable of doing is wringing their hands and shrugging their shoulders.  That is their reaction to the latest disaster, namely, the loss of 750 jobs in the Halifax chain, on which I and other Opposition Deputies pressed the Taoiseach earlier.  It did not ambush the Government; it was long signalled.  Where is the promised new accountability of the financial institutions?  Why are employers allowed to throw workers onto the street in this manner?  Most importantly, what is the Government going to do to save these jobs, the livelihoods of 750 workers and their dependents?On top of all that the Government has already imposed on the people it now imposes even more in this Finance Bill.  One of the most far-reaching and punitive provisions is the removal of the VAT exemption from local authority charges.  People will face increases of 13.5% in local authority waste charges, parking charges, charges for the use of leisure facilities and so on.  We learn in the media today that the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government stated in a circular that a whole range of other charges will be also subject to the VAT increase.The extension of VAT to public bodies will increase the cost of living for already hard-pressed householders and businesses.  The fact this is an EU directive validates the argument which Sinn Féin made against the introduction of these charges at the outset.  The power to administer them has been taken from local level and now from national level, and outsourced to Brussels which is more concerned about the profits of private enterprise than the provision of much needed services.  How much more control will the Department hand over to Brussels in the coming years?  We have already learned, to our great cost, that the European Union's one-size-fits-all approach does not work.  The ECB's interest rates and their impact on the property bubble is proof of that.This VAT dictat is a monstrous example of how the European Union has been allowed to ride roughshod over Irish democracy.  The abolition of the VAT exemption for local authorities in this Bill arises from a European Court of Justice ruling which claimed that the exemption was unfair to private operators.  What we have here is the driving through of the privatisation agenda, and what a farce it is.The supporters of unbridled privatisation and competition for State and local government services claim it will lead to cheaper prices for the consumer.  However, the exact opposite is happening.  As a result of this ruling money will be taken out of the pockets of already over-burdened Irish taxpayers.  It is an outrage against democracy because it is our right as Irish legislators -or so I always believed — to exempt Irish local authorities from VAT if we so decided and we should accept no outside dictation on this matter.The Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Hanafin, is reported as having urged local authorities to be sympathetic to social welfare recipients when setting rates of refuse charges.  She cited the waiver system operated by many local authorities but the waiver system is totally inadequate.  In 2008, the Ombudsman investigated the waste waiver schemes operated by local authorities and described the system as a shambles.  She found that seven local authorities have no waiver system of any kind in place on the grounds that the service is provided exclusively by private operators.  Others only give waivers for refuse that is not collected by private operators.  One county has three different waiver schemes in place while the average value of the waiver varied from €40 to €357.  The three Ministers, Deputies Mary Hanafin, Brian Lenihan and John Gormley, should recall the words of the Ombudsman in that report.  She said this "highlights a significant social policy deficit, with local authorities increasingly driven by commercial considerations, while the needs of the poorest and most vulnerable people in society suffer".The Government has not implemented the recommendations of the Ombudsman's report and in this Finance Bill it is imposing a further VAT burden on top of local authority charges.  We in Sinn Féin totally reject the Government's cave-in to the EU on this issue.  Budget 2010 was a deflationary budget based on cuts to public expenditure and on contracting the economy to make a dent in the deficit.  It did not contain sufficient measures to stimulate the economy and nor does this Finance Bill.The Government's approach to the economy is not working.  Reducing public spending as opposed to implementing a stimulus plan and a jobs strategy has had no effect on the real economy.  The live register is growing daily.  Banks are still not lending.  Let us make no mistake about that.  The banks are still operating closed shops.  Our competitiveness ranking has not improved.  All the Government's strategy has achieved to date is plaudits from right-wing commentators who enthusiastically promote the application of outdated and disproved economic theory to vulnerable countries.  People do not matter to these commentators who are obsessed with policies that maximise corporate profit.This Bill should have been about an overhaul of a finance system dependent on unreliable indirect taxation such as VAT and stamp duty, a system that previous Fianna Fáil Ministers for Finance designed and implemented.  However, the Government's unwillingness to deal with the tax issue and to upset vested interests is very much on show in this Bill.  Very little of the extremely detailed analysis by the Commission on Taxation is being introduced.  My party does not agree with all the findings of the commission but it examined hundreds of tax reliefs, for example, and found them to have no value to the Exchequer.  Only a handful of tax reliefs are being abolished in this Bill, one being the bin charges tax relief.  This is a relief that helps low income families and only costs a few million euro per year to administer.  One might compare that to the retention of mortgage interest relief for landlords which costs the state €300 million a year.  Once again the Government has allowed wealthier people in this State to carry on untouched by a Finance Bill while ordinary people must continue to bear the brunt of the recession.There are a number of measures in this Bill that will further contract the economy.  The introduction of this carbon tax is a negative because it increases energy costs and adds to an already spiralling cost base.  Environmental taxes should be revenue neutral — as had been promised initially — but this carbon tax is designed to bring money in for the Government and had, therefore, to be agreed between Fianna Fáil and the Green Party before its introduction.This Bill ignores the reality of the economic climate in which we live.  It extends the scheme of tax exemption on the income and gains of new start-up companies, but to what new companies does it refer?  There is no credit available to start-up companies from banks.  Tweaking of the tax system is not useful to these companies when they cannot even come into existence.This is not the only example of mere tweaking in this Bill.  The artists' tax exemption has been reduced but nothing is being changed regarding how decisions on who qualifies for the exemption.  We want those who deserve to qualify and those for whom the tax exemption was introduced to benefit from it.  Over the course of the past year we have seen some strange cases applying and benefiting from the exemption.  Great literary works such as the memoirs of Deputy Bertie Ahern and Gerry Ryan qualified for the scheme.  I always found that there was more craft to Deputy Ahern than art, although his skills were undoubtedly many.  Lo and behold, I noticed at Christmas that his memoirs were available on CD, read by himself.  I considered buying a copy to send to a person I did not like but decided I did not dislike anybody enough to send them such an item in the post.

I have just been watching the RTE and TV3 news programmes to see the latest bad news, which mainly concerned the response of Europe to the Greek situation and its consequences.  This brings home to us the difficult economic situation in the world currently.Deputy Niall Blaney will remember, because he is Co-Chairman of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, that at a recent meeting of the assembly I made the point to colleagues from Northern Ireland, Britain and the islands — I was interested in hearing their reaction — that in each of our jurisdictions and parliaments the problem is all considered the fault of the government and saying otherwise has no impact.  When such a suggestion is put to a body like the assembly, the people from the British Parliament and from the Northern Ireland Assembly understand what I mean.  The current crisis has affected the economies of countries throughout the world; even support for Barack Obama has plummeted and he lost a seat that had been in Democratic hands for almost 50 years.  That is the situation and who knows what will happen in future elections.  The situation has been difficult.I represent the constituency of Dublin South-West and live in Tallaght, which I know is no different in this regard from any other place.  I am keen to represent not only Tallaght here, but also the Dublin region.  I often hear my country colleagues say that everything happens in the Dublin region, but it has suffered and so has Tallaght as a result of the crisis.  I live in a constituency where over 10,000 people now sign on in the local social welfare office.  None of us has been immune from the situation.  I have great concern for those who have been affected.  I do not wish to repeat myself, but I have pointed out on more than one occasion that I try to bring my own experiences to my politics.  I have been made redundant three times in my life, and it may happen me again.  I know what it is like to struggle, to wonder and to worry about the situation.  I have listened to many colleagues talk about the challenges families face and I was the Acting Chairman when Deputy Olwyn Enright made a fine contribution about families under pressure.The Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs, which is chaired by Deputy Healy-Rae and of which I am vice chairman, has examined many such issues in recent times.  Deputies Thomas Byrne and Olwyn Enright have prepared a report, which will be launched next week, which deals with the high level of indebtedness in Irish society.  On a number of recent occasions the committee took the initiative to bring in people to talk about these issues.  For example, it brought in senior staff from the Educational Building Society to discuss how we could deal with these issues.  People are suffering in a way they never did before.  I conduct nine clinics a week where I attend and listen to my constituents.  People come to my clinics who were in jobs up to a year or six months ago.  They had comfortable lives, but now they have suddenly found themselves facing great challenges.  We are all entitled to our personal politics, but we all have a responsibility to deal with those issues and to advise the Government to continue to build confidence, create jobs and invest.I would like to mention three particular issues.  Last night, Deputy Arthur Morgan mentioned special needs assistants.  I acknowledge this is a big issue in Tallaght currently and it has been on the news all week and mentioned on the "Today with Pat Kenny" show and other shows.  St. Joseph's special school in Balrothery faces huge problems because one third of its staff, or more, is threatened by cuts because of a decision which is being appealed.  I have spoken to the Minister for Education and Science and told him that, in my view, the proposed cuts in that school are drastic and should be re-examined.  I use this opportunity to support that school.Second, I would also like to use this opportunity to support the West Tallaght Resource Centre.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, myself and other colleagues attended a public meeting in the centre last week to discuss the difficulties with regard to the possible closure of the centre.  I wish to support the centre and its work.Third, the loss of jobs due to the closure of Halifax Bank was mentioned in the Dáil this morning.  Any visitor to the Square in Tallaght will see the Halifax Bank shop, the official opening of which I attended.  The workers there, to whom I spoke today, are just as devastated as all other Halifax workers here.  It is a shock to Tallaght that these jobs are gone, but I know this shock is repeated throughout the country.  It is important we take the opportunity here to show solidarity with those workers.Members are entitled to make political points in this debate and I am sure colleagues right across the floor will continue to do that.  I will listen to that debate.  However, it is very important that we try to build confidence and move forward.  I look forward to hearing what the Minister will have to say.  Without being patronising, I would like to wish the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, continued success with his endeavours.
#NiallBlaneyIND	unknown-#NiallBlaneyIND-party	unknown-#NiallBlaneyIND-dob	unknown-#NiallBlaneyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	620	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Finance Bill presented by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan.  There has been a major focus in recent times on our financial situation, and rightly so, and many people are uncertain of our ability to pull through the current economic crisis.  While I term it the "current" crisis', it has been with us now for some time, which has led some people to scepticism.  Some people may say that is a natural process for the human psyche.  The process of economic stabilisation has been slow but steady and it will play out over the course of this year and next year.There is no quick fix to our problems.  We are in a global economic downturn, with added banking problems, and must work our way out of it.  That is exactly what we have been doing under the leadership of our Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen.  We found ourselves in a very unfortunate position, but one which has been improving and will continue to do so.  We have faced tough budgets over the past two years, budgets that were neither popular nor painless.  Many people have been affected by the decisions taken in recent budgets, but our job is to put this country back on its feet again and not to get caught up in popularity contests.  I believe history will prove this Government's courage in time.We have taken some inspirational steps in recent months and many people around the world have been watching the outcome of these steps.  Some openly admired the initiative shown by our Government and others have imitated the steps we have taken.  The bank guarantee scheme, the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank, the introduction of NAMA and recent budgets have amounted to positive action.  This is something of which we should be proud.  We have come a long way, but we have further to go and of that there is no doubt.  I am confident we will return to being as strong as ever as a nation if everybody gets behind the wheel.  We must also take heart from the IMF's support of NAMA, which was a bold and original initiative.  It took the crisis by the scruff of the neck and promoted a valid solution.  This is what real politics is about, not the populist shouting across the Chamber we unfortunately see so much of.  There was more of that tonight.I spoke in the House recently about our resilience as a nation and the concept of the Irish "meitheal".  Our mettle as a nation has been tested in recent times and it is against these tests that we show our true ability.  It is only when we work together that we can show optimal ability as a nation.  It is with this in mind that we must move forward.  We have been let down by our banking system and been wronged by some of those running the system.  However, I look forward to due justice being served upon those deserving of it.  Some Members believe an example should be made of some of these people immediately to show that this type of behaviour is unacceptable.  There is no doubt that some people would feel better about our future if we did that.  However, it is more important that a thorough investigation is held in order to hold up all those responsible as an example of wrongdoing.  None of those involved deserves anything but the full rigour of the law.  That is the approach being undertaken and I look forward to its conclusion.There have always been populist politics and these have been exacerbated throughout this period of economic instability by many in this House.  There has been much talk of bailing out banks and developers.  There is only one group of people the Government is interested in bailing out.  These ordinary individuals in the street, going about their daily business, are the people we intend bailing out, first, by guaranteeing that their savings are safe and, second, by introducing the policies of this Government to reorganise our financial system to ensure that the people have access to credit to meet their needs.There has been much furore over pay cuts for public sector workers of late.  I acknowledge the huge contribution the public sector has made to dealing with our financial predicament in the past 18 months.  It was never about pitching public sector workers against private sector workers.  However, the fact is that thousands of private sectors workers have lost their jobs, many of whom are dependent upon social welfare for the first time in their lives, which is a difficult situation in which to find oneself.  We all know many people who have found themselves in this situation in recent times and we empathise with them.  The more fortunate members of the private sector are striving to hold onto their jobs and they have taken substantial pay cuts, but many are unsure about their futures or how long their jobs will last.It is in these circumstances that we must realise it is not a competition between the public and private sectors.  Frankly, we did not have the money to continue paying the public sector wage bill.  We simply could not afford it.  Changes were imminent.  Nobody wanted to see jobs being lost and, therefore, everybody was asked to contribute.  It was not a pleasant measure to enforce but it was necessary.  Further adjustments may have to be made in this area and I am hopeful discussions can be resumed with the social partners in order to obtain satisfactory measures for all concerned.  Job security is of the utmost importance and must be top of our agenda for any future discussions.The Finance Bill is giving effect to some of the measures announced in the budget last December.  It will give effect to the reduction in VAT from 21.5% to 21%, which will go some way towards helping businesses along the Border, particularly in Donegal, which I represent.  There has been much media coverage of those travelling across the Border for shopping in recent months.  The increase in the UK VAT rate will also assist those in business in such areas.  Furthermore, the decrease in the excise duty on alcohol is a welcome initiative.  Again, coming from Donegal, I am well aware of the difficulties arising from cross-Border trading.  The decrease in the excise duty on alcohol and the VAT rate are considered to be wise incentives.The introduction of the domicile levy of €200,000 on all Irish-domiciled individuals who are Irish citizens to ensure that wealthy Irish-domiciled individuals make a contribution to the State is vital.  There has been much resentment levelled at these individuals in the recent past and this is a welcome move.The challenge of attracting investment and jobs in an increasingly competitive environment is also being addressed in the Bill.  Advantageous taxation measures are being introduced to ensure that Ireland can actively compete against other world leaders, and several tax reliefs are coming into being.  Last week, Jean Claude Trichet, president of the ECB, said that our initiatives are very impressive and similar sentiments have been expressed in various commentaries across the world.In regard to Ireland's financial position and the measures being taken by Government, we will continue to take issues on board and deal with them in such a way that Ireland will be back as a competitive country in which to do business.  With companies such as those highlighted, we should be encouraged as a nation to show our mettle to the rest of the world.  We all acknowledge people are experiencing tough times out there.  We have come a long way and we must take those final steps together to ensure Ireland is back out there as a competitive country.  All positive input is welcome.
#ChrisAndrews	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-party	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-dob	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	621	The Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, last week published the Finance Bill 2010 which gives effect to the measures announced by him in his Budget Statement on 9 December last.  The Bill contains measures that, though clearly difficult, are necessary to stabilise the economy.  It is important to highlight that this Bill also contains many pro-enterprise measures, which have been welcomed both at home and internationally.  As Deputy O'Connor noted, listening to the difficulties being experienced by the Greek economy in particular, and the reluctance of the Greek Government to face up to those difficulties, its position is in sharp contrast to the Irish experience, which has shown we are capable of making and willing to make very difficult decisions.  The Irish Government is being held up in many circles as an example of best practice in tackling the economic difficulties.All parties accepted that savings of €4 billion had to be found in this budget.  Obviously, people will have very different opinions about how this was to be done.  The Government was as fair as it could be and has tried to ensure to the best of its ability that the most vulnerable are protected.The domicile levy of €200,000 was a correct measure, which will see the wealthiest of our society contributing more to help the economy through this difficult period.  Some measures have undoubtedly been difficult for many people, including an unfortunate but necessary reduction in public sector pay.  Overall, while those measures were and are difficult for the people experiencing them, we in this House included, I welcome the decisive action taken by the Cabinet and the Minister for Finance in dealing with the current economic crisis.I am also pleased to point out some very positive initiatives contained in the Bill.  As I said, there are many sensible pro-enterprise measures that will make Ireland a more attractive place to do business.  One of those measures amends the remittance basis of taxation so it will be easier to attract highly qualified managerial or technical people to Ireland to ensure Irish industry operates to world class standards.  Furthermore, the simplifying of the processes to pay dividends and royalties and expanding the tax regime to facilitate international companies locating their headquarters here should increase Ireland's attractiveness to large corporate companies.For small and medium-sized enterprises in operation here in Ireland, a credit system review scheme is to be established which will give SMEs, farm enterprises and sole traders the right to appeal, where an application for credit is refused by a financial institution participating in NAMA, after the bank's own internal process has been finalised.  Under this new scheme, if it is recommended that credit should be granted, the participating institution that refused credit must comply or provide a written explanation for its refusal.  In recent months, I have been contacted by countless SMEs which have informed me of the difficulties they are experiencing in accessing credit.  However, banks have been telling a different story in claiming that they are open for business.  While this new credit system should prevent the banks from fudging the facts, more needs to be done to free up credit to the SME sector.The Tánaiste recently indicated that she might put in place a bank guarantee scheme.  I have previously called for this measure to be implemented and I again put on record my support for the scheme.The Minister for Finance, though having had to find savings, has attempted to do so in the fairest way possible and has also implemented many smart and welcome measures which will benefit Ireland in the long term.  I again commend the Minister for Finance on his hard work and dedication to rectifying Ireland's economy.  I commend the Bill to the House.

I take this opportunity to wish the Minister for Finance a full return to health, which is something all of us in this House and anywhere else should recognise.The other issue that evokes a certain amount of sadness is the impact of the Finance Bill on the people we all represent.  It is sad, after all the money that floated around this country and all of our claims to be one of the richest countries in the world — we were supposed to be the third richest county — that we have come to a situation where each segment in our society is being hit again and again.The Government has proclaimed that there is a crisis, as if an atrocity has been committed and the crisis was created by somebody other than it.  The Government has also proclaimed that there is a world crisis.  There is a bigger one here and it was created by the Government, which is what is sad.  There will come a time when the electorate will have an opportunity to respond.  The Government has adroitly slid away from responsibility and moved into the shadows saying that, while we are in a sad and serious situation, it was unable to control particular matters.  However, it could have done so.At some stage the electorate will connect the two issues, which is important.  If the electorate does not do so, nothing will change and we will be having the same debate in five and ten years time with the same group of people sitting on the Government side complaining about a crisis of some description for which somebody else will be to blame.  The Government has no intention of accepting any responsibility for any crisis.  As a result, the electorate will lose its democratic right to change the Government, leaving it free of responsibility.Reference was made earlier to the carbon tax.  The Green Party told the House how good the carbon tax will be for the people.  Perhaps we should ask some of the people who will be affected by it what they think, including those people who will pay higher prices for their fuel and energy, people who are being already hit in several others by high mortgages, many of which they cannot pay, negative equity and job losses.  The Government is acting as though nothing at all is happening.  I have never before in my life witnessed anything like what is going on.  It is almost as if the public has been hypnotised.  I must keep an eye on the television to see if a subliminal message is being transmitted to lull the people into a false sense of security.  It appears people have an inability to react.Another issue of concern is competitiveness.  We are all aware of our lack of competitiveness for the past eight years.  It is recognised on world markets that we are not competitive.  What do we do?  We introduce a budget and a Finance Bill which makes us less competitive, which is truly extraordinary.  The Government has announced that we have a particular problem and has stated it has no control over it because the same is happening all over the world.  It happened in America and was bound to happen here we are told.  There has been no word about the property boom which carried the economy away as though nothing would ever end.  Perhaps the Acting Chairman will indicate how much time I have left.

#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	626	That is great.  One can do an awful lot of damage in a couple of minutes.The windfall tax was mentioned.  What does the word "windfall" denote?  It is like manna falling from heaven in respect of which there is no penalty; it is all gain and no pain.  It will be great fun to witness the impact of this at local level.  The theory is that this will restrict development at local level.  We have been told there has been too much development.  Another theory is that we should demolish many of the dwellings built because there are too many of them, which is sound economic thinking.  If we keep going as we are there will be fewer people in this country in employment carrying a bigger burden of tax resulting in a constriction of the economy.  This is not the first time this has happened; we seen it all before in the 1980s.  Sadly, we are going down the same road once again.  The Government has learned nothing from the past 20 years.  I do not expect it will learning anything between now and the next time the electorate goes to meet them at the polls.My final point relates to the high level of mortgage interest arrears in this country.  During the debate on NAMA, Members on this side of the House asked that something be done to address the issue of mortgage interest arrears.  So far, nothing has been done.  While a moratorium in respect of house repossessions has been introduced, there is no moratorium on the interest that is clocking up and the arrears being racked up on a daily basis.

On top of this, interest penalties, of up to 9% in some cases, are resulting in their bills growing on a daily basis.  The Government stated it would introduce legislation to deal with this issue.  We are still waiting for it.  We are as near to getting it now as we ever were.  As time goes by it will become evident the Government never had any intention of looking after these people.  Sadly though, it will be too late for the people concerned.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	629	I am a firm believer in people helping themselves.  I do not agree with easy hand-outs which create a spiralling pattern of dependency.  Self help is the route out of poverty.  People must be enabled to help themselves whether personally or in respect of business.This Bill stifles such initiatives and lessens the chance of a quick rise from adversity.  On the one hand, it is a missed opportunity on the part of Government to maintain and create jobs and, on the other, a vehicle for the introduction of stealth taxes.  It is amusing to note that the Minister in the first sentence of his speech yesterday trotted out his usual platitude that the Finance Bill 2010 ensures that all sectors will play their part in the critical task of stabilising the public finances.  Does the Minister really believe this?  Does he believe, given the unequal targeting of the low and middle income workers, that this Bill in any way removes that inequality?  Can he assure us that this Bill will require all sectors of this country to pay their share?  Were that the case, there would be no need for this week's Private Members' motion.  Perhaps higher civil servants and the Judiciary slipped his mind.According to the Institute of Certified Public Accountants in Ireland, CPA, the Bill contains little support for native business and shows the Government to be out of step with the day-to-day realities of our national companies and their employees.  In a Bill designed to enact a budget that is focused on cutting public expenditure and stabilising the budget deficit, little is to be seen by way of effort to support our struggling business community.  Measures such as a reform of the PRSI regime, which acts as a deterrent to employers to increase staffing levels, have been ignored.  However, with a belated realisation that export-led growth, such as that experienced during the boom years, is the best hope for a decimated economy, the Bill contains some measures to maintain and perhaps enhance inward investment.The Government has yet to show any proof of a competitiveness and viable job creation strategy.  With NAMA proving to be less than the great white hope predicted by the Taoiseach, businesses are starved of cashflow.  The Government pushed through NAMA despite the IMF's reservations in terms of whether it would lead to an increase in lending.  While it is undoubtedly true that NAMA will cripple taxpayers for years to come, it is, as feared, not increasing the supply of credit to the economy.  Fine Gael's plan for a national recovery bank would get credit flowing and realise the long awaited national stimulus for which we have all been waiting.

#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	635	What we are ultimately debating this evening is an issue of fairness.  Is it fair that working people across the public sector, including teachers, nurses, road cleaners, gardaí and others, should see a significant reduction in their wages as a result of Fianna Fáil's mismanagement of the economy?  The answer to that question is "No".  It is not fair because these people did not create the mess we are now in, yet they are being asked to clean it up.On budget day last December, like everyone else, I expected to see a reduction in my wages and other measures being taken also.  However, for a large section of society, particularly those who are quite wealthy, budget day never happened.  Others, including public sector workers, those dependent on social welfare, the disabled and carers, suffered a significant reduction in their income and in State supports.  At that time the Labour Party strongly opposed the cuts in public servants' pay.  We considered the cuts to be unfair and we rejected the scapegoating of public sector workers by Fianna Fáil and others.  Labour's opposition to the public sector pay cuts is well documented on the Dáil record and in various interviews given by our leader, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, and other spokespersons on the party's behalf.Labour argued instead that significant savings would and could be made in the public sector pay bill through negotiated reforms.  Such reforms could have been achieved if the current Fianna Fáil Government had not collapsed those talks with the public service unions last December.  We still believe that the reform documents, which were being considered before the collapse of the talks, offered serious scope for efficiency, cost savings and a better service to the public.  On being elected to Government, the Labour Party would reopen discussions with the public service unions on these reforms.  As part of that process, the party would be prepared to negotiate appropriate pay restoration.  This can be achieved on the basis of efficiency, flexibility, value for money and a continuous high level of service to the public.Perhaps I could ask Deputy Bruton, if he is not talking to Deputy Lee, to give me a few minutes' quietness if he does not mind.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	636	He never spoke to Deputy Lee.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	637	The amendment before the House commends the Government for its reactions to what it describes as restoring public finances.  To my mind, restoring the public finances means recovery, but not through a return to business as usual.  The latter would mean bailing out bankers, dealing with developers and putting the type of economy in place which initially got us into this mess.  It must be borne in mind that the financial crisis is also a political crisis, and one cannot be separated from the other.  The financial crisis is a direct result of political mismanagement over the past 15 years.The amendment before us sets out to congratulate the Government on its recent actions.  However, no reference is made to its decisions that led us into this financial crisis, and no explanation is given as to how the crisis began.  Furthermore, there is no mention of the Government's campaign of public vilification that has been orchestrated against public sector workers in recent months.  We saw a typical dehumanisation process being carried out before the knife was stuck in.  This is a well documented process in any socio-psychological situation whereby before one can perpetrate the act, one must first vilify the person who is targeted.  That scenario was set out in the public mind by the Government's campaign.We should put in place a clear and fair alternative in which the shared sacrifice that is now required will be undertaken by all of us to get out of this mess, which was created by a few for the benefit of a few.  That should result in shared prosperity for all, rather than a process of bailing out bankers and developers.  The Minister is proposing in future to continue to look after those who are close to Fianna Fáil Governments, as they have been in the past.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	638	The motion before us refers to civil servants whose earnings are at the higher end of the scale, even though I know there are people earning beyond €150,000 and €160,000 a year also.  I am not in the business of saying that anyone's pay should be cut.  If people work hard and have gone up the scale, in the main they are entitled to what they earn.  When cuts must occur, however, there should be a degree of fairness.  No matter who a person is or what he or she does, they must realise that cutting 10% from someone on €30,000 a year is entirely different from cutting it from someone earning €100,000, €130,000, €160,000 or more.  It is an entirely different prospect for low earners because the impact is far more severe.  In addition, it will have a knock-on effect, and not just on individuals themselves.  It is the only source of income for the people we are talking about who, in the main, are married women with mortgage commitments and child dependants.  We must look at the matter in that context.I have met some higher civil servants who are annoyed that we are trying to cut their incomes.  It is not about cutting incomes, however, but about having a degree of fairness.  It is about the person who stands at a desk and deals with the public.  This country was divided down the middle by the cuts, which unleashed anger against those people because they are recognisable.  Higher civil servants on €150,000 or €160,000 a year are not at the front desk and seldom meet the public.  Those on low wages do meet the public and we expect the same degree of service from them, yet we are saying that in some way they are lesser beings.When the Minister for Finance stood up here on budget day, he knew that what he was saying was not entirely true.  He knew he was not including the bonuses, which are not bonuses of course.  Only a civil servant could have written such a script for other civil servants.  A bonus is now part of their income, but how did that happen?  How did it get left out of the reckoning?  Eight months after we decided to abolish these bonuses, how did they appear all of a sudden as part and parcel of their income, while they are not susceptible to cuts in the same way as everyone else?  It sounds convoluted and is hard to follow, but that was deliberate.I have great time for the Civil Service whose members do Trojan work.  This State could not exist without them.  Nonetheless, whoever decided to cut off the Deputies' inquiry line as a form of action to oppose these cuts should think again.  The only people who benefit are the Government.  Ministers do not want us to have the information.  They are thrilled that these inquiries are not being answered.  How can the Opposition get this information now?

#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	640	Whoever made that decision should seriously reconsider it.  Maybe they should think about a more directed form of action.When someone has taken a 10% cut in a very low income, one cannot expect them to visit their GP or solicitor as frequently since none of those professional costs is coming down.  In addition, train fares have risen as have education costs and accident and emergency charges.  These are all matters over which the Government has control.  The Government cannot cut one section without taking the rest of the economy into account and ensuring the cost of living is going down across the board, including the things over which it has control.  I appeal to those, who decided as a form of industrial action to cut off the very means by which the Opposition can get at the Government, to think again.

#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	643	While I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this motion, if ever I saw a "no motion" it is this one because the facts as outlined last night by the Minister are quite clear.  Significant reductions have been applied to the remuneration of both grades, 14% in the case of the grade of deputy secretary and 11.8% in the case of the grade of assistant secretary on top of the pensions levy and other reductions that apply to all public servants.  It is not correct that there was a large disparity.  The facts as put forward last night show that those grades take reductions of a much higher level than was noted or perhaps not clearly noted.Earlier, Deputy Ciarán Lynch said that we had stirred public vilification of public servants.  This is quite untrue and I am tired of hearing it.  Every e-mail I get states that we have stirred up vilification against teachers.  I was a teacher and never worked as hard in my life as when I was a teacher.  It is amazing to put into e-mails the idea that I would publicly vilify teachers.  There was no public stirring up of vilification against public service workers.  That is a line they have been sold, swallowed, regurgitated and reproduced again in all these e-mails.Deputy Ciarán Lynch also said when his party came into government it would reopen talks with the trade unions.  I sincerely hope that talks will be reopened by then.  The transformation agenda is still there and I hope people will start to talk on the basis that Kieran Mulvey of the Labour Relations Commission set out.  I have spoken here about it before.  He was very forthright when he appeared on RTE suggesting that he could provide a forum in which people could come to talk to him and that he hoped in that way he could address some of the ills and misconceptions which had grown up over that matter.Deputy Ciarán Lynch also said that when they entered into those talks, they would talk about the restoration of pay.  I am hoping that the coming Minister for Finance, who is in the House along with his assistant Minister to be, is taking heed of that.  I am quite sure he is.I agree with Deputy Kathleen Lynch who said that whoever is not answering the telephones is doing an injustice, not so much to the Opposition, but to constituents.  Ordinary constituents who want to get answers to their queries cannot do so because of some working out of this vilification of which we speak.Returning to the motion, quite clearly the higher civil servants of whom we have spoken have taken the hit and at a quite considerable level.

#ThomasByrne	unknown-#ThomasByrne-party	unknown-#ThomasByrne-dob	unknown-#ThomasByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	646	Tonight we are dealing with only one part of the overall budget package which has been pinpointed in a negative context, and that is understandable.  While the anger on the issue is understandable, we must consider the budget as a whole, which is what I appeal to the House to do.  I ask the Opposition to look at the budget objectively given that we all have the same overall goal of bringing our country back to a state of steady economic success.On the matter of the second-highest paid public servants, which we are addressing today, we must keep in mind that in 2009 when this so-called performance-related pay or unjustified bonus as it has been more correctly described — which I must say I believe was a scandal — was eliminated, these people took a pay cut above and beyond what other people in the public service were asked to do.  These individuals now have a major responsibility to drive reform in the civil and public service.  That is a message that needs to go out loud and clear from here tonight.In comparison to other countries, this country under the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and the Taoiseach has handled the economic crisis with a determined attitude.  We have been prepared to make the necessary sacrifices that others were not.  It must be said that this was in the face of consistent opposition from the Opposition.  Sacrifices have been made across the board, particularly by the unemployed.  Greece has already been forced into a bailout, whereas we have held strong and avoided this measure.  The public disorder predicted by many for this nation has happened in Greece.  The leadership and sacrifice from the top down has prevented that from happening here.  People were crying out for leadership.  When they see what is happening in Greece this week, they know that this party has provided that leadership here in the past year.  That is a fair judgment and assessment to make.Cuts have been made across the board in an attempt to regain financial stability in this nation.  For those who do not accept that the cuts are hitting the highest paid hardest, the facts are that secretaries general have lost, I believe, 33%.  Assistant secretaries, when this so-called bonus is included, have lost a quarter.  While we do not like cutting anybody's pay, clerical officers have lost 8%.  The percentages have been much less lower down the scale and have been greater higher up the scale.  No one wants to do this; we all hate doing this.  However, thanks to the leadership offered by this party in government, the comparisons to Iceland and Greece made by some in our nearest neighbour have fallen off the radar.Recently we have seen the anger over financial decisions that had to be made.  I completely relate to this and have dealt with it head-on in my constituency.  However, we must look at the figures, including those relating to consumer confidence.  One aim of the budget was to restore consumer confidence and the latest ERSI report indicated that consumer confidence is at its highest rate since January 2008.  That is very important and the Opposition has a role to play in encouraging that consumer confidence because we need to get people to spend and we need to get the saving rate down from the very high rate at which it has been.All the decisions of the budget have been part of a long-term plan to bring the country out of debt.  It is a plan that requires sacrifices and patience.  It is filled with difficult decisions some of which are popular and some of which are unpopular.  Most importantly it is a plan that has worked thus far in comparison to other countries.  I am happy to say I support every aspect of the budget because I support the overall plan of which these changes are an intricate part.  I support the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and respect him for the decisions he has had to make.  I trust he is doing what is best for the country based on what he has done already and on what he has yet to do.I wish the Taoiseach well as he goes to Brussels tomorrow to extend the hand of friendship, example and leadership to the birthplace of democracy in its hour of need.  In short, this is a vote of confidence in the two Brians and I am full-square behind them.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	647	I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak tonight on this motion, because I am extremely unhappy with the current situation.  I believe that politics is about trying to effect change and I did that on this occasion to the best of my ability.  I have fought a hard fight within my party since before Christmas to try to effect change, but I am sad to say that I have failed on this issue.Since our parliamentary party meeting last week, I have had a number of meetings with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and the Chief Whip, Minister of State, Deputy Pat Carey, where I vigorously pursued the issue as to why the Government ignored the recommendations of the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector and why we were informed that only 160 people were involved in these changes when we now know that the actual number is 630 and growing.I believe that this was a retrograde decision, giving bad example to each and everyone within the lower grades of the public service, many of whom are struggling to make ends meet and who, contrary to the myths, work hard on a daily basis in line with the old adage of "an honest day's work for an honest day's pay".  I appeal to the relevant grades to whom this reversal applies to show leadership and good example at this late stage and to forgo to some extent the benefits of their new situation.  I believe that the bonus system has been a bad policy from its inception and the situation was exacerbated when those same bonuses became cavalierly regarded as income of right, which is now being used as justification for these recent changes.This is nonsense and is anathema to all right thinking hard working citizens of this country whether they are in the public service or the private sector.  I have been told on numerous occasions by lower grade public sector workers that it was on the assessment of their hard work that a bonus was awarded to the heads of Departments, which is clearly unfair.  During these meetings I have received assurances from the Minister for Finance that the Government has no wish to seek further reductions in public service pay rates especially from the lower paid and I fully accept this.  I have here extracts from the Taoiseach, which are on the record of the House from 27 February 2010, which give these same reassurances.Having consulted widely over the past week with my constituents and supporters, I have decided that although I am clearly unhappy with the current situation, I am and will be in a far stronger position to effect change from within the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party as the majority party in Government.

I could name dozens but shall confine myself to just a few.  One is South Tipperary General Hospital and St. Michael's unit within it.  There is also a need to progress numerous school and road projects.Our most pressing issues as a Government are to stabilise the economy and to get credit flowing from the banks to hard-pressed businesses and homeowners.  It is vital that we stop the haemorrhaging of jobs because of the dramatic effect this is having on families and communities and it is imperative that we ensure that no family home can be allowed to be repossessed, even as there are institutions lining up for repossession orders.As recent events have shown, the Opposition benches offer very little scope to make a difference. I am in the Dáil to represent my constituents, to make things better for them.  I am only interested in making life easier for the people of south Tipperary.  I want to help find employment for them.  I want to ensure that local issues in south Tipperary have a national voice here in Leinster House.  There is no point being locked outside the door when issues relating to my constituency are being debated inside.  I do not want to be left alone in the coffee docks of Leinster House, like some lone soldiers from the other parties across the benches, trying to get things done.  I want to be in a position to make changes where necessary for the good of my constituents.  I may not have been successful this time but my voice has been listened to on other occasions and I have no doubt it will be again in the future.  I assure my colleagues on all sides of the House that I will continue to be work hard within my  parliamentary party.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	657	How does one follow that from my good friend and colleague, Deputy Mattie McGrath?I am pleased to have an opportunity to make some brief comments in the time available on the motion as put forward by the Fine Gael Party in relation to this pay issue concerning senior civil servants and related grades.  I stand foursquare behind the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, on all the decisions he has taken since becoming Minister for Finance in the summer of 2008.  I believe he has performed outstandingly well in that role since that time.  He is internationally recognised as somebody who has the courage and conviction to take very difficult decisions.  He has set the economy on the right path and made decisions that will help us get the public finances in order.  We need to discuss this motion, I believe, on the basis of the facts.When I learned just before Christmas that a decision had been made to reduce the impact of the pay cuts on assistant secretaries and deputy secretaries of Departments, I, too, was surprised until I looked at the detail.  We are all acutely aware of the impact budget decisions have had on the low paid in particular.  However, in considering this issue, it is important to look at the package of the three budgets since October 2008, including the one in April 2009 and the budget of last December, as well as the decision in February 2009 to introduce the pension levy.  We need to examine the impact of the package of those financial decisions on different grades in the Civil Service and within the public sector generally.  It is quite clear from any objective analysis that the progression of the impact on people earning higher levels of pay has been quite aggressive.  Consider the main elements introduced in those budgets.  Under the pension levy, the first €15,000 of earnings is exempt.  The levy is 5% on the next €5,000, 10% on the subsequent €40,000 and 10.5% on earnings above €60,000.  The income levy is 2% on earnings up to 75,000, some 4% on incomes between €75,000 and €175,000 and 6% on pay in excess of that.  I put those figures on the record to highlight the progressive nature of the decisions taken by the Government in recent budgets.It is fair to say that there can be no question that the basic principle of "those earning the most paying the most" has certainly been respected by this Government and has been at the centre of its approach to tackling the public finances.  Take for example the figures which the Minister for Finance introduced last night.  The impact, collectively, of those measures on clerical officers was 7% of net pay but 25% on assistant secretaries at the mid-point, equivalent to more than three times in percentage terms.  In monetary terms the cut is equivalent to 14 times greater.I am the first to recognise that every euro is of greater value to someone on low pay compared to a person earning €150,000 or more, but having said that the cuts have been far greater for higher civil servants.  The media would suggest in recent weeks that higher civil servants were not taking any cut at all, or that their cut is relatively smaller, when in fact this is not the case.  At the heart of this controversy is the treatment of the bonus in the calculation of the pay cut.  It is important to address that issue and acknowledge that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, abolished what was a very flawed bonus scheme.Deputy Bruton was correct last night that bonus payments had become par for the course and were being seen as virtually an automatic entitlement, and that was certainly wrong.  It defeated the whole purpose of incentivising civil and public servants to achieve high standards.

I agree with my colleague, Deputy Mattie McGrath, that the Minister should have been advised of the wider application of this decision to more than 600 civil and public servants following the decision before Christmas.  I particularly welcome the fact that the Minister has sanctioned an independent efficiency review of local authorities as well as the HSE.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	660	It is difficult to follow the last two speakers without covering the same ground.  However, this is a mischievous motion.  The Deputies opposite, and in particular the main signer of this motion, knows more than most precisely the precarious and difficult financial situation of the country.  I claim it is a base motion as well because at its heart is an attempt to play on discontent within the public service.  I have had the experience of serving at several different grades in public administration in this country and I was a trade union representative for the lower grades in the public service.  I am well aware of the difficulties facing a clerical officer, clerical assistant or junior executive officer at the lower end of the scale.  However, the attempt to create more discontent in those grades than what undoubtedly exists already is not good politics; it is bad politics.  It will divide worker against worker.  If they were to reflect on the matter, I believe most of those on the opposite side of the House would recognise it is bad politics.We are all aware of the situation of the country lately and the recently published Exchequer returns make the position very clear.  The 2007 tax take was €47 billion and it is now down to €33 billion.  One must cut one's cloth according to one's measure.  We could do other things but we tried such other things in the past.  Previously, the country tried to borrow itself out of difficulties.  The proposer of the motion knows as well as I do the damage that did to our economy.  We stultified Ireland's economic development in the 1980s because we doubled and trebled our debt.  By 1987, every penny generated from personal taxation went into servicing debt.  It was insupportable expenditure.We are also aware the capacity of this country to raise more taxes in the current circumstances is limited.  If we did not cut public expenditure, the Government would have to find the money elsewhere.  I give credit to Deputy Bruton in this regard, because he had some difficulty within his own party in arguing for the extent of the cuts necessary.  Had we not taken the necessary steps, we would have had to find up to €4 billion in extra taxation and in our heart of hearts we know that is simply not a realistic option.  The Government could have simply closed down services.  Frequently, that is what takes place in business.  Let us consider the unfortunate situation of the workers who heard the dreadful news concerning Halifax last night.  Some 750 or 760 jobs will go.  We sought to protect the public services to the maximum possible extent and we sought to protect employment within public services.As everyone in the House is fully aware, public services are delivered through people.  The greatest single element in most public service expenditure is salaries.  The obvious solution is to trim expenditure to the bone.  If one is not to lay off staff, which would be a disastrous policy in my view, one must operate in the area of salaries.The issue at the core of this debate has been disingenuously misrepresented.  I agree that political communications could have been somewhat better.  However, it seems we are taking a particular issue out of context, twisting the reality and trying to use the discontent which exists for purely political purposes.  That is damaging to the nation and the State and it does not serve to help anyone in the House who proposes a way forward.The situation has been well explained by the Minister for Finance, who had to take into account that the pay of the grades involved had been reduced already because of the suspension of the schemes of performance related play.  The Minister had to ensure such people would not bear a disproportionate amount of the cuts.  It is wrong, therefore, to use this debate in the way it has been used.  I am surprised and not a little disappointed this is the case.I will take considerable pleasure in supporting the Minister in this matter because he is aiming to create justice for all workers.  There is no easy way out. There are no easy solutions or magic wand.  A person who came into this House in a blaze of glory some time ago left skulking in recent days because he found out that fact.  The Members who moved this motion are aware that is a fact as well.

As with other speakers on this side of the House I believe the motion represents opportunistic politics at its best.  More constructive motions could have been forwarded, especially by the individual heading this motion.  It is in no way constructive and does not take account of all the facts.We must consider the overall context of the adjustments that took place and the realities of several recent budgets to get an overall insight, rather than simply taking an element of public sector workers and pay reductions in the last budget.  It is fairer to examine what has taken place in the past three budgets.  In doing so, one gets a better idea of what is at issue and of the differences in pay.  Public service salaries up to €125,000 will be reduced by 5% for the first €30,000 of salary, 7.5% for the next €40,000 of salary and 10% for the next €55,000 of salary.  This produces overall reductions in salary ranging from 5% to just less than 8% in the case of salaries of €125,000.  This is a progressive, measured reduction which provides that those on higher salaries will contribute more.The reductions in rates of pay for public servants earning in excess of €125,000 are based on those recommended in report No. 44 of the Review Body on Higher Level Remuneration.  The review body made recommendations on appropriate reductions on a sample number of posts.  Since it was a sample, the recommendations have been extended and adapted as necessary to cover groups not specifically examined.  The scale of adjustment provided for in the legislation related to secretaries general, deputy secretaries general and related grades.  In reaching the decision, it was emphasised that the pay of assistant secretaries was found by the review body not to be out of line having regard to its comparative rates in the eurozone.  This point should be considered very closely in respect of this motion.It is worth emphasising the Government has applied the pay reductions in a progressive way.  As with all adjustments to the cost of public service pay, the result is lower paid public servants have suffered less of a net loss compared to those in higher paid grades.  For example, over the course of the three budgets since Autumn 2008, a clerical officer on the mid point of the pay scale has suffered a net loss of 11.7% of pay.  The loss is still significant, of course, but let us compare it to the net loss of those on higher pay grades.  In the same period, the assistant secretary grade has suffered a net loss in pay in excess of 24%, while a deputy secretary has suffered a net loss of in excess of 27% of pay.  These are the facts and figures we must consider in respect of this motion.  When one considers the facts and figures, this motion should not be even before the House today, because the facts are stacked against the Opposition.I have no doubt the motion will be defeated.  One good aspect of this motion is it provides everyone with the opportunity to present the facts as we know them.  It also affords an opportunity to explain the scenario to the people.  It is an opportunistic motion and this gives us a chance to put the record straight.  There has been too much misinformation disseminated by Opposition parties and trade unions.  Many unions are peddling this view locally to public sector workers and causing further division.Ultimately, we must get our house in order.  I hope we can return to a situation whereby our union representatives could come back into Government Buildings and re-start negotiations not only for the good of the lower paid, but for all public sector workers and to ensure job security and value for money is realised in future.
#KieranODonnell	unknown-#KieranODonnell-party	unknown-#KieranODonnell-dob	unknown-#KieranODonnell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	662	I wish to share time with Deputies Varadkar, Feighan, Connaughton, Neville, McHugh and Doyle.  I trust the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will inform me when I have one minute remaining.  I am very pleased to be here tonight to support the motion proposed by my colleague, Deputy Bruton.  I note Deputy Mattie McGrath has left the Chamber.  The only thing that was surprising about his speech was that it was unsurprising.  We heard the speech we expected in that there was an about-turn.  The Deputy was on the road to Damascus for a while but turned back very quickly.It is imperative that we deal with facts.  The tables produced by the Government are based on net figures but if we base them on gross figures we will note staff at assistant secretary level are taking a pay cut of 3%.  They should be taking a cut of 8%.  They are, therefore, effectively receiving a bonus of 5% by comparison with everyone else.I tabled a question for the Minister for Finance asking him the date on which the Government made its Cabinet decision to reduce the pay cuts for certain senior public servants and the discussions that took place prior the decision.  The reply was that the position regarding remuneration was considered by the Cabinet on 9 December, the same day as the budget.  However, the budget speech states:The Government has considered the recommendations of the Review Body and intends to apply reductions to all public servants in the higher pay bands [. . .].[. . .] Those at the top will lead by example in this national downward readjustment of pay.  Legislation to give effect to these substantial reductions in senior level pay will be published shortly.On 15 December, when the Minister spoke on Second Stage of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Bill, which was to reduce pay for public servants, he gave no indication whatsoever that there would be a change to what he outlined in the budget.  He mentioned a substantial inequity in respect of section 6.  Section 6(a) states, “exceptional circumstances exist (because of some particular aspect or condition of their employment, office or position) in respect of such public servant, class or group and a substantial inequity would thereby arise”.  In spite of this, the Minister stated he was taking on board the recommendations of the review group, which stated it “remains in favour of moderate, performance-related award schemes, where bonus payments reflect the achievement of challenging targets, as motivators of excellence.”Deputy Mattie McGrath congratulated the Minister for Finance on doing away with the bonus scheme in February 2009.  It was regarded as a bonus scheme last year but this year it is regarded as part of basic pay.  The Government cannot have it both ways and there is considerable inequity in its provision.There was a Cabinet decision on pay on 9 December and the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Mansergh, who is present, made no mention of it.  There was no reference to it in the budget speech or during the passage of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public In.  The Taoiseach stated the Bill came into being on 21 December and decided on 22 December, the following day, that he would direct, under section 6, that the pay reductions would not apply.  He issued a circular on 23 December.The Government backtracked.  Something happened whereby it made a decision at a late date or, worse, made the decision on 9 December and effectively engaged in a cover-up in the House.  The same tactic was used in respect of the debate on NAMA, the IMF and the provision of credit flow.  The House is entitled to know the exact advice given to the Government.  Was a memorandum provided on 9 December?Is the word "bonus" mentioned in the contracts of employment for the senior public servants?  How many people of assistant secretary grade were receiving the bonuses?  Were all of them receiving them?  It is a question of fairness.  Staff on relatively low pay are taking a cut of 5%, at a minimum.I hope Deputy Mattie McGrath will see the light again before the vote at 8.30 p.m. and vote with us.  It is a question of fairness.  The Government is looking after the privileged few and neglecting the lower-paid and middle-paid public servants who are under severe pressure.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	663	This is not a cynical motion, as a previous speaker suggested.  Fine Gael has been very honest about the issue of public sector pay.  During the benchmarking process eight or nine years ago, it pointed out that benchmarking payments would not be sustainable if funded from tax receipts from developers and banks.  We stated they should be based on productivity and efficiencies and that, if the were not, they would not be sustainable.Fine Gael was the first party to call for the national wage agreement to be suspended and the first to say there should be pay cuts for public servants on higher incomes.  It is a testament to the responsibility and strength of the party that it was prepared to do so.  There are not many Opposition parties or parties competing to be in government in Europe that were prepared to be as honest as Fine Gael.  It probably cost us votes but Fine Gael is all about telling people the truth and pointing out solutions to real problems.In cutting public service pay, it was crucial that the Government be fair and be seen to be such.  The way the cuts were achieved was unfair.  It was not right to cut the pay of those earning under, say, €30,000, €20,000 or €15,000.  The Government should certainly have protected the first €15,000, €20,000 or €30,000 of everyone's income.  The Government needed to be seen to be fair in ensuring that those at the higher level, who could most afford to pay, would take the biggest cuts.  This motion states the Government exempted one class of public servant, including those at assistant secretary level and other senior staff in some of the State agencies and local authorities.  This undermined the policy that was necessary.It is important that the Government not only reverse its decision on senior civil servants but also that it not allow senior managers in the HSE to receive the increase.  Their receiving it would be an appalling scandal and would further social division, generate more anger among public servants and make it more difficult to implement the policies that must be implemented.  We should not allow a second class of people at the top of the HSE to avoid further pay cuts and receive an increase.  It is an issue of honesty.The decision on the pay cuts should have been made and explained when the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Bill was being discussed before Christmas.  It is very clear the provision in section 6 was included in the legislation for a reason.  The Minister must have had in mind certain scenarios such as the one in question.  There are others that affect disabled people who are earning salaries very close to the minimum wage, as raised by the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh. This category is one of the exceptions.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, must have had in mind that the exception under discussion could arise.  He should have been honest about what he was doing when he introduced the Bill rather than make a sneaky announcement, as he did on 23 December when he believed nobody would notice.  It undermines every measure he was seeking to implement.The bonus system was largely a sham.  We know that one sets one's own targets, achieves them and thus obtains one's bonus.  In some local authorities, every person who applied for a bonus got one.  It is not a bonus but a handout.The Fianna Fáil backbenchers showed their mettle and got great kudos for it when they stood up against the deal the Government almost made with the trade unions with regard to public servants having 12 days of unpaid leave.  It will be interesting to see how strong they are on this issue.  They were prepared to stand up to the trade unions and all public sector workers when the issue arose before Christmas.  Let us see whether they are genuine about their convictions when it comes to standing up to the rich and influential and the staff in the higher levels of the Civil Service.

The accountant said, "What do you want it to be?  That is what was asked of the Minister on this occasion.  It appears senior civil servants are the exception to the rule.  They succeeded in having an earlier cut regarded as their current cut.  It is cynical that the information on this was released before Christmas.  People are making huge sacrifices.  I accept that many of these senior civil servants have mortgages and are suffering like most people but this measure is sending out a message that sacrifices are for little people and leadership is for somebody else.  If we really want to get out of this economic mess, there must be leadership and it must be shown from the top.The 655 individuals are management personnel working throughout the country in the health service, the Central Bank and hospitals.  They did not lead this country, and they certainly would not prove themselves in the private economy.I hear constantly about sacrifice and mini-revolts within the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party.  In recent weeks Deputy Mattie McGrath has been very vocal on this issue on local radio in south Tipperary and elsewhere.  Who is stopping Deputy McGrath from voting with his conscience?  Is it the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh?  Is he leaning on Deputy McGrath and ensuring that his constituency colleague——

The bonus in 2001 was performance related but there was no performance.  It was easy in the market that existed to claim that people could spend as much money as they wanted to spend but we now see that the cupboard is bare and nobody is taking responsibility.That is what has happened with this Government.  Nobody is taking responsibility.  Once again, the leadership and the people who matter decide the sacrifices are to be made by the little people.  There is an anger among the lower grade civil servants.  I can feel it.  The Government has caught the mood completely wrong.  What it is doing is wrong, and this measure should be reversed immediately.
#PaulConnaughton	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-party	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-dob	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	672	The Government has made two huge blunders in two years, and it is all to do with lack of fairness.  The year before last it made the monumental mistake of treating the elderly in the worst possible fashion in terms of medical cards.  Thousands of them marched outside this House.  The reason they came to Dublin was because they believed they were being discriminated against and that others were getting a better deal than them.  It was reasonable to assume at that stage that whatever else one does, admittedly in the worst of times, one would not make the same mistake the second time.This is a central issue of fairness, and it has as much to do with perception as anything else.  The people who are earning the €30,000, of whom there are many in the public service, genuinely believe that the people at the top are getting away with something they are denied.  The Minister of State can put any spin he likes on it, and he can stay here until tomorrow and talk about bonuses and performance bonuses, how they are calculated and so on, but that is the bottom line.I want to record that what the Government did to the people earning up to €30,000 was shameful.  Deputy Richard Bruton's proposal was the plank of the Fine Gael alternative budget and it stood up to every kind of scrutiny.  It was tested inside out and the people earning up to €30,000 would not be penalised with the 5% deduction.  That is the reason the Government is in trouble today.  It is facing more trouble that we can see at the moment, and I hope it will not develop, but there is so much anger at that level.  People are asking how the Government expects them to make a living, and the banks and building societies are about to raise the mortgage rates again.  How does the Government think these people can live?  I have nothing against the cohort of people involved.  I am sure they are hard-working people, but it appears they are not being treated in the same way as the people lower down in the grades.  No matter how one analyses it, that is what has happened.I saw a photograph of the Minister of State's colleague, Deputy Mattie McGrath, in the newspaper the other day and he was dancing a four hand reel.  He will be dancing tomorrow, but it will be a fast jig to get out of the way of the journalists because if ever he led them by the nose, Mattie did it this time.

Between the lot of them the Government has made a hames of this issue.  I know Deputy McGrath fought with his conscience and it is obvious that he won.  That type of thing gives politics a bad name.  I call on the Deputy, even though I am sure he has been called already to do this, that if he stands for anything, and I always believed he did — I have no reason to doubt otherwise — there is only one place for him to go but if he follows the flock of sheep that will go through the lobbies in an hour's time, it will be difficult to take that man or Fianna Fáil seriously in the future.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	675	I acknowledge one achievement on the part of the Government.  It engaged in a game of divide and conquer.  It played it skilfully.  Through its spin doctors it manipulated the media and created the public sector private sector divide.  Unfortunately, the people left in the middle of the divide and conquer game are faced with a conundrum.  They face many problems and challenges, one of them being survival in terms of paying their bills, repaying their mortgages and living day to day in that category.The €30,000 salary was specified in our pre-budget submission because the people affected are looking at what is happening at the senior civil servant level and deciding whether they will work.  They are considering the €30,000 they could get by not working.  We have further disincentivised working at a time when we have a spiralling unemployment level which will get worse, particularly in light of the additional taxes, costs and penalties being introduced in the Finance Bill for people who are trying to survive.Two years ago Deputy Bruton and our leader, Deputy Kenny, who were very strong on this issue, talked about a pay freeze in 2008 and we got hammered for it.  I got hammered for it on local radio.  Families rang in to say they would never again vote for me because I called for a pay freeze in 2008.  That is only two years ago, but the Minister has now taken a very harsh stance on people who cannot survive.Not everybody is in a position to do their apprenticeship in their own county.  Many low-earning civil servants, who have to come to Dublin and rent accommodation, cannot survive.  That creates a disincentive to work.At a macro-economic level, we must get this country working again but we will not do that by penalising people, which is what the Minister is doing.  We are creating the paradox of thrift where the people who are in a position to save are continuing to save; the people who continue to save are not willing to spend; commerce is grinding to a halt because people are not spending; businesses are folding up; and there are more and more people on the unemployment register.  That is the outcome in this whole debacle — more and more people in an ever-increasing unemployment spiral.The Minister must look at what is happening.  All bets are off in terms of people's survival.  They bought houses which they could not afford.  Every night they go to bed in fear that mortgage interest rates will go up in the next several months.  When the Government sends out a signal that certain civil servants at the higher levels will not be subject to pay cuts, it demoralises and disenchants those affected, leading to a disincentive to work.  This is a dangerous position in which the Government finds itself.  It is a conundrum out of which it can get by exempting those earning €30,000 and under per annum.  It must, however, be addressed in the short not the medium term.
#AndrewDoyle	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-party	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-dob	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	676	Last year, I issued a statement arguing that public versus private sector was not the solution to our problems.  However, as I am not a celebrity Deputy, a guru or an economist but just a straightforward on-the-ground-Deputy it was not covered much.  Maybe someone will cover it this time.At the time I made the point it was hard to persuade those in the public service, particularly those on lower pay, that they were responsible for the country's economic woes.  Levies were introduced and we were being dishonest with the public sector, telling them they would have to pay the piper.  At the time we were in the throes of protecting the banking sector and keeping financial institutions solvent, a point with which no one argued.  The manner in which such moves would be funded, overviewed and how those who caused the problems would be held accountable were being discussed.However, it was decided we would make the public sector fully responsible.  For years Fine Gael called for public sector reform but it was not quite as simple as just pay cuts.  The body for higher remuneration from 2000 to 2008 saw it fit to reward those on higher pay in the public sector, including the Taoiseach, Ministers, county managers and others, with a rate of pay increases that far exceeded those given to the lower paid.The Government amendment takes into account the net decrease to those on higher pay has far exceeded those on lower pay but forgets performance pay has become part and parcel of salary increases.  I do not know what a higher civil servant had to do not to get his or her performance bonus.  It seems one would have had to have made a major boo-boo and be an embarrassment to one's position before one was denied a performance bonus.  To use the performance bonus as an excuse for not cutting salaries in the higher services smacks of unfairness.  The Minister for Finance said on the budget day that we have turned the corner because the straws in the wind from abroad indicated a coming out of the worldwide recession.  However, it was somewhat premature and most certainly so in the case of Ireland.  No matter how quickly other parts of Europe come out of the recession, Ireland will be in the last three to emerge from it.Ireland has been cushioned by two factors.  First, there has been negative inflation except in public service costs which have risen over the past year.  Second, interest rates are low.  However, as sure as night follows day, serious pressure will emerge for interest rates to go up to prevent the main eurozone areas getting carried away with positive growth figures.It is delusional that those on the higher and protected public sector salaries should be given a softer landing on basic pay.  On Monday I was informed of a young woman working with Wicklow County Council planning department who was paying €800 a month for child care for her two children.  She has taken a 25% pay cut and, as there are less planning applications, overtime is very much denied to her.  Her husband, a private sector worker, has also taken a 25% pay cut.  Their basic costs have continued to rise, however.I will give the Government one credit.  Whoever writes its amendments to our Private Members' motions is a creative genius.  Will the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, let us know who it is?
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	677	Today, I checked the cost of the Government's decision to reverse the pay cuts for higher civil servants.  The cost to the State will be €10 million.  For the past ten years, I have been asking for €7 million in funding for the National Office for Suicide Prevention to reduce the number of suicides which is conservatively estimated at 600 people a year.Lives can be saved if the funding which I and many other non-political groups and people request is provided.  Ireland has not eliminated or reduced its suicide levels while other countries have succeeded with proper suicide prevention programmes.  If the motion is accepted and the Government devotes 70% of the savings made for the State, lives will be saved.  In the first half of 2008, there was a 35% increase in suicides.  It has been known from research going back to 1897 that in times of recession there is always an increase in suicide.Various emergencies such as the recent flooding and the freeze-up have been debated in this House and to which there was some response from the Government.  There is another emergency in the financial positions and pressures in which many people and families find themselves.  Due to their changed economic circumstances some have taken their lives.  The 35% increase in suicides warrants an emergency response on the part of the Government.  It is not acceptable the Government ignores the issue.  There has been a reduction in mental well-being and an increase in mental health problems, substance misuse, relationship breakdown and divorce as a result of the economic pressures on individuals, families and society.  The Government easily made a decision to increase salary expenditure by €10 million but it still will not consider increasing funds for suicide prevention by €7 million.

There was general agreement in this House on the level of expenditure reductions required in 2010 and an acceptance by the public service unions in discussions with the Government that a reduction in the pay bill for 2010 was necessary.  The Opposition has the luxury of agreeing on a macro level what is required to address the immense challenges we face in the public finances, while proceeding to oppose nearly all the microeconomic measures decided upon to achieve the required expenditure reductions.  The Government, on the other hand, must make the necessary decisions and implement them no matter how unpopular they may be and regardless of the level of plausible misrepresentation, which is very high over the present issue.Pay cuts are always unwelcome and put extra pressure on those affected by them.  Two thirds of public servants earn €50,000 or less, but given the scale of reduction required in the pay bill, €1 billion, it was not possible to exempt lower paid public servants from the pay reductions.  However, the average value of incremental increases at lower grade levels in the Civil Service range from 3% to in excess of 4.5%.  These incremental increases were retained, despite Fine Gael proposals that they should be abolished, and remain in place, albeit at the reduced rates.The recommendations made by the Review Body on Higher Remuneration are not binding or mandatory on Government.  Looking back on report No. 38 in September 2000 at the very height of the boom, the size of the increases recommended was very large and, in my opinion but admittedly with the benefit of hindsight, too large.

It proved difficult to distinguish exceptional performance and the 10% became embedded in pay.  The Minster has abolished the performance related pay scheme as unaffordable at present, but it never worked originally as intended.  However, in my experience, for the record, assistant secretaries and deputy secretaries, without prejudice to those who work above or below them, are at the cutting edge of policy execution.A passage that appears to have been overlooked in the most recent report No. 44 states:We recommend that, in the event that any anomalies arise in the implementation of these recommendations, the Department of Finance should have the discretion, in consultation with other relevant departments and agencies, as necessary, to make such adjustments to our recommendations as may be required to remove any such anomalies.The legislation in December gave the Minister such powers.  He is, therefore, acting in line with the report, not ignoring it, as has so often been alleged.  The table circulated by the Minister for Finance yesterday demonstrated clearly the major impact on net pay of budgetary decisions since 2008.  With the exception of a few Secretaries General, net pay for all senior civil servants has fallen well below €100,000, with losses of 24% to 27% in the categories in question.  The system as it stands, even with the correction of the anomalies, is sharply progressive and there is no justification for claiming they have been spared far more than junior civil servants.The Government recognises that the pay cuts applied to all public servants are onerous and difficult.  They were not undertaken lightly but they are absolutely necessary.  I would suggest that they must be considered in the context of the magnitude of the adjustment and contribution required from all those in our society, including social welfare recipients; the fact that the reduction of 5% in the consumer price index over the 12 months to December 2009 offers at least some mitigating effects; the devastating effect of the recession on jobs and incomes in large swathes of the private sector; and the current serious threat to European economies that do not demonstrate their determination to put their houses in order.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	681	I wish to share my time with Deputy Bruton.  I was delighted to see the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, put on the record that in hindsight many of the decisions taken in the past ten years by the Government may well have been wrong.  It is a bit late for that.  He is coming very late to it, especially since considerable pay increases have been awarded to people over a very short period.I refer specifically to the most recent increases outlined in the report of the review body on higher remuneration in the public service of October 2007, covering 1,600 top civil servants and the extraordinary increases proposed in it.  The increase at the assistant secretary level was approximately 5.5%, and that at Secretary General level was approximately 11.3%.  The proposed increases for the chief executive officers of IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, Forfás and FÁS were in the order of 22.5%.  Compare that with what principal teachers obtained.  Principals got nothing out of that, yet their proposed increase in terms of the allowances and changes in the last benchmarking award has not come into effect.  The awards to principals, the senior managers within our education system, were never paid.  Therefore, under the last review, an assistant secretary got a 5% increase; a principal got nothing.  When one considers that in the most recent budget the pay reductions of principals was in the order of 8% and those at assistant secretary level within the Civil Service saw the now proposed 3% reduction, one cannot compare them only in respect of the last budget.  One must compare them in a context of extraordinary pay increases over recent years.The Minister is also wrong when he and his colleague told the House in a debate in which I participated that only those public servants who were paying the pension levy would be affected by the pay cut of December last.  What we were told was totally untrue.  It emerged in the Committee Stage debate, as the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, well knows, that those substitute teachers and temporary workers within the public sector saw a percentage pay reduction across the board.Therefore, there is no fairness in the way in which the Government has dealt with the issue.  Many lower paid civil servants and public servants are now having to be bailed out by family income supplement because they have seen a reduction in their take home pay, a reduction as a result of the pension levy and the income levy.It is grotesque and unacceptable that the Government has introduced this sweetheart deal for more than 600 top civil servants.  It sends out a negative message to other public servants, especially those on lower grades who are struggling to make ends meet.I put it to the Minister of State that the Government's policy is all over the place.  It shunts from one day to the next.  There is no clarity in the way in which the Government has gone about this.  It is grossly unfair to give a sweetheart deal to one group of civil servants and public servants over another in a circumstance where those people have seen significant increases in their pay over recent years.  Deputy Bruton put on the record of the House last night that over the past six years those civil servants have seen an increase in the order of 70% to 80% in their gross pay and will obtain that very handsome pension at the time of retirement.  This has not been fair.  It has been a bad day for the public service and it has been a bad day for the Government which has botched this scheme right the way back to the budget.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20786	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	682	I am glad to have the opportunity to conclude this debate.  I would have to start by congratulating the Minister of State at the Department for Finance, Deputy Mansergh, for his powers of persuasion in persuading his colleague, Deputy Mattie McGrath, a Fianna Fáil TD who many would admire for speaking it as it is.  Even today, Deputy McGrath recognised the gross injustice of what we are considering here, but he was prevailed upon by the golden words of the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, to which we are often treated.  Pearls of wisdom that flowed from the Minister of State persuaded Deputy McGrath that he would have to leave his sense of fairness at the door and instead seek to use his influence within the party.  It is a sad day when Deputy McGrath felt obliged to do that because he is allowing the Government get away with something that is grossly unfair.  That is the position here and what we are voting on.The Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, was most economical in quoting from the high level review group.  He found one quote which referred to the possibility of some anomalies.  He has blown the possibility of some anomalies into a Government decision that is horrendously unfair.  Let us be blunt.  When the high level group made its recommendation that deputy secretaries should take a 12% cut and assistant secretaries should take an 8% cut, it did so fully in the knowledge that the pension levy had been imposed on these groups in the structure about which we all know, fully in the knowledge that the bonus system had been suspended and was now no longer applicable to these groups and fully in the knowledge of the progressive nature of the tax code the Minister had introduced in his previous budget which, naturally enough, asked everyone in every sector to pay more if they earned more.Is it not remarkable that not one speaker on the Government side referred to the fact that the high level group, when it made this recommendation which was adopted by Government in the budget, knew all these things?  Notwithstanding the existence of the pension levy, the suspension of the bonus scheme and the progressive nature of our tax code, it still recommended that these highly paid public servants should, in equity, take a pay cut greater than those on lower levels of pay.  That was its recommendation which was very fair in any man's language.  The only people who do not see that as fair are the members of the Government and, no doubt, some of those affected by these cuts who are now delighting in the fact that bonuses, which were never part of their core pay, are being given as a free pass to them to avoid taking the cuts everyone else has taken.  It is an issue of fairness.When the Minister goes back to his Department, he will see the clerical officer and the porter at the door working away.  They are being asked to take much bigger pay cuts proportionately than the bosses in their comfortable offices who have had high pay, huge bonuses and so on over the years.  Where is the equity in that?Let us not forget the powers the Minister is using to make this decision.  They are very clear.  There must be a substantial inequity and it must be just and equitable in all the circumstances to use this power to reverse a pay cut imposed by the high level group.  There is no substantial inequity.  If the Fianna Fáil backbenchers were willing to come into the House, they would know that everyone agrees the substantial inequity in these pay cuts is that the person on the lowest pay has been asked to pay — the person on the minimum wage, the person struggling to get by, the person trying to pay a mortgage and the person trying to cope with children in the wake of cuts to child benefit.  These people ought to have been spared.  If there was a grain of money available to show some equity and fairness, would they not be the people to whom one would turn and say why should the porter pay so much and a person on the minimum wage take a 5% cut and let us use a little bit of discretion to exempt some of these hard put upon people?That was not the way the Minister or any of his colleagues in Government saw it.  They saw the assistant secretaries, the deputy secretaries and the 655 hangers-on to the same grades as the people suffering inequity.  I do not agree with the Minister nor do many of the Government backbenchers.This has nothing to do with tackling the nation's finances.  It is enough to make a crocodile cry to hear Ministers lecture the Opposition about the need to face up to these difficult times.  What are we being asked to do to face up to these difficult times?  We are being asked to exempt the best paid public servants from taking their share of the cut.  It is astonishing and unfair and most people will not forgive the Government for what it is trying to do here.  I am not surprised people at the bottom level of the public service are angry and frustrated and are doing things which, in my view, are futile.  They are angry and frustrated and they look up to the top of the tree and see these people taking advantage of a situation.I was amazed by the table the Minister produced last night as if it were some great evidence and that we should melt away and say assistant secretaries are experiencing hardship.  The Minister said the pension levy, the higher health levy and the higher Lenihan levy should be all taken into consideration in regard to the higher paid.  What about the lower paid and people in every sector who have been paying all those progressive taxes?  That is the nature of a fair tax system and it cannot be used to defend exempting those at the top of the tree from paying their share when it comes to cutting pay.  It is offensive to see the resources of the Department of Finance being used to try to dupe us.  No doubt one of these people on these high bonuses came up with this extraordinary matrix to try to justify what is unjustifiable.Let us look at this honestly and fairly for a change.  The net effect of the Government's decision is that assistant secretaries will take a 3% pay cut whereas the person on the lowest pay, the porter and the cleaner, will take a 5% pay cut.  That will be further modified by the fact that in terms of disposable income, it will be less for the higher paid person.  That is the effect of this.  If one includes the pension levy, the effect is that these assistant secretaries will have taken an 11% cut over the two budgets while the clerical officer, who the Minister tried to pretend was walking away scot-free, will have taken a 10.5% cut.  The person at the bottom of the administrative structure will take the same pay cut as the person at the very top as a result of the Minister's decision.Let us look back at the history of this.  The Taoiseach had the audacity to come into the House and pretend these high paid public servants suffered awfully over the intervening years and had been pressed down because they had access to the bonus.  The truth is completely the contrary.  Those assistant secretaries and deputy secretaries enjoyed a 78% increase since 2000 while the clerical officer at the bottom of the scale enjoyed a 48% increase, and the porter got even less.  These assistant secretaries and deputy secretaries were privileged people not only enjoying their bonuses but enjoying bigger pay increases than anyone else.  A pay increase of €64,500 was given to an assistant secretary while a clerical officer got only €10,000 — a six and a half times bigger increase in absolute terms for the people at the top of the tree.The Minister had the opportunity to find the people who were suffering extreme hardship and substantial inequity, but to whom did he go?  He went to the people who got the €64,5000 increase in the past eight years.  It makes no sense and is an offence to fairness.  That is why the Government backbenchers have put the Minister in the dock.  He will survive this one but the sense of unfairness in what he is doing will resonate right through the system.  It undermines the capacity of this Government to deliver the sort of reforms and the changes in work practice we need to see.Let us be very clear.  We are in a time of great difficulty and our public service will have to accept huge changes in the way we work, and we should accept that here as well.  That is the reality of the world in which we live.  One does not start a process of asking people to make changes to the way they do their work by singling out for exemption those people who are supposed to be the leaders of change.  How can one justify that?  Those people should lead by example and show that this is the time for change, for sacrifice and for doing things in a way they were never done before.Instead, the Government used this Buggins's turn bonus system, where everyone got a slice of the action regardless of how bad was his or her performance, which time and again we were told should not be administered in that way.  The high level group insisted time after time that this could not be regarded as part of core pay or something on which one should count and that one should get it only for exceptional performance above and beyond the norm.  The Government, however, turned all that on its head.We are at a time of economic peril.  That is about the only thing on which I agree with Government speakers.  However, the way in which we confront this must be seen to be fair and purposeful.  The ordinary five-eighth should not be asked to make a sacrifice — they will be asked to make more sacrifices in the years ahead — by saying that our view of what is substantially inequitable about the recent pay cuts is that the people at the top of the tree have suffered a pay cut by losing their bonuses. Bonuses are gone in the private sector and no one is getting compensation for that.  That is life.  Bonuses were paid when the economy was successful.  That time has passed.  Similarly with senior public servants, the era of bonuses has passed.  The Government's attempt to relieve them now and give them substantially greater pensions in the future as a result of this approach to bonuses is morally wrong, unfair to the people at the low end of the scale and will undermine the capacity of the Government to address the really difficult problems which lie ahead.

#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	684	Issues that were not addressed in the Finance Bill include the wider credit crisis and the issue of late payments which are crippling small and medium-sized businesses throughout this country.  Companies are stuck in a catch-22 situation with no money coming in, making it hard for expenditure such as staff wages to be met.  According to a survey last October by the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association, 60% of businesses indicated that late payments were playing havoc with their cash flow levels.  The negativity that has engulfed the economy has led to the deferral of a number of foreign direct investments that had been earmarked for the midlands and for my county of Longford in particular.  The IDA has confirmed that key money spinning foreign investments scheduled to come to County Longford have been temporarily shelved as a result of a negative perception of our economic standing.  The IDA said that it had expected more businesses to have come to the midlands.  Although some projects have been postponed, according to the IDA it was not possible to name their locations.  They would greatly benefit counties Longford and Westmeath where more than 15,000 are unemployed at present.County Longford's multinationals have endured mixed fortunes for the past year and a half.  Although Abbotts has confirmed its commitment to increase production capacity at its plant on the outskirts of Longford town, the US-owned company, Cameron, announced a 10% reduction in office and engineering staff through voluntary redundancies.  This followed an announcement in 2008 that the company was to expand its existing manufacturing, research and development facility in County Longford, with the creation of 140 jobs over the next five years.  This has all been put on hold.The loss of these jobs is only part of the continuing job drain threatening the economic viability of counties Longford and Westmeath, where live register figures rose by 22.8% and 28.5% in the past year.  The Government seems immune to the heartbreak and loss being experienced by families in these counties and across the country.  This Bill will not give them hope that the Government has a grip on job creation.  What plans are there to appoint a job facilitator for the midlands, particularly for counties Longford and Westmeath?Who exactly benefits from this Bill?  Would the Minister of State agree that the main winners are the Revenue Commissioners?  According to a spokesperson for the Department of Finance, Revenue will gain because of enhanced powers to ensure that everyone pays the correct amount of tax.  Where there are winners there will also be losers.  Once again the losers are the struggling lower and middle income earners and those who have seen their jobs evaporate into thin air.  The live register has risen again, despite the Minister's assurance in his budget speech that the worst was over.  What the Minister forgot to mention was that the worst is not over for already hard hit householders.  New stealth taxes are set to cripple further those who are unemployed and those who have faced pension levies, income levies and pay cuts.  The Exchequer is reaching out a grasping hand to take hundreds of euro of extra taxes through road tolls,waste services and car parking charges from people who simply cannot afford to pay another cent.The power this Bill will give to the Revenue Commissioners with regard to the black economy is welcome.  Retailers have claimed a loss of €700 million in revenue from illegal selling of tobacco on the black market.  The maximum fine for smuggling cigarettes has been increased from €12,695 to €126,690.I welcome two other provisions of the Bill, namely, the extension of mortgage relief to 2017 for those who took out a home loan in 2004 or after and the provision of some help to hard-pressed farmers struggling to comply with the nitrates directive.  I stress, however, that had the Minister not sold out farmers with regard to the payment of grants for the construction of slatted sheds, this belated help might not have been needed.Can I tell the people of my constituency that this Bill is a serious attempt to get those among them who have lost their jobs back to work?  Can I tell them that the Minister is making an honest effort to support the development of companies in Longford and Westmeath?  Can I tell them that the pain will now be shared across every sector in the country?  I think not.
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	685	I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution on the Finance Bill.  The Minister said yesterday that we were setting the seeds for economic recovery and new job creation.  Over the past two years, all Members, particularly Opposition Members, have been saying that the most important factor for recovery for the country is job creation.  We need more jobs.  However, the Government does not seem to have the slightest semblance of a job creation policy.  Nothing the Government or any Minister has done indicates they have a job creation policy.  Until that happens, the road to recovery will lead nowhere.  The green shoots we heard mentioned are no longer green, despite the many opportunities that exist for the Government to act with regard to job creation.In addition to the failure in the area of job creation, there is an issue with regard to finance being made available for small businesses.  In constituencies throughout the country we all see small businesses folding.  Yesterday, we heard of the 750 job losses in Halifax, Bank of Scotland (Ireland) and of job losses in Galway, the main industrial pivot of my county.  These major job losses get the headlines, but small businesses in every town and village are, slowly but surely, shedding jobs.  These all add up to a significant number and should not just be seen as a figure.  Behind each job loss lies a family and the people connected to that family.  In this Finance Bill, the Minister has clearly lost sight of these facts.The director of Financial Services Ireland, Brendan Kelly, said recently that attracting senior staff to Ireland is essential to get firms to set up here and create jobs.  That is all very well as a statement, but with no disrespect to the expertise that might come here from outside, we have never had as many people with the highest qualifications possible in every sphere of industry and technology as we have now, but they still cannot get work.  As a result, they are leaving the country.  If we look at our unemployment statistics, we see that the greatest proportion of those out of work are young people under 30 years of age, yet these are a great reserve of expertise in many areas.  We must plead with the Minister to deal with this issue once and for all.  He must return to this issue and provide a policy.  Even if it costs money, he must do it in order to provide employment.  The Minister has said that by the end of this year we will have a 13% rate of unemployment.  Tragically, the rate will not stop at 13% judging by the current trend.  We are only two months into 2010 and there has already been a significant increase in unemployment.The Government has failed miserably to tackle the banks.  We were promised 18 months ago and even a year ago that the Minister would, through intercession with the banks, make resources and finance available to small companies to help them develop and carry on in business.  That has not happened.  Until it does and until pressure is put on the banks, they will continue to claw back their losses in every way possible.  Overdraft facilities and other accommodations available in the past have been withdrawn and businesses are collapsing.  We can see from what is happening in our courts day after day that companies are going into examinership or being liquidated.  This cannot be allowed to continue.  The only intervention that will work is for the Minister to direct the banks to accept their responsibility.  They lent the money before when they wanted to create competition, but now they are looking for the money back at the expense of small businesses.The Minister's token response to the issue of people with incomes of over €1 million per annum was to impose a levy of €200,000 per annum.  This is only a token gesture and is only a pretence to the electorate that something is being done.  The Minister must get his act together in the interest of the many people who will lose their jobs and those who have put their hard-earned money into businesses that will go to the wall.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	686	Last night, I listened with great interest to the contribution by Deputy Michael D. Higgins, who advocated a greater in-depth discussion on economic policy and the future direction we should take.  I also listened to Deputy Joan Burton on "Tonight with Vincent Browne" where she expressed her preference for a return to Keynesian economics.  In the past 100 years three main economic philosophies have impacted on our society.  The first of these was Keynesian economics, which advocated a mixed economy, predominantly a private sector economy but with a large role for the Government and public sector.  This served as an economic model at the end of the 1930s after the depression at that time and after the Second World War.  It was a very successful model until the end of the 1960s or early 1970s when we had stagflation, due to the lack of governance over government expenditure.  This caused trouble back in the 1970s, when our economy was also in great distress.  It was followed by Milton Friedman, whose philosophy extolled the virtues of the free market economic system with little intervention by government.  It was taken on board by Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan as well as by the Russian Government.  It worked for a while but lack of governance and light regulation again became a feature.  There was excessive and reckless lending, and massaging of facts and figures, and we are now suffering the result of that economic policy of recent years.Totalitarianism is the third area.  It contained no lack of governance as it was governed by the centrist power which effectively destroyed all other countries which were under the control of that centre.  We now witness the problems that policy created for the countries affected which are having great difficulty in rebuilding a sustainable economy.  Those are the three philosophies which have had supremacy in the past 100 years.Some of that totalitarian policy was expressed by members of the Official IRA and Sinn Féin, the Workers' Party, as well as the Workers' Party.  I wonder if it has gone through the veins of those who have moved on to the centre left and are in this House today.I agree with Deputy Michael D. Higgins that there should be more discussion on what economic policy we should follow.  However, I would also contend that the Governments of this country have been very pragmatic in the policies they have followed.  They have been successful, in the main, from the 1960s, with a blip in the 1970s and early 1980s, following which we improved, although we are now in trouble again.  A great part of the reason we are in trouble is that there has been lack of enforcement of the substantial body of regulation contained in our legal system.The Finance Bill is legislation that every year gives legal effect to the proposals that are outlined in the budget.  Many of the contributions in the House were of a budgetary nature, which is understandable.  However, there was dissent from the Opposition side, with the Finance Bill being contradicted, and it was said we were doing nothing for employment or to stimulate the economy.  Of course, the Members on this side have said the opposite.  What the Opposition is suggesting does not reflect the reality of Government policy and what has been done, particularly in the past year, in order to stabilise and achieve a working banking system.There is significant investment in the economy.  Over the next six years, €40 billion is earmarked for investment in infrastructure, €6 billion of which is for 2010.  Some €130 million is for energy efficiency measures, €10 million is for the food industry, over €50 million is for support for new agri-environmental schemes, €120 million is for support to forestry and bio-energy and there is substantial support to employers through the stabilisation fund and the temporary subsidy scheme, which will cost in the region of €165 million in 2010.A new scheme that will promote local employment and reduce PRSI contributions has been introduced.  Under this scheme, when an employer creates a new job and employs a person who has been on the live register for six months or more, the employer will then be exempt from employers' PRSI contributions for the first 12 months of that employment.  Typically, this will save approximately €3,000 per annum in the cost of employment, which is a huge saving in any business.While many businesses have been afraid to take on new staff in the current economic climate, I hope this scheme will give them extra encouragement.  It is particularly aimed at those who have been on the live register for six months or more, as these are the people who generally find it most difficult to find new employment.  This is a strong, positive step by the Government to promote employment and I hope there will be significant uptake by companies and businesses.The decision in budget 2010 to retain Ireland's corporation tax rate at 12.5% sends a clear message globally that Ireland is open for business.  Given the current economic climate, it is vital a small country such as Ireland continues to attract new enterprise and employment.  By retaining our attractive corporation tax rate, we are sending a positive signal to both existing and potential international investors that Ireland is the place to do business.In budget 2009, the Government introduced a three-year corporate and capital tax exemption for start-up companies in 2009.  I am pleased that in this Bill, the Minister for Finance has extended this scheme to companies which commenced trading in 2010.  This will be at a cost of €6 million in 2010 and €15 million in 2011.  This will be an incentive to new companies and it is vital they are given the support they need to succeed at this difficult time.Ireland has been extraordinarily successful in attracting foreign direct investment, punching way above its weight for many years.  Over the course of the past 20 years, Ireland has earned a reputation as one of the most attractive jurisdictions in which to establish an investment fund, ranking among the most flexible and advantageous international fund domiciles, due in no small part to the wide variety of funds which may be established under the Irish legal and regulatory system, as well as Ireland's ability to react promptly to the demands of both fund promoters and investors.The latest development in Ireland's offering is the proposed new re-domiciliation process which will enable funds from other jurisdictions to re-domicile to Ireland in an efficient manner.  Ireland's growth in the investment funds arena may be attributed to a number of factors, including regulation.  Ireland is a regulated jurisdiction offering both UCITS and non-UCITS products across the whole spectrum from plain long-only products through to UCITS alternatives, hedge funds and FoHF, real estate and private equity schemes.  The Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority has many years of experience in authorising and regulating sophisticated investment strategies and products, and has adapted and developed its regulations to keep pace with developments in the funds industry internationally.With regard to tax, Ireland has a favourable tax regime for investment funds, including, first, exemption from tax on the fund's income and-or gains; second, no withholding of taxes on distributions to non-Irish resident investors; and third, a wide and expanding network of double taxation treaties.  With regard to the legal environment, Ireland operates under a common law legal system, with a variety of suitable fund structures — corporate, CCF and ILP.  All of the leading fund custodians and administrators have operations in Ireland staffed by teams with in-depth experience across the full range of fund products.  This is demonstrated by the fact that approximately 50% of all global hedge funds are administered in Ireland.  Ireland's international status is also a factor.  Ireland is a member of the European Union, the OECD and the Financial Action Task Force.  As well as being an attractive jurisdiction for the establishment of new investment funds, Ireland now offers a relatively straightforward process for re-domiciling to Ireland an investment fund established in another jurisdiction.Islamic finance is a growing player in the financial world and it is estimated that the fund is up to $800 billion and growing.  Section 35 contains provisions which will help Ireland to attract our share of the growing market in Islamic finance.The decision to introduce a national solidarity bond, announced in the budget, is given effect in the Bill.  I congratulate the Minister in this regard.  This bond will be administered by the National Treasury Management Agency, will provide alternative investment opportunity to small investors and will pay interest during and at the end of the term of investment.  I welcome the provision in section 52 which clarifies that the disponer of land under compulsory purchase order has no liability to pay until compensation has been received.The European Court of Justice requires that the VAT Act be amended to allow public bodies, including local authorities, to be subject to VAT.  This has nothing to do with the Lisbon treaty despite the assertion of some people that it does.  There are reports that full VAT in respect of a product or service will be added on to a bill.  However, this is not correct.  VAT on inputs can be offset against VAT on invoices which people receive and business customers who charge VAT can claim for any VAT charged by a public body.In his Budget Statement the Minister said he would commence implementation of the Commission of Taxation report recommendations in 2010 and 2011.  He has kept his word and has abolished six tax reliefs and extended mortgage tax relief for the benefit of mortgagees.  I welcome the Minister's decision to clarify that tax relief is available in respect of private contributions made towards the cost of upkeep of an individual under the fair deal scheme.  This tax relief on extra payments is welcome as our elderly population and the cost of nursing homes increases.Section 33 introduces an amendment in respect of Deposit Interest Retention Tax, DIRT, which I welcome.  This removes PRSAs from the scope of DIRT, requires a relevant deposit taker to obtain the tax reference number of the person making a specified deposit and that the financial institution will make accelerated payments of DIRT tax to the Exchequer.  Also, the financial institution must automatically issue statements setting out the amount of DIRT deducted rather than honour a request in this regard as is currently the position.  This amendment is welcome and timely.I welcome the changes to the current research and development tax credit scheme.  Research and development is vital to the development of our economy.  The current scheme has been a draw-back to research and development in that people who invested in two sites could not, if one closed, transfer the benefit to the other site.  As a result of the change where two sites are located within 20 kilometres of one another and one closes the benefit can be transferred to the other.  It is vital that every assistance is given to our research and development agencies and companies.There is much concern in regard to the housing market and people getting into financial difficulties with their mortgages.  The repossession of family homes by financial institutions creates tremendous social, psychological and economic issues for borrowers and their families and places further financial pressures on the State.  The Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service heard submissions from Respond Housing and the Prevention of Family Home Repossession Group who outlined solutions to allow the borrower time and methods of addressing their debt.  Following the hearings the committee submitted a report on the matter to the Minister for Finance.  I was pleased to hear during the week of the decision by the Financial Regulator to make a statutory order to outlaw repossession of a house for one year.  It is important that individuals who get into financial difficulty are able to approach their lending institution to discuss their problem and to try to reach an agreement which resolves it.  I look forward to a more comprehensive report during the next few months from the Financial Regulator which will assist people in difficulty to work their way through these difficult times.This Finance Bill in conjunction with the budget proceeds in the right direction and ensures that the primary objectives of budget 2010 are achieved.  These objectives are to stabilise the deficit in a fair manner, to restore Ireland's competitiveness, to guard those worst hit by the recession, to stimulate crucial sectors of the economy and to sustain and create jobs.

#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	689	I am deeply disappointed with the Finance Bill 2010 which does not recognise the crisis in society, due in part to the recession, in respect of mental well-being, in particular depression caused by the situation that has developed.In general, I am disappointed that the Bill and budget did not respond to the needs, expressed for a number of years, in terms of under-funding of the psychiatric services.  Some 6.7% of the total health budget is now allocated to psychiatric services.  The figure for England and Wales is 13% and for Scotland 18%.  We have neglected our mental health services and it is extremely disappointing that the Bill and the budget ignored the glaring need to respond to this issue.Long-term psychiatric patients are living in Dickensian-type accommodation.  The inspector of mental services, who recently spoke about particular institutions, has expressed horror in respect of the conditions in this regard.  For as long as I have been a Member of the Oireachtas, now almost 21 years, there have been promises of funding in this area.  However, during that period the total budget for the psychiatric service in terms of the overall health budget has been decreasing.  Time and again we have spoken about this issue to no avail.  I take this opportunity to remind the Government that it has again ignored this crucial societal and medical issue.  People are entitled to modern conditions and facilities and to a response to the recommendations of the mental health services report entitled A Vision for Change which was accepted by Government four years ago.  Despite the firm commitments made by Government these problems have not been fully resolved and the recommendations have not been fully implemented.Moneys allocated two years ago by the Minister for Health and Children for the improvement of mental health services was syphoned off into the health budget.  For the following two years, this was used as an excuse not to provide further funding to the mental health services.  The Minister for Health and Children asked at a committee meeting why she should give money to the Health Service Executive to address mental health service issues when it will not use it for that purpose.  I wonder who is in charge.  The urgency with which this issue must be addressed in times of the recession is again highlighted in significant deterioration in the area of mental health.  A report published last year indicated that more than 50% of respondents were going without food and heating.I turn now to deal with problem debt, which is a real issue for many people in our society.  At present, debt is a real issue for many people who may never have experienced such problems in the past.  Of those who had debt problems, 71% ran out of money every week or most weeks, 87% relied on credit to pay for food and everyday costs, 56% went without food due to debt, 21% went without heating and 92% reported not being able to socialise.  The research also found that people with mental health problems are three times more likely to be in debt as they are living on a low income and unable to work due to difficulties getting a job because of the stigma or due to ill health.One of the challenges facing society, and in particular the Oireachtas and the Government, is to fund programmes to deal with psychiatric illness.  Until we destigmatise it, society will not accept it as a normal illness, although that is what it is.  People with psychiatric illness cannot help being ill, any more than those with a heart condition, influenza, diabetes or any other medical condition.  In the case of depression, we know that with early intervention there is a 90% chance of achieving a full cure.  People, and especially children, are not getting the opportunity to receive such intervention treatment.It is important that debt collection agency staff receive mental health awareness training.  Banks should adopt a system whereby customers can choose to have their account monitored for erratic spending to better protect their finances.  Irish personal debt stands at a staggering €172 billion and is a significant cost on our mental health.  Money worries are not just keeping people awake at night; they are causing high levels of stress, depression and in some cases self-harm and suicide.  At a time when people across the country are anxious about their finances, debt depression is a real and growing concern.People living with mental health problems are particularly vulnerable to being trapped in a cycle of debt and poverty with many unable to work due to ill health.  People are becoming dependent on credit to pay for everyday essentials.  Those on lower incomes are more likely to get credit from lenders who charge astronomical interest rates.  It is a worrying trend as people are left facing a mountain of debt that they have no means of repaying.If we are going to tackle this massive inequality and really help people who are struggling with mental health problems and debt, we need to see action by the Government, the HSE, banks, debt-collection agencies and other creditors.  The Government must provide a lead in this respect.  The Bill before us, however, has missed the opportunity to give such a lead.  The budget missed this opportunity also in failing to allocate sufficient funds to a mental health service, which is totally underfunded.Changes in practice, such as waiving fees when a customer has been unwell and introducing mental health awareness training for bank staff, would make all the difference.  Creditors have a duty to help and not hound their customers, especially when they are coping with serious health problems.People with bipolar disorder, which can cause sufferers to spend extravagantly during a manic phase or schizophrenia, are four times more likely to be in debt than the rest of society.  According to the survey to which I referred earlier, fewer than one in three people with problem debt informed the organisation to which they owed money of their mental health problems because they did not think that they would be understood or believed.  Some 83% of those who did tell creditors continued to be harassed about their debt payments.  The Government must give leadership in this area and ensure that resources are available to psychiatric services to deal with this fallout from the current economic crisis.An issue that has arisen in the past two weeks concerns the release from the Central Statistics Office of suicide levels for the first half of 2009.  The Government must address the emergency that has arisen concerning these suicide rates.  The latest figures from the Central Statistics Office show the number of deaths by suicide increased by 35% in the first half of 2009.  Some 228 people took their own lives in the first half of last year, compared to 169 in the same period in 2008.  The Government must pay heed to the link between recession, unemployment and suicide.It is alarming that the Government has not responded to this emergency, although it is aware of it.  As I said earlier, the Government responded inadequately to flooding before Christmas and to the big freeze-up after Christmas.  It must now respond adequately to the suicide emergency.Figures for the second quarter of 2009 show that there were 122 deaths by suicide in that period, which is an increase from 95 deaths by suicide in the second quarter of 2008.  Taken with the first quarter figures for 2009, this shows that over the first half of last year 228 people took their own lives, an increase of 35% on the first half of 2008.  Some 77% of the deaths by suicide were among men, while 40% of those who took their own lives were under 35 years of age.  This, therefore, is a young person's problem facing those who have a lot of potential and much to contribute.  We must bear in mind the trauma that suicide causes to the bereaved families and relatives.  The Government should regard an increase of the magnitude of 35% in the number of suicides as warranting an emergency response.The link between suicide and financial disaster has been well established.  Unemployment, insecure employment, threat to or loss of home and restricted access to credit take a heavy psychological toll on public health.  There is a reduction in mental well-being and an increase in mental health problems, substance misuse, relationship breakdown and divorce.During recessionary times, there is a sudden gap between material needs and resources.  In economic downturns, frustration increases as an increasing proportion of people cannot realise their financial goals.  This frustration can increase aggression, including suicide.Research published in 1967 found that the absolute value of change in stock market prices was associated with an increase in male suicide rates from 1929 to 1940.  This confirmed the position that economic change downwards in the business cycle increases suicide.  In earlier studies the rate of unemployment emerged as the leading predictor of suicide rates.  There have been numerous studies of this type over the years.  Most continue to illustrate a clear link between unemployment and suicide rates.  This is true especially for males.  All studies show higher rates of ill health, both psychological and physical, in men and women who are in insecure work or are unemployed.  A protracted period of unemployment of people at a young age seems to have a particularly deleterious effect on the mental health of young men, regardless of their social background.Unemployment affects the suicide rate and has a profound effect on a person, especially on the young and on those in middle age.  Irish society awards status and prestige according to a person's position and contribution to work.  Unemployment is associated with loss of face and of prestige.  The unemployed are six times more likely to be suffering from a psychiatric disorder than those in employment, and they are three to four times more likely to take their own lives.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	690	I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on this Bill.  I pay tribute to Deputy Neville and I listened carefully to what he had to say.   The impact of recession and depression on people's mental health and the stress which people are under very often because of financial pressures is something we are all encountering increasingly.  We must redouble our efforts to assist people who are under unbelievable pressure at the moment.  It is frightening.The Minister recognises that the unemployment rate will peak this year at more than 13%.  However, he does not take into account the 60,000 people who have emigrated, many of them young people.  Almost every family has now experienced this.  That is something the Minister should have acknowledged in his speech and perhaps he will do so when he sums up later.  We need to work as hard as we can to encourage and support small business.  There is not much mention in the Minister's speech about small businesses, which are haemorrhaging jobs at an alarming rate.  I see no strategy in that regard from the Minister.In his speech the Minister spoke about the responsibility to change our behaviour to reduce greenhouse gases and he has introduced a carbon tax and so forth.  I recently raised the matter of electricity micro-generation with the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  He told me that in February 2009 he launched the micro-generation programme, which had "the potential to provide up to 4,000 domestic customers investing in micro-scale projects with a financial payment for electricity exported back to the grid".  This is direct import substitution.  However, the uptake to date has been very disappointing.  Although the target was 4,000, only 189 people had taken up the programme.  I am glad the Minister for Finance has joined us.  I asked people why this might be the case.  Many people who want to participate in micro-generation are farmers who want to install a wind turbine on their land.  However, they will be charged VAT to install a turbine.  If the Government target is 4,000 and only 189 have taken it up, what is wrong?  I believe VAT is a problem.I understand that farmers, who put in a diesel generator to generate electricity for their farm, pay no VAT on it.  However, those installing a wind turbine to do the same job must pay VAT.  I ask the Minister to review the matter.  I believe there is an anomaly which should be corrected.  If the Government is serious about micro-generation from renewable sources this matter could be addressed now in the Finance Bill.  I ask the Minister to consider it on Committee Stage.  He may have a reason for not doing it.  In a response to a parliamentary question the Minister stated it would be acceptable if it were only for agricultural purposes.  However, if a farmer wants to generate electricity using micro-generation for farming purposes he should be assisted and encouraged to do so.  If VAT is a problem then perhaps that should be removed if it is possible.Another matter is related if we want to encourage people in enterprise and so on.  The Student Support Bill is languishing somewhere in Committee and has been there for years.  Every day people contact us saying they want to go back to college or school.  People contacted me today who had submitted an application in August and have still not received the grant.  There is something awfully wrong there.  Perhaps the Minister could bring forward the scheme for third level grants to earlier in the year.  The Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science is also in the House.  Why not publish the scheme in March so that before people go to college they know whether they qualify for the grant?  Why wait until the end of August?  People must prove that they are in need of financial support in order to get the grant so they must be not well off.  However, they then must wait until February to get the grant.  People are dropping out of college across the country because they cannot afford to keep going.  They do not have enough money to buy food to eat.  This is an administrative, bureaucratic problem that has nothing to do with anything else.  I challenge the Minister for Finance to bring the scheme forward earlier in the year.  The tax year ends in December.  There is no reason these forms should not be available in March allowing students to know in June whether they will get the grant.  If they get a place in college, they would then know they could finance it.  This is something simple that should have been done long ago.Some €900 million was supposed to have been provided for the disability strategy.  I have asked several Ministers, including the Minister opposite, to provide me with a breakdown.  It was supposed to have been €900 million over five years.  Was it ever there?  My suspicion is that it was not.  I challenge the Minister opposite to go back to the Department.  Either he or his predecessor committed €900 million for the disability strategy.  Where is it?  This goes back to value for money.  I want to know if the money was provided and on what was it spent.  Despite asking time out of number, no Minister can tell me what happened to that money and whether it ever existed.The Bill makes no mention of tackling all the quangos and their cost.  Although we have been promised it, it has not happened.

#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	700	With due respect to the Minister, whom I am glad to see here, the budget is bereft of vision, devoid of ideas and lacking in philosophy.  I am always very fair and there are some very good ideas in the budget.  However, I am concerned that the budget contained nothing to tackle the scourge of unemployment and losing jobs.  There was not just a tacit acceptance, there was an explicit acceptance that by the end of this year 75,000 more people will be unemployed.  At a net cost of €20,000 each it would total approximately €1.5 billion, a very significant amount.  I need not spell out the impact of that as I know the Minister is acutely aware of it.  There is nothing for jobs in the budget.I am concerned that we have got into confrontational mode, sometimes inspired by a right-wing media agenda that it is best to confront unions and adopt a macho pose that shows the Government is stronger and will muscle people down.  However, the very people the Government is tackling are the people who have the few bob that the Government is giving them on behalf of the State and they actually spend it.  The circular theory of money and the velocity theory of money are nowhere more pronounced than among the very people who are in the low and middle-income groups.  The propensity and ability to save among those people is minuscule.  The propensity to save among people from the high middle-income groups and upwards has increased from the normal 2.5% to 3% up to 10% or 11%.  That is a also problem owing to lack of confidence.  There is no confidence engendered in the budget to get those people releasing money and buying in the marketplace.  Therefore we are perpetuating the problem rather than tackling and arresting it and introducing initiatives to try to get money flowing again.It is about time the Government took the opportunity to get the trade union movement back into constructive dialogue.  The Minister for Finance, a person of great sense and tremendous intelligence — I do not say that in any condescending way — knows this better than I do and can expound about it better that I would ever do.  The opportunities that existed in early December should be revisited.  Let us try to get the trade union movement and the Government back on the pitch playing a positive and constructive role.  We should never denigrate or forget the impact of the previous partnerships and understandings.  They should not be written off because it suits a media agenda to write them off.  We should always pay particular tribute because without their participation and positive impact we would not have seen the illusion of success that some people enjoyed.  How short term it was.  Nevertheless, they played a major role in addressing the significant financial and fiscal crisis that existed from the late 1980s onwards.  We cannot forget about that.Youth unemployment is an enormous problem.  Over the last two and a half years, there has been a 150% increase and it is a social timebomb.  It is impacting negatively on young people and is an enormous challenge.  The last figure was 84,398 and there is very little concentration on jobs.  This cohort of people believes the Government has thrown them to one side.  The only thing they could extract from the budget was the fact that it was an attack upon them.  There was a reduction in social welfare for most of them.  Most of them do not even want to draw it at all.  As regards the back to education and back to work allowances, all the time limits should be cut out.  If the Labour Party was in government or whoever, I would not vote for them, as a backbencher, unless they got rid of the stupid six-months and three-months limits.  It is better to have people in the education system or to retain the back to work allowance or anything that gives soul and direction to people's lives.

#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	702	That is right, discipline.  Deputy Morgan is correct.  The number of places available for further education and retraining should be increased, and there should be more graduate places, job opportunities and internships.  My colleague, Deputy Michael D. Higgins has explained this in great detail.  There was no jobs stimulus package and I cannot for the life of me understand how a little island nation with 4 million people, the size of Manchester, which has achieved so much on the cultural, social and recreational playing fields, in technology and everything can expect to get out of this recession without this.  Why do we believe we are so different from everywhere else in the world that we can rise to the challenge, without a stimulus package — a country that depends on Ryanair and Aer Lingus to get people here?I have had my differences with Michael O'Leary, probably more than many.  He is probably at a different end of the political spectrum to me, but I respect him.  He often says things with which I fundamentally differ but if he says there is an 80% drop in tourism because of a "tourist tax", I must believe him.  I would not side with everything he says as regards charges, but if Spain and every other country is doing away with this tax to attract tourists we must address this.  Tourism is so important for the midlands, as the Minister knows.  He knows all about Athlone and the importance of tourism there, and his aunt will be making a case to the Minister in this regard.  It is very important throughout the midlands.  We have beautiful lakes, from Loughrea, through to Lough Erne, Lough Derravaragh, Lough Owell and Lough Ennell, the best places in the country.  We need to get tourists in, but we are inhibiting them by imposing unnecessary taxes.Tourists will spend once they arrive at their destination.  Somebody accused me the other day of never coming up with an idea for bringing people in.  If he was in government, he said, he would give tourists €10 and €20 vouchers to spend.  If such vouchers are given, the recipients will spend €200.  I remember, as a young lad going to Atlantic City when one was given $100.  The Minister probably did this, too, as a student.  When one went in with the $100 one was quickly cleaned out, but at least the money got one in and one never forgot the experience.  It was a good lesson.It is extremely worrying that 60% of young people in a recent youth poll expected to be unemployed after graduating.  We are all in favour of the carbon tax, but I must warn that there are areas of agriculture on which we could be impacting in a very negative way if it is introduced in the manner now being planned.  I appeal to the Minister and his officials not to throw the baby out with the bath water.  The carbon tax is a good idea, but we could end up negatively impacting on the agricultural industry, depending on how we apply it.  It is no use adding charges to the productive sectors of the economy that could militate against achieving the additional production that is vital for getting us back on the road again.  I thank the Minister.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	703	I thank Deputy Penrose for giving me five minutes of his time and indeed, the Minister, for allowing this.Everybody understood that this was going to be a tough budget, but what caused dismay was how pessimistic it was.  It offered no hope as regards the challenges we and our constituents face, particularly in relation to unemployment.  Factored into the budget was a greatly increased number of people coming on the dole, 75,000, instead of a calculated position that would provide opportunities for job creation in the course of the year.Reform is a word that is used a good deal in this Chamber, but I felt, in particular, that no attempt was being made to reform the public service.  We had an bord snip nua, Colm McCarthy's report.  Most of us agreed with parts of it, while not everyone, even on the Government side, agreed with all of it.  However, that was some type of template that the Government simply ignored when it came to dealing with reforming the way the State operates.Even as late as today the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has had to extricate himself in a rather undignified fashion from a situation, essentially of his own making, as regards appointments to the RTE board and the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.  An bord snip nua said there should be no broadcasting authority but rather one regulator for communications in broadcasting.  This would save money and be a streamlined approach to make Government work better.  However, the Government does not care and is not interested in reform.The Government is, however, interested in reducing people's incomes.  I should like to put it on the public record that the next time somebody starts to bash the public sector we should remember the men who went out and kept our roads open all over Christmas and the new year.  The only thanks they got at the end of that lengthy period, while the rest of us tried to enjoy ourselves, was less money in their pay packets.  That is the reality of the Government approach to this.  It is not reform but rather an attack on people with very modest incomes who deserve better.As regards employment, there is nothing in this budget that opens up the opportunities that exist for us.  It is extremely frustrating when one looks at the opportunities that are there, particularly in the area of renewables, in energy and the smart economy that everyone talks about.  The reality, however, does not match the talk or the rhetoric.  The Labour Party produced a document not long ago which clearly set out the fact that 80,000 jobs could be created in the energy sector if we had a Government willing to head up such an initiative.  We itemised the areas, one of which is so simple that I challenge the Minister to look again at what he calls the national retrofit programme, which is included in the budget.  Essentially, there is no additional money allocated.  It is a grand name for funding that is already in place for various grant schemes that operate out of Sustainable Energy Ireland and some money that is allocated to local authorities.If there are changes it will not be because there is additional funding.  It will not mean that more people are taken on, construction and highly skilled workers who could be put to work retrofitting homes in a way that would meet the challenges we all face regarding climate change.  It simply means there are some management reorganising schemes, and when one looks at the figures at the end of last year for the particular grant scheme which was introduced, where about €45 million was allocated — the home energy scheme — they show that something like €34 million remained unspent by the end of the year.  There was what I would not quite consider to be manipulation, but certainly a little reorganisation to try to make the figures look good.  However, the figures are actually damning when one considers the need to retrofit our buildings.  We cannot continue to burn up fossil fuel and cause carbon emissions as we have done in the past.  We can put people to work who have the skills and we can do so now.  However, I regret deeply that the Minister has simply failed to consider the opportunity that existed under his nose in this budget to put people back to work.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	704	I thank the many Deputies who made their considered and useful contributions to the debate yesterday evening and today and I look forward to a constructive discussion on Committee Stage.  I will try, as far as possible in the time available to me, to address the points raised by the Deputies yesterday and today.  Of course, there will be a further opportunity on Committee Stage to deal in greater detail with issues covered by the Bill.I refer to some of the more general issues raised, especially by Deputies Bruton and Burton.  It was argued by some that the Bill does not contain a vision.  Deputy Higgins suggested the Bill was unimaginative while Deputy Enright suggested it was unambitious, but I disagree.  The Bill contains significant measures that will enable Ireland to build on its existing strengths as an economy.  These measures, when taken together with our budgetary strategy, will protect existing jobs and create additional ones.  They will support export-led growth in services and goods, the best way of maintaining and enhancing our international competitiveness, which I highlighted on 9 December as a key focus of the budget this year.  Unless we sharpen our competitive edge, we will not be unable to return to the tried and tested strategy of export-led growth.Some Opposition Deputies described the Bill as a housekeeping exercise devoid of ideas to deal with the challenges facing us at present.  Such a view contrasts sharply with the commentary from the industries and enterprises on which we will rely to create well-paid jobs in the economy as we return to growth.  It was suggested the Bill lacked focus and placed an unfair burden on taxpayers.  This, after all, was a budget that contained no personal tax increases and some reductions in consumption taxes.  The Opposition must lack focus or must be unable to see the big picture if this was not evident from the budget.The 2010 budget and the Finance Bill build on the work that started in budget 2009.  We have made significant progress in stabilising the public finances.  The adjustments involved very hard decisions and I am aware of their impact on citizens, but they were necessary to ensure the very financial survival of the country.  Those decisive actions have enabled us to stabilise the deficit and have led to a reduction in the cost of borrowing by the State.In the run up to the budget, I made it clear that we could not tax our way out of our difficulties.  My sense was the main Opposition party agreed with this view.  Accordingly, the budget focused on expenditure and did not increase the burden of income tax.  That approach also informed the development of the Finance Bill.  Deputies will be aware that there are no tax increases in its provisions, apart from a number of measures aimed to ensure high earners pay their fair share and I make no apology for including these measures.In her contribution to the debate, Deputy Burton moved quite a distance from the subject to engage in a discussion about the banks and the builders.  Loth though I am to follow her departure from the subject of the debate, I wish to deal with the accusation that I misled the House about the attitude of the IMF, International Monetary Fund, to NAMA.  Deputy Burton was relying on a newspaper report of last Monday.  The note on which the report was based contains a ringing endorsement of NAMA by the IMF.  In fact, it states that "the IMF would have been encouraging the adoption of a NAMA-type initiative even if the Minister for Finance had not already announced it".

It was in the context of a discussion about that very point that Mr. Seelig made his remarks about the impact of NAMA on the availability of credit.  I am very pleased that Mr. Seelig has, at my request, agreed to serve on the board of NAMA when he retires from the IMF this year.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	714	This is why the credit guidelines were included in the NAMA legislation and this is why NAMA was set up to cleanse the banks' balance sheets of toxic loans.  The IMF delegation agreed with this view and that point was made in the debate.I refer to measures contained in the Bill.  I welcome the support given by Deputies Bruton and Kennedy and the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, on the extension of mortgage interest relief for those who bought at the peak of the housing market.  The extension of mortgage interest relief will help those who purchased in 2004 or later, and the transitional measures may, as Deputy Kennedy highlighted, act as a stimulus to those who wish to enter the housing market at this stage.  The commitment to remove this relief altogether by 2018 will provide significant savings to the Exchequer.  Deputies Crawford and Enright suggested mortgage interest relief is not available for individuals on low incomes.  Mortgage interest relief is a tax relief of up to 25% on interest.  It is applied at source, thereby reducing the total mortgage payment.  It is available to all qualifying loans regardless of the income of the mortgage holders.Deputy Burton referred to the budget speech, in which I indicated high earners must pay their fair share.  The amendments to the restriction of reliefs measure announced in the budget and set out in this Bill will curtail severely the number of tax reliefs that can be used to reduce the income tax liability of those on high incomes.  It will ensure that, in addition to PRSI and levies, those with high incomes and using reliefs will have an effective income tax rate of approximately 30%.  I thank Deputy Moynihan for his support on this and other taxation issues in his contribution.Deputies Bruton, Burton and O'Donnell all referred to the need for tax incentives for start-up companies.  In particular, Deputy Burton referred to the need to help indigenous start-ups and in the Bill I have made provision for an extension of the tax exemption for new start-up companies introduced in budget 2009 to companies who commence to trade this year.  The Commission on Taxation proposed to extend the measure to non-corporates until 2011.  New start-ups that commence trading in 2010 may continue to avail of the exemption up to and including 2012.Deputy O'Donnell made reference also to the research and development tax credit scheme and proposed that the credit should be allowed to be offset against PRSI.  This proposal is not new and I am aware of other proposals to allow companies set off the tax credit against payroll tax liabilities.  The suggestion has serious implications for the Exchequer in respect of the funding of pensions and social insurance payments in future.  There are serious difficulties in acceding to such requests having regard to the implications for the social insurance fund into which contributions are paid.  The research and development tax credit scheme has been improved in most budgets and Finance Acts since its introduction in 2004.  Significant enhancements have been made to the scheme in budget 2009 and the Finance (No. 2) Act 2008.  These and other changes have made the scheme one of the most competitive schemes of its type, a matter to which I point in response to Deputy Burton's assertion that Ireland's only competitive advantage is its 12.5% tax rate.I am conscious there are reasons, other than cash-flow, certain companies and advisers wish to allow the tax credit to be offset against payroll costs but it should be possible to devise an accounting solution which will deal with the issues in this area.I agree with Deputy Burton that Ireland's reputation is the key to our future success, both from a regulatory and a tax policy perspective.  The Government has announced significant reform of regulatory structures.  Legislation in this regard will be before the House this year.Deputy Burton also referred to a front page article in the Sunday Business Post which alleged a tax loophole cost the Exchequer €400 million in lost revenue.  Deputy Ardagh questioned whether the figures quoted in the story were correct.  Unfortunately, the tax loss figure quoted in the story was highly inaccurate.  The amount of artificial capital losses claimed was €409 million and the amount of capital gains tax potentially under threat was in the region of €85 million.  Furthermore, contrary to that newspaper report, I point out that artificial losses are already being challenged by the Revenue under the general anti-avoidance provisions contained in the section 811 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  Deputy Burton then questioned why something was not done before now about this matter.  However, the Deputy should note that much has been done.  While the UK introduced a broad based approach to tackling such aggressive avoidance in its Finance Act 2007, we already had the general anti-avoidance measure in place.  Then, we took measures under the Finance (No. 2) Act 2008 to counter aggressive avoidance schemes which had come to light, involving the creation of artificial capital losses.  Such schemes will continue to be under review.  I am surprised the Deputy did not go the trouble of checking the facts on this matter for herself rather than relying on a highly inaccurate newspaper report.

The impact of the carbon tax on agriculture has been mentioned by a number of Deputies, including Deputies Crawford, Breen, O'Mahony, Sherlock and Naughten.  Although I appreciate the position many farmers currently find themselves in, the excise duty on agricultural diesel is only around one tenth of that applying to auto-diesel.  That in itself is a significant concession.  The new carbon charge must be based on the emissions that arise from the fuel used.  Therefore, to ignore such emissions would simply undermine the rationale for the tax in the first place.Deputy Bruton pointed out that the application of a carbon tax to coal and peat creates difficulties because of the potential for products with lower environmental standards to be sourced in Northern Ireland.  I agree with him and assure him I will not be introducing the tax on coal and peat until I am satisfied this issue is addressed appropriately.  That is why a specific date is not signalled in the legislation.  Work has already commenced on this matter within the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.Deputies Bruton and Burton referred to local authority services being made subject to VAT on foot of a decision by the European Court of Justice in July 2009.  To comply with the court's ruling, it is necessary to extend VAT to certain categories of local government services.

The closure of the homeless shelter in Cedar House, Marlborough Place, Dublin 1 was sudden and unilateral.  It came without consultation with the staff or any notice to the clientele, and I understand it is being implemented next month.  As of yet, the representatives of the workers in the shelter have not been able to have any consultations or negotiations.  The first meeting took place today.  That is not the way to conduct business, especially when it is being conducted in regard to the most vulnerable people in our society.The homeless centre in Cedar House has approximately 50 residential occupants per night and approximately 40 to 50 who get day care service provided by doctors and nurses, which is essential.  It also has a regular supply, so to speak, of people who come along and get sleeping bags on a 24 hour basis from the hostel.  The hostel provides a very valuable service as a night shelter for people coming from different walks of life who need that type of facility.As I said, there has been no debate on this decision, apart from what has taken place behind closed doors.  The Government strategy on homelessness, The Way Home: A Strategy to Address Adult Homelessness in Ireland 2008 to 2013, is just a work of fiction.  There is a commitment in that strategy to end long-term homelessness by this year.It is outrageous to make such a commitment without providing facilities for it.The provision of social housing has never been so bad.  Every week dozens attend my constituency clinics who cannot get social housing because the local authority is not building new units, conducting maintenance on vacant units or extending existing units to cater for larger families or a disability.  Up to 60,000 people are in need of social housing while there is a declaration in the homelessness strategy that long-term homelessness will be ended by this year.  As we well know, when it comes to social housing provision, it is the homeless who are at the bottom of the pile, the last to be dealt with and given a permanent home.  There is no sense in the Minister telling us this will change.  The last thing we need is the closing down of one of the two shelters on Dublin's north side, putting the people in question on the street, while expecting the already inadequate services and facilities to be able to provide for them.The 45 people employed at Cedar House and their representatives were treated disgracefully.  They were not informed until last week about this decision made before Christmas and behind closed doors.  They were informed at the same time as the clientele in the hostel were.

This goes against all trade union agreements that allow for forewarning and an opportunity for negotiations to take place.  The decision was taken, the axe has fallen and any discussions that will take place will be post factum.  There is little likelihood of them being successful in keeping the shelter open.I am not happy such an event should occur in my constituency.  Cedar House is located in the heart of Dublin city.  There are a multitude of problems there with people from the young to the elderly to those with various disabilities who, for a variety of reasons, are homeless and sleeping rough.  A decision has been made to close a facility which did a fantastic job under the aegis of the Salvation Army.  The Minister of State should reverse the decision until such time as alternative accommodation can be provided for the people affected and proper negotiations have been held with the employees and their trade union representatives.
#MichaelFinneranFF	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-party	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	730	Under housing legislation, decisions regarding the facilities and arrangements necessary to accommodate homeless persons are matters for individual housing authorities to consider at local level.  However, given the inaccurate and unhelpful public comments made by Deputy Costello about the Cedar House homeless shelter, I am happy to set the record straight, particularly to allay any concerns unnecessarily created among homeless people or those who look after them.There is no question of the sudden closure of Cedar House.  The Cedar House shelter is being reviewed, in conjunction with the Salvation Army, as part of the reconfiguration of all homeless services in Dublin which the Homeless Agency is overseeing.  This reconfiguration is essential because we must move away from an outdated emergency hostel-based approach in which people remain for long periods, damaging their self esteem and reducing their prospects of progressing to full independent living.  We must change from reacting to homelessness to tackling it in a more planned and strategic way and providing long-term solutions rather than just managing homelessness.This more progressive approach is at the heart of the Government's homeless strategy, The Way Home, which I launched in August 2008.  A core objective of the strategy is to eliminate long-term occupation of emergency or transitional homeless facilities and enable households to progress to independent living in mainstream housing.  A new scheme of supports to assist people with the transition to independent living has been launched.  Several measures are being vigorously pursued to source accommodation for that purpose.  I have given special priority to safeguarding the level of funding for homelessness which reached more than €62 million in 2009, an increase of 5% in nominal terms and even more given the deflationary environment.  This higher level of funding is being maintained in 2010, notwithstanding retrenchment in State funding.The Homeless Agency and the Dublin local authorities have a clear rationale for changing the way homeless and housing support services are delivered through the implementation of an agreed plan to end long-term homelessness and the need to sleep rough.  In April 2009, they adopted the pathway to home model of homeless and housing support provision.  This new model of service delivery will mean a reduction in the amount of temporary accommodation because national and local government policy is to provide for a significant increase in suitable long-term tenancies.However, as part of the new model, 24-hour supported temporary accommodation will be put in place as distinct from the current hostel one night stay approach.  A comprehensive programme of consultation was initiated in 2009 with the various homeless service providers and an intensive series of meetings with individual providers is continuing.  Needless to say, the needs of homeless people are central to this process.There is no question of any residents of Cedar House being left without shelter.  I am appalled at any suggestion that people might be left on the streets as a result of any changes.  On the contrary, we are determined to break the cycle of homelessness.  Further action will be pursued to end any need for rough sleeping, continuing the progress that has already seen street homeless numbers in Dublin reduce from 185 in 2005 to 60 in November 2009.  This will build on the excellent work done during the recent severe weather which, with the co-operation of the various bodies and commitment of people on the ground, helped to protect vulnerable people from the elements.  Ireland was unique that no death was recorded in the country due to the inclement weather when there were hundreds across Europe and 30 in the UK.It is incumbent on all of us, especially public representatives, to marshal all the facts before making public statements on issues.  This is all the more important when such statements can have the effect of creating unnecessary alarm and concern among a vulnerable group in society such as the homeless.  My Department, the Homeless Agency and Dublin City Council are always available to inform Deputy Costello of the factual position on matters of interest.

#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	733	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise the issue of serious allegations regarding inappropriate local authority housing allocations in Dublin City Council and the urgent need for a proper inquiry into them.  This serious matter has been brought to my attention by Independent councillors Mannix Flynn and Damian O'Farrell.  There has been much huffing and puffing from the management in city hall and some councillors about it.  Let us have the truth and the facts.  If nothing is going on, then there is no problem and they have no concerns.  I urge the Minister of State to get off the fence and demand action in this regard.  Dublin City Council has 25,550 rented dwellings in it housing stock.  If only a fraction have been given out inappropriately, then we need to see transparency and fairness.  It is not fair to the genuine families on the housing waiting lists.I am also here to ask whether corruption was involved.  Did some people get houses on lower points than others with higher points?  Were staff, management and politicians involved in this malpractice?  What does the Minister of State say to those genuine families on the lists that were shafted?This is what I want to do here tonight.  Let us look at the facts and the evidence so far and then the Minister of State can decide.  This is all relevant, with the Whistleblowers Protection Bill 2010 coming through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I want to stand up for the good and decent whistleblower public servants and the people most in need on the housing lists.On November 2007, Dublin City Council management requested an internal audit to carry out an investigation into the possible misallocation under medical priority of a Dublin City Council dwelling.  In mid-September 2008, the internal audit investigation began — ten months later.  Of the 50 files examined, six applicants who had not been awarded overall medical priority by the Chief Medical Officer were placed on the medical priority list.  Six properties were subsequently misallocated to these applicants by the city council on the basis that they had medical priority status.  Subsequently, a further 39 files were examined.  The audit found major control weaknesses or no system of control present.  Many tenancy agreements could not be located at all.  The procedures manual is partly out of date and not updated.  Urgent action was deemed necessary.At the request of Independent Councillors Damian O'Farrell and Mannix Flynn, the city manager presented reports to the city council on 7 December 2009 and 8 January 2010.  The reports hinted at ongoing staff and HR issues, including grievance procedures, which prevented the city manager from clarifying matters further.  This is a total red herring.  There was no mention of the serious control weaknesses present, including no controls at all.  These issues are senior management issues, not staff issues.  Senior management has kept councillors completely in the dark of these failures.The reports were rejected and branded a disgrace by Independent councillor Damian O'Farrell.  Allegedly, there seems to be an issue with a member of staff whereas a separate independent report points the investigation in a different direction altogether, a direction that has not been investigated.  Staff should not be scapegoated for failures of senior management.  The only investigation that can get to the bottom of this is an external independent investigation.Solicitors' letters have been issued to newspapers that have mentioned the matter.  Members of senior management have not even acknowledged many e-mails from Independent councillors looking for clarification.  Councillors Lacey, Breen and Ó Muirí, who are members of the audit committee, have not had the courtesy to even acknowledge a request by Independent councillor Damian O'Farrell for information.The answering by senior management — who, incidentally, are public servants — of councillors' questions has shown a total disregard for elected officials and some received information not even in the ball park.  Independents pushing this issue are Damian O'Farrell, Ciarán Perry and Mannix Flynn.  Established party councillors are either in denial or running for cover.The only way forward is an independent investigation.  There is direct evidence of a complete indifference to the scheme of letting priorities and the Dublin City Council social housing policy, which has resulted in the exploitation of the scheme by certain individuals.

#MichaelFinneranFF	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-party	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	736	In responding, I want to place the matter raised by Deputy McGrath in context.  The allocation of housing is the responsibility of individual housing authorities, with the functions involved being exercised by each authority in accordance with its scheme of letting priorities.  The making of such schemes is a reserved function of the elected members of the housing authority, under section 11(6) of the Housing Act 1988.Section 11(9) of that Act precludes ministerial involvement in the allocation of housing in individual cases, stating clearly that nothing shall be construed or operate to enable the Minister to direct the letting of a dwelling to any individual person.  The governing legislation is therefore explicit in setting out that the operation of an authority's allocation scheme is a matter for the council itself; and new provisions to be introduced under last year's Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act reaffirm this position.  While Deputy McGrath has called for an inquiry into certain matters relating to the operation of Dublin City Council's housing allocations system, it is important that the integrity of investigative processes already in train within the council is not compromised in any way.In the first instance, it is a matter for the local authority concerned, Dublin City Council, to investigate the issues which have been raised regarding the operation of its housing allocation system.  The normal and appropriate route is for the local authority, having carried out its investigation into the matter, to report on the findings of the investigation to its elected members.That is how it should be.  Regrettably, there can be a significant disconnect between the rhetoric around the importance of devolving powers to local government on the one hand and the demands for central Government oversight of devolved matters on the other.  Power and responsibility must go hand in hand.  Responsibility for the discharge of functions and powers assigned to local authorities should be exercised to the greatest extent possible through local mechanisms, including thorough effective oversight by elected members.In terms of the issue raised by Deputy McGrath, Dublin City Council has informed my Department that the council's internal audit department initiated an investigation into the matter in question and that part of that investigation was completed in 2009.  Other aspects of the council's investigation are still ongoing.  In the best interests of all concerned, it would be desirable that these investigations are concluded as quickly as possible, with the matters involved being addressed in a thorough and comprehensive manner.When the investigations are concluded, it will be important for the executive of the council to report to the elected members.  As I indicated recently here in the House, it is a matter for a local authority itself to decide on the publication of an individual audit report.  Should the outcome of the investigation raise any issues of a policy or legislative nature, these will be considered without delay.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	737	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for finally allowing me to raise this important issue in the House.The Rehabilitation and Support Programme, RASP, is an outstanding community-based anti-drugs programme based in north Coolock, Dublin 17.  Sphere 17 is a local youth service catering for young people aged 10 to 21 who also live in Dublin 17.  Even though both RASP and Sphere 17 provide absolutely critical services for my constituents in the Dublin 17 and related areas, incredibly, they both are under serious threat.  RASP has been told its funding will be cut by 34% this year and they face the prospect of being axed completely in 2011.RASP is led by chairperson Mr. Kevin Behan and CEO Mr. Pat Hanna, and was originally sponsored by the Moatview/Fairfield Development Association in Priorswood, Dublin 17.  In 2000, it was mainstreamed and its yearly funding allocation is just under €200,000, but now Mr. Behan and Mr. Hanna have been told by the Department of Education and Science that their budget for 2010 has been reduced, as I stated, by approximately 34% to just €134,000.RASP operates a successful multi-disciplinary approach to assist citizens who have suffered from addiction.  The programme helps approximately 20 clients at a time and its administration is facilitated by a number of posts under the community employment programme.  The project operates from a former coalyard business on the old Belcamp Lane and has gradually moved as a service from a vocational to a therapeutic model.  I have visited the premises on many occasions over the years and witnessed at first hand the terrific work of Mr. Behan, Mr. Hanna and their staff.  Among the most impressive initiatives taken by RASP is a wonderful horticultural training course which is of great benefit to clients.  The RASP board had been expecting a 10% cut and was devastated to find the cut is as large as 34%.Sphere 17 — Regional Youth Service is based in the landmark Darndale Belcamp Village Centre, Dublin 17 and has three different youth work teams covering the parishes of Bonnybrook, Darndale and Priorswood.The range of high quality services Sphere 17 provides for local young people in Dublin 17 is extraordinary and includes educational, health, art, drug outreach and counselling programmes as well as support for the local Traveller community.  For many young people in Dublin 17, Sphere 17 provides access to health, art or educational services to which they have no access anywhere else.  It also provides a healthy, safe and educational outlet for young people who may otherwise find themselves under pressure to get involved in anti-social or even criminal activity.  It also facilitates the Woodale youth justice project which is part of the national Garda youth diversion projects.  That particular Garda youth diversion project has been saluted as a best practice model by the Irish youth justice service.Last year, Sphere 17 worked in total with more than 1,500 local young people, an increase of 400 on the previous year.  It received a range of funding from the City of Dublin Youth Services Board, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Pobal, St. Stephen's Green Trust, which is related to the Darndale parish area, and RAPID.Axing RASP and the Sphere 17 anti-drugs programmes and initiatives to combat anti-social and criminal behaviour will leave very vulnerable citizens at the mercy of drug dealers and may potentially result in the relapsing of many clients with a history of addiction.  It is appalling that citizens who are trying to turn their lives around and get themselves off drugs will now have nowhere to turn for help and support in their local communities.  It also makes no wider social or economic sense to slash vital youth services.  For example, it has been estimated that every €1 spent on anti-drug programmes saves the State €3 in terms of health and justice costs.A few weeks ago at the Committee of Public Accounts of which I am a member, I was astonished to be told by Ms Kathleen Stack of the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, which has responsibility for the national drugs strategy, that the Department of Education and Science had cut these budgets without reference to her Department, which is absolutely mind-boggling.  What does this say about our national drugs strategy that one Department can axe a critical programme which will have a devastating effect on the fight against drug abuse in the Dublin 17 and surrounding communities?  It totally undermines the new national drugs strategy 2009 to 2017.The plans to cut funding to Sphere 17 and RASP is also another savage attack on a community that is already under very severe pressure.  Many local people are reeling from the job losses — the Minister of State might have heard me talk about Cadbury, our local factory, earlier today — cutbacks to services and wages and the general economic disaster we are currently experiencing under this Government.I urge the  Minister of State to go back to his colleagues to try to secure necessary funding for RASP and Sphere 17 and not put these brilliant projects, which represent and look after young people so well, under this ferocious threat.

These projects, through a variety of programmes and activities, seek, in the main, to encourage young people not to engage in drug-taking.  The Department originally took on responsibility for funding these projects through a mainstreaming process whereby projects on interim funding were assigned to a number of Departments and State agencies.Some 35 of the projects are administered by the three VECs — Dublin City, Dublin County and Dun Laoghaire — while the remaining three projects are funded directly by the Department.  In the main, the projects provide for the employment of youth workers and project leaders, the delivery of peer education in a drug education context and initiatives aimed at retaining and supporting children in first and second level education and the prevention of early school leaving.  In addition, a number of projects provide support for the delivery of the substance misuse module of the social, personal and health education curriculum in schools.Some 22 of the projects are administered by the City of Dublin Youth Services Board under the aegis of the City of Dublin VEC, including Sphere 17.  Ten of the projects are administered by County Dublin VEC and three projects are administered by Dun Laoghaire VEC.  The remaining three projects are administered directly by the Department, one of which is RASP, the rehabilitation and support programme.Arising from the budget of 2010, it was decided that funding for these projects was to be reduced from €3,643,000 in 2009 to €2,461,000 in 2010 and to cease from 2011.  The Minister acknowledges the difficulties arising for projects and the Department is currently reviewing the implications of this decision for the individual projects concerned.  The review, which involves a detailed examination of all 38 projects, has not yet been completed.The Minister would like to reassure the House that within the resources at his disposal, he remains fully committed to implementing the national drugs strategy.  In that regard, he wants to place on record the significant contribution the Department has made and continues to make in support of the prevention pillar of the strategy through the introduction of a social, personal and health education curriculum at primary level and at junior cycle in second level, the initiatives under the delivering equality of opportunity in schools action plan and the school support programme to prevent early school leaving and achieve better educational outcomes for students and the guidelines on substance use policies issued to all schools.The SPHE programme is the foundation for developing awareness of drugs and alcohol issues in schools.  It is a mandatory part of the curriculum at primary and junior cycle in second level.  The substance use modules of SPHE are augmented by two support programmes, the Walk Tall programme at primary level and On My Own Two Feet at post-primary level.  The implementation of these programmes in schools is supported by full-time support services at primary and second levels, which provide professional development for teachers and advice and support to schools.The DEIS action plan for educational inclusion is aimed at identifying and tackling levels of disadvantage and it provides the basis for school supports to, among others, schools located in local drugs task force areas.  Supports targeting children most at risk of leaving school early are currently being enhanced through the integration of the relevant services, that is, the school completion programme, home-school-community-liaison and the visiting teacher service for Travellers under the National Educational Welfare Board.Through the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, the Government is continuing to support initiatives for youth, such as the Young People's Facilities and Services Fund, which aims to divert young people away from the dangers of substance abuse and the special projects for youth scheme, which supports out of school projects for disadvantaged young people.The Minister acknowledges the difficulties for the projects in local drugs task force areas funded by the Department.  In that regard, he anticipates that the examination of the projects, in the context of reviewing the implications of the decisions taken on funding for 2010 and 2011, will be completed shortly.  The Minister wants to thank the Deputy for raising this matter.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	739	I am very happy the Minister of State is here to reply but I must say how disappointed I am that the Minister for Education and Science or the Minister with responsibility did not find it worthwhile to remain in the House to reply in so far as both voted a few minutes ago on the Finance Bill.I feel I should speak very straight about this.  The matter I raise calls into question whether words mean anything.  In the debates on the budget and the Finance Bill I heard the suggestion that those who have lost their jobs, those who are unemployed, in particular young people of whom one in three is out of work, are to be encouraged to go back to education.  This is the greatest hypocrisy I could possibly instance.I am speaking about the back to education allowance.  The way it worked was that a person going on an access course had to be on the jobseeker's allowance.  That was one hoop through which a person had to jump.  In addition, the back to education allowance was means tested.  The group to which I refer have qualified under both hoops, are in third level and their allowances will continue.  People in the future will only receive one allowance.  There are a group of people already on an access course and who went through both tests in the clear understanding that these allowances would enable them to return to education and they have been cut off arbitrarily.The policy seems to be that while they are welcomed back to education, they will have to pick themselves up and make sure they are ready to go back, which is why they are being asked to go through an access course and make sure they will be able to stay in a college — the case to which I refer concerns the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology.  When they are on the access course the rug is pulled from under them and they are told they will not receive the back to education allowance.  That is happening and it is why a great number of the people concerned sent me a signed letter saying they understood the difficulties in the economy — they put it much more politely than I am.  I am putting it rather bluntly because I am sick and tired of the hypocrisy of suggesting that we are asking people to return to education when obstacles are being placed in their way.  The people concerned asked, politely and simply, if those in mid-stream could be allowed to get that which they expected.  That is not on offer.Last year 30,000 young people who wanted to take post leaving certificate courses were turned away.  This year two people will apply for every place available in a third level college.  We are constantly hearing the notion that we are encouraging people to return to education.  Some people on the list I have in front of me are tradespeople.  The Minister of State, who is here as a proxy, is from the west and knows that the largest number of males who are unemployed are young construction workers who want to return to education and are having their allowances cut.  I do not want a long rigmarole from the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Hanafin, or anybody else.The issue of jobseeker's allowance is interesting.  If a person was not on a contract but a company wanted to string him or her along by saying it might have more hours for him or her, on that basis, the Department of Social and Family Affairs could refuse a young person the right to return to education, something which happened this week.  Let us be honest.  If the Government says it is in favour of young people being driven onto the live register and reducing the minimum wage, and saying it is going through the motions, people should be exposed on it.  However, the group of people to which I refer are on an access course in the expectation that they were entitled to both allowances.  One allowance was arbitrarily withdrawn while they were on the access course.  This is scandalous.  I know a lot about this issue.This evening the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy O'Keeffe, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Hanafin, and the Minister of State with responsibility for this area were in the Chamber and left after voting on the Finance Bill.  I hope the young people to which I refer and every other young person calls the bluff of this Government.

I thank the Deputy for giving me this opportunity to outline the position of the Department of Education and Science regarding changes announced in the budget to student maintenance grants for those also availing of the back to education allowance scheme.I am pleased to inform the house that the Department funds four maintenance grant schemes for third level and further education students: the higher education grants scheme; the vocational education committees scholarship scheme; the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees; and the maintenance grant scheme for students attending post leaving certificate courses.  The higher education grants scheme is administered by the local authorities.  The other three schemes are administered by the vocational education committees.  Under the terms of the maintenance grant schemes, grant assistance is awarded to students who meet the prescribed conditions of funding including those which relate to nationality, residency, means and previous academic attainment.The back to education allowance is a second chance education opportunities scheme designed to encourage and facilitate people on certain social welfare payments to improve their skills and qualifications and, therefore, their prospects of returning to the workforce.  Eligibility for the back to education allowance and associated payments is determined and administered by the Department of Social and Family Affairs and is primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Hanafin.The Deputy will appreciate that in the context of the current economic circumstances difficult choices had to be made by Government in order to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long term.  It was decided to discontinue the practice of allowing students to hold the BTEA or VTOS allowance and a student maintenance grant simultaneously as this represents a duplication of income support payments.  From September 2010, as announced in the budget, all new applicants who are in receipt of the back to education allowance for all schemes and the VTOS allowances for those pursuing PLC courses will be ineligible for student maintenance grants.  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the cost of the student services charge and any fees payable to colleges will continue to be met, for eligible students, by the Exchequer on their behalf.  Students should apply to their assessing authority to have their eligibility assessed.As the Deputy will be aware, students currently in receipt of the BTEA are not automatically entitled to a maintenance grant.

Students progressing to a new course, with effect from the 2010-11 academic year, will no longer be eligible for student maintenance grants in addition to BTEA or VTOS support, but can apply for assistance under the student grant schemes towards the cost of the student services charge and any fees payable.  Apart from the maintenance grants schemes and the free fees initiative, financial support is also available to all students, including mature students, in approved third level institutions, through the student assistance fund.

Dublin Bus is due to undertake consultation on the network changes in March.  It is also working on eliminating unnecessary duplication of services, creating even headways to improve reliability and reduce the potential for "bunching" of services.Dublin Bus has commenced the roll out of its Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL) System and full implementation on the Dublin Bus fleet is expected to be completed towards the end of 2010.  The information from the AVL System will be used on the Real Time Passenger Information units which are being procured and managed by Dublin City Council.  In 2010, prior to installation of on street signage Dublin Bus will commence provision of Real Time Passenger Information on the Internet and on mobile phones.In the case of Bus Éireann the Deloitte report concluded that the scope for cost savings is limited as the current network design and schedules are largely efficient.  In line with the recommendations of the report Bus Éireann is engaged with Pobal, the HSE, the Irish Wheelchair Association, the Department of Education and my Department in co-ordinating the better integration of various services provided by Bus Éireann, the Rural Transport programme and the HSE.  Pilot projects currently underway will be evaluated with a view to mainstreaming across the country.  Bus Éireann has also expanded the use of double deck buses and coaches and have undertaken a "Use the Bus" type marketing campaign to increase passenger carryings.

A progressive approach is being adopted to allow customers to familiarise themselves with using the new system and to permit transport operators to undertake the necessary testing with the integration of the technologies involved.  The project is now firmly in the implementation phase and extensive testing of elements of the system is already underway.The system will be progressively rolled out over the coming months on Dublin Bus and Luas services, such that, by end-2010, smartcards with a "pay-as-you-go" function will be available to some 75% of public transport customers in the GDA.  Private bus operators are also participating in the scheme and it is anticipated that a number of these operators, along with DART and commuter rail services and Bus Éireann on a pilot basis, will join the scheme throughout 2011.  Whilst progress in the delivery of the project has been slower than desired, good progress is now being made by the transport agencies in the delivery of this complex I.T. project.The project remains on target to deliver real and tangible benefits to public transport users on a progressive basis during 2010. However, in a project involving numerous organisations, and where there are many business and technical complexities, there are and will continue to be difficulties that will pose challenges to all participants in delivering on the agreed programme. This has also been the experience internationally. The experience to date is that the Project Board is working well and in a manner that allows them to meet these challenges as they arise.  €25.8 million has been paid out by the Exchequer on integrated ticketing since the inception of the project in 2002. This expenditure encompasses project management, design and development costs and operator contributions.

Articles 9, 11, 12, 19, 20(1) and 26 of the regulation, now apply to all rail passenger services throughout the Community including all Irish Rail passenger services.  Domestic rail services, have, under S.I. No 473 of 2009 of 1 December 2009, been exempted from the application of the other Articles of the Regulation pending the conclusion of discussions with Irish Rail regarding their application to the inter-city rail passenger services.  The provisions of EC regulation 1371/2007 apply in full to the cross-border Enterprise service between Dublin and Belfast.  S.I. No 473 of 2009 provides for an exemption of 5 years and not 15 years and can be repealed when there is a satisfactory outcome to the discussions with Irish Rail.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	752	The Road Safety Strategy 2007-2012 is being successfully implemented across a range of agencies.  The core objective of the Road Safety Strategy is to reduce road deaths to no greater than 60 fatalities per million population by the end of 2012.  This is an average of 21 road deaths per month or 252 deaths per annum.  2009 saw the lowest number of road deaths on record at 239.  This is an average of 20 road deaths per month.  This core objective has been met well before its target date and we must now concentrate our efforts in ensuring that the figure is maintained or improved over the next few years.  There have been 19 road deaths so far in 2010 (as of 9am 10th February 2010).  This is 4 fewer than for the same period in 2009.In 2009, my Department completed five of the Actions contained in the Strategy and a further five are progressing.  Two of these are included in the Road Traffic Bill 2009 published on 30 October 2009, i.e. lowering the Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) levels, and providing for Preliminary Impairment testing.  The RSA is tasked with reporting on the 126 actions in the Strategy and their report on the implementation of the actions for 2009 will be submitted to me later in the year.  The Strategy identifies 39 Actions for completion in 2010 and my Department will work with the other agencies involved to ensure that these targets are met.  The Road Safety Strategy is challenging and ambitious, and even when target dates are missed we must not lose sight of the underlying achievement. Fatalities on our roads have fallen significantly and people are alive today that might be not otherwise be.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	753	I consider that the air traffic controller (ATC) dispute which closed the three State airports for 4 hours on 20th January last raises concerns about existing arrangements to protect the provision of essential public services in the event of industrial action.  The Labour Relations Commission Code of Practice for Dispute Procedures including Procedures in Essential Services was made in 1992.  Under the terms of the Code, agreements are negotiated on a voluntary basis that require the parties to abstain from strikes, lock-outs or other action designed to bring pressure on either party during the period of the agreement and to abide by agreed procedures for the resolution of any disputes.In this case it should be noted that the Irish Aviation Authority had put in place Continuity of Service Agreements with IMPACT (the ATCs trade union) since 1996, in accordance with the Code.  However, the most recent Agreement expired in September 2008 and, despite the IAA's best efforts, it was not possible to secure its renewal with IMPACT. Moreover, the Agreement provided for only limited emergency cover in the event of industrial action.In my response on 20th January last to private notice questions I indicated that I intended to raise at Government, the question of how to better protect essential services during industrial disputes, often referred to as ‘no-strike clause' legislation.  I raised the matter with my Ministerial colleagues on 26th January.  In light of recent events, I believe that it would be appropriate to review the effectiveness of arrangements currently in place in the relevant State bodies.  I also believe that it would be appropriate to consider the question of what sanctions might be invoked in cases where such agreements are breached.

However, in instances where vehicle defects present potential danger to road users, ownership particulars of vehicles can be provided to the manufacturer from the National Vehicle and Driver File in my Department.  In this case, ownership particulars of some 27,399 vehicles were provided on 3rd February to the manufacturer named by the Deputy to assist with the recall initiative.

I have been informed however by the DAA that after months of discussions with union representatives and following the involvement of the Labour Relations Commission, agreement has now been reached on a cost recovery programme that will assist the DAA in aligning its cost base with current business requirements.  While I have been briefed on the efforts of DAA to address its cost base, I have had no direct personal contact with the DAA on the negotiation of the agreement.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	756	I wish to refer the Deputy to the reply to a similar Parliamentary Question I gave in the House on Thursday 5th November 2009 (Dail Question No. 22).  To clarify the matter, the seizing of contraband cigarettes in Ireland is the responsibility of the Customs and An Garda Síochána. The role of my Department is that it is responsible for the implementation of International and EU security requirements at Irish ports.The annex to the International Convention for the Safety at Life at Sea (SOLAS) 1974 was amended in 2004 to include a new chapter concerning maritime security and which introduced the International Ship and Port Security (ISPS) Code. In the European context, Regulation 725/2004/EC brought the maritime security requirements of SOLAS and the ISPS Code into community law.  In Ireland, since July 2004, port facilities receiving cargo vessels of 500 Gross Tonnes and above, and those receiving passenger ships that are engaged in international trade, have been required to comply with the EU Regulation. Port facilities require an approved port facility security plan and a port facility security officer is responsible for day-to-day security activities. The provisions of the EU Regulation and the ISPS Code only apply in relation to the "ship to shore" interface at ports.Regarding enhancements to security in Irish ports, Directive 2005/65/EC on enhancing Port Security extends the requirements for port security measures to cover adjacent relevant areas containing works and equipment designed to facilitate commercial maritime transport operations.  The European Communities (Port Security) Regulations, S.I. 284 of 2007, transposed the Directive requirements into law in Ireland.  One of the Directive's requirements is that Port Security Authorities (PSA) are required to be established. Following consultation with relevant stakeholders it was agreed that the Port Security Authorities should include representation from An Garda Síochána, the Revenue Commissioners as well as the port operators.  The Marine Survey Office (MSO) in my Department is currently working to finalise the implementation of the Directive requirements. This includes the designation of port areas that will be subject to the enhanced security measures and the approval of port security plans covering such port areas.Another initiative, which my Department has, and continues to develop, is the SafeSeasIreland (SSI) maritime information system. Vessels of 500 Gross Tons and over are required to provide security information into the SSI before arriving into an Irish port. This information is provided via login and password to relevant stakeholders. Additionally the SSI is being developed to incorporate the security related information of the ports themselves. This single window system is already providing significant benefits to stakeholders that I expect will continue to grow as the system is developed further in the future.

The Bill includes a provision for the mandatory testing for alcohol of drivers involved in road traffic collisions, where an injury is caused to another person that requires medical assistance. That provision meets a commitment I have made on a number of occasions following representations from various road safety campaigners.  Any necessary amendments to the Bill will be considered at Committee Stage.  The Medical Bureau of Road Safety has commenced the procurement process for the new EBT instruments, following which the new instruments will then be evaluated and tested by the Bureau over a six month period.

The new chairperson has a highly regarded track record at a senior level in business management in Ireland over many years. She is also familiar with the port and the port sector through her previous term as a director of Dublin Port Company from 1997.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	759	I am fully aware of the negative impact that the difficult economic situation is having on the travel trade sector and I am closely monitoring developments, particularly in relation to the aviation sector.  2009 was an exceptionally difficult year and the demand for air travel fell dramatically due to the global recession; however there is evidence across Europe that the decline in passenger numbers has stabilized.  I understand that since the beginning of 2008 a total of 26 travel agents/tour operators have collapsed. While the closure of travel agents will primarily affect the outbound market from Ireland, anything that impacts on access capacity into Ireland could have a negative impact on inward tourism.Tourism Ireland is the body responsible for the overseas marketing of Ireland as a tourist destination.  My colleague Martin Cullen, the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism launched Tourism Ireland's 2010 Marketing Campaign last December. This is designed to ensure that the number of visitors coming to Ireland will return to growth in 2010. The Tourism Marketing Fund has a provision of €44.25m for 2010.  This will enable the level and value of investment in overseas marketing of Ireland to be maintained in real terms as recommended in the report of the Tourism Renewal Group.  A key focus of Tourism Ireland's strategy to restore overseas tourism to growth in 2010 will be on re-engaging with the travel trade including tour operators and travel agents, in overseas markets and on increasing the participation of island of Ireland industry members in overseas promotional opportunities.My Department is liaising with the Department of Arts Sport and Tourism in the context of implementing a recommendation concerning enhanced air access, contained in the Report of the Tourism Renewal Group.  While the wider air transport industry continues to face significant challenges in the coming year, the Government will continue to support the development of an innovation-friendly, pro-competition regulatory framework for aviation.   To that end my Department is currently engaged in measures to enhance our bilateral relations with emerging markets such as India and China in support of the Government's Asia strategy.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	760	I am aware of the increasing trend in the number of detections of drug driving.  Indeed, the Medical Bureau of Road Safety, who carry out analyses of specimens of blood, urine and breath provided for the Gardaí by people suspected of intoxicated driving offences, recorded an increase of over 68% in 2008 in the number of Garda requests for drug analysis of specimens submitted.  Currently, where a member of the Garda Síochána is of the opinion that a person in charge of a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place is under the influence of a drug or drugs to such an extent as to be incapable of having proper control of that vehicle, he or she may require that person to go to a Garda station and further require that person to submit to a blood test or to provide a urine sample.While random drug driving testing, based on saliva specimens, is in operation in some jurisdictions, it is very limited in application.  There is no suitable preliminary testing device available in Europe yet for the introduction roadside testing of drivers for drugs. Such devices are still in the prototype stages and the Medical Bureau, who is keeping abreast of developments, will advise me when a suitable roadside-testing device becomes available and should be introduced in this country.  In the meantime, the Road Traffic Bill 2009 includes provisions for preliminary impairment testing, i.e. non-technological methods by which the Gardaí can make a preliminary assessment about the possible presence of drugs.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	762	Traffic throughput at the State's commercial seaports is an obvious barometer of economic activity as a whole. The Dublin Port Study carried out last year under the National Development Plan concluded that national port throughput would continue to decline in 2009 and into 2010 and that traffic throughput will not return to 2007 levels until post 2011.  The Irish Maritime Development Office's most recent figures indicate that the rate and pace of the decline in shipping traffic volume continued to ease during the 3rd quarter of 2009.In the case of our largest port, Dublin, I welcome the company's recent statement that the decrease in throughput has shown signs of stabilisation and that the total downturn in traffic in 2009 was less than expected.  In the medium to long term the Dublin Port Study concluded that traffic growth will be such that significant additional port capacity will be required by 2025-30.  In the Greater Dublin Area there are two significant projects at different stages of the planning process at present. The Bremore proposal is at pre-planning stage and a decision from An Bord Pleanála in relation to Dublin Port's proposed expansion is expected in the coming months.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	763	The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is a statutory function of each road authority in accordance with the provisions of section 13 of the Roads Act 1993. The carrying out of works on these roads is a matter for the relevant local authority to be funded from its own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of projects to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.When Exchequer grants for regional and local roads are allocated each year, my Department does not hold back a reserve allocation, at central level, to deal with weather contingencies.  Holding back such an allocation would mean a reduction in the road grant allocations made to all local authorities at the beginning of each year.  The allocations made to local authorities are inclusive of a weather risk factor.  Local authorities are expressly advised in the annual road grants circular letter that they should set aside contingency sums from their overall regional and local roads resources to finance necessary weather related works.My role in addressing damage caused to the road network is in disbursing the amount of money provided in the 2010 Estimates for funding regional and local roads, that is, €411.177 million, in the fairest manner possible.  I have, however, asked local authorities to provide details of exceptional road related costs associated with the November 2009 flooding and recent prolonged severe weather, which fall outside the normal financial provision for winter maintenance. I will have regard to this information when deciding on the allocations.  I will announce the 2010 regional and local road grant allocations shortly.

The driver licensing regulations made in October 2007, which provided for the introduction of a learner permit to replace the provisional licence and for some other measures, were the first step in the introduction of a GDLS. The Road Safety Authority (RSA) undertook a consultation process on a GDLS in 2009, which contained a number of possible measures. The RSA has considered the responses from the public and interested bodies and has recently submitted its recommendations to my Department. Those recommendations are being considered carefully within my Department at present.

These individuals purchased cycle and cycle accessories with an aggregate cost of €7,746.46, which is being recouped from the individuals concerned as a salary sacrifice under the terms of the scheme. Tax, PRSI or income levies is not payable on this sacrificed remuneration.  In relation to the roll out of additional cycling initiatives, I announced Ireland's first National Cycle Policy Framework (NCPF) on 20 April 2009.  The NCPF contained 109 action points and to date, as reported during my Department's recent joint cycling seminar with the Embassy of the Netherlands, progress has been made or is underway on some 40 of those points.  A copy of the NCPF is available on www.smartertravel.ie <http://www.smartertravel.ie> as are the presentations delivered at the recent seminar.  The delivery of all aspects of the NCPF will progressed on an ongoing basis up to 2020.

I subsequently asked the local authorities in these cities to see that the feasibility of Bus Rapid Transit systems was simultaneously taken into account.  These studies, which are being carried out by consultants appointed by the relevant local authorities, with funding from my Department, are examining the most appropriate and feasible public transport systems for the cities in question, and are not being carried out by the Railway Procurement Agency.The Cork study has already been presented to both Cork City and Cork County Councils, and a public consultation process is being undertaken this month, following which the Study will be sent to both Councils for formal approval.  The Final report on the Galway Study has recently been submitted to the City Council and is on the City Council Agenda for the second week of February 2010.  The Waterford study is due to be presented to the Strategic Policy Committee at end March 2010 and to the full Council in early April 2010.  The Limerick Public Transport Feasibility Study (PTFS), is incorporated into a wider planning, land-use and transportation study, the  Mid-West Area Strategic Plan (MWASP) including the development of a multi-modal transportation model which means that the Limerick PTFS will take a little longer than the other studies.  I expect the full MWASP and Limerick PTFS to be completed and published by the summer of 2010.I look forward with interest to the full completion of these studies. I shall, on their completion, consider the recommendations in these studies before making decisions on how best to enhance public transport.

These carry over 60% of all traffic (80% of commercial).  It is acknowledged that driving conditions were sometimes difficult but this is a natural consequence of severe weather.  The majority of Dublin Bus services continued to operate throughout the period. Bus Eireann operated the majority of its services. Irish Rail and Luas services were largely unaffected and some extra capacity was provided where possible.  Food and fuel supplies were maintained.My own Department is also currently undertaking a review of our Strategic Level Response Plan for transport response and preparedness.  We will be looking at the timing of the activation of the emergency co-ordination structures and we will also review the effectiveness of those structures, once activated.  We will look at how public information was handled and what can be improved.  The public transport websites were excellent and regularly up to date.  The RSA was very helpful in getting out targeted road safety messages.  We will seek to build on those best practice examples. The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is leading a separate review relating to the lessons to be learned in respect of our overall emergency management framework.  This is in addition to reviews in other Departments as well as at local government and agency level.

However, I am not aware of a specific request to make parking regulations in general more flexible.  Under the Road Traffic Act, 1994 responsibility for parking matters is vested in local authorities in respect of public roads in their charge.  Section 36 provides road authorities with extensive bye-law making powers with discretion afforded to authorities regarding the location and specification of parking places, level of fee and specification of maximum parking periods within their functional area.Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) Regulations made under Section 35 of the 1994 Act also contain enabling discretionary powers for local authorities to restrict parking of specified vehicles in specified areas or places within a nationally applying framework.  I have no proposals to amend the Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) Regulations in this way.

This was done on foot of an agreement negotiated by officials of my Department and the NRA and approved by me and the Board of the Authority. A copy of the agreement has been lodged with the Dail Library.  The new arrangement was concluded on an administrative basis so as not to affect my statutory role or that of the local authorities in any way.The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads remains the statutory responsibility of road authorities under section 13 of the Roads Act 1993 and is not affected by the new administrative arrangements.  The NRA is not being given any new statutory powers similar to those it has in relation to national roads.  Under section 82 of the Roads Act the Minister for Transport is empowered to pay grants to road authorities and under this power I allocate regional and local road grants to these authorities each year to supplement expenditure from their own resources.  This power is also unaffected by the revised administrative arrangements and I will continue to decide on grants policy and on the grant allocations to each individual road authority.This decision was taken on grounds of administrative efficiency, particularly in circumstances where there is increasing pressure on staffing and financial resources. It makes sense to use one organisation to administer all road grant payments and to monitor the expenditure of these road grants.

Current policy is to abolish all of these harbour authorities by their transfer to local authority control or amalgamation with a State owned port company. It is hoped that a number of these transfers will take place in 2010.In compliance with the Government's decision of October 2008, the Air Accident Investigation Unit of the Department of Transport, the Railway Accident Investigation Unit of the Railway Safety Commission and the Marine Casualty Investigation Board will be administratively merged in mid-2010 to form the Irish Accident Investigation Office as an Executive Office under the aegis of the Department of Transport. Legislation to underpin the new arrangements is expected to be introduced in the Oireachtas in 2010.  It is also my intention to amalgamate the Commission for Aviation Regulation and the regulatory functions of the Irish Aviation Authority with the planned new National Transport Authority.  Detailed proposals to implement the decision are currently being considered.In line with the McCarthy Report proposals, consideration is being given to the merging of the National Roads Authority and the Railway Procurement Agency and this will be progressed during 2010.

These projects and programmes can be found on the Transport 21 website (www.transport21.ie).However, in the light of the changed economic circumstances, it has been necessary to review investment priorities across all Government Departments. The results of this review are reflected in the Renewed Programme for Government and my Department's Transport 21 priorities for the coming years are as follows:for national roads, the priorities arethe completion by end 2010 of the five major inter-urban motorways and the M50 upgradethe progression of the Atlantic Road Corridor.for public transport, the priority is to deliver significantly increased long term capacity to the network throughthe construction of Metro Norththe construction of DART Underground and the implementation of the associated electrification, signalling and rolling stock investmentsinvestment in buses, bus priority and real time passenger information, subject to the implementation of the recent cost efficiency reviews and the availability of subventionit is important that we continue planning other projects to enable their earliest possible delivery when the economic situation improves.These priorities for investment are set out in the Renewed Programme for Government.  It is unlikely that all of the projects originally identified in Transport 21 will be completed by 2015. However, no projects have been cancelled and Transport 21 continues to provide the strategic framework for capital spending on transport infrastructure into the future.

This route includes a key section of the Sutton to Sandycove route (Sir John Rogerson's Quay via the Samuel Beckett Bridge to Fairview).  My Department meets with Dublin City Council on a regular basis in relation to this route, which I am anxious to progress, and other cycle-related matters. The current estimated cost remains at €10 million, which includes provision of three new canal crossings, one railway crossing and significant works at 11 junctions, and the Council's intention is to complete this route by the end of this year.The City Council is now surveying, with some modest funding from my Department, the potential route between Portobello and Inchicore to link to South Dublin County Council's exemplary cycling route between Adamstown and Inchicore, which is also being developed with financial assistance from my Department.  There are unlikely to be further funds available for routes in Dublin City in 2010 as my Department is progressing similar exemplary projects in other parts of the country.  Furthermore, I also want to see the proposed cycling and walking strategy for Dublin City before considering future routes there.

The CEO, Mr. Mueller, explained that the company has reached agreement with unions on a cost-reduction programme and that while some of the arbitrator's recommendations remain under discussion with the pilots he expects that ballots will be undertaken shortly to secure agreement of all staff.  It is anticipated that full year savings under the new cost-restructuring plan will amount to €97 million by 2012.  The details of the new plan are entirely commercial matters for the Board of the company.   A statement outlining the future direction of the airline was published on 26 January and is freely available.Aer Lingus recently announced agreement on a new franchise arrangement with Aer Arann to enhance its short haul route network.  The new agreement will serve key regional destinations linking them to the Aer Lingus Dublin transatlantic network and will significantly increase the Aer Lingus presence in the Ireland UK market.In relation to the air travel tax the Deputy will be aware that policy responsibility for this measure rests with the Minister for Finance.  I believe that the decline in passenger numbers at Airports cannot be attributed to the imposition of the travel tax.  The economic recession has had a significant impact on consumer demand for discretionary air travel throughout Europe.Competition and connectivity are the cornerstones of aviation policy. My Department's main objective is to assist airports and airlines to respond to the downturn in the sector, while maintaining the highest possible levels of connectivity between Ireland and key markets.  In a global market, which is fully liberalised within the EU, the scope for measures to provide direct support to airports and carriers is very limited.  The focus must therefore be on managing through a severe downturn and being well positioned for an upturn when economic circumstances improve.Looking to the future, the challenge will be to ensure that Irish aviation is well positioned to take advantage of the economic recovery when it comes.  To that end the Government will continue to support the development of an innovative-friendly, pro-competition regulatory framework for aviation.  My Department is currently engaged in measures to enhance our bilateral relations with emerging markets such as India and China in support of the Government's Asia strategy.  The continued roll-out of DAA's investment programme and introduction of US preclearance facilities will greatly enhance the experience of customers using Irish airports and will provide airlines with opportunities to develop and grow new services.

The Irish market for shipping services is highly competitive and provides a diverse range of maritime links into and out of the State. This is vital to facilitate trade and tourism. The Cork Swansea service is particularly important for tourism in the South West.  As for any new venture, a range of supports is available from various State agencies. Fáilte Ireland will support the new service through active promotion and marketing, as is the case with other air and sea access routes. Fáilte Ireland has also granted BES certification to the enterprise.The Port of Cork has provided advice on this initiative and the Irish Maritime Development Office has met with Fastnet Line and is available to provide further advice and assistance.  In October 2009, Fastnet Line issued a public offer seeking to raise funds. I have given approval, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to allow the Port of Cork Company make a commercial investment should it so wish, but such a decision is entirely a matter for the Board. I understand that some of the local authorities are also considering such an investment.  Before entering service, the ship will be subject to an inspection by the Marine Surveyor's Office of my Department.

These Regulations established common Community rules in the field of civil aviation security, in force since January 2003.  These Regulations and a series of supplementary implementing Regulations have been adopted into our National Civil Aviation Security Programme (NCASP).All Irish airports with commercial flights are required to comply with the requirements of the EU Regulations and the National Civil Aviation Security Programme. These requirements include measures for the screening of departing passengers, their cabin and hold baggage. The Regulations stipulate that all departing passengers and their cabin baggage shall be screened in order to prevent prohibited articles from being introduced into security restricted areas and on-board aircraft. Similarly, all hold baggage and cargo is required to be screened prior to being loaded onto an aircraft.I understand that a Garda investigation is underway into the circumstances surrounding the incident regarding the import of an explosive substance to Ireland from the Slovak Republic on 2 January 2010. I refer the Deputy to the reply of my colleague the Minister for Justice to Question No. 223 of 20 January 2010 regarding this incident. My Department also raised this issue at a meeting of the EU Regulatory Committee for Aviation Security in Brussels on 21 January last. It is clear that the incident in question arose as a result of an error during an airport security exercise at Poprad-Tatry airport in the Slovak Republic and in no way reflects on the operation of aviation security at Dublin airport. The Slovak authorities have apologised for the incident on a number of occasions since.The operation of aviation security at Irish airports is subject to monitoring by my Department to ensure that airports meet the requirements laid down in EU Regulations. I am satisfied that aviation security practices and procedures implemented at Irish airports conform to European Union common rules and to the highest standards internationally. In addition to these practices and procedures being subject to monitoring by my Department, they are also the subject of periodic reviews by international organisations, such as the EU Commission and the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO).It is not the practice to comment on specific security measures in place or that may be implemented at the State's airports or on monitoring activities carried out by my Department; however, aviation security arrangements at Irish airports are kept under continuous review by my Department and the National Civil Aviation Security Committee, which is chaired by a senior official from my Department.  The Committee comprises representatives of Government Departments, State Airports, airlines, An Garda Síochána, the Defence Forces, Customs and Excise, An Post, Irish Aviation Authority, the Irish Airline Pilots' Association and the Regional Airports.

In the case of Shannon Airport, I understand from the Dublin Airport Authority (DAA) that the US Preclearance facility for commercial aviation at Shannon Airport has been fully operational since 5 August 2009 and that a number of commercial airlines operating from Shannon have used the facility since then.  The next phase of preclearance at Shannon is to extend its use to private aviation traffic.  The necessary infrastructure is in place and my Department, in conjunction with the Shannon Airport Authority, is working closely with the U.S. authorities on all relevant aspects, including security measures, with a view to having this phase of preclearance operational as quickly as possible.The preclearance facility will be provided in Terminal Two at Dublin Airport and is due to commence operations when the terminal opens in November 2010.  In relation to the issue of body scanners, I refer the Deputy to my answer to question no. 179 on 4 February last.

In 2005 statutory guidance was issued to Local Authorities on the setting of special speed limits in accordance with Section 9 of the Road Traffic Act 2004.  These Guidelines were revised and issued to Local Authorities again in December 2008.  They set out principles to guide local authorities in setting special speed limits and, under Section 9 of the Road Traffic Act 2004, application by local authorities of the 30 km per hour speed limit must be in accordance with the criteria set in the guidelines.In setting a speed limit a local authority must assess various factors with the primary focus being on road safety.  It is, quite appropriately, a matter for the local authority to assess the various factors at play in setting a special speed limit including compliance with the criteria set in the guidelines.  Any assessment of the impact of the new 30 km per hour zone in Dublin city centre can only be made following a period of time in operation.  Responsibility for the erection of signage and public awareness regarding new special speed limits are also matters for the local authority concerned.  Public awareness campaigns regarding road safety are the responsibility of the Road Safety Authority.

I am aware that motorcyclists are vulnerable road users and I believe that CBT for motorcyclists will improve road safety not only for this group but for all road users.  I understand that the RSA undertook a pilot programme to prepare for the introduction of CBT for motorcyclists, which was completed last year. Other necessary conditions for the introduction of a full CBT programme are, I understand, also now in place including the availability of a good supply of approved driving instructors.  Draft regulations are now being finalised within the RSA with a view to submitting them shortly to my Department for examination.

To date, as reported during my Department's recent joint cycling seminar with the Embassy of the Netherlands, the presentations at which are available on www.smartertravel.ie, progress has been made or is underway on some 40 of those points.The NCPF is part of a suite of interrelated measures being pursued under the Smarter Travel policy to deliver a sustainable travel and transport system by 2020.  My Department does not, nor does it intend to, disaggregate expenditure between the NCPF and other Smarter Travel measures, including support for An Taisce's GreenSchools Travel Programme because, in many cases, expenditure on cycling also serves to support other sustainable travels options such as walking and mixed mode travel.Securing an increase in both cycling and walking requires an integrated suite of measures and complementary actions across all aspects of sustainable transport. In this respect I have secured funding of €25 million for Smarter Travel initiatives in 2010, compared to an outturn of just under €10 million last year.  To date in 2010, payments totalling just over €350,000 have been authorised from the €25 million referred to earlier.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	785	The immediate cause of the Air Traffic Controller dispute at Dublin, Cork and Shannon airports was a withdrawal by IMPACT of co-operation with new technology projects since 1 January 2010 and the suspension of 14 Air Traffic Controllers (ATCs) as a result.  Around 110 inbound and outbound flights at the three State airports were cancelled on 20 January as a result of the industrial action and around 20,000 air passengers were affected.  In these circumstances, I am very disappointed that industrial action occurred before the Labour Court had an opportunity to consider the matter.  I am also very concerned about the serious consequences of industrial action for air passengers and the economy.I understand that the core issues of this dispute were non-payment of increases under T2016 and the possible introduction of an employee contribution to the IAA superannuation scheme.  Following consultation with the ICTU and IBEC, the Labour Court invited the IAA and IMPACT to preliminary talks on Friday 22 January aimed at devising a framework for resolving the issues in dispute between ATCs and the Authority.  Both parties accepted the invitation and, following the talks, IMPACT agreed to a full resumption of normal working with immediate effect and to no industrial action of any kind.  It also withdrew its objection, at the Labour Court's request, to ATCs undertaking project work.  The 14 suspended employees were returned to the payroll that same evening.Both sides also agreed to attend a further Labour Court hearing on 26 January to address (i) the issue of co-operation with ongoing technological change, and (ii) the pay and pension issues.  In the case of the former, the IAA and IMPACT agreed that the court would investigate the immediate issue of the classification of work under section 20 (2) of the Industrial Relations Act 1969 and that they would accept its decision in the matter as final and binding.  The Labour Court issued its recommendations on 27 January and found in favour of the IAA in respect of all four technology projects concluding that the changes associated with the disputed projects did not go beyond the parameters of what can be properly classified as "normal on-going change".On the issue of pay and pensions, the Labour Court issued its non-binding recommendations on 5 February and recommended the following:The first phase of 3.5% would be paid with effect from 1 January 2011 with retrospection to 1 January 2009;The second phase of 2.5% would be paid with effect from 1 July 2011 with retrospection to 31 December 2009;Retrospection would be paid into the IAA's pension fund as a once-off cash injection having regard to the current deficit in the pension schemeThe court urged the parties to accept the recommendations on condition that:The Unions and their members commit to full co-operation with normal ongoing change, adaptation and flexibility; andThe parties undertake to engage in an intensive process aimed at addressing the current difficulties in the Authority's pension scheme and that this process should take place over a period not exceeding three months.I would urge both parties to carefully consider the Labour Court's recommendations and to engage constructively as regards their implementation.

The construction, improvement and maintenance of individual national road projects is a matter for the National Roads Authority under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2007 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.  The 2010 national roads allocation of €1.115 billion demonstrates this Government's continued commitment to upgrade the State's national road infrastructure in the face of the current economic crisis and represents an average investment of €93 million per month in Ireland's national roads.The focus for 2010 is on completing the remaining sections of the major inter–urban routes linking Dublin with the Cork, Limerick and Waterford with 292 km of new roads opening during the year.  As a result no major new road construction projects will start in 2010.  The NRA is currently reviewing its plans for 2011 and 2012 in the likelihood of reduced Exchequer funding in those years.  Alternative means through, for example, additional public private partnership projects are being considered at present.The situation in relation to the Leinster Orbital route remains unchanged.  Neither Transport 21 nor the National Development Plan provides any funding for a Leinster Orbital Route.  The Government has already made it clear that under Transport 21, its priorities for the national roads investment programme, after the completion of the major inter-urban network in 2010, will be the Atlantic Road Corridor as well as the improvement of other key national primary routes and the targeted improvement of certain national secondary routes.  It is clear that, in the current economic climate, further progress on projects such as the Leinster Orbital Route will only be possible as and when resources become available.

The regulations also specify the means by which passengers may be screened, including hand search and walk-through metal detection (WTMD) equipment.  The use of body scanners as a method of screening passengers has yet to be approved by the EU.  However, EU regulations allow for trialling of new types of security equipment and body scanner technology has been and, continues to be, trialled at a number of EU airports.A special meeting of the European Union Regulatory Committee for Civil Aviation Security was held in Brussels on 7 January 2010.  The committee received a factual report from the authorities of the Netherlands and the United States on the serious incident that took place on flight NW 253 from Amsterdam to Detroit on 25 December 2009.Following an exchange of views on the security situation in the aftermath of that incident, the committee unanimously underlined the need for an EU approach to addressing the security situation, including the use of imaging technology, commonly referred to as body scanners, as one means for screening passengers.  The Commission is considering an initiative on imaging technology to reinforce passenger security, while at the same time addressing the conditions for using such technology, in particular, privacy, data protection and health issues.I am aware that Dublin Airport Authority has issued a tender notice seeking expressions of interest for the supply of body scanners.  Dublin Airport Authority has indicated that this is merely a first step in preparing for the possible use of such technology and is aware that deployment at any airport in the State, even on a trial basis, would be subject to approval by my Department and the European Commission.Consideration of the use of body scanners has not reached the stage where any decision has been made as to whether, and if so, to what extent legislative measures will be required.  I have been advised by my colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that any measure introduced will have to comply with the rights and protections provided for in our Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights.

It is clear that excessive increases in fares would damage the attractiveness of public transport while a lowering of fares could require additional Exchequer funding in the case of subvented services.In relation to the introduction of a new five zone fare on the LUAS red line, I understand that fares have been adjusted to take account of the Luas extension to the Docklands whereby passengers making longer journeys pay higher fares but for the vast majority of passengers there has been no change in the fares paid.  There is an incremental operating cost associated with extending the Luas network to service new areas and this cost has to be funded by fares.

I know that Revenue has had and continues to have a strong focus on making sure that everyone complies with their tax and duty responsibilities by paying the right amount and on time. Revenue expects businesses to continue, notwithstanding the more difficult economic circumstances in which they are now operating, to maintain a clear focus and organise their financial affairs to ensure that tax debts are paid as they fall due. I fully support what Revenue are doing in that regard.I know also that Revenue is very conscious of and appreciates that the difficult economic and financial climate in this country poses challenges for business in being timely compliant. Revenue responded to this difficult environment by actively encouraging businesses experiencing particular payment difficulties to work proactively with them when such difficulties start to arise to find an agreed way through those difficulties and quickly restore voluntary timely compliance. Revenue has developed an administrative framework to manage such cases, and has published material for businesses experiencing tax payment difficulties on its website www.revenue.ie
Revenue has been proactive in communicating its policy in public fora and has utilised every appropriate opportunity to publicly make its position clear in relation to this issue.   I am aware that the feedback from trade representative and tax practitioner bodies to the initiatives Revenue has taken has been positive and is regarded as an effective way of supporting businesses who are disposed to addressing payment difficulties in a positive, realistic and proactive way.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has examined this issue in his 2008 Annual Report, and has noted Revenue's approach. He concluded that this approach appears to be appropriate, but that ongoing vigilance is called for and the Revenue Commissioners advise me that they agree with this observation.

The Group is charged with the collection of flood level data, an assessment of the damage caused by the flooding and the identification of interim flood mitigation measures. At its first meeting last week, the Group identified a number of specific locations around Athlone where mitigation works may be feasible.  In January, the OPW wrote to Local Authorities seeking applications for funding for minor flood relief works and studies they propose to undertake in 2010. It is anticipated that Westmeath County Council will submit applications under this scheme in respect of mitigation works in the Athlone area.

The Deputy may be aware that no Stamp Duty is payable by first time purchasers of new or second hand residential property or by owner-occupier purchasers of new residential property under 125 square metres in size.  If Stamp Duty on residential property was reduced or abolished, any shortfall in Exchequer receipts would have to be made up by increases in other taxes.  Stamp Duty on property will be reviewed in the context of potential changes to the taxation of property, such as the Commission on Taxation's recommendation to introduce a residential property tax and the commitment in the renewed Programme for Government to introduce a site valuation tax on non-agricultural land.

A tax year is the period from 1 January to 31 December inclusive.  Based on the information provided, there would be an entitlement to mortgage interest relief from 2003, including entitlement on the new mortgage taken out when the person traded up to a new property in 2008.  Having received mortgage interest relief for seven tax years from June 2003 to 31 December 2009 at the first-time buyer rate, the person is now entitled to receive mortgage interest relief on the new property at the non-first time buyer rate of 15% per annum, on interest paid up to a maximum of €3,000 for a single person or €6,000 for a married couple.The entitlement to relief in this instance was due to end in 2014.  However, in Budget 2010, I announced that I would be extending mortgage interest relief up to the end of 2017, at the appropriate rate, for those whose entitlement to relief was due to end in 2010 or after.  Full details of this measure are set out in the Finance Bill.

Since its establishment the unit, in conjunction with Government Departments, Local Authorities, offices and agencies, has achieved savings amounting to €27,253,124. These savings were primarily derived from an initiative that achieved up to 8% cost reductions on contracts for goods and services over the value of €100,000. As existing contracts expire further savings will be achieved through the conducting of competitive tendering processes based on aggregated public service demand.  The total running costs of the unit to date (including the activities of the former GSA) are €1,081,336. This figure primarily consists of salary costs relating to the 26 staff based in both Dublin and Trim, Co. Meath.

The European Investment Bank announced on 3 October 2008 that it was increasing lending for European small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to help mitigate the effects of the credit crisis. This support was in the form of a €30 billion facility to provide loans to commercial banks for onlending to SMEs to fund medium to long-term investment projects.  Four banks operating in Ireland have access to the EIB facility: Allied Irish Bank (AIB), Bank of Ireland (BoI) and Ulster Bank have access to €100 million each and Bank of Scotland Ireland has access to €50 million.It is important to emphasise that the EIB makes funding available for onlending to SMEs as part of its mandate to assist the development of the SME sector. As a result, commercial banks that borrow from the facility are required to ensure that the money is onlent to SMEs for investment and expansion of their activities.  It follows that there are significant constraints on lending from the EIB scheme. Borrowing for short-term working capital is generally not eligible, although a permanent increase in working capital required to develop an expanding SME would qualify.  Loans for cash flow or the refinancing of other debt and generally for the takeover of other businesses would not qualify.  The distribution of drawdowns across institutions is of commercial sensitivity but indications are that substantial amounts of lending under the facility have been approved across a wide range of sectors.Additional to the EIB scheme, I am aware of funds being made available to Irish SMEs through the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme operated by the European Investment Fund.  However, this scheme was established before the onset of the financial crisis.

It was recognised that the draft legislation could allow the particular circumstances of the grade to be addressed although no decision was taken on the manner in which this might be done.Section 6 of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act 2009, which came into force on 21 December 2009, provides that the Minister for Finance may by direction exempt or vary the application of the pay reductions provided for in the Act to public servants or groups of public servants in certain limited circumstances.  On 22 December, 2009, I formally directed under Section 6 that in the reduction of salary for the Assistant Secretary and Deputy Secretary grades in the civil service, and for certain public service grades related to the Assistant Secretary and Deputy Secretary grades, account should be taken of the termination of performance related pay.

It is a well established principle that the pay of job or work sharers and those on atypical work patterns is calculated by reference to the whole time equivalent pay rate for the grade or post in question.  The reduced pay rates are, therefore, calculated in this way which is consistent with the legislation governing the conditions of employment of part-time workers.  Accordingly, the reduction in the rate of pay for full time and job sharing public servants is the same and any change in this relationship would create an inequity in the rate of pay for those doing similar work.  The option of those currently work sharing to increase their hours or return to full time duties will be dictated by the service needs and resources of the public service body where those public servants are employed.The Pension Related Deduction (PRD) commenced in 2009 during which the PRD was in effect for 10 months.  In 2010 the application of this deduction over 12 months results in a slightly higher PRD being deducted with effect from 1 January.  However, this increase will be offset to some extent as earnings of public servants will reduce due to the application of reduced rates of pay in 2010."

Travelling expenses within the State other than transport by ambulance are not normally regarded as allowable health expenses.  However, Revenue, in their published leaflet on health expenses relief (IT6), have stated that where regular continuing treatment or consultation is required and the patient has to travel long distances, tax relief for the travelling expenses may be granted; but in this regard it is not the intention that tax relief would be granted for minor local travelling expenses or occasional travelling, for example, to undergo an operation.  If a taxpayer has any doubt about whether a particular treatment or expenditure qualifies for tax relief he or she should seek clarification from their local Inspector of Taxes.

The windfall tax applies to the portion of any profit or gain which arises from the rezoning.  The balance of the profit or gain is taxable at the appropriate income tax, corporation tax, or capital gains tax rate, depending on the circumstances of the disposal.In most cases a site of agricultural land will not require rezoning to allow the building of a house, so the windfall tax rate would not apply to the disposal of such land.  However, to put the matter beyond doubt, Finance Bill 2010 contains a measure providing that the windfall rate will not apply to sales of sites up to 1 acre in size and €250,000 in value.

It  provides important safeguards to people who are involuntarily admitted by ensuring that all admission and renewal orders are subject to automatic and independent review by a Mental Health Tribunal.  The Act also established the Mental Health Commission which is responsible for promoting, encouraging and fostering the establishment of high standards and good practices in the delivery of mental health services and taking all reasonable steps to protect the interests of persons detained in approved centres.  The Act is due to be reviewed in 2011 and the provisions of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with a Disability will be among the issues to be considered in that context.A Vision for Change outlines Government policy for the future development of mental health services including community based services.  In January 2008, the Government established the Office for Disability and Mental Health as a cross-cutting Government Office with a remit across four Government Departments: Health and Children, Education and Science, Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The Office provides for greater cohesion across the public service and brings together responsibility for a range of different policy areas and State services.  The Office was assigned four key priorities one of which is to bring a new impetus to the implementation of ‘A Vision for Change'  working in partnership with the HSE and other stakeholders including other Government Departments to achieve implementation of agreed targets.  Bilateral meetings with officials from other Government Departments to discuss progressing recommendations in ‘A Vision for Change' and ‘Reach Out' the National Strategy for Action on Suicide Prevention take place within this context.

Substances are scheduled under the Act in accordance with Ireland's obligations under international conventions and/or where there is evidence that the substances are causing significant harm to public health in Ireland.The list of scheduled substances is kept under ongoing review. For example, in 2006 psychotropic (‘magic') mushrooms were banned and their possession and sale is now illegal. On 31 March 2009, BZP was similarly subjected to legislative control measures and criminal sanctions.  In the light of the health risks associated with some of the products being sold in so-called ‘head shops', I intend to make regulations before the end of June which will introduce controls, similar to those introduced recently in the UK, on a range of substances which are currently on sale in head shops. These regulations will make the possession and sale of these substances illegal and subject to criminal sanctions.Some of the substances in question have legitimate uses  — for example, in the production of plastics and industrial solvents. It will be necessary to assess the level of use of these substances by industry in Ireland and the implications for industry of placing these substances under the ambit of Misuse of Drugs legislation. In accordance with EU law, it may also be necessary to notify the Commission of the proposed regulations in case they impact on legitimate industrial activities and this imposes a 3 month stand still period on implementation of the regulations.  Minister of State John Curran, who has responsibility for co-ordinating the National Drugs Strategy, has identified head shops as an area of concern, and is currently considering the options available to more effectively control the activities of head shops.A Research Advisory Group (RAG) has been established to identify possible options for the regulation of head shops. The RAG held its first meeting on 13 January 2010. It has representatives from the National Advisory Committee on Drugs, the Departments of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Health and Children, the Health Research Board, Revenue Custom's Service, the Forensic State Laboratory and other relevant stakeholders. The RAG will report incrementally until its work is complete.

This unit provides services directly to adoptees, natural mothers and birth families.  It also works closely with the registered adoption societies and the HSE nationwide information and tracing services.  Improvements to this service have been effected by the computerisation of the unique adoption files held by the Board.The National Adoption Contact Register was established in 2005 to assist adopted people and their natural families to make contact with each other, exchange information or state their contact preferences.  They decide, through a range of information and contact options, how they wish to proceed.  Already 440 matches have been made on the Register representing over 900 individuals who have now received a service.  The operation of the Register was reviewed in 2007 and a major upgrading of it has just been completed.The Adoption Board, together with the societies, the HSE and the support groups, developed the "Standardised Framework for the Provision of a National Information and Tracing Service".  This was published in November 2007 and sets standards and provides guidance and advice for information and tracing services providers nationally. The standardised Framework is currently being piloted nationally. In relation to Information and Tracing for persons adopted from abroad, the Adoption Board intends to undertake a consultation process with interested parties to determine how best to address the needs of those adopted from abroad.Following the passage of the Adoption Bill 2009 adopted children will continue to have the same eligibility and entitlements to health, personal social services and special education needs as any child in Ireland. The Bill includes statutory provision for the notification by adoptive parents of the adoption on return to Ireland with the child. This must be made to both the Adoption Authority, for the purposes of registering the child, and the HSE, in order that the child receives all the normal child health surveillance services available through the public health system.Registration of domestic adoptions is governed by Section 22 of the Adoption Act 1952.  Under that provision, an tArd Chláraitheoir (Registrar General) is required to maintain a register of domestic adoptions (i.e. adoptions effected in Ireland, regardless of where the adopted person was born).  The register is called the Adopted Children Register.  An index to the register is maintained and can be searched by any person.  Any person may obtain a copy of any entry in the register.  The legislation also provides for an index linking the birth entry in the register of births (in the case of an Irish-born adopted person) with the entry in the Adopted Children Register.  Information from this index may not be given to any person except by order of a court or the Adoption Board. I am aware that the treatment of adopted persons in this regard differs from the rest of the population but consideration of this issue must take place in the context of the complex legal, ethical and constitutional issues arising from the need to fairly balance the rights of all parties to the adoption process.

This report estimated, based on the best available information at that time, that the total full year cost of implementing such a programme was between €16m and €19m. This assumes a purchase cost of €11m for vaccine and the balance being pay and other administrative costs. In early December last I met with the two manufacturers of the vaccines and indicated to them that I would like to go ahead with the vaccination programme as early as possible and that if we got a price close to the price they offered to other countries, especially the UK, it might be possible to go ahead in 2010. They assured me that they would give very competitive prices and consequently I requested the HSE to initiate a tendering process for the procurement of a HPV vaccine with a view to commencing a HPV vaccination programme for all girls in first year in secondary school. This tendering process for the vaccine is now completed and the HSE is committed to starting this campaign during the current year.

The Deputy may be interested to know that as set out in the Ryan Report Implementation Plan HIQA is developing guidance for the HSE for the Review of Serious Incidents, including deaths of children in care.  The HSE and the Irish Youth Justice Service are to develop a panel (internal and external) of appropriately skilled professionals to undertake those reviews.  In addition HIQA may conduct an independent investigation of a serious incident or death.The review in relation to the death of the young person referred to by the Deputy will be undertaken once this guidance is issued and the panel is established.

#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	825	I welcome the publication of HIQA's "Overview Report on 2008 Inspections and Findings for Children in Care Services".  The Report provides, inter alia, an overview of findings from the inspection of services to children in care throughout 2008.  It highlights strengths and deficits in these services.  The findings are designed to effect continuous improvement in the quality and outcomes of services provided to children in care.  The HSE has a statutory duty to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection.  I am aware that the HSE is actively working to implement the recommendations set out in the report, including those relating to the vetting of foster carers and care planning generally.  My Department has asked the HSE to reply directly to the Deputy on these operational matters.One of the recommendations of the HIQA Report relates to the placement of children age 12 and under in residential care.  In 2009 my Office developed a ‘National Policy in relation to the placement of children aged 12 years and under in the Care or Custody of the HSE' in response to HIQA's recommendation.  The policy states that a child aged 12 years or under should not be placed in residential care except in exceptional circumstances.  These exceptional circumstances are outlined in the policy document.  This policy was notified to the HSE in October 2009 for implementation.  The Government is committed to ensuring that all children in care are allocated a social worker and a care plan as set out in the Implementation Plan following the Ryan Report.
#AineBrady	unknown-#AineBrady-party	unknown-#AineBrady-dob	unknown-#AineBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	826	Government policy in relation to older people is to support people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible and, where this is not feasible, to support access to quality, long-term affordable residential care.  In line with this policy, a priority of Government in recent years has been to develop care services to assist vulnerable older people to live at home for as long as possible. There has, consequently, been significant development nationally by the Health Service Executive (HSE) of a number of community-based supports such as Home Help, Home Care Packages, and Day/Respite Care. In 2010 the Executive will, for example, invest in the region of €210 million for Home Help services, and €130 million for Home Care Packages.The focus of the Department and the HSE in recent times has been the introduction of new regulations for the long-term residential care sector, underpinned by a scheme of financial support (the Nursing Homes Support Scheme). While there is at present no statutory regulation of the home care sector, the HSE has responsibility for delivering all aspects of its community based service. This includes training and induction for its community staff, and Garda clearance for all new staff employed since 2006. (Garda clearance has also been sought, on a phased basis, for all staff who commenced employment before 2006. Clearance has by now been received for almost all such staff members, and work will continue in this area until clearance has been received for all HSE employees.)Following the introduction of Home Care Packages in 2006, and in accordance with a recommendation of the Long-Term Care Working Group and a "T2016" commitment, the Department last year commissioned an independent Evaluation of Home Care Packages. This Evaluation was published on 3 December last. The HSE is committed, in its Service Plan 2010, to implement the recommendations of this Evaluation, which will include the adoption by the Executive this year of:National Guidelines for the Standardised Implementation of Home Care Packages;National Quality Home Care Support Guidelines; anda National Procurement Framework for the provision of home care services.These measures will apply to all relevant home care services provided directly by, or on behalf of, the HSE.In relation to the issue of statutory regulation,  the Law Reform Commission published a consultation paper in July last, entitled Legal Aspects of Carers. While the focus of the HSE this year will be on the implementation of the recent Evaluation, the Department will also consider the Commission's findings in the context of possible changes to legislation and regulation in the area of home care for older persons generally.I have referred the Deputy's question to the HSE for direct reply, in relation to the cost information raised.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	830	Figures on the prevalence of respiratory conditions in Ireland are not routinely available.  The reason for this is that these conditions cover a very wide range of diagnoses from minor to acute or chronic disease which are not generally notifiable or covered by specific disease registries.  In Quarter 3 of 2007, the Quarterly National Household Survey (QNHS) conducted by the Central Statistics Office included a health questionnaire which asked respondents about previously diagnosed medical conditions.  Asthma and bronchitis were included in the list of conditions with a reported prevalence of 6% and 2% respectively.Data from the World Health Organisation indicates that rates of decline in mortality from respiratory conditions in Ireland have been very rapid, particularly in the last 10 years, and that the gap with our EU counterparts has closed significantly over this period.  Premature mortality (age less than 65 years) from respiratory disease is now at the EU average having been 20% higher a decade ago.  Mortality for those over the age of 65 is 80% higher than the EU average, but here too the gap has narrowed.  Overall, respiratory conditions remain a very significant cause of chronic illness and of mortality in Ireland.There are a variety of risk factors contributing to respiratory disease.  However, research demonstrates that smoking prevention and cessation is the single most effective way to reduce respiratory diseases and slow their progression.  Considerable progress is being made which can be attributed to a variety of causes including improved medical treatment and better environmental and lifestyle factors such as reduction in smoking.  A number of measures have been taken to prevent smoking including the workplace smoking ban, taxation measures, written health warnings on tobacco products and restrictions on the display of tobacco products in the retail sector.As part of its work in the 2010 Service Plan, the HSE has committed to developing a chronic disease management programme for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The HSE is also currently developing an asthma management programme which involves shared care of asthma between Primary Care and the acute sector and is focused on preventing asthma and its complications.Lung cancer is a major cause of mortality and there are approximately 1,800 cases of lung cancer diagnosed and around 1,600 deaths from the disease each year. Comparison with other jurisdictions shows that advanced stage of disease at presentation is more common in Ireland which leads to poorer outcomes for patients. In order to address this problem the HSE's National Cancer Control Programme is establishing Rapid Access Diagnostic Clinics for lung cancer in each of the eight designated cancer centres. Four clinics have already been established and the remaining four will open by the middle of this year.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	833	The number of  nurses and midwives (expressed in Whole Time Equivalent terms) employed in the Public Health Service was 37,071 as of  31 December 2009, while the corresponding figure for 2000 was 27,973. These figures are sourced from the Health Service Personnel Census and exclude student nurses and student midwives.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	834	The current number of undergraduate nursing degree places, each year, across the individual courses is as follows:NumberGeneral Nursing860 placesIntellectual Disability Nursing180 placesPsychiatric Nursing290 placesMidwifery140 placesChildren’s and General Nursing Integrated100 placesTotal1,570 placesAs a result the total number of nursing undergraduates currently in training is approximately 7,000. My Department and the HSE, in cooperation with relevant stakeholders, is initiating a review of different aspects of the undergraduate nursing degree programme and its findings will inform the future direction of the programme.By international standards Ireland has a high number of nurses graduating each year. In fact the O.E.C.D. (Health at a Glance 2009) indicates that Ireland at 32.5 is close to the OECD average of 35.5 nursing graduates per 100,000 population.  In comparison to many other countries, Ireland has a relatively high ratio of nurses to population. Compared to others, Ireland has relatively fewer nursing assistants or healthcare assistants working with nurses. If we can achieve a more efficient and effective use of the nursing resource through advanced practice, improved skill mix and more flexible and efficient rostering this would impact on the projected nursing requirements.  The planned reconfiguration of many of HSE's front line services will also be of assistance in this regard. This reconfiguration includes conversion of in-patient work to day-care work, focusing on reducing patient length of stay in acute hospitals, reducing in-patient bed numbers and providing more services in community settings thus reducing dependency on in-patient beds.In recent years much progress has been made in the better utilisation of the nursing resource and a number of initiatives have been introduced which facilitate nurses and midwives expanding their roles and improving the services provided to patients and clients. I have amended the relevant legislation and introduced new regulations to allow for the introduction of nurse prescribing. Currently approximately 400 nurses and midwives have commenced or completed the education programme for nurse/midwife prescribing. These programmes are conducted in University College Cork and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland. There are currently 146 registered Nurse Prescribers from a diversity of health service providers and clinical areas throughout the Health Service Executive with the authority to prescribe medicinal products.I have introduced the necessary regulation to authorise nurses to refer an individual for medical ionising radiation (X-Ray). The introduction of this expanded practice for nurses is a significant initiative in the Irish health service and will have implications for service users in terms of convenience, cost-effectiveness, improved access to radiology services and simplification of the patient journey.  The continuous development of Advanced Nurse Practitioner posts (121 approved) and Clinical Specialist posts (2065 approved) to meet specific service needs in the nursing and midwifery disciplines are further examples of developments in this area.A small, but extremely significant development in the better utilisation of nurses is the new role nurses are playing in Sexual Assault Treatment Units (SATU).  8 nurses have successfully completed the Higher Diploma in Nursing -Sexual Assault Forensic Examination programme.  These nurses are now working in their sponsoring SATU areas providing holistic care and undertaking the clinical forensic examination of  the victims of sexual assault. This work was previously only undertaken by doctors.  Another example of the new and more effective use of the nursing and midwifery resource is the key role that a large number of nurses and midwives are playing in the administration of the H1N1 vaccine in the current Swine Flu vaccination campaign.I regard nursing and midwifery as key elements of our health services and I am currently finalising a new Nurses and Midwives Bill.  This will not only recognise midwifery as a separate and distinct profession but will modernise the regulatory framework for these professions and align it to the frameworks governing other healthcare professions.  The new legislation will enhance the protection of the public in its dealings with the professions and ensure the integrity of nursing and midwifery through the continued promotion of high standards of professional education, training and practice and professional conduct.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	840	Details of the number of medical card holders are provided to my Department each month by the Health Service Executive (HSE). The figures are provided on a net basis, showing the balance after new cards have been issued and other cards, as appropriate, have been deleted from the Executive's database, e.g. following a review of a person's circumstances. The most recent figures provided by the HSE to my Department reflect the position on 31st December 2009 and show 337,669 medical card holders aged 70 years or over.Under the Health Act 2008, the income thresholds for entitlement to a medical card for those aged 70 or over is €700 (gross) per week (€36,500 per year) for a single person and €1,400 (gross) per week (€73,000 per year) for a couple.  Where the spouse/partner is under 70 years of age, he/she can qualify under the over 70s medical card scheme if the combined gross incomes of the applicant and dependant spouse/partner are within the income threshold limit of €1,400 (gross) per week. There were no changes to these provisions in Budget 2010.  As the other information sought by the Deputy is not provided by the HSE to my Department as a matter of routine, my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to address this matter and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	843	I have consistently emphasised the need to improve facilities and services to persons with cystic fibrosis.  Following publication of the Pollock Report in 2005, the Health Service Executive established a Working Group to undertake a detailed review of cystic fibrosis services.  The Group, which was multi-disciplinary in its composition and included representation from the Department of Health and Children, was asked to review the current configuration and delivery of services to persons with cystic fibrosis in Ireland.  The report was published in October 2009.  Many of its recommendations had already been implemented.Some 50 additional staff including consultant, nursing and allied health professionals, have been appointed across the hospital system in recent years to enhance the level of services provided for persons with cystic fibrosis.  The HSE was asked to place a particular focus on the development of services at the National Adult Tertiary Referral Centre at St. Vincent's Hospital.  The hospital currently treats over 50% of the CF adult population.  A number of capital projects have been completed at the hospital and have helped to improve facilities. These include a new ambulatory care centre, the refurbishment of St. Camillus Ward, and a new Emergency Department which includes single room accommodation.The refurbishment of accommodation to provide eight single en-suite rooms for patients with cystic fibrosis was completed in August 2008 and the beds are now operational. This brings the total level of in-patient accommodation for the treatment of respiratory patients (including people with CF) at the hospital to 63 beds.A new ward block to replace existing accommodation is being developed at the hospital. This facility will provide single room en-suite inpatient accommodation (100 rooms) and a dedicated day unit for people with CF, including 10 single day treatment rooms with en-suite sanitary facilities. Tenders for this development are currently under consideration. It is estimated that the construction, equipping and commissioning of this block will take approximately 18 months. It is intended that the development will become operational as early as possible in 2011.  The new facility will include accommodation for cystic fibrosis patients with appropriate isolation facilities for the treatment of their condition.  The HSE is now working with St. Vincent's to identify opportunities for patients who do not require tertiary level care to be treated close to home where adult services have been developed in the other specialist centres.A number of other significant capital developments are being progressed for cystic fibrosis patients throughout the country, including in Beaumont Hospital.   Capital funding has been provided for the development of outpatient facilities for patients with CF treated at Beaumont Hospital.  The project is in two phases and the first phase (decanting) was completed at the end of 2009.  The second phase is due for completion in the second quarter of 2010.  HSE funding enabled the construction of a three storey building consisting of two floors each of 14 single rooms, and 8 bed HDU and two additional ICU rooms (within existing ICU).  Services for patients with cystic fibrosis are also provided at Our Lady's Hospital, Crumlin, Children's University Hospital, Temple Street, Tallaght Hospital, Cork University Hospital, Waterford Regional Hospital, Mid Western Regional Hospital, Limerick, University College Hospital Galway and Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda.The Cystic Fibrosis Registry of Ireland (CFRI) receives support funding from the HSE.  Ireland is the only European country to commit public funding to a CF registry.  The CFRI is now in a position to produce relevant data on 90% of people with CF in Ireland.  The average enrolment of people with CF in other country registries is approximately 80%.  The Newborn Screening for Cystic Fibrosis Steering Group was established in June 2009 under the Chairmanship of Professor Gerry Loftus, Professor of Paediatrics, Galway. This group has a broad membership from key stakeholders and experts in the field of cystic fibrosis.  The screening programme will commence implementation in 2010 provided all the necessary general and specific screening programme governance arrangements are in place.The Cystic Fibrosis Association of Ireland has made representations to the HSE in respect of people with Cystic Fibrosis living in Donegal for whom attendance at the CF centre in Belfast might be more convenient.  The HSE is pursuing this through Co-operation and Working Together (CAWT).  I am conscious that further improvements are required, including the need to develop community outreach services to facilitate the treatment of patients outside of a hospital setting where appropriate. Taken together, the planned developments represent a tangible improvement in the quality of services for people with cystic fibrosis.

I discussed the overall implementation of the national roads programme and corporate governance matters.  I have also on occasion met with the Chairman, Chief Executive and other officials of the NRA on specific policy issues. No meeting of this type has taken place recently.  My Department also maintains regular day-to-day contact with the NRA in relation to policy and funding issues in respect of the national roads programme and in relation to corporate governance of the Authority. I understand that tolling issues are occasionally discussed at these meetings.However, I should point out that as Minister for Transport I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in relation to the national roads programme element of Transport 21 while the implementation of individual national road projects is a matter for the NRA and the local authorities concerned.  I should further clarify that the statutory power to levy tolls on national roads, to make toll bye-laws and to enter into toll agreements with private investors in respect of national roads, is vested in the NRA under Part V of the Roads Act 1993 (as amended by the Planning and Development Act 2000 and the Roads Act 2007).

Drugs and organised crime are being prioritised by An Garda Síochána as a core focus for 2010, through the Commissioner's Policing Plan, 2010, which reflects Government strategies contained in the National Drug Strategy.  Drugs units are in place in every Garda division and work in partnership with the Garda National Drugs Unit in tackling and targeting drug-related crime. Divisional and District Policing Plans also reflect the focus of the national Policing Plan in terms of drugs enforcement.As part of a co-ordinated approach. An Garda Síochána makes full use of the international Garda Liaison Network, District and Divisional Drug Units, the Garda National Drugs Unit, the Organised Crime Unit and the Criminal Assets Bureau, as well as other specialist units and uniformed and plain-clothes personnel nationwide, in targeting drug supply reduction. An Garda Síochána also has in place a number of strategic partnerships at national and international level to address drug trafficking.However, it is clear that we cannot tackle the problem of drug misuse through law enforcement measures alone. As set out in the Government's new National Drugs Strategy for the period  2009 to 2016, it is vital to address the problem in a co-ordinated way across the pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and research.  In this context, I can assure the Deputy that my Department, and all the agencies under its aegis, remain fully committed to this approach and to the implementation of the Strategy.I am advised by the Garda authorities that the  table below shows the quantities of heroin, cocaine, cannabis, LSD and Methamphetamines seized in Mayo Garda Division in 2007, 2008 and 2009, on the basis of cases reported to the Forensic Science Laboratory (valid to 4th February, 2010).YearCannabisCannabis ResinHeroinCocaineEcstasyMethLSD2009*2,191.812 gms2,657.036 gms—231.443 gms125.599 gms87.273 gms—20081,872.276 gms2,848.780 gms0.041 gms477.945 gms400.309 gms0.484 gms2 tabs2007501.272 gms1,538.088 gms3.891 gms21.584 gms4,388.750 gms—13 tabs*Statistics provided for 2009 are operational and liable to change.

In April 2006 Phase 2 of the project (the digitisation of some 2.5 million individual registered boundaries) commenced on a county by county basis.  Twenty two (22) counties are now fully live on the system, with County Tipperary due to be completed before the end of this month.I am informed that digitisation of boundaries is currently at various stages in the remaining three (3) counties — Offaly, Waterford, and Galway.  Galway is due for completion in mid-year. Before the process commences for each county a briefing session is organised for solicitors and other users in the area and this was done in respect of County Galway at a very well attended seminar on Friday 28 January 2010.  At that meeting the time schedules were outlined, demonstrations were given and practical information on how to best use the new system was provided. The registered boundaries are plotted and quality assured before being loaded on to the PRA's computerised system and declared live.  The changeover to digital mapping in County Galway will result in improved turnaround times for cases requiring mapping from the middle of this year and onwards.The Deputy should note that approximately 70% of dealings lodged in respect of County Galway with the PRA do not require to be mapped and are not affected by the Digital Mapping Project at all.  Regular progress reports on the project are also published on the PRA website which was last updated on the 24 December 2009.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	859	The Private Security Authority (PSA), established under the Private Security Services Act 2004, is the regulatory body with responsibility for regulating and licensing the private security industry.  The Authority is an independent body under the aegis of my Department and the administration of the Authority is vested in a Board whose membership includes industry representatives.  With regard to the electronic security sector, the Authority has to date regulated ‘Intruder Alarm Installers' and ‘Intruder Alarm Monitoring Centres'.  The purpose of licensing this sector is to ensure that the public are being provided with a security service by installers who are properly established, tax compliant, have had a criminal record check and who are able to carry out work to an acceptable standard.I have been advised by the Authority that they also intend to commence licensing of ‘CCTV Installers' in the future.  I am further advised that in drafting the requirements underpinning the future licensing of this group, the Authority has endeavoured at all times to include the views of the public and industry. This is achieved through the formulation of a document setting out the processes and procedures applying to installation and maintenance of CCTV systems in a licensed environment. I can inform the Deputy that there have been two periods of public consultation; one in 2008 and one in 2009/2010 as well as extensive formal, focussed consultation with stakeholders from industry throughout this time to ensure that the draft document, when finally agreed, is as reflective as possible of industry concerns.In the course of these consultations, I am informed that there had not been any significant objections to the inclusion of maintenance as a licensable activity as it was agreed by stakeholders that proven competence in this field, through compliance with PSA requirements, was an essential safeguard to ensure the confidence of the public and consumers as well as protecting the vast majority of contractors who already provide a high quality service in the areas of installation and maintenance.The Deputy may wish to note that the latest targeted public consultation process indicates that around 40% of potential CCTV Installer licence applicants are already in possession of a PSA ‘Intruder Alarm Installer' licence. For these potential applicants there will be no additional cost in respect of licence fees. Licence fee charges will only accrue to those CCTV Installers who are not, at the time of the application for a PSA licence, already in possession of any PSA licence relating to the installation of electronic security systems.The PSA has also sought the views of the industry representative body on ways to reduce the costs of compliance for contractors while at the same time maintaining standards for the public. An examination of the number of contractors licensed by the PSA shows that the numbers have remained unchanged over the past three years and while some contractors have exited from the industry this has been offset by the number of new entrants to the sector.

Bhain gné forbartha pobail leis an dá chlár agus cuireadh ar fáil iad trí struchtúir soláthair áitiúil éagsúla.  Tháinig na cláir seo chun críche ar 31 Nollaig 2009 agus tháinig clár nua — an Clár Forbartha Áitiúil agus Pobail (LCDP) — i gcomharbacht orthu.Is í aidhm an LCDP nua dul i ngleic le bochtanas agus eisiamh sóisialta trí chomhpháirtíocht agus chaidreamh cuiditheach idir an Rialtas agus a chuid gníomhaireachtaí agus daoine i bpobail atá faoi mhíbhuntáiste.

The Task Force co-ordinators are employed by the HSE and a work programme is agreed with the Task Force Chairperson on behalf of the particular Task Force.  I have arranged to send the names of the co-ordinators directly to the Deputy.
#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	870	As I outlined previously to the House, my Department has seen the need to re-design its community development/social inclusion programmes, particularly the Local Development Social Inclusion (LDSIP) and Community Development Programmes (CDP), drawing on good international practice and to support the ongoing evaluation of the programmes.  Both programmes had a community development element and were delivered through separate local delivery structures.  These programmes came to an end on 31 December 2009 and have been superseded by a new programme, the Local and Community Development Programme (LCDP).The aim of the new programme is to tackle poverty and social exclusion through partnership and constructive engagement between Government and its agencies and people in disadvantaged communities.  The new programme preserves elements of good practice from the CDP/LDSIP Programmes and will enable groups to objectively demonstrate the positive impacts they are securing for local communities.  An implementation strategy, involving the stakeholders, is underway for LCDP roll-out over the course of 2010.In advance of proceeding to establish the LCDP, my Department undertook an evaluation of individual CDPs. Many of these projects span across two decades, with quite diverse activities.  The objective of the review was to identify those projects that produce tangible, appropriate benefits for the communities they serve.  The vast majority of projects fell into this category and were offered funding under the new programme in 2010.  Where projects were not recommended for continued funding, an appropriate appeals mechanism was provided and a CDP Appeals Board established.  The Appeals Board completed its work on 29 January 2010 and the Deputy may be aware that its report has been published on my Department's website at www.pobail.ie.I am advised that CDPs that were unsuccessful in their appeals — including West Tallaght Resource Centre — have been informed by the Appeals Board of its decision to uphold the original decision of my Department to cease CDP funding for them.  The Deputy will appreciate that it is now a matter for the voluntary boards of management in each case to decide the future strategy for their companies in light of the decisions of the Appeals Board. My officials have been in contact with each of the projects concerned and have indicated that if the company decides to cease operations and to wind-up, my Department will, without prejudice, seek to assist the directors in discharging their statutory responsibilities.  While such assistance could include limited financial assistance in appropriate circumstances, due account would have to be taken of the nature and extent of any net liabilities incurred by the companies and the financial and regulatory limitations applicable to my Department.As I have previously indicated, my primary concern is to make every effort to ensure that the front-line services provided by, or supported through, my Department — especially those providing tangible benefits for the most disadvantaged communities — are protected.  Under the new programme, local development companies will be able to identify and meet the needs of communities and I have asked that particular attention be given to RAPID areas and to those areas where a CDP is no longer operating.Finally, with regard to the request from West Tallaght Resource Centre for a meeting with my Department, I understand that my officials have been in touch with them in this regard. I have also agreed to meet with the board of the company.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	878	Under EU social welfare law, it is illegal to distinguish between EU workers on the basis of nationality alone.  Therefore, in the context of the opening of the Irish labour market to workers from 12 new EU member states in 2004, it was considered necessary to protect Ireland from ‘welfare tourism' by ensuring that people with little connection to this country could not qualify for welfare payments immediately upon arrival in Ireland.  The effect of the habitual residency requirement is that a person whose habitual residence is elsewhere is not paid certain social welfare payments on arrival in Ireland, regardless of citizenship, nationality, immigration status or any other factor.  Decisions concerning habitual residence are subject to five factors which have been laid down by the European Court of Justice, and which are now incorporated into our domestic social welfare legislation. These are:(a) the length and continuity of residence in the State or in any other particular country;(b) the length and purpose of any absence from the State;(c) the nature and pattern of the person's employment;(d) the person's main centre of interest, and(e) the future intentions of the person concerned as they appear from all the circumstances.The vast majority of Irish nationals applying for social welfare support satisfy the HRC condition. Difficulties might arise however if, for example, the person's main centre of interest is still abroad — e.g. they have a spouse living abroad or still own property abroad etc. Between 1 May 2004 and 31 December 2009, of those Irish citizens whose circumstances called for detailed investigation in this respect, 89% were found to satisfy the habitual residence condition. Only 11% were refused on HRC grounds.Irish nationals returning to live in Ireland on a permanent basis should experience no difficulty in demonstrating that they satisfy the requirements of the Habitual Residence Condition. The guidelines published by the Department address this as follows: in the context of the first factor listed above, they make it clear that a person may attain habitual residence on arrival here. The guidelines state:"On the other hand, a short stay in Ireland does not automatically prove that an applicant has maintained his/her habitual residence abroad. Periods of residence abroad and the nature of that residence prior to the date of the latest arrival in Ireland may be relevant in assessing what is the person's main centre of interest and settled intention.Consider the length and continuity of the applicant's residence in Ireland and in the other country:has s/he lived in Ireland before, if so for how long?has the applicant stayed in different countries outside Ireland?how long did the applicant reside in the previous country before coming or returning to Ireland?are there any remaining ties with his/her former country of residence?"Later, in the context of determining the applicant's main centre of interest, the Guidelines say:". . . . . . a person who previously lived in another country or countries may now have moved to Ireland on a permanent basis and established a main centre of interest here. For example, a person who has retired from missionary or other service abroad and has chosen to resettle in Ireland should be considered to have his/her main centre of interest here."The Guidelines are kept under constant review to ensure that they give clear guidance to deciding officers in dealing with the relevant issues and are updated or amended as the need arises.  Every notice of disallowance sets out the claimant's rights to request a review of the decision or to lodge an appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office. These options allow every claimant the opportunity to produce additional evidence in support of their case, and to have any error of judgment addressed appropriately.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	883	The back to education allowance (BTEA) scheme is a second chance educational opportunities scheme for people on welfare payments who wish to participate in full time education and who would not otherwise be able to do so. Participation is open to recipients of a range of welfare payments, including Jobseekers, One Parent Family, Disability, Illness and Caring schemes. The allowance is paid at a standard weekly rate equivalent to the maximum rate of the social welfare payment that qualifies the applicant for the scheme. It is not means-tested and income from part-time work while on the back to education allowance does not affect the basic payment. In addition, an annual cost of education allowance of €500 is payable.In order to qualify for participation, an applicant must be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for 3 months if pursuing a second level course or 12 months if pursuing a third level course. This is extended to 2 years in the case of Illness Benefit. The qualifying period for access to third level courses is reduced to 9 months for those who are participating in the National Employment Action Plan process or engaging with the Department's facilitator programme. People who are awarded statutory redundancy may access the scheme immediately, provided an entitlement to a relevant social welfare payment is established prior to commencing an approved course of study. In general, an applicant must be at least 21 years of age prior to commencing an approved course of study. However, lone parents and recipients of jobseekers payments who are out of formal education for at least 2 years can qualify at 18 years of age.At present, participants in the BTEA are eligible to apply for a maintenance grant under the schemes administered by the Department of Education and Science. However, it was decided to discontinue this practice as it represented a duplication of income support payments. Students currently in receipt of both the BTEA and the maintenance grant will continue to be eligible for both payments for the duration of their current course provided they meet the terms and conditions of the scheme. From September 2010, all new applicants who are in receipt of the back to education allowance will be ineligible for student support maintenance grants. The cost of the student services charge and any fees payable to colleges will continue to be met under existing criteria, for eligible students, by the Exchequer on their behalf. Students should apply for these supports to their assessing authority in the usual way.

This Directive was transposed into Irish law through the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992, (Ambient Air Quality Assessment and Management) Regulations, 1999.   Under further regulations made in 2002, 2004 and 2009, specific ambient air quality standards have been prescribed for the following pollutants:sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and oxides of nitrogen, particulate matter and lead (2002);carbon monoxide and benzene (2002);ozone (2004); andpolyaromatic hydrocarbons, arsenic, nickel, cadmium and mercury in ambient air (2009).Where the indicative level for any pollutant is exceeded, the Air Quality Standards Regulations 2002 require the local authority concerned, following notification by the EPA, to develop a long-term air quality management plan to ensure compliance with the thresholds for the relevant pollutant or pollutants.  The EPA reports the results of the air quality monitoring of the above pollutants through its website: http://www.epa.ie/whatwedo/monitoring/air/data/. My Department keeps these data under ongoing review to identify any significant trends which might emerge and also meets periodically with the EPA on air quality issues.The EPA also publishes a comprehensive annual report on air quality, the most recent being the report on Air Quality in Ireland 2008 (September 2009). This report provides an overview of ambient air quality trends in Ireland in 2008 based on data from 30 monitoring stations and a further 18 stations operated by local authorities to measure black smoke. The Report confirmed that air quality was generally good at monitoring stations throughout the country, with pollution levels in larger cities highest at traffic influenced sites but highest in smaller urban areas due to the burning of coal and solid fuels. All monitored levels met required EU and national standards.As part of a commitment on monitoring air quality made under the 2007 Programme for Government my Department requested the EPA to undertake an overall review of the adequacy of the air quality monitoring network in light of population change in urban areas.   The review has now been completed and a report of its findings is currently being finalised by the EPA.

An Interdepartmental Task Force, chaired by my Department, has been established to bring the project to an orderly conclusion and to oversee disposal of the equipment and termination of storage arrangements.  To date, the Task Force has met three times, and it aims to complete its work as soon as possible.In considering options for disposal of the equipment, the priority is to pursue the most economically advantageous approach, with a view to achieving the maximum recovery of cost possible in the circumstances, consistent with environmental and other obligations.  Detailed consideration of all relevant factors is underway to inform the manner in which disposal of the machines will be effected.  This includes contact with the original suppliers of the machines.  Pending completion of arrangements for the disposal of the machines, the website, www.electronicvoting.ie is still operational to assist in this process.  It is anticipated that the website will be taken off-line when this process is complete.The design and development costs for the website in 2004 were €40,257.  The annual cost in 2009 in respect of hosting the website, including domain name registration, was €1,881.

Under the registration system, quarry operators were required to supply full details of their operations to the planning authorities by 27 April 2005.  Following registration, a planning authority could impose conditions on the operation of a pre-October 1964 quarry or could require such a quarry to apply for planning permission and submit an Environmental Impact Statement in certain circumstances.  Authorities could also restate, modify or add to conditions on the operation of a quarry which had received planning permission more than 5 years before the commencement of section 261.I intend to bring forward committee stage amendments to the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2009 to address certain difficulties in relation to section 261 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, which made provision for registration and imposition of controls on quarries.

My colleague, the Minster for Housing and Local Services, held a meeting in August 2009 with representatives of the organisation referred to in regard to Part 3 of the Act, in particular the technical assessment process.  Part 3 of the Act provides for registration of the title of "Architect".The Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland (RIAI), which is designated as registration body for Architects under the Building Control Act 2007, has established an Admissions Board and a Technical Assessment Board so that the registration process may commence in the near future.  The RIAI has appointed architects to the boards and I have appointed the Chairpersons and non-architect majority to both boards.  I am currently examining a submission from the RIAI on all registration fees under the Act and I hope to reach a decision on that submission shortly.Section 14 of the Act sets out the eligibility criteria for registration in the statutory register of architects. Section 21 of the Act provides for the establishment of the Technical Assessment Board which will set out the criteria for assessment and consider applications for registration from persons who have been practising architecture for a minimum period of 10 years in the State.  Section 22 sets out the procedures for the operation of the Technical Assessment Board.The Act provides for an appeal against a decision of the Technical Assessment Board to an Appeals Board which will be appointed shortly.  The Appeals Board will also have an independent Chairperson and a majority of lay members. There is ultimately an appeal to the High Court against a decision of the Appeals Board or any other Board or Committee.Once statutory registration has formally commenced it will be an offence under sections 18 (1)(a) and 18(1)(d) of the Act  to use the title of "Architect" unless registered on the statutory register.  However, those sections will not apply(i) where a person has applied for registration to either the Admissions Board or the Technical Assessment Board and where a decision has not been made on the application;(ii) where a decision is awaited on an appeal to the Appeals Board against a decision of either Board referred to, or(iii) where a decision is awaited on an appeal to the High Court against a decision of the Appeals Board, subject to the requirement that the application for registration to the Admissions Board or the Technical Assessment Board, or the  appeal to either the Appeals Board or the High Court, has not been withdrawn.

This Bill provides for the restructuring of the management of the inland fisheries sector, including the establishment of Inland Fisheries Ireland, a single authority which will replace the existing Central Fisheries Board and seven Regional Fisheries Boards.I assume the Deputy is referring to the appointment of an angler representative to the board of Inland Fisheries Ireland.  As I stated in my second stage speech on the Bill, I am determined that Inland Fisheries Ireland will be led by a small, focused board that is to deliver on the full potential of the sector and which will have a high-level focus on corporate governance.  In light of this, the Bill provides that potential appointees to the nine member board must have specified experience of or have shown capacity in one or more of a number of areas including recreational fisheries.Complementing this high-level board focus and in recognition of the need for and the value of stakeholder, including angler, participation in inland fisheries, provision has been made in the Bill for the establishment of a national inland fisheries forum.  It is envisaged that this will facilitate input by local stakeholders into the work of Inland Fisheries Ireland.  I also expect Inland Fisheries Ireland to establish effective communication channels to give local interests an opportunity to influence policies and how they are implemented at a local level.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	918	Trade in certain tropical timber products is regulated under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora — (CITES for short).  In Ireland the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government issue CITES permits — the authorisation to import such timber.  For all other timber and timber products there is no statutory obligation on procurers of such products to ensure that they are legally sourced.The EU Action Plan for Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) proposed a package of measures to support international efforts to tackle the problem of illegal logging and associated trade.  The EU is currently negotiating Voluntary Partnership Agreements (VPA) with timber producing countries, which put a legally binding obligation on the parties to implement a licensing scheme and to regulate trade in timber and timber products.  The VPA with the Republic of Ghana has now been completed and approved and is expected to be operational by the end of this year. A further VPA with the Republic of the Congo has been completed and awaits Council approval. The FLEGT licensing scheme is expected to be fully operational in Congo by mid-2011. A number of other VPAs are now close to completion with progress being made in negotiations with other third countries. My Department is currently making preparations for the implementation and enforcement of VPA agreements under FLEGT Regulations (EC) No 2173/2005 and implementing Regulation (EC) No. 1024/2008.In tandem with the FLEGT negotiations, the European Commission introduced a proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down the obligations of operators who place timber and timber products on the market.   The main objective of the Regulation is to complement and underpin the EU's current policy framework and support the international fight against illegal logging and its related trade.  It aims to ensure that only timber products that have been produced in accordance with the national legislation of the producing country enter the Community.  The Regulation will place an onus on operators who place timber and timber products on the EU market for the first time to minimise the risk, through the use of due diligence systems, of such timber products coming from illegal sources.  Negotiations on the final text of this draft Regulation are at an advanced stage of negotiation between the Council and Parliament.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	921	Under Regulation (EC) No. 998/2003 on the animal health requirements applicable to the movement of pet animals there is free movement of pets (dogs, cats and ferrets) between Ireland and the UK, a rabies free zone.  Apart from exports to the UK, all dogs exported from Ireland, both commercial and non-commercial, must be accompanied by a pet passport. This passport is issued by my Department on foot of identification micro-chipping by the Private Veterinary Practitioner (PVP).  Almost 5,000 passports were issued during 2009, the vast majority for pet (non-commercial) dogs and cats.  The PVP subsequently completes sections in the passport concerning rabies vaccination and, in the case of commercial exports, health and fitness to travel, after which the animal concerned may be moved at a time to be decided by the owner.  As the official documentation required for moving both pet dogs and commercial dogs is the pet passport, my Department has no specific information on the number of dogs exported from Ireland for commercial purposes.

At primary level posts have been allocated to schools that had increased enrolments in the current school year and which, as a result of last year's pupil-teacher ratio change, lost out on a teaching post in this year by either one, two or three pupils.  My Department has contacted the schools in question and in the interest of transparency the list of schools has also been published on my Department's website.  A list of the primary schools as sought by the Deputy is attached.The list will be fully completed when the 30 September 2009 enrolment returns are received from the remaining schools that have not yet submitted them to my Department.

These projects, through a variety of programmes and activities, seek, in the main, to encourage young people not to engage in drug-taking.  My Department originally took on responsibility for funding these projects through a mainstreaming process, whereby projects on interim funding were assigned to a number of departments and State agencies.  Thirty five of the projects are administered by the three VECs in Dublin City, Dublin County and in Dún Laoghaire, while the remaining three projects are funded directly by my Department.  Arising from Budget 2010, it was decided that funding for these projects was to be reduced from €3,643,000 in 2009 to €2,461,000 in 2010 and to cease from 2011.  I acknowledge the difficulties arising for projects and my Department is currently reviewing the implications of this decision for the individual projects concerned.

If an individual applicant considers that she/he has been unjustly refused a maintenance grant, or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, she/he may appeal, in the first instance, to the relevant local authority or VEC.Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the assessing authority, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in her/his case, an appeal form outlining the position may be submitted by the applicant to my Department.  Support may be available through the Student Assistance Fund which is designed to assist students who, having commenced a third-level course, experience financial hardship that may render them unable to continue their third-level studies.  Information on the Fund is available from the Access Officer at the candidate's College.
