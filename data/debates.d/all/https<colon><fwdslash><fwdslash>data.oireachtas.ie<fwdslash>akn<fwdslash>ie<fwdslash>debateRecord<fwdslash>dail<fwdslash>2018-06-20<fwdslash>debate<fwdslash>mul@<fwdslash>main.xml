            <p eId="para_3">This question relates to affordable housing. At budget 2018 last October, we were told that a cost rental pilot project would be delivered this year and €25 million would be made available for Ó Cualann-type affordable home schemes delivered through local authorities. We were also told that €200 million for the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, would deliver genuinely affordable homes throughout the State. In addition, the Government made a significant announcement of €750 million funding for Home Building Finance Ireland. Will the Minister update the House on the progress of these schemes and indicate if any housing units will be delivered for affordable rent or sale through the schemes in this calendar year?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EoghanMurphy" as="#Minister_for_Housing,_Planning_and_Local_Government" eId="spk_2">
            <from>Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government<recordedTime time="2018-06-20T10:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_4">I propose to take Questions Nos. 25 and 26 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5"> Under the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, the Government's commitment to an ambitious delivery agenda for social housing is clear and substantial progress continues to be made to expand the social housing programme significantly from a virtual standstill position a number of years ago.</p>
            <p eId="para_6"> As Minister, I have been clear that we also need to address issues of housing affordability, recognising the pressures that exist for low to middle-income households, particularly in Dublin and certain other of our main urban centres. To underpin progress in this area, I have commenced the relevant provisions of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, the effect of which is to place the new scheme for affordable purchase on a statutory footing.  From engagements with the local authorities in Dublin, the wider greater Dublin area and Cork and Galway cities, their initial estimates suggest they have lands with the potential to deliver some 4,000 new affordable homes.  My Department is continuing to work with the key local authorities and the Housing Agency to identify sites which would see the level of ambition increase to at least 10,000 new affordable homes from local authority owned land. That analysis is progressing well.  </p>
            <p eId="para_7"> I am determined that cost rental housing will become a major part of our rental landscape in the future. It is clear that there is a gap between social housing and the rental market that needs to be filled, making a sustainable impact on housing affordability, national competitiveness, and the attractiveness of our main urban centres as places to live and work.</p>
            <p eId="para_8"> The Housing Agency, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and a number of approved housing bodies, AHBs, have been working to get our first cost rental pilot, at Enniskerry Road, ready for tenders to issue shortly. In parallel, Dublin City Council, my Department and the National Development Finance Agency are undertaking detailed modelling and financial appraisal on a major site, at St. Michael’s Estate in Inchicore, to assess its suitability for a significant cost rental development. The work of that multidisciplinary team is progressing well and should be concluded shortly.   </p>
            <p eId="para_9"> To support local authorities in getting their sites ready for affordable housing, I have decided to provide additional funding for enabling infrastructure via the serviced sites fund.  Given that housing related infrastructure will now be able to avail of funding under the €2 billion urban regeneration and development fund, I am redirecting the €50 million funding for phase 2 of the local infrastructure housing activation fund to the serviced sites fund, increasing the scale of the fund from the previously announced €25 million to €75 million.  When local authority co-funding is included, an overall minimum investment of €100 million will be provided to those sites that require infrastructural investment in order for them to be brought into use for affordable housing.  To drive early activity, I will invite applications for funding under the serviced sites fund by the end of next week.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EoinOBroin" eId="spk_3">
            <from>Deputy Eoin Ó Broin<recordedTime time="2018-06-20T10:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_10">The short answer to my question is that not a single unit will be delivered this year for affordable rental or affordable purchase under any Government scheme. While I welcome the commitment with regard to St. Michael's estate, the cost rental pilot has been in the pipeline since Deputy Alan Kelly was Minister. Not only has the pilot in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown not been delivered, but we hear the homes will not be made available at an affordable rate. The Minister referred to funding of €25 million. Surely it would have been straightforward to put the scheme in place at the start of this year. The scheme has not been established and there have been no discussions about it with the joint committee.</p>
            <p eId="para_11"> On the €750 million to be provided through Home Building Finance Ireland, the relevant legislation was only published this week and will take some time to get through the House. As such, the funding will not become available until next year at the earliest. Probably worst of all is the position in respect of the local infrastructure housing activation fund, for which the Minister has given us figures. The average price of a LIHAF house on private land in Dublin is €318,000 based on 2017 prices. Given that these houses will not be ready for two years, we may factor in house price inflation of between 10% and 20%. Similar, albeit slightly lower, figures apply in the rest of the country and there are no guarantees that housing built on public land will be affordable.</p>
            <p eId="para_12"> The Minister keeps telling us about future announcements and projects but we do not have any clear sense of homes being delivered at prices of between €170,000 and €260,000, which is the level of genuine affordability.</p>
            <p eId="para_13">There is no commitment in regard to delivery this year. Will the Minister commit to the delivery of genuinely affordable rental or purchase homes in 2019?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EoghanMurphy" eId="spk_4" as="#Minister_for_Housing,_Planning_and_Local_Government">
            <from>Deputy Eoghan Murphy<recordedTime time="2018-06-20T10:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_14">I thank the Deputy for his question. It is important to note that the problems we are facing in the housing sector were 15 years in the making and they cannot be fixed in two years. However, we are seeing some interesting developments in the housing market. For example, house prices were still falling in 2012 and while they are dramatically increasing again, they are still 21% below the peak of 2007. There are still a number of people in very difficult circumstances in terms of negative equity. In the first four months of this year, there has been a slowdown in price increases. If this trend continues this year, there will be single digit price growth this year, which is a welcome development.</p>
            <p eId="para_15"> We started with social housing because we have to look after our most vulnerable people. Rebuilding Ireland sets out the ambitious plan of the provision of 47,000 - now 50,000 - homes using the €6 billion funding made available. At the same time, we recommenced building in the private sector. Last year, 14,500 homes were built, which is very welcome. Many commentators and bodies had underestimated the level of building. This year, the stock of social housing will increase by approximately 7,900 new homes. I have signed the commencement order which means that in the next four weeks, working with the local authorities and the joint Oireachtas committee, work can commence on the regulations in terms of access to the affordable schemes and on designation of the lands to be used for these schemes. In light of the additional €50 million, we now have a much bigger fund for affordable purchase homes. I hope to see affordable purchase homes delivered this year. Provision of 4,000 homes is our minimum ambition from local authority land only.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EoinOBroin" eId="spk_5">
            <from>Deputy Eoin Ó Broin<recordedTime time="2018-06-20T10:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_16">If the Minister brings proposals to the committee we will work constructively with him on them. We have been told, for example, that 550 affordable homes would be delivered in the Poolbeg strategic development zone. The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government was helpful in assisting Dublin City Council and councillors in the community in getting that target. However, I am told by the residents that there is no clarity as to whether these houses will be genuinely affordable. In other words, will they be priced at somewhere between €170,000 and €260,000? The concern is that the benchmark in Dublin of €320,000 will become the Government's definition of affordability, which even with the Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme is not going to be accessible because, as we know from the figures we have today, people looking to buy homes through that loan scheme cannot get sufficient loans. Does the Government believe affordable rental or purchase homes will be delivered next year? If the answer is "No", the Minister needs to say that and tell us they will be delivered the following year.</p>
            <p eId="para_17"> A sum of €25 million has been made available for Ó Cualann-type developments. We know the specifics of the Ó Cualann scheme. We needed only to issue a direction to the local authorities in Dublin on the basis of existing legislation and that money could have been used this year. The Minister is telling us now that he intends to engage with us on the matter and that, perhaps, something will happen before the end of the year. This means the money announced for expenditure this year will not be spent until next year. When will affordable rental and purchase homes be delivered and at what price will those two forms of housing be delivered?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EoghanMurphy" eId="spk_6" as="#Minister_for_Housing,_Planning_and_Local_Government">
            <from>Deputy Eoghan Murphy<recordedTime time="2018-06-20T10:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_18">This is about building Ó Cualann-type housing at scale. To do this, I have increased the amount of money available from €25 million to €75 million, plus €25 million from the local authorities. Some of this money will be drawn down this year to meet the cost of site preparation works. I hope to see some affordable purchase homes accessed this year but we will certainly have affordable purchase scheme homes accessed next year.</p>
            <p eId="para_19"> On affordability and the Poolbeg development, taking into account the Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme, the help-to-buy scheme and the affordable home purchase scheme, houses will be affordable. We will provide a maximum of €40,000 per home on a site and the local authority will then work out the land cost in that regard and, if determined to be €30,000, this would equate to a knock-down on the price of €70,000 which, depending on the area, would be quite significant. It could be more than that. Each local authority will have to do a study and decide what needs to be done. As a result of the knock-down price, the local authority will take an equity stake in the house with the person buying it, which will be resolved over a number of years but not in the first five years. As a result of this, we can then maintain a rolling fund to ensure we are always building affordable purchase homes to ensure that in the next economic crisis we will not have to shut down any provisions around affordability and so on. This is about Ó Cualann at scale. Cost rental is not as simple as some people try to make out. What one is trying to build into a cost rental scheme is a guarantee that the management costs, life cycle costs and build and maintenance costs will not be such that the type of cost inflation linked to rent increases will not have to be changed at any time in a future cycle.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#DarraghOBrien" eId="spk_7">
            <from>Deputy Darragh O'Brien<recordedTime time="2018-06-20T10:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_20">My question is about the commencement of an affordable home purchase scheme, to which the Minister responded, in part, in his response to Deputy Ó Broin. The Minister also mentioned that we cannot fix this problem in two years. However, this problem has been around for almost eight years. My concern is around when an affordable home purchase scheme will commence. The Minister indicated he had signed the commencement order for the affordable scheme, which I welcome. When will the regulations be introduced? On 17 May, I brought a motion to the House dealing with the commencement of an affordable housing scheme and it was voted down. We need this scheme urgently. The additional €50 million is welcome but the €25 million already in place equates to approximately 400 units. If the target is 400 affordable purchase units, the €25 million equates to about €16,000 per site. I am not sure if that would actually make a dent in affordability. How far down the line is the Minister with regard to the regulations for an affordable home scheme and setting the parameters for the scheme in terms of income thresholds and who will be eligible to apply?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EoghanMurphy" eId="spk_8" as="#Minister_for_Housing,_Planning_and_Local_Government">
            <from>Deputy Eoghan Murphy<recordedTime time="2018-06-20T10:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_21">This crisis is not eight years in the making. House prices were still falling in 2012. The affordability scheme was stood down because there was no affordability issue in the country at that time. We exited the bailout in 2014. In 2016, the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government put in place Rebuilding Ireland, a dedicated Ministry and, for the first time, ring-fenced funding to restore the housing sector but in such a way that we would not repeat the mistakes of the past. As part of this process, local authorities were tasked with building social housing rather than outsourcing same to the private sector and we also removed some of the obstacles to private sector building. We are now addressing the issue of affordability. I refer the Deputy to the example I gave to Deputy Ó Broin. If a €40,000 subvention is provided by the Department to a local authority for site works and the local authority then estimates the land value at €30,000 or €40,000, this means €80,000 would come off the price of a house. If the market price for that house is €320,000 or €350,000, there would be a significant drop in the price of that house and it would be affordable.</p>
            <p eId="para_22"> On eligibility, similar to the undertakings in the Rebuilding Ireland home loan, an individual earning a gross income of €50,000 or a couple earning a gross income of €75,000 will be eligible for the scheme. Each local authority will have to run a lottery scheme in its area as each scheme comes online.</p>
            <p eId="para_23"> On the regulations, next week I will put out a call to local authorities for the sites on which they want to utilise this fund. They have already identified the sites and there will now be a formal process of them identifying to me the ten key areas where affordability pressure is greatest. A great deal of work has been done on the regulations as well. The Act prescribes what can and cannot be done. I will be writing to the joint committee this week seeking its input on some of the parameters. We can do this in the next four weeks. The local authorities know this money is available and they are doing the necessary work around their sites.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#DarraghOBrien" eId="spk_9">
            <from>Deputy Darragh O'Brien<recordedTime time="2018-06-20T10:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_24">I welcome the clarity. I am glad the Minister is at last moving to develop regulations to establish the scheme. However, I am still unclear about the site selection process and the income thresholds. The Minister stated the income thresholds will be similar to those that apply under the Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme. Couples in Dublin, Galway and Cork earning €70,000 or €80,000 per annum cannot purchase houses now. They are the people who are paying €1,600, €1,800 and 2,000 per month in rent and thus unable to save for a deposit. There must be flexibility in the thresholds. There are some people in this House who believe that a couple earning €80,000 or €90,000 per annum are loaded but they are not. These are the couples who are paying rent, childcare costs and so on. We should all work together to establish a scheme that works and to do so quickly.</p>
            <p eId="para_25"> On the Minister's point that we had to do social housing first and he is now moving to affordable housing, we have not done social housing yet. In terms of expectation, will this scheme be up and running before the summer and is the Minister open to looking at regional affordability? As wage levels differ across the country we will need different thresholds in terms of affordability. The greater Dublin area may have a different regional affordability than the midlands or Ulster. We need to have flexibility to ensure no cohort of people is locked out of home ownership which, at 69%, is now the lowest it has been in generations. I do not want a generation of people condemned to a rip-off rental market.</p>

            <p eId="para_26">Home ownership rates have decreased for a variety of reasons. For example, people are staying longer in education, households are forming later in life, smaller households are forming and people are more mobile in where they work and how they live. We need to ensure that owning a home continues to be an aspiration for many people and that we can provide for it.</p>
            <p eId="para_27">In the first quarter of the year we saw a 35% increase in house sales on the figure for last year. There is activity in the market. Housing has to be affordable in order that people can access the market. The average house sale price in Dublin in the past 12 months was €360,000. The median price, when irregular sales which can be very expensive or very cheap are excluded, was €330,000. That speaks to an affordability problem. A couple, both of whom are earning over €50,000, will be able to afford these prices, but it will be difficult for those on less money. When one takes the 10% deposit requirement, the help-to-buy scheme and the Rebuilding Ireland home loan together, not even all three factored in together would enable someone to reach those prices. In Galway the average house sale price is €169,000. Therefore, there is not as much of an affordability issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_35">Question No. 24 was my first priority question, for those in the Irish League of Credit Unions who may be watching proceedings. I want to ask the Minister about the progress made or lack thereof in the development of a special purpose vehicle. For almost five years the credit unions have been advocating utilising about €10 billion worth of assets for investment in the social good, but not one cent of that money has been used to date. The Central Bank announced on 1 February this year that it had granted approval and changed regulations to diversify the classes of investments for credit unions which can play a really big role in investing in social and affordable housing. When will the special purpose vehicle be set up to allow credit unions to invest in social and affordable housing?</p>

            <p eId="para_36">The Government's Rebuilding Ireland: Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness emphasises the need to look at new ways of funding social housing delivery, in particular, the need to provide structural, funding and policy supports to increase delivery of social housing by approved housing bodies. Against that background, credit union representative bodies put forward proposals for how credit unions could provide loan finance for approved housing bodies for social housing. In February, following the publication of a consultation paper and a period of consultation, the Registrar of Credit Unions who is responsible for regulatory oversight of credit unions amended the regulations to allow credit unions to invest in tier 3 approved housing bodies under certain conditions. Tier 3 approved housing bodies are the larger ones.</p>
            <p eId="para_37"> In May 2017 my Department announced that funding of €49,000 would be provided for the Irish Council for Social Housing, ICSH, to support an initiative through which it would develop proposals for special purpose vehicles and a mechanism that would enable the sector to attract investment in social housing projects from potential investors, including the credit union movement. Work has been ongoing between the ICSH, a number of larger tier 3 approved housing bodies and their financial advisers on the development of such a vehicle, taking account also of the recent EUROSTAT decision on the reclassification of the approved housing bodies sector. The ICSH anticipates that this work should be completed in the third quarter of the year. My Department and I have met the credit union movement on a number of occasions to discuss its wish to invest in social housing. The Department has also facilitated engagement between the credit union sector and the ICSH with a view to encouraging links between the two sectors and allowing credit unions to share the benefits of the work under way.</p>
            <p eId="para_38"> While it remains the case that the development of specific special purpose vehicles to enable the credit unions to make investments in the sector is a matter credit unions have to resolve, my Department will continue to be available to engage with the sector, as required.</p>

            <p eId="para_39">On 27 February the Irish League of Credit Unions met departmental officials shortly after the Central Bank had given its approval for the diversification of the classes of investments. We understand it applies to tier 3 approved housing bodies. There is €700 million available to be invested that could be invested in the provision of about 5,000 homes. The Minister is talking about the third quarter. When will the regulated investment vehicle set out in the credit union regulations be established? Are we setting a target date? When will the special prupose vehicle be set up? I know that work is ongoing on it. The Minister is saying it will be completed in the third quarter. The Department had originally told the Irish League of Credit Unions it would be ready in June or September to receive the investments. Are we still working towards it being ready in September? I hope we are. I noted the Minister's comments earlier in the week. I welcome the discussions he is having with the European Investment Bank on investing in social housing. It is something I welcome. There is €10 billion available in Ireland in the credit union sector, with €700 million ready to be used. Discussions with the European Investment Bank are great, but there is Irish finance available for community good. Will the Minister give me a target date for when he wants the special purpose vehicle to be established and up and running?</p>

            <p eId="para_40">It is very important as we resolve the housing crisis that we look to new finance vehicles. The Deputy is absolutely correct to emphasise the role the credit union sector can play. There are also a number of funds we are looking to get involved in the provision of social and affordable housing. We can leverage these streams of funding to make sure we put secure housing in place and at less cost to the taxpayer. That is why when we talk about housing delivery, it is very different from 30 or 40 years ago. There are different streams we can use to maximise value for the taxpayer, while also securing homes for people. We have to be very careful with the credit union sector as it went through its own difficulties during the financial crisis. We have to recognise that regulation of the credit union movement is a matter for the Central Bank, with which we do not want to interfere. It was a very welcome decision when it stated tier 3 approved housing bodies could receive funding from the credit union movement. It is a substantial amount of money, at just under €700 million. There are two classes of credit unions that could become involved. We are aiming for September to have clarity on the special purpose vehicle. We have to be careful in the Department because we cannot get directly involved with an approved housing body and a credit union. It is for the Irish Council for Social Housing to work with the innovative funding available to put the special purpose vehicle in place. The third quarter of this year is the deadline to which we are working in having clarity on the matter and moving forward to leverage the investment.</p>

            <p eId="para_41">I appreciate the Minister's answer, but I am not sure for what clarity we are looking. The Central Bank has given its approval. This is about establishing the investment vehicle. The Minister has mentioned that we need to be careful with the credit unions because of their past history, but the Central Bank has given its approval for this form of investment. Therefore, no clarity is needed. The Department allocated funding to work with PwC to establish the special purpose vehicle. Establishment of the special purpose vehicle is needed to accept finance from credit unions to invest in tier 3 approved housing bodies. The Minister may want to advise separately on the need for clarification. If there are outstanding matters that need to be clarified, the credit union sector needs to be so advised. I certainly need to be so advised. There is an absolute desire for the credit unions for the common and community good to become involved in building social and affordable housing and investing in approved housing bodies, but we are dragging our feet. I am asking what clarification is needed. If the Minister is saying September, does it mean that the special purpose vehicle will be set up and established and that the credit unions will be able to start to invest from September? Is that what the Minister's response means?</p>

            <p eId="para_44">Phase 3 is about the technical work required to put together a special purpose vehicle. It is not simple to put a special purpose vehicle together. There are a number of technical requirements. It has been indicated to me that further clarification will come from the approved housing bodies to my Department on how exactly they can do it. We have to bear in mind the separate work happening in the Department of Finance on EUROSTAT's decision on reclassification. What we have said is that it will not stand in the way of delivering the houses we need to deliver through the approved housing body sector under Rebuilding Ireland, but that does not mean that it is a straightforward question as to how exactly the finance will be secured in terms of the balance sheet. It is technical work and there are further questions coming from the approved housing bodies. It will be up to particular approved housing bodies working with particular credit unions to put a special purpose vehicle in place. They will be in a position to do so from the third quarter of the year when the final step is completed. If they choose to enter into an arrangement, because there are other finance houses looking to undertake jobs with approved housing bodies, they will be able to do so from that point on.</p>

            <p eId="para_46">Is it not time to admit that Rebuilding Ireland is failing disastrously? Wexford and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Councils which are not controlled by the left have both passed motions to the effect that Rebuilding Ireland is failing. The reliance on the private sector has been exposed. The Minister's figures for private sector completions are not accurate. There is far less coming from that sector than the Minister had hoped. The delivery of public housing is pathetic. Last year 1,058 local authority houses were delivered and the target next year is 5,900. Only God knows if it will be met, but I would say it is unlikely. It is just not good enough. It is not working. Is it not time, therefore, to take a different approach and have an emergency programme of public and affordable housing on our own land?</p>

            <p eId="para_47">Developing the State landbank for housing is a key priority. Importantly, we have large sites in Dublin, Cork and other key urban areas where housing and homelessness pressures are greatest. We now have a good picture of all local authority residential lands and authorities have well-developed plans for many of their sites. This is backed by €6 billion in Exchequer funding, and significant progress is being made in ramping up the social housing programme. At the end of 2017, there were 13,400 social housing homes in the construction programme, up substantially on the 8,500 homes in the programme just a year earlier, and this continues to grow weekly.</p>
            <p eId="para_48"> In addition, the local authorities in Dublin are bringing forward major sites for mixed tenure development such as the 900 homes at Kilcarbery in Clondalkin, where procurement will be finalised in the autumn, and O’Devaney Gardens, a 600 unit site in the city council area where the procurement process is moving into the competitive dialogue stage and should be finalised in early 2019. Proposals for other key sites across Dublin are also being developed.</p>
            <p eId="para_49"> As I indicated in my reply to earlier questions, I have commenced the statutory provisions for the new affordable purchase scheme. Early indications from key local authorities have identified lands for 4,000 affordable homes and we are working to increase this ambition to 10,000 homes from local authority lands only. To support local authorities to get their sites ready for affordable housing, I am providing, via the serviced sites fund, increased funding of €75 million for enabling infrastructure. I will be inviting applications under the fund by the end of next week.</p>

            <p eId="para_50">In my area, there is nothing happening in Shanganagh. We have been demanding for about five years that public and affordable housing be built there. There has still not been a sod turned. There is also nothing happening in St. Michael's Estate, on the Oscar Traynor Road site or in Clonburris. People have been calling for public housing for years on all of these big sites but there is still nothing happening. Part of the problem is the affordable housing issue, the Minister's failure to define what that is and to guarantee that money will be made available to make affordable housing genuinely affordable.</p>
            <p eId="para_51"> I did not understand the Minister's earlier answer. Is the affordable housing on these schemes going to be affordable based on income or is it going to be linked to the market? If it is going to be linked to the market, it is not going to be affordable, certainly not in my area. Shanganagh cannot move forward until the council there knows that the Minister is going to provide the funds to make that genuinely affordable. If he is not going to do that, then we should just build council houses and stop messing around with all of these things that he has failed to define.</p>

            <p eId="para_52">I thank the Deputy for the question. If there was a difficulty in the response Deputy Boyd Barrett heard, that was because of a difficulty in the question. It flies in the face of reality. This crisis is 15 years in the making. This Government has put together a €6 billion war chest to fix our housing sector under Rebuilding Ireland and to fix it in a way so that we do not make the mistakes made in the past.</p>
            <p eId="para_53"> Motions passed by councils do not build houses. Local authorities seeking funding from this Department, using their landbanks and engaging with builders is what builds houses, and that is what is happening throughout the country. Deputy Boyd Barrett does not want to see that but that is what is happening. There were 2,200 or 2,400 social housing homes built last year. That was a threefold increase on the previous year. We will build 3,800 this year between local authorities and housing bodies and roughly another 500 to 600 from the Part V commitments. That is a doubling of social housing homes being built on local authority land again this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_54"> I provided an additional €50 million for local authorities to bring forward their landbanks for affordable homes. We know we need affordable homes because we have acute affordability pressures, particularly in those ten local authorities that we know of in Dublin and the greater Dublin area, Cork city and Galway city. That will work with designated income criteria for accessing the affordable purchase scheme. We will also provide, roughly, depending on the site, €30,000 to €40,000 per home as a discount. The local authority will decide what the land value is, that will be a further discount that will come off the price of the house and that will make it affordable.</p>

            <p eId="para_55">Nothing is happening in my area. I mentioned four other sites around Dublin where nothing is happening on public land. Do not tell me that is because I do not want to see success. I can see that nothing is happening in Shanganagh, in Cherrywood, on the Oscar Traynor Road site, in Clonburris or in St. Michael's Estate. We can go through the list.</p>
            <p eId="para_56"> What the Minister just said about affordability is very worrying. It is about the income level at which a person can apply for an affordable house, but it also raises the question of the point in applying for an affordable house that is not affordable. Average house prices in my area are now €600,000. Private developers are selling the 10% of so-called social housing back to the local authority and are looking for prices of up to €450,000. That is not affordable. Is affordable going to be affordable and will local authorities be guaranteed that money will be made available so that affordable housing on public land will be affordable? If that is not going to be the case, we need to build council housing on those sites.</p>
            <p eId="para_57"> There is not enough money. There is €1.14 billion in capital spending for social housing this year. According to the Minister's targets, that is going to deliver 5,900 houses. It is not enough. We need a minimum of 10,000 council houses a year. The budget is going to have to be doubled to get close to addressing the extent of the housing crisis and to begin to make an impact on the figure of 144,000 on the housing lists.</p>

            <p eId="para_58">This is not a question of money or resources. They are in place. There is a €6 billion ring-fenced fund over the life of the Rebuilding Ireland programme. When I needed an additional €100 million last year, I was able to secure it and that went into homes and emergency accommodation. Last year, when I also went looking for €500 million for Rebuilding Ireland, I was able to secure it so that we could hit the target from the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government of putting 50,000 homes into the social housing stock. That is happening. Work is happening, and the different figures we have tell us that is happening, but not every site can be developed at the same time. Some of the larger sites in Dublin, in particular, are the more difficult sites because they have many legacy issues. Those, however, have been resolved over time and we are now in a position to start work on many of those sites.</p>
            <p eId="para_59"> On a site like St. Michael's, a key site in the city, there is great potential for public housing that could really benefit many people on lower incomes who are locked out of the rental market or the housing market. We want to do that, but if we get it wrong when we do it for the first time at scale, then it will not happen again. We have to make sure that we get it right. I will be in O'Devaney Gardens next week as well because progress is being made on that site. We have a pipeline of works to be done. Housing will be built on these big sites, but on the social housing side of things, there are dramatic increases in house building as well as on the private side. We are now talking about affordability, which is key. This new funding is there and it will deliver it.</p>

            <p eId="para_62">The housing land initiative, HLI, includes the regeneration of a number of significant development sites on lands in the ownership of Dublin City Council, including St. Michael's Estate site in Inchicore. Feasibility studies on the sites, which were presented to and passed by the elected members of Dublin City Council on 9 January 2017, included the council’s agreed optimum mix of 30% social, 20% affordable and 50% private homes on these lands. The studies also agreed the methodology for community consultation. The council is staggering the procurement process for the sites and a project board, including representation from my Department, and individual project teams have been set up and are working to progress the HLI programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_63"> As part of this Government’s reform of the Irish housing system, it is clear that we need a third sector to complement social and private market housing delivery. That is why the development of a new cost rental sector is so strategically important. Delivery of cost rental homes into the market at scale will make a sustainable impact on housing affordability, national competitiveness and the enhancement and liveability of our cities as places to live and work.</p>
            <p eId="para_64"> My Department and I remain committed to working with Dublin City Council and other councils to ensure we make the delivery of this model a reality. To advance this, we are learning from a pilot project in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown and the detailed examination of similar models operating elsewhere. We are also working with the European Investment Bank and other key stakeholders. Dublin City Council, my Department and the National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, have carried out detailed modelling and financial appraisal on the St. Michael's Estate site to assess its suitability for a significant cost rental development. The work of that multidisciplinary team is progressing well and this will be of significant assistance in rolling out a broader cost rental programme across Dublin and certain other large urban areas.</p>

            <p eId="para_65">I am glad to see that there is some progress on this. What is the Minister's thinking on this? The council has to make a key decision on this site, with the community. The regeneration team is looking for 300 houses to be built on the site as a practical reality from a sustainability point of view - 150 local authority houses and 150 on the cost rental model. They have to be taken out of the land initiative. There is general support for that now among the different parties, including Fianna Fáil, Sinn Féin, Independents etc. I believe the council will have an emergency motion soon to take St. Michael's and use it as a pilot scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_66">It is hoped that it will be moved into other local authority, OPW and State lands to tackle the issue of affordability and allowing people access to security of tenure.</p>

            <p eId="para_67">There is much interest in the St. Michael’s site because it provides opportunities to deliver cost rental, affordable homes close to the city centre, close to key infrastructure, such as transport, and close to where people will want to live and work. It can do that in a way where people who are not able to qualify for social housing, but also cannot get access to the private rental market, will then be able to live in a community. We also want to ensure people from the community can live there too.</p>
            <p eId="para_68"> I have met with two different representative groups and have been on the site. Some fantastic work has already happened with Richmond Barracks and Goldenbridge cemetery. There are challenges facing the school in terms of some of the situations in which some of the children find themselves. There are also 52 new living with care homes which have been delivered. Much is happening at the site. There is a great opportunity to provide cost rental accommodation at scale there. That will add further improvements for those people coming to live in the area.</p>
            <p eId="para_69"> However, I have a problem with the level of ambition coming from the community, namely the proposal to limit the development to 300 homes. I have said to the two representative groups that we have a housing shortage and an affordability challenge. These issues are coming together in an acute way in Dublin city. The idea that the St. Michael’s site would only have 300 new homes delivered on it is disappointing. The site can take more public housing and more affordable homes to rent without impacting on the level of ambition for social housing provision. We are working with several different stakeholders to see what exactly that model will look like and what would the affordable rents mean for people moving into these houses.</p>

            <p eId="para_70">Is the Minister saying the public land on St. Michael's Estate will be used for public, cost rental and affordable homes? Will no private housing be built on that site? This is the key point for people in the area. This is public land. It is an asset to the State which can be paid back to the State over the next 30 years if it is set up and delivered properly. I believe it can be. I know there was a proposal for 300 homes in this area. While I accept density is an issue, there is also sustainability within projects which has to be taken on board, as well as amenities and people wanting to live in the area. The residents and the regeneration team will negotiate with the housing officer in Dublin City Council.</p>
            <p eId="para_71"> Will this public land be used for public housing, social and local authority housing, cost rental and affordable homes?</p>

            <p eId="para_72">Every time we talk about fixing our broken housing sector, we talk about doing it in a way that does not make the mistakes of the past. That is why we always talk about a mixture of tenure on any site. It is the right way to go to have social and affordable homes and private homes on the same site. We know on the St. Michael's site that we can accommodate all three with a much greater proportion of social and affordable than had previously been envisaged. That is what we are trying to achieve.</p>
            <p eId="para_73"> In Thornton Hall we already have 74 social housing units. We have to bear that in mind as well. We also have great amenities there. There is a senior citizens’ complex, Richmond Barracks, which I want to go back and look at properly, Goldenbridge cemetery and a sports centre. I want to work with the local community groups so they can see the ambition we have. I do not believe going higher than 300 units will have the type of impact some people fear it will. We can go for a higher density in a way that will provide accommodation for, say, singles or couples starting off a family together. Not every home that we build has to be the same size because people are at different stages of their lives.</p>
            <p eId="para_74"> If we use some of the new design standards which I introduced at the end of last year, we can get more than 300 homes on that site and a greater proportion of affordable cost rental homes. The work we are doing is around the financial model. Can we build something to ensure the rents are affordable, not just tomorrow but for the next 20 years? It is not simple but we can do it because it has been done elsewhere.</p>

            <p eId="para_76">Will the Minister of State outline the possibilities for using online voting for our elections? Will he examine whether this would encourage greater voter participation in our democracy? I met with Albert Royo-Mariné and Gov2U promoting e-democracy across Europe last month. I know the Minister met with him afterwards. Even trialling online voting would be an acceptance of how our younger generations engage and participate in all facets of their lives. Considering bad weather and people going on holidays can depress voter turnout, could technology remove some of these barriers to democratic involvement?</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government<recordedTime time="2018-06-20T11:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_77">There are no proposals to introduce measures to support online voting or to re-introduce e-voting. In February 2000, the then Government decided to introduce a new system of direct vote recording and electronic vote counting at elections. In 2008, a commission reported that e-voting should not continue.</p>
            <p eId="para_78"> I have an open mind on the subject of online voting which is completely different than the e-voting system we had previously. The priorities in the Department are modification and updating of the electoral register, as well as the provision of a facility for online voter registration with a single identifier. It is hoped that work will commence in October 2018. It may take two to three years to complete but it will allow a facility for people to register for voting online. There are 23 different forms which are applicable for a voter registration, such as dealing with change of address, joining the supplementary register of electors and different types of postal votes.</p>
            <p eId="para_79"> I am in constant contact with the eight staff in the franchise section in the Custom House. They are the people who effectively run every election and referendum. Their resources are limited, however. The priorities are the provision of online voter registration and the establishment of an electoral commission. The broader question the Deputy raised on online voting is one that could be legitimately raised if we get to a position of having our electoral register in better order than it is currently.</p>

          <speech by="#ShaneCassells" eId="spk_39">
            <from>Deputy Shane Cassells<recordedTime time="2018-06-20T11:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_80">It was online voting to which I was referring, which is a completely different scenario. If we are talking about updating the register, for all who practise politics, we should be concerned about our democracy and that our system needs modernisation and is secure. There is undoubtedly abuse of our system as it is based on the issuing of voting cards. These can go to addresses where people no longer reside and, in some cases, multiple cards go to one address. An examination of the voter register, especially in the areas of townhouses and apartments, points to this. Tightening this up to eliminate the potential for voter fraud should be uppermost in our minds.</p>
            <p eId="para_81"> I am amazed we can use online activities for every other facet of our lives. The Revenue Commissioners have secure portals for LPT payments, for example. Why can it not be used for this? Up to 14 countries have some form of online voting. Estonia, a small Baltic nation, was the first to introduce permanent national Internet voting. It has gone from 1.9% of votes cast through online voting to nearly 30% in its recent parliamentary elections. Interestingly, it also keeps the simple pencil and paper system.</p>
            <p eId="para_82"> If we are looking at voter registration, there is the potential to look at online voting.</p>

            <p eId="para_83">There is not the potential in terms of the facility that the franchise section has as there are only eight officials working in it.</p>
            <p eId="para_84"> Other Members and other practising politicians consistently raise with me the fact that electoral registers are not as accurate as they could or should be. It has been a political priority for me for the past 12 months to get modernisation of the register moving.</p>
            <p eId="para_85"> Preparation of the scoping document on improvements to the register and proposals for online registration is now well under way and at an advanced stage of drafting. The Government will make a decision on this, hopefully, before the summer break or immediately after the return in the autumn. The proposal is to commence that work nationally before the end of this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_86">I do not want to dampen the Deputy's enthusiasm and I acknowledge that online voting is different from the electronic voting we had previously. However, we should all remember the public backlash against the e-voting system that was introduced. The strong view of general public was that the principle of using a pencil and paper at the ballot box was still valued. That is not to say that as technology improves, we cannot look at online voting. Online registration and improving the register must remain the priority.</p>

            <p eId="para_89">Online voting would make the process of voting for Shane Cassells or anybody else in Meath West even simpler. It would also be a recognition of the reality of the world in which we live. It would help younger people to engage with the democratic process. Young people are accessing information on online portals and there is an opportunity to use the same medium to allow them to vote. If we consistently resist online voting and use experiences from past elections that did not embrace technology in the best way, we will never make progress. The Minister of State said there is an opportunity to improve the electoral register. We should use that opportunity to introduce online voting. As I said, if Estonia, a small Baltic nation with a small population, can embrace this process, as it has since 2005, surely Ireland also has an opportunity to do so. There will be a series of elections next year and we could potentially trial this process in a number of constituencies.</p>

Among the services and support the place finder service can offer is the capacity to pay deposits and advance rental payments to landlords on behalf of households in emergency homeless accommodation or at immediate risk of entering such accommodation in order to secure housing via the HAP scheme. The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection continues to make assistance available to eligible households generally, which are seeking financial support to access rental accommodation. However, in an effort to consolidate homelessness supports within the local government sector, I provided local authorities with the specific capacity to provide this financial support to homeless households.</p>
            <p eId="para_109"> This targeted intervention for homeless households which are finding it difficult to secure HAP tenancies has been in operation in the Dublin region since 2015 and in Cork city since last year. To qualify for these specific additional supports available to homeless households, a household must have been determined by the relevant local authority to be homeless within the meaning of section 2 of the Housing Act 1988. The operation of local homeless services, including the place finder service, is a matter for each local authority, utilising the supports provided through my Department, as I have just outlined. I understand the service will become operational in the Deputy's local authority area next Monday, no doubt as a result of the efforts he has made in this regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_110">The problem is that people were unaware of the announcement made by the Minister in January and the resources to go with it to help people. The Minister is aware that people who are currently homeless are turning up at local authorities seeking an upfront payment or a deposit. There is a question as to what constitutes being homeless. I am dealing with families and individuals who sleep on different couches every night. They are couch-surfing but they are being told they are not regarded as homeless because there is a roof over their head, although it is a different roof every night. There should be clarity between the Department and local authorities on the definition of homelessness. I regard such individuals and families as homeless and I believe most Deputies will agree with me.</p>
            <p eId="para_111"> People also seem to be unaware of the upfront payment when they try to access services. I have checked with the local authority, the community welfare officer and the rents unit about how to access an upfront payment and a deposit to help people to get off the streets, as we all want them to do. The level of awareness in this area is not as good as the Minister and his officials would like it to be. Will they focus on this issue to ensure homeless people who show up at a local authority public counter after finding a property receive every support necessary to allow them to move into a property as quickly as possible?</p>

            <p eId="para_112">I thank the Deputy for his questions. I do not doubt he has done much work in this area and I am well aware he has engaged with my officials for a number of weeks on a couple of cases. The place finder service was only rolled out beyond Dublin and Cork at the beginning of the year. Of the 20 local authorities which requested a place finder service, 17 now have a service in place. The opening of a service in the Deputy's area will bring the number to 18. This is a new measure and its implementation will not always be straightforward in every local authority area. Deputy Ó Broin is aware of cases involving people who sought support at a public counter and were turned away or told they did not have the correct documentation or information. This cases should not occur. As we encounter these problems, we will continue to ensure the local authorities fully understand their obligations and their staff are given the necessary training.</p>
            <p eId="para_113">About €3.6 million will go to emergency accommodation supports in the mid-east region this year. Roughly 350 tenancies will be created each week of the year. We know that it works. We also know that with the homeless housing assistance payment, we prevented more than 1,000 families from having to enter emergency accommodation last year. </p>
            <p eId="para_114"> The Deputy asks an important question about what is homelessness. It is defined in the 1998 Act, but it is very much for the local authority to make the determination within the parameters and criteria set in the Act. One of the reports from the Dublin Region Homeless Executive which was published yesterday speaks to the need for us to address the question of what it is we mean by "homeless". Of course, it is a problem that has come up in the use of section 10 funding in cases in which someone is or is not in emergency accommodation and there are questions about their status. This is a conversation we are having as an Oireachtas and a society. It is a welcome one because for too many years we were not getting into the actual details of the complex challenges we were facing. We are now discussing them, from which will come new solutions.</p>

            <p eId="para_115">I thank the Minister. That is the issue - when one actually gets into individual cases and does the spadework with those involved, one sees the complexities. We want to work with the Minister and his officials to unravel them in order that we can help the people who are most vulnerable. Am I hearing the Minister correctly when he says that from next Monday Kildare County Council will be given the resources it needs to have a HAP place finder section to deal with the issues I have raised with him and his officials and to sort out the problems people are experiencing when they show up looking for the upfront deposit and payment?</p>
            <p eId="para_116"> There is something else the Minister might consider. With regard to the housing assistance payment, as has been spoken about before, there is a discrepancy between the payment allocated and the actual true rent paid. That has to do with a lack of supply, an issue which will obviously be addressed in time. In some cases, however, families are actually getting a top-up from a family member, parents, etc. They are going to the local authority with letters stating the top-up of €200, or whatever it is, will be guaranteed in order to get them off the street, but they are not being accepted by the local authorities. They are not being accepted by Kildare County Council. I wonder if the Minister and his Department can assist in that regard because it is adding further adding to homelessness. In the interim, we are trying to assist people who are homeless to get off the street. We should do everything in our power to make sure that will happen. Unnecessary snags and obstacles are being put in people's way. We should try to work together to remove them.</p>

            <p eId="para_117">I thank the Deputy for his question. He touched on a couple of issues and I will try to get to each of them briefly. He is absolutely right to focus on people who are sleeping on the street, on trying to get them into emergency accommodation and then onto a sustainable pathway. We now have the policies in place to do so. Since last year we have seen a dramatic reduction in the level of rough sleeping, 40%, which is very welcome, but there are still more than 100 people sleeping rough in Dublin, an issue on we continue to work. Housing First now has a national director. It also has a programme throughout the country. In one of the reports which, again, was published yesterday, we see a 90% retention rate, which is very welcome.</p>
            <p eId="para_118"> The third housing summit will be held shortly, in the first week of July. I will be speaking to local authorities, specifically about affordability and the crisis of homelessness we continue to face. I will be speaking about the reports, their recommendations and how to implement them. I will have a further engagement today with the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government on the recommendations and how they should be brought forward. The Deputy is right to state that on Monday the new person will be in place and ready to get to work in his local authority. That is good because they will be able to work on the hard and complex cases the Deputy's constituency is experiencing.</p>
            <p eId="para_119"> There is an uplift so far as the housing assistance payment scheme is concerned. There is a figure of 20% for the normal housing assistance payment scheme and 50% for the homeless housing assistance payment scheme. However, some local authorities are not using it. Where I find an example in some of the data of their not using the uplift, we can go back and insist on a local authority using this measure because we know that it works.</p>

I acknowledge the very significant amount of work the Minister of State has been doing since the publication of the review to try to establish the expert group to work out how to tackle the very serious deficiencies.

            <p eId="para_122">In line with the commitment in Rebuilding Ireland, in 2017 the Housing Agency commissioned an independent expert review of funding for Traveller-specific accommodation.  The review had regard to targets contained in the local authority Traveller accommodation programmes, actual delivery, the current status of accommodation funded and funding provided for accommodation maintenance and other supports.  </p>
            <p eId="para_123"> Following its consideration of the review which showed that more than 3,000 units which the Government had hoped would be delivered had not been, the national Traveller accommodation consultative committee, NTACC, agreed to the establishment of an expert group to examine and make recommendations on issues regarding Traveller accommodation policy, strategy and implementation.  The committee recently submitted to me the proposed terms of reference for the expert group.  It is correct to say there has been a long delay in this process, with which I am unhappy. However, we have engaged with the committee to get it moving and there has been some progress in the past couple of months. It is my intention to establish the group as soon as possible, with a view to it concluding its work within a short timeframe.  </p>
            <p eId="para_124"> The expert group will consult relevant stakeholders at local and national level, including Traveller representative organisations and other stakeholder groups represented on the NTACC and local Traveller accommodation consultative committees.  Such consultation will include an invitation for written submissions and a series of national and regional workshops. My Department will consider recommendations made by the expert group to improve the delivery of Traveller accommodation nationally and ensure full use is made of the increasing level of funding available for this purpose, which is €12 million this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_125"> I hope the expert group can be appointed in the next couple of days. We have been in contact with the people who have been nominated and selected through a process who will I hope all say "yes." If they do not, we will move to the next choices, but I hope we will have an answer this week and be able to get moving. It has taken far too long, but it is important that we move as quickly as we possibly can. I compliment the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government on the work it will do in conjunction with the expert panel to track its work and work with it. This House, taxpayers and the Department are playing their part by increasing the budget, but we have to make sure the money will be spent. That is the key issue in the context of the review.</p>

            <p eId="para_126">I thank the Minister of State for his reply. One of the startling figures from the report published last year, a report commissioned by the Department and the Housing Agency, was that, as the Traveller accommodation programmes progressed from 2000 to 2018, the incidence in meeting their targets fell. From 2000 to 2004, they hit about 90% of their targets. In the period from 2014 to 2018, that figure had dropped to 39%. The Minister of State is correct to say funding has been increased for Traveller accommodation programmes, albeit far too modestly. However, the tragedy is that none of the additional funding has been spent by the local authorities. Last year was the worst year on record in terms of drawdown. There was a 45% underspend, which essentially means that all of the additional funds allocated since the Government was formed remain unspent. The problem is very clear. Local councillors and county managers are, in many cases, refusing to provide land or make provision for Part 8 developments. They are refusing to draw down the money. The announcement of the group needs to be made as a matter of urgency. The Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government wants to play its part. We want to support the Minister of State and the expert group. However, we will need to see radical changes to ensure the money which the Minister of State is increasing, albeit again modestly, will be drawn down to ensure the systemic discrimination against Travellers in the housing system, as made clear earlier this year by the Irish Council for Social Housing, is brought to an end.</p>

            <p eId="para_127">I certainly agree with the Deputy that our ambition, as a Department, and certainly mine as Minister of State and that of the Minister is to have the money spent. It is very hard for us to argue for increased funding for Traveller-specific accommodation if it is not spent. Last year less than €4.5 million out of a total budget of €9 million was spent. We are engaging with various people before the expert panel is formed. We are engaging with the local authorities and all other stakeholders to try to have the money spent this year. I visit a lot of sites and see no reason we cannot progress work on them. We are certainly making the Department available to work on solutions and projects. The money is available and we want to see it being spent. I have made it very clear to all stakeholders that it is there to be spent and should be spent and that there is no reason we cannot move on projects. The issue sometimes is the Part 8 planning process or with local managers or authority members. I refer also to stakeholders' ambitions. In some cases, I visit sites and the ambitions are not realistic. To be fair, last year's report on the Traveller accommodation programme recommended greater consultation with all stakeholders to work out solutions. The issue is not always just on one side. Part of the overall process of engagement involves encouraging stakeholders to have realistic ambitions. Again, in the case of some of the sites I have visited, I see no reason we cannot get people into a room to form agreements. However, it does not happen and the money is left to one side. There is a lack of focus. I will certainly be open to considering any suggestion the expert panel may bring forward. I hope it will complete its work quite quickly. I am conscious that its members are not going to be paid a lot of money to do it, but we want their advice and expert suggestions which we will implement.</p>

            <p eId="para_128">I urge all Members of the House, including the Minister of State, to read the report of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission on inequality and discrimination in the housing system which was published this week. It confirms again, as did the Department's own report commissioned last year, that there is systemic discrimination against Travellers in the housing system. There is also a responsibility on the political leadership. In that regard, I again acknowledge the good work of the Minister of State. However, it is not just a matter for him or some of us on the Opposition benches. All Deputies need to stand up and be counted to ensure that when the issue of Traveller accommodation is being discussed in their constituencies, they do not turn a blind eye to county managers or councillors who are playing politics, with the result that Travellers are denied access to quality accommodation. I am a strong advocate of giving extra powers to local authorities and would be loath to see powers being taken away from them.</p>
            <p eId="para_129">However, where a local authority has a track record of refusing to provide land or Part 8 planning or refusing to draw down the funding, then I believe we need to consider, perhaps on a temporary basis, removing that power from the authority and conferring it elsewhere or applying financial sanctions.</p>
            <p eId="para_130"> Like everyone else, those in the Traveller community deserve equal access and equal rights to housing. I wish to acknowledge the work of the Minister in this regard. Those of us on the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government are committed to working with the Minister to ensure we get this right. If the expert group comes up with good recommendations, those of us in this House can do a good day's work by ensuring that, whatever legislative changes we make, the money will be spent and Travellers get the housing they need.</p>

            <p eId="para_131">Those of us in the House at the moment who are focused on this area have an ambition for this money to be spent. There is responsibility on all stakeholders, including Deputies, councillors, Senators, local managers and local authority staff as well as local communities and local Traveller groups. We need to work on this together. The Traveller accommodation programme review points out various difficult areas – it is not limited to one side. I urge anyone who wishes to see progress to work with us to get progress.</p>
            <p eId="para_132"> We are trying to get this year's allocation spent along with potential changes recommended by the expert group. However, people have to recognise their responsibilities across the board and across the system. That means changes for all sides if we are to get this money spent. I have seen some accommodation that is absolutely not acceptable for these times. Regardless of what party a person is from or what ambitions that person has, it is important that we get this money spent. I hope that we can work with people who are solution-focused. I see people who are objecting or delaying accommodation solutions for different reasons and that is not acceptable either. I appeal to people not to play politics with this in the years ahead because there is a duty on all of us to deliver accommodation. Let us be clear: there is difficulty in some cases with spending on the social housing budget. It does not only apply to Traveller-specific accommodation. We have difficulty in general with social housing projects. We are trying to bring in new design and quality measures to ensure we bring forward top class projects that will be more acceptable to communities. All of us have to play our part.</p>

            <p eId="para_134">We all recognise the need for housing, including social and affordable housing. Nowhere is the need greater in my area than in Ballincollig, where prices are continuing to drift up. At this stage the average price for houses being sold in recent weeks has reached €308,000, up from €245,000 last year. There is tight demand for social housing. Housing needs to be made available. Phase 1 of the local infrastructure housing activation fund was supposed to supply houses in the area. It was to provide over 500 houses initially and a further 3,000 afterwards. However, the project has stalled and is not being progressed. Can it be prioritised for the next round of LIHAF?</p>

            <p eId="para_135">I thank the Deputy for the question. The aim of the local infrastructure housing activation fund is to increase housing supply through enabling infrastructure such as roads, bridges and parks.</p>
            <p eId="para_136"> It is now the case that significantly increased funding will be available for enabling infrastructure projects through the new €2 billion urban regeneration and development fund and the €1 billion rural regeneration and development fund announced under Project Ireland 2040.</p>
            <p eId="para_137"> Local authorities will also be able to apply to the new serviced sites fund, which will support delivery of both off and on-site infrastructure that can unlock local authority-owned lands to deliver affordable homes.</p>
            <p eId="para_138"> Given the crossover between these funds, I have reviewed whether it is necessary to have a further call specifically under LIHAF. I have concluded, in consultation with the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, that it would be unnecessary duplication to have separate calls under separate funds for the same types of projects. In addition, I want to give further support to local authorities to bring forward publicly owned sites to provide affordable housing under the affordable purchase scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_139"> Accordingly, it has been agreed that the funds that had been allocated for the second call under LIHAF will be transferred to the new serviced sites fund. This will increase the Exchequer funding available from €25 million to €75 million over the period to 2021. This funding will help to speed up the development of affordable housing from publicly owned sites and I will issue a call for proposals under the fund by the end of next week.</p>
            <p eId="para_140"> The four projects that the Deputy referred to can apply for funding through either the urban regeneration and development fund or the rural regeneration and development fund. Calls for proposals under both funds are expected to issue in the coming weeks.</p>

            <p eId="para_141">There is clearly extraordinary demand in the area for housing, whether it is delivered through one scheme or another. People have seen the public schemes. The Old Fort Gate scheme has been stalled and the Poulavone scheme of social housing on public ground has also stalled at second stage evaluation. LIHAF was to deliver a large number of houses on privately owned ground. It was going to be a real opportunity for people in the area. Prices have continued to drift up from an average price of €245,000 last year to €308,000 at present. The social housing demand is phenomenal. The house offered on the choice-based letting website this morning will have up to 500 bids before the week is out. Houses are not being delivered currently. We need the schemes to start delivering sooner rather than later, including those on the publicly owned sites to which the Minister has referred. Are the proposals for LIHAF phase 1 in respect of which the need was established going to be transferred and prioritised for further schemes? That would allow an opportunity for housing to come on-stream.</p>

            <p eId="para_142">I thank the Deputy for the follow-up questions. LIHAF 1 is about using State money to unlock larger areas of land and housing potential than would have been available had we directly built the houses ourselves. Approximately €200 million will deliver in the region of 20,000 homes. Not every scheme that applied to the fund was successful. There were three successful schemes under LIHAF 1 in Midleton, Carrigaline and Glanmire. As the Deputy knows, there were some particular issues with the Ballincollig bid. That meant the application could not be finalised when I was finalising the projects last year. It was not so much a problem with LIHAF 1 but a local problem that we could not get around at the time.</p>
            <p eId="para_143"> The fact that we are standing down the possibility of LIHAF phase 2 does not mean we are standing down the possibility of those projects submitted to my Department for funding for the same scheme or for something similar. It is simply that they will now be under the urban regeneration and development fund or the rural regeneration and development fund. These are bigger schemes, with €3 billion between the two funds. That is separate from the €75 million available for affordable housing provision. I will be launching the urban regeneration fund next week. It will be open for applications for three months and will close at the end of September. We will make decisions in October for the first tranche of money to be drawn down from 1 January next year. A total of €100 million will be available next year. Those projects that are shovel-ready will get prioritised. The announcement will be made next week.</p>

            <p eId="para_144">I thank the Minister for the information. Clearly, the need was demonstrated in the four areas, including Ballincollig. The council has been looking to advance the project. There was local pressure to get the project going. The council is putting the proposal back in for LIHAF 2. I imagine applications for the other three projects will probably come in as well. Will they have to go back around again and make new applications for the new scheme? Can the Minister prioritise or fast-track them? Clearly the demand is demonstrated in these areas. They already have matching funding in place and would be more advanced than any scheme coming in fresh. Can they be prioritised? What is the Minister's intention to deal with those? Will they be delayed by having to go back around again with a new application?</p>

            <p eId="para_145">Two of the concerns I have with the first round of LIHAF are relevant to the second round. Many of the larger funding allocations were granted to developers who do not actually need the funding. These developers have profitable cash reserves and would have proceeded with the developments within the same timeframe without the money. That is in direct contradiction to the original intentions of LIHAF.</p>
            <p eId="para_146"> Let us consider the detail of the discounts the Department has provided us with. The average prices after the discount at 2017 prices in the private LIHAF Dublin sites are a little under €320,000. However, the 2017 prices are not locked in. Therefore, as those houses are built in 2019 and 2020 we will see house price inflation. Outside of Dublin we see prices at approximately €250,000 on the basis of 2017 prices. Again, in many places these are actually higher than private sector new-builds. The Minister is giving money to developers who do not need it. There is no guarantee of affordability. In fact, in many cases there is no agreement whatsoever on public sites and mixed sites. It is not simply about ensuring that developers on the sites who need the funding get it. If the objectives of the scheme are to be met, it is vital that funding only goes to those who need it and that there is an affordability dividend. In many cases under LIHAF 1 that was not that case.</p>

            <p eId="para_147">I will respond briefly to Deputy Ó Broin. I do not agree that the sites would have proceeded had we not put in place LIHAF 1 funding. The State is getting the money back for the investment made. The State is getting far more back in terms of unlocking these sites for housing than it might have gotten had it directly invested the money. If the current inflation trend for house price increases seen in the first four months this year continues, then we will have single digit inflation this year. That would be a welcome development because we saw double-digit inflation during the past 12 months.</p>
            <p eId="para_148"> I do not doubt the need for houses in the areas the Deputy has identified in his constituency.</p>
            <p eId="para_149">If we are to proceed with LIHAF 2, local infrastructure housing activation fund, there will be a need for a new application. The great thing about these projects is that a huge amount of the heavy lifting has been done in putting proposals together and ensuring the other funding required to leverage LIHAF 2 funding is in place. They will have to make a new application for the new funds because there are different weighting criteria and a number of objectives that have to be met. However, an application that is ready to go will be looked at more favourably because we want to ensure the money will be drawn down from the beginning of next year. We have to invest a large amount of money between now and 2027, the lifetime of funds under the national development plan. These applicants will start from a very good position, but they will have to pay attention to the new criteria which will be slightly different from those under LIHAF 2. I have no doubt that, given the progress made under LIHAF 1, they will be in a good position when the applications process is opened.</p>

            <p eId="para_153">The purpose of this question is to find out exactly what vacant homes officers are doing. Given the fact that there are now so many people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness, coupled with the fact that there is such a shortage of available housing, it is a scandal that there are empty properties throughout the country which could be used as homes. Even if the numbers are nowhere near the census figure of 183,000, we need proactive engagement on empty houses available throughout the country in order that they can be turned into homes for people. What are vacant home officers doing? Are they being proactive in bringing homes back into use?</p>

            <from>Deputy Damien English<recordedTime time="2018-06-20T11:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_154">I agree that we have to be very proactive in dealing with vacant properties. That is what we are trying to do. It was nice that the Central Statistics Office, CSO, figures last week reflected the fact that over 5,000 vacant properties had been brought back into use in the past two years. The report of the CSO was released last week and is independent of the Government. We also know that 8,400 local authority voids have been brought back into use. There has, therefore, been a major focus on vacancies.</p>
            <p eId="para_155"> Local authorities have designated vacant homes officers who act as a central point of contact. They provide information and advice for owners of vacant homes and also deal with queries from members of the public in respect of private residential vacant properties in their administrative area.  </p>
            <p eId="para_156"> The range of duties of the vacant homes officer includes tasks that support the development of local authorities’ vacant homes action plans. They are involved in co-ordinating both initial vacancy assessment exercises such as drilling down into available data, primarily from the CSO and GeoDirectory. They also undertake visual inspections of properties in their administrative area, where appropriate, as well as engaging with the owners of vacant homes on the options available to assist them in bringing their properties back into the habitable housing stock. A range of options have been outlined by the Department which are an attractive carrot designed to encourage people to bring forward these vacant properties.  </p>
            <p eId="para_157"> It is, of course, a matter for each local authority to decide the appropriate allocation of staff and resources for this work, having regard to its overall workforce planning policy. However, we have indicated to local authorities that we want them to do as much as possible to ensure vacant homes in areas of high demand for housing are targeted and brought back into use, where feasible. In that regard, my Department will be providing funding to support the work of vacant homes officers within each local authority, allowing for an increased focus on vacancy issues and boosting take-up of schemes to tackle vacancies. Correspondence from local authorities to that effect was received last week and there will be more in the weeks ahead. </p>
            <p eId="para_158"> I had the opportunity recently to visit Limerick where I saw some great work being done on vacant properties. I have to commend the vacancy unit for the work it is doing. I have asked it to do much more of that work. It has brought forward some excellent properties under the purchase and renewal scheme. It is also dealing with the repair and leasing scheme. There is a range of schemes in place. There is, therefore, no excuse for leaving properties vacant. I accept that in some instances there is a reason which must be addressed with the person who owns the property which might be complicated, but local authorities are being asked to prioritise this work. They have been provided with funding and we have seen some great results throughout the country, in Limerick in particular.</p>

            <p eId="para_159">I am really trying to find out whether the people who have these jobs have other tasks to do. Is a specific amount of time devoted to proactively finding out the reasons properties are vacant, rather than just responding if somebody provides the information? Do they draft action plans? In the British system vacant homes officers have a very proactive role. They identify the reason a property is vacant in their local area, rather than waiting for somebody to apply under the existing schemes such as the purchase and renewal scheme. Is there a proactive plan in place for local authorities to specifically identify vacant houses? Do the officers in question then go and talk to their owners? Are there plans to have a tax on properties that have been left vacant for a long period of time?</p>

            <p eId="para_160">Vacant homes officers and their teams are engaging on the issue. In Limerick four people have been assigned to the task. There is even a vacant homes manager. Their job is to proactively chase up vacant properties. I have seen good examples in different counties I have visited where vacant properties have been brought forward. We want the officers in question to do more. That is what we are asking them to do. It involves engaging directly with the owners of properties to find out what has gone wrong. The website, <i>vacanthomes.ie</i>, was set up by Mayo County Council and my Department. It is a useful tool in that regard and over 1,700 homes have been registered on it. It raises awareness of properties and encourages people to work with us to bring forward solutions. There is a range of schemes available which I will not go through. There are many options available through the local authorities. The allocated funding for this year, amounting to around €50,000 per unit, will be announced in the weeks ahead in order that this process can be driven physically on a day to day basis. I understand this is what vacant homes officers are doing in most cases. We have asked them in our meetings with them, when we meet them at housing summits and weekly meetings with local authorities, to focus on this issue and dedicate resources to dealing with it. We are matching that funding with resources from the Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_161">The numbers taking up the two schemes are disappointing. Does the Minister of State have plans to increase the uptake either by changing the schemes or introducing a stick-based approach? Are there plans to have a tax on homes that have been left vacant for a long period of time?</p>

            <p eId="para_162">We all agree that the numbers are not as high as we want them to be. The schemes have been put in place and they are attractive. We made changes to them to make them even more attractive. There is no reason the purchase and renew scheme cannot be used much more by local authorities which now understand this also. There are over 600 repair and lease-back properties in the system. Some 900 properties have been through the scheme and 600 are still being judged or worked on. I hope the majority will come through the system. We have changed the scheme to make it easier and more attractive. There is an option to lease back properties after five years. We are trying to place a focus on this project. Asking each local authority to have a vacant homes action plan, fund officers and put money behind the scheme is an attempt to place a focus on the issue. We should see a major improvement in the number of properties coming through both schemes, as well as others, in the months ahead. The vacant homes unit in the Department which was set up by the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, aims to drive this agenda to increase the level of activity. We will see increased activity in this space in the months ahead.</p>

          <p eId="para_171">I pay tribute to the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, for its hard-hitting and uncompromising report on Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, set up by the Government four years ago. Its conclusions, which follow the investigation which was necessitated by the false allegations pertaining to Maurice McCabe, are serious and damning and call for a fundamental review of the agency and whether it is fit for purpose. The report is alarming in that it says that, as a State, we are not dealing with current child sex abuse allegations properly or with the necessary level of capacity. Despite all of the inquiries into child sexual abuse in the past and all of the huge outrage in terms of what happened, it is extraordinary that in this day and age the Government and its agencies are simply not in a position to deal with sex abuse allegations. In fact, the report states that the systems failures within Tusla had the potential to put children at risk, which is a very worrying conclusion.</p>
          <p eId="para_172"> There is a list of issues. Some 165 sex abuse allegations await assessment. In the course of its review, HIQA escalated 65 cases to regional managers at Tusla where it was concerned about a potential risk to a child. The investigating team found cases which were inappropriately closed, inadequate managerial oversight, a gap between Tusla's national policies and what is happening on the ground, a lack of timeliness in responding to referrals and poor record keeping. It found actual cases of systems failures that, as I said, placed children at risk. Alarmingly, it found no standardised approach to direct and guide staff in the management of retrospective allegations.</p>
          <p eId="para_173"> There are the huge deficiencies in the working arrangements between Tusla and the Garda Síochána. There are no electronic transfer mechanisms. There is no electronic data transfer system between them and, instead, notifications of child sexual abuse are notified between the two agencies by fax or by phone. In this day and age it is extraordinary that both agencies do not have the capacity to notify each other electronically of suspected child abuse.</p>
          <p eId="para_174"> Does the Taoiseach have confidence in the Tusla agency, its board and its management? Does he accept it has a systemic problem which is putting children at risk? How does he account for the lack of any proper relationship between An Garda Síochána and Tusla at a formal level? Does the Government accept its failings in this regard and the need for a comprehensive reassessment of Tusla? It was set up in great haste and with great fanfare but it seems that huge deficiencies are still evident.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#LeoVaradkar" eId="spk_92">
          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2018-06-20T12:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_175">First, I thank Deputy Martin for raising this very important issue. I also join him in thanking HIQA for doing this very thorough statutory investigation and doing it in just over a year, which is reasonably timely for a statutory investigation. I also want to commend the Minister, Deputy Zappone, for taking the initiative of commissioning this report in the first place.</p>
          <p eId="para_176"> The Government accepts the report. The Department of Children and Youth Affairs accepts the report. Tusla accepts the report. It will be implemented in full and, in fact, Tusla will be accounting for it before the Oireachtas joint committee today. I do have confidence in Tusla to implement the report but we will be monitoring that very closely and we will be taking independent advice on the monitoring of the implementation of that report. I also point out that while the report is very critical and very hard-hitting, it does not say that Tusla needs the kind of overhaul the Deputy is suggesting.</p>
          <p eId="para_177"> I am very conscious of the serious nature of the findings. We are determined, as a Government, that the focus now is on speeding up the pace of existing reforms and implementing all of HIQA's recommendations for the benefit and safety of children who may be at risk. The Minister has been in touch with the chairman of Tusla's board, emphasising the urgency of action on the recommendations. She intends to meet the board shortly to discuss the implications of the report and the next steps. An immediate and systematic improvement is needed and it is intended to implement the recommendations in full as soon as is practicable.</p>
          <p eId="para_178"> Officials from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs met this morning with Dr. Moling Ryan, who will chair the quality assurance group which will drive the implementation and recommendations made by HIQA to assure us they are being implemented. The Minister, Deputy Zappone, is taking full responsibility and will publish regular updates on the group's work to keep the public informed of progress. The Minister is also working with Government colleagues on the cross-cutting issues, and there are many cross-cutting issues. For example, she is working with the Minister for Justice and Equality on a new approach to deal with historical allegations of child sexual abuse and is engaging with the Minister for Education and Skills on a new formal career path for social work. She will also work with HIQA to identify how a review of best practice in the regulation of children's social services can inform the development of a regulatory framework.</p>
          <p eId="para_179"> The response from Tusla and the openness of senior management yesterday to respond to questions are welcome. As I said, they will be appearing before the Oireachtas joint committee later today, where they will give further account. I expect there will be a robust and good engagement at that.</p>

          <p eId="para_180">I could believe what the Taoiseach has just said if it were not for the record over recent years. Unfortunately, this is not the first we have heard of this issue. For example, HIQA conducted 12 inspections of Tusla child protection and welfare services between 2014 and 2016 and exactly the same issues arose in those reports, so much so that HIQA in 2015 reviewed the governance arrangements within Tusla because it was so concerned. Nine months ago, in October 2017, HIQA organised a meeting with the Minister and Tusla to apprise them of the fact that children were at risk because of systemic failures within Tusla. We have also had the Garda Síochána Inspectorate report on child sex abuse allegations with very damning conclusions.</p>
          <p eId="para_181"> This needs more than what the Taoiseach is suggesting. The response from Government is not urgent nor comprehensive enough and has been partially responsible over the last two to three years. This is despite all of the reports, for example, those from Geoffrey Shannon and the Ombudsman for Children. They are all saying the same thing but very little is happening on the ground in reality in terms of giving capacity and introducing proper change to make sure children are not at risk because of the systemic failures of our national child welfare agency.</p>

          <p eId="para_182">It is important to stress the report is very clear that appropriate and timely action was taken where children were identified as being at risk of harm but, due to various failures in the way systems are managed, children at potential risk may have been missed, which is a very serious finding. It is also important to acknowledge that the report comments positively on the strategic direction and it comments that there is abundant evidence of considerable financial investment by Government and evidence to show better and more focused staff training has occurred. We should acknowledge that and acknowledge the front-line social workers who do such a good job in difficult circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_183"> The Deputy is right to talk about the record, and we have had many problems in setting up this agency and getting it up and running. We should not forget where we have come from. This was not a greenfield site. It was a question of taking Tusla out of the HSE and taking the Department of Children and Youth Affairs out of the Department of Health. It was not a greenfield site and it is very much an ongoing process of improvement. We are in a very different place than we were ten or 15 years ago when child protection was just an afterthought, an appendage to the Department of Health and to the HSE. We know that HSE boards, for example, regularly did not even discuss child protection at their board meetings. What have we done? We have totally changed from that old policy of the past, established a dedicated Department of Children and Youth Affairs, established Tusla as a dedicated agency, taking it out of the HSE, put children's rights in our Constitution and legislated to give effect to that.</p>

          <p eId="para_188">Yesterday the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, published the Government's summer economic statement. It clearly points to a budget in October that will have serious consequences for ordinary people. By taking a decision not to invest the €1.4 billion that is available to the Government in the upcoming budget under the fiscal rules, it is deliberately choosing once again not to address the social crises that we have in this State, crises that have been created as a result of a decade of underinvestment by this Government and previous Fianna Fáil-led Governments.</p>
          <p eId="para_189">That lack of investment has resulted in hospital waiting lists of more than 700,000 people. It has resulted in 100,000 people on hospital trolleys last year alone. It has resulted in more than 4,000 children waking up this morning in emergency accommodation. Along with the crippling crisis the State faces in health and housing, we have the highest childcare costs in the European Union while our third level institutions are falling down the international ranking. Basic telecommunications remains a pipe dream for many in rural Ireland. Many struggle in fear of an extra financial burden such as a car breakdown or an unexpected trip to the doctor. It is reckless of the Government to decide that even though the money is available, it will not invest it to meet the challenges we face as a society. Instead, it is attempting to normalise lacklustre public services, which is socially and economically irresponsible.</p>
          <p eId="para_190"> The coming budget should be about building economic stability for all. It should be about providing access to proper public services and meaningful investment to stabilise public and personal finances. Putting a few quid in a rainy day fund is the wrong decision at the wrong time. While everyone appreciates the idea of putting a few bob aside for unprecedented events in the case of emergency, we have emergencies right here and now. They will not fix themselves. They need investment and they will not vanish overnight. Despite Fianna Fáil's constant promises to fund everything under the sun, it seems to be on board with the Government's strategy. The long and the short of it, however, is that these services will continue to be in a state of crisis unless the Government invests to fix them. The Government knows it and Fianna Fáil knows it. That is the crux of the matter. The choices to be made in the upcoming budget in October are very simple. We can choose to continue to allow these crises to prevail and deepen or we can tackle them head on. Does the Taoiseach accept that under his plans, the message to those in emergency accommodation and to the hundreds of thousands on hospital waiting lists or on trolleys is to suck it up and get on with it?</p>

          <p eId="para_193">The summer economic statement, which presages the budget, provides for an increase in public spending next year of €3.4 billion. That is one of the largest increases in public spending in a very long time. Of that, we have already committed €2.5 billion. We have committed to a €1.5 billion increase in investment in public infrastructure, which includes housing, health care, schools, broadband and climate change mitigation measures. We have also pre-committed to increasing pay for our public servants, including doctors, teachers and nurses. We will see pay restoration continued during the next year. We have also set aside additional money for demographics, recognising that there will be more pensioners next year as well as more patients and students in our schools. We are also taking account of the fact that some of the improvements introduced in the course of this year, including subsidised childcare and increased welfare payments, will cost more in 2019 because of the full year effect. As such, the summer economic statement provides that next year we will increase public spending by €3.4 billion, which is a very large amount of money.</p>
          <p eId="para_194"> Health spending in Ireland is already at a record high. On a <i>per capita </i>basis, it is among the highest in the world. It has been running ahead of the international OECD average for 20 years now, including during the recession. If Sinn Féin does not understand that our problems in healthcare are about much more than funding, it has no solutions to offer Irish people or those patients who are suffering and waiting. The Sinn Féin policy is to spend money which is not available and would have to be borrowed. What we say in the summer economic statement is that we are aiming for a deficit next year. It is still a deficit and we will still borrow money next year. We are aiming for a deficit of 0.1% of GDP next year, which is close to but still not a balanced budget. The Sinn Féin policy is to borrow another billion or two next year. Now is not the time in the economic cycle to increase our debt. Now is the time for us to balance the books and pay down our debt because we cannot assume the economy will always grow this quickly or that unemployment will always be falling. The Sinn Féin policy is actually worse than the Fianna Fáil policy of the past. Fianna Fáil's policy was "When I have it, I spend it". At least it had it, whereas Sinn Féin is proposing to borrow it. Increasing borrowing and debt now might work for a year or two but after those two or three years are up, Sinn Féin will plunge us into a financial crisis yet again.</p>

          <p eId="para_195">It is clear that the Taoiseach and his Cabinet are making economic decisions from their ivory tower. Let us deal with the reality here. The State faces major social crises. As we speak, there are hundreds of people on hospital trolleys. This morning, more than 4,000 children woke up in emergency accommodation. Despite the fact that we have very strict fiscal rules, we can spend an additional €1.4 billion to deal with these crises, yet the Government in its ivory tower has decided not to do so. Its message is clearly "Suck it up and wait". That is the wrong decision. It is socially irresponsible. It is economically irresponsible to fail to invest following a lost decade of underinvestment. We have had the lowest capital spending in Europe. While there is an increase in capital spending now, it is not reaching the European average, never mind dealing with the fact that we have had a decade of underinvestment.</p>
          <p eId="para_196"> What does the Taoiseach say to the young child this morning who left hotel accommodation to get two buses to his or her primary school? What does he say when that child asks why the Government cannot build the homes people need even though €1.4 billion is available under the fiscal rules? What does the Taoiseach say to a child who has been waiting for two years for an assessment because the Government will not provide the resources? What does he say to the 19 people in my constituency who are lying on trolleys today while a ward with 19 beds remains closed and management seeks €1.8 million to open it to allow these people to be treated with dignity and the professionals in the hospital to work in a proper environment?</p>

          <p eId="para_208">In my first Leaders' Questions as party leader, I read out some of the shocking statistics from the 2015 Women's Aid report. The latest version of that report records that there were 19,385 disclosures of domestic abuse against women and children, including 607 cases of sexual abuse. According to Garda statistics last year, 2,947 sexual offences were committed in Ireland, of which 655 were cases of rape. Sadly, there are probably many more victims behind these numbers who did not come forward. Sadly, again, very few rape trials end in conviction. The National Women's Council of Ireland has called for reform of data collection in relation to sexual assault, in particular rape. It has asked for a number of State agencies, including An Garda Síochána, the Courts Service, Tusla and others, to work together to ensure the best possible data are available to policymakers. Current gaps in the data are preventing the bringing to justice of perpetrators. The recent HIQA report on the failings of Tusla in the handling of sexual offence allegations is yet another example of that.</p>
          <p eId="para_209"> Last weekend, it was my honour to present at the Labour Youth conference the annual Jim Kemmy "Thirst for Justice" award to the Rape Crisis Network Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_210">The Rape Crisis Network plays a vital role in working with survivors of rape and, in particular, co-ordinating and supporting local rape crisis centres. However, as the Taoiseach will be aware, funding for the network has been cut and the organisation is struggling to continue with its vital work. Curiously, its funding has been placed under Tusla even though adult victims of rape and sexual abuse are outside the legal remit of Tusla. The network is unlikely to receive the priority it deserves in that context.</p>
          <p eId="para_211"> The new #MeToo movement is spreading around the world as people recognise the victims of sexual assault and rape and encourage them to come forward. As part of the #MeToo phenomenon, a great many women across the world, and men too, have shown tremendous courage by sharing publicly their experiences. This is helping to break down some of the barriers to victims receiving justice.</p>
          <p eId="para_212"> It is urgent for us to ensure the State is providing sufficient funding to these vital services to support victims of sexual violence and rape and ensure there is a safe space to enable victims to come forward. Will funding be fully restored to the Rape Crisis Network? Does the Taoiseach consider Tusla to be the appropriate funding body for this network? Does he agree that a more appropriate State agency or Department of State should be found?</p>

          <p eId="para_213">I thank Deputy Howlin for raising the important issue of sexual violence. Although he did not mention it, we are all aware of a recent conviction in the courts and the unspeakable crimes that were committed in the case in question, which highlights the devastating impact of sexual violence. I express my admiration for the victims in reporting the offences to the Garda because many men and women do not report sexual violence and rape. We need to ensure we put in place a supportive environment for them to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_214"> I will definitely look into the issue the Deputy raises regarding funding cuts to the Rape Crisis Network. I will seek a note on that today. I do not understand why it has occurred. The budget for Tusla increased by €40 million this year. I am not sure whether these cuts happened this year or under the previous Government but I will certainly check that out.</p>

The Deputy raises valid points and I will certainly look into them.</p>
          <p eId="para_217"> I should point out the some of the actions the Government is taking with regard to sexual violence to change attitudes and ensure perpetrators are punished. The second national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence runs from 2016 to 2021. We are nearing completion on the actions necessary for Ireland to ratify the Council of Europe convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence, also known as the Istanbul Convention. The Domestic Violence Act, which was enacted at long last on 8 May, significantly enhances the legal protections available to victims of domestic violence. In addition, we published the general scheme of the Sex Offenders (Amendment) Bill, which contains valuable provisions to assist in the management of serious sexual offenders upon release, including tagging and a better sex offender register.</p>

While this was an organisational matter, there is an understanding that the network is not being given the priority it merits in the context of the many different pressures placed on Tusla, some of which were rehearsed in a previous question. I ask the Taoiseach to review this matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_220">I will conclude by mentioning two other points. I will look into the issues the Deputy raises, both in terms of the quantum of funding and the most appropriate body to fund the rape crisis centres.</p>
          <p eId="para_221"> The Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, recently announced a full review of the sexual assault and treatment units around the country. These units provide support for victims of sexual violence and do significant work supporting men and women after sexual violence. However, we need to ensure we have a national plan in place and greater geographic equity because we do not have that at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_222"> The expert group led by Professor Dorothy Watson is nearing the completion of its work. We established the group in response to demands that we have a second Sexual Assault and Violence in Ireland or SAVI report. We should be in a position to announce in the near future a new detailed survey of sexual violence and domestic violence because one needs to know the facts to drive evidence based policy and one cannot improve matters if one does not measure them. We are keen to get a second SAVI survey up and running in the next couple of months. The survey may not be exactly the same as the SAVI survey done ten or 15 years ago. That should not be the case given that much has changed since but we need to have the data.</p>

          <p eId="para_223">In a report in today's <i>Irish Independent</i>, the journalist, Katherine Donnelly, provides a detailed and disturbing analysis of a new study by Dr. Rosaleen McElvaney of the school of nursing and human sciences at Dublin City University. The analysis was funded by St. Patrick's mental health services. Dr. McElvaney found that primary schools are engaging with children, some as young as four years of age, who are experiencing serious mental health difficulties, including self-harming and suicidal thoughts. The study notes that one quarter of all school principals believe they are ill-equipped to respond to the complexity of these children's needs. It is estimated that one third of schools are providing on-site counselling on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis. This demonstrates the way in which the absolute chaos in our mental health services is interacting with the crisis facing teaching principals around release times. This is generating a perfect storm, which is having a debilitating impact across the educational and mental health spectrum.</p>
          <p eId="para_224"> In the past week alone, almost a dozen schools in County Tipperary contacted me to raise the issue of exhaustion and the excessive workload affecting teaching principals as they try to manage the unmanageable administrative burdens being placed on them. The principals of the Deanery school in Cashel, Mount Bruis national school, Upper Newtown national school, St. Michael's national school, the Christian Brothers school in Tipperary town and the national schools in Tankardstown, Lisronagh, Lattin and Ballydrehid, as well as many other schools from outside my constituency, all expressed the view that the education system is under threat. They are burnt out and disillusioned and they argue that fantastic educational leaders are being lost every month due to ill health and stress.</p>
          <p eId="para_225"> As I stated, all of this is creating serious, systemic problems for children and a mental health crisis. Teaching principals are being mentally worn down in their search for adequate and appropriate child services. The position is the same at all levels of education, including in secondary schools. This morning, I and many other Deputies met student union representatives who also raised major issues. For instance, some students have to wait a full term to see a counsellor. The service is wholly inadequate when students must wait for eight to ten weeks for an appointment.</p>
          <p eId="para_226"> Is it any wonder this is happening when there is not a single residential child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, bed or adult psychiatric bed in Tipperary, a county with a population of 160,000? Recently, when I raised with the Taoiseach the resignation of an eminent psychiatrist, Dr. John Hillery, he dismissed it as a pre-election stunt on Dr. Hillery's part. I found that disgraceful. Unfortunately for the Taoiseach, the same cannot be said about Dr. Rosaleen McElvaney, the author of the study to which I referred. Will he accept there is a deep and prolonged crisis in mental health that is actively threatening the stability of the primary education system? Will he give a commitment to engage urgently with teaching principals to address their concerns for the sake of all the pupils, staff and families involved?</p>

          <p eId="para_229">-----nor have I read the study to which it refers. However, I can perhaps comment on some more general matters. In terms of mental health, I am sure the Deputy will be aware that we spend approximately €900 million per annum on mental health. This is a considerable amount of money, which is well spent, and is an increase of €200 million since 2012. There is, therefore, significant investment in mental health, an area in which services are changing. However, we are running into various recruitment difficulties, as is almost every country, in finding appropriately qualified staff to service our mental health infrastructure.</p>
          <p eId="para_230"> In terms of school principals, we are fortunate in Ireland to have such truly excellent school principals who do such an excellent job in managing and leading their schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_231">We are doing more and more every year now that we can afford to do so. There is, of course, always more work to do but it is relevant to mention what has been done. This year the total spend on education will be €10 billion, the highest ever. What does that mean in practice? Some 5,000 new teachers have been employed in the last two years on foot of the confidence and supply agreement with Fianna Fáil; the restoration of guidance counsellors in a lot of schools; new subjects being introduced like computer science and physical education; 15,000 special needs assistants in our schools now - more than we have gardaí even though Garda numbers are increasing as well; renewed investment in our institutes of technology and universities; and new school buildings all over the country. We are seeing a considerable investment in education.</p>
          <p eId="para_232"> The Deputy might not be aware, so perhaps I have an advantage over him on this, that the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, made an announcement this morning which is all about improving school leadership and management and that involves additional promotional posts in primary schools, for example, more assistant principals to support principals, improved continuing professional development and training for teachers to help them deal with the changing environment that children now face.</p>

          <p eId="para_233">Unfortunately I do not think the Taoiseach gets it. We can quote all these numbers and statistics but right in front of his face is the pressure that is on principals and the mental health problems that are there at such a young age are frightening all of us or at least anyone that wants to listen and acknowledge it. I feel the Taoiseach does not appreciate the scale of the crisis facing teaching principals. Some 80% of teaching principals have had their health compromised by their positions and 84% have considered stepping down. The Taoiseach can talk about all the new posts but we cannot keep the trained, excellent leaders that we have: we are losing them. Teaching principals are also paid less than their administrative principal counterparts who are also extremely overworked but who do have 900 hours release time a year on average more than the others. Teaching principals work without the added responsibility, so that 900 hours is very badly needed. The teaching principals forum has stated that the primary education system currently is like a house of cards, something like the Taoiseach's Government, and he is going to stand by while it collapses around us.</p>
          <p eId="para_234"> With regard to mental health, three nurses resigned from mental health posts in Waterford Regional Hospital only this week. There is nobody there at the moment. The Taoiseach can close his eyes to this, deny it and say he does not know what I am talking about but he should know and it is his duty to know. He is not living on Mars: he is living in Dublin.</p>

          <p eId="para_256">The Education for Persons with Special Education Needs Act 2004 was passed through this House in 2004 and quite a significant number of sections have not yet been commenced, sections which deal with the rights and entitlements of children in terms of their entitlement to an education assessment for example, the development of a statutory individual education plan, the delivery of detailed education services on foot of this plan, an independent appeals process and so on. Over a year ago I asked about this issue and I asked again subsequent to that for an update from the Taoiseach on the commencement of those sections of the Act because unfortunately people have become too familiar with announcement after announcement, passage of legislation and no follow through in any meaningful sense. I would like an indication from the Taoiseach, in line with the programme for Government, on where the Education for Persons with Special Education Needs Act 2004 stands and those sections which have not been commenced and what is the Government's response in terms of what it will do about it.</p>

          <p eId="para_259">The situation facing parents and guardians of children with scoliosis who are waiting for corrective surgery is incredibly difficult and that is before we take the excessive waiting times, cancelled surgeries, abandoned action plans and broken promises of the Minister and Government into account. Recently, parents who are part of the scoliosis advocacy network have raised concerns that the HSE is managing the waiting list. They believe this is done through the issuing of letters asking the parents whether they still seek an appointment for surgery for their children which gives them an impossibly short window in which to reply. This means they are removed from the public waiting list because they cannot reply in the time that is allotted and I am sure the Taoiseach will agree that this is worrying, or maybe he will not. Can he confirm that this practice will stop, that we will see the added investment that is required and that there will be an immediate corrective surgery action plan with definitive times and commitments so that we deal with this issue once and for all and that we no longer have to have a situation where children wait for up to three years for their first appointment and assessment?</p>

          <p eId="para_260">I thank Deputy Pearse Doherty for raising the issue. Specifically on the validation of waiting lists, I will check to make sure they are in accordance with the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, protocols but the NTPF, as a statutory agency, sets down strict protocols on the rules that should be followed to ensure accurate waiting lists. We have made significant investment in the area of scoliosis. In the last budget there was €10 million more of an investment in paediatric orthopaedic surgeries. This will see additional recruitment which is already under way in terms of an additional consultant post and importantly we have been working with the advocacy groups and the clinicians to put a new scoliosis co-design plan in place, which I expect to be published in the coming weeks.</p>

Subsequent to the publication of the plan I have had discussions with the Minister of State, Deputy John Paul Phelan, and he has confirmed to me my understanding that when the statutory instruments are drawn up the former boroughs will be constituted as stand-alone municipal districts.

          <p eId="para_263">The abortion legislation is being drafted and a lot of us do not want to table amendments because we want to see it being progressed. However, vital issues have to be incorporated. There is speculation that three visits will be required to be made by a person who may be pregnant and wants to have an abortion - two at the beginning and one afterwards. That is completely unnecessary and it would add to the cost. It would also be unnecessary medically. It must also be trans-inclusive, as we are drafting legislation in an era in which there is better understanding of gender. Conscientious objection must not prevent any pregnant woman from having access in a region or a geographical location. There should be an opting out, rather than an opting in. On the issue of safety, pregnant women in hospitals are being picketed. This will certainly be an issue once we legalise abortion. We have to be mindful of the need for a buffer and safety zone around hospitals, clinics and GP surgeries, not to prevent industrial action or legitimate protest but to protect people's safety, including staff.</p>

          <p eId="para_269">I wish to ask the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government about the differential rent scheme in County Tipperary, a matter I have already discussed with him. The county council has written to over 1,000 tenants telling them that they are facing huge increases in rent of 50%, 60% and 70% and threatening to charge them the maximum rent unless they engage. Does it need a statutory instrument to do this or can it do so without notice? In letters received on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday last week they were told that the increases would take effect on 1 July. It is a very ham-fisted way for it to deal with the issue as it strikes fear and terror into people living in rented accommodation. In the context of the housing crisis, it is totally insensitive. Surely manners could be put on council officials who cannot do this willy-nilly.</p>

A man in my area was brutally beaten up 14 years ago on coming out of The George on George's Street because of his sexuality. He developed neurological problems and has been waiting 13 years for compensation, despite the fact that the solicitor has given all of the information the tribunal needs. It is not acceptable.</p>

          <p eId="para_273">It was announced that there would be a number of constitutional referendums later in the year, including one on Article 41.2.1o on women in the home. My understanding is the Government's preference is to delete the article, but a lot of bodies, including the National Women's Council, are of the view that it provides the possibility for a wider discussion on families, family formation, caring relationships and so on and that it would be a good opportunity for us to have a national debate. There is a strong case to be made for having a broader article to better reflect the inclusive modern Ireland. Is the Government open to considering that idea? Does the Minister have an open mind on the possibility of inserting a replacement article, instead of simple deletion?</p>

I will be happy for that conversation to take place and arrange to meet appropriate groups. However, there are issues beyond the Department of Justice and Equality and I am very keen to ensure the commitment in the programme for Government on the deletion of what I regard as a somewhat offensive reference to women in the Constitution will be dealt with at the earliest opportunity.</p>

          <p eId="para_275">Last week the chairman designate of the DAA, Mr. Basil Geoghegan, was before the Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport. He said there were significant issues which still needed to be addressed regarding the new runway. He said, "We need clarity urgently on the new system for noise regulation at the airport." He went on to say the current restrictions could cost the economy over 17,000 jobs by 2037. For 18 months the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, has been promising legislation to deal with the competent authority for independent noise regulation at Dublin Airport and failed to deliver. As a consequence, the Government has failed to deliver much needed legislation on independent noise regulation at the airport. It is a serious issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_283">My question is related to page 160 of the programme for Government which deals with local authority reform. Last week the people of west Cork received a draft of the new local authority boundary changes and I sincerely hope it is a draft. Submissions which other representatives and I, as well as local communities, have made have been totally ignored as areas such as Courtmacsherry, Timoleague, Butlerstown, Ring, Darrara and Lislevane have been mysteriously taken out of the Clonakilty council area against the will of the people. Many believe this suits the Government, but the Taoiseach may be able to end these thoughts if he clarifies, on behalf of the communities concerned and the majority of public representatives in the areas affected, that they can be kept within the Clonakilty council area. What is the procedure to stop some of the plans from being implemented?</p>

          <p eId="para_290"> The announcement of 1,000 jobs by Amazon in Dublin is extraordinarily welcome. It is a real vote of confidence in the Irish economy. Realistically, jobs like those provided by major tech companies such as Amazon, Facebook, Google and so on will only happen in big cities with a critical mass. If those jobs had not gone to Dublin, they would not have gone elsewhere in Ireland. They would have gone to Tel Aviv, San Francisco or Amsterdam. We need to realistic about that.</p>

          <p eId="para_302">In the programme for Government under the heading of greater access to mental health services in primary care, the Government made three specific commitments, namely, building further capacity in child and adolescent mental health services, more 24-7 service support and liaison teams, and mechanisms to attract and retain staff in this area. The Taoiseach will be aware that Dr. John Hillery, president of the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland, described the current system as shambolic and nothing short of a disgrace. He said he had to resign over the executive's inaction on mental health issues. It was reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> on Monday that in the past year more than 300 Irish doctors this year have obtained working visas for Australia. What will the Government do to attract and retain staff in this area of the health service before it crumbles?</p>

          <p eId="para_303">I thank the Deputy for his question. He rightly identified there is a major challenge with the retention of consultant psychiatrists and psychiatry staff. As he will be well aware, this is a major challenge not just for Ireland. There is also a chronic shortage of staff in this discipline in Europe, America and Australia.</p>
          <p eId="para_304"> The Deputy asked a direct question, namely, what the Government will do about it. The future for this area lies in telepsychiatry where we will have to start delivering these services online and making better use of consultants' time, thereby ensuring they are doing exactly what they should be doing and not ancillary work that does not have to be done. That is where the future lies in this area. I am exploring that with the Department and the HSE. I have seen telepsychiatry in action in other countries where telepsychiatry machines are used to deliver psychiatric services. It is one of those disciplines that can be delivered online. Many physical health services cannot be delivered online. Telepsychiatry is the future in this discipline that is the direction in which we have to move. I appreciate the Deputy's frustration about this. We cannot keep having the same conversation about there being a shortage of consultants. We need to look beyond that.</p>

This is a problem around enforcement.

          <p eId="para_311">The cost of fuel, diesel and petrol, has gone through the roof, especially in the past six months and since the last budget. I understand the Exchequer's revenue take is now at least 20 cent more per litre of diesel or petrol. I ask the Taoiseach to forgo that massive revenue take increase and give some of it back to the poor people. Hauliers, ordinary people who drive to work and farmers are being driven into the ground with this additional cost burden. Surely, the Government can forgo some of this revenue and reduce the cost of petrol and diesel on behalf of all the people who have been affected by these massive price increases.</p>

          <p eId="para_323">I raise with the Taoiseach the commitment to protect the environment in the programme for Government. Perhaps he saw the recent "RTÉ Investigates" programme, "Ireland's Wild Waste". It is more like the Wild West. The side by side competition and privatisation model in Ireland is chaotic and has been shown to be failing in protecting the environment. Ireland has one of the best records for separating waste in Europe. Householders are doing their piece and paying dearly for having their waste removed. However, some waste companies are involved in criminal behaviour. All sides of the House are concerned about this, as we should be. The maximum fine of €2,500 is akin to fining a Member of the Oireachtas €10. The culprits are laughing because there is no penalty or substantial deterrent in place for waste companies. I raised this issue with the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten. I now put it to the Taoiseach that we need greater local authority control over waste management. We also need to streamline enforcement, which is currently a patchwork. </p>

          <p eId="para_327">I am not sure I agree with the Deputy's analysis. When these matters were solely controlled by local authorities and councils, there was no recycling and everything was dumped in landfills. I know all about it because the biggest dump was in my constituency. The Deputy's ideological analysis does not stand up to reason. The penalties under the Waste Management Act are substantial. There is a fine of €5,000 on summary conviction, or imprisonment of up to 12 months, and a maximum fine of up to €15 million on conviction on indictment, and-or imprisonment of up to ten years. These are stiff penalties. We need to see them enforced and applied.</p>

          <p eId="para_328">Chapter five of the programme for Government deals extensively with investment in the health service and local hospitals. Naas General Hospital in my constituency serves 200,000 people across County Kildare and west Wicklow. One of the units most under pressure in the hospital is the endoscopy unit. I recently visited the unit which is located in a prefabricated building in an old part of the hospital. Under a previous agreement, the hospital's endoscopy unit was to be replaced with a new unit. I understand the tender has not yet issued. While some progress has been made, the new unit, which has been repeatedly delayed, is now needed urgently. Perhaps the Taoiseach or the Minister for Health will give an update on the status of the project.</p>

The Government is determined to do so and the Health Service Executive is working out its capital allocation for the next number of years. I will revert to Deputy Lawless directly on the matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_330">With regard to the programme for Government and improving the lives of people with a disability through housing adaptation grants, the total budget allocated to Louth County Council this year is slightly less than €1.5 million, which is almost €500,000 less than last year. These figures are replicated in other counties. We are only halfway through the year and the council has already received 267 applications. It also carried over 95 applications from last year, bringing the total to 362. Louth County Council will only be able to deliver on one third of the applications with Government funding. It would need a further €1.8 million to clear the remaining applications. Will the Government continue to deny vulnerable people the basic home supports and housing adaptations they need to live independently-----</p>

Funding for housing adaptation grants has increased this year. Later this week, we will announce additional funding for these grants to help in this area. The number of grants is increasing because more funding has been provided for this area.

          <p eId="para_337">We welcome the summer economic statement by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, and we note the change in the funding strategy for Irish Water. I have raised this issue before. Could Irish Water be asked to update its strategy for the upgrade and development of wastewater treatment facilities in Mitchelstown and Churchtown where a nursing home development has been put on hold because of the upgrade of the sewerage facilities? Mitchelstown has not had any new housing built in recent years because Irish Water has stalled all plans for housing development. I ask the Minister and the Taoiseach to intercede. It is a disgrace. Mitchelstown is the economic corridor to the south east. People travelling from Dublin to Killarney or Mallow must pass through Mitchelstown. We cannot build one-off housing in the town because of Irish Water. I contacted the Minister and the Taoiseach previously about the need to upgrade wastewater treatment facilities in Mitchelstown. The facility in Churchtown also needs to be upgraded.</p>

          <p eId="para_338">I thank Deputy O'Keeffe for the question. Between now and 2027, more than €8.5 billion will be invested by Irish Water in key infrastructure, the majority of which will go into wastewater infrastructure because it is so important. Obviously, because Irish Water sits in my Department and I also have responsibility for housing, we can co-ordinate investment to ensure houses are built with the necessary infrastructure in place, including clean water going in and wastewater going out. If the Deputy is concerned about a delay on a specific site or project because the necessary investment has not been committed, he should give me a note and I will examine the issue immediately. </p>

          <p eId="para_343">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_344">That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 to make provision for a partial exemption of property tax payable by a relevant owner whose property is located in a managed estate on which the owner of said property is liable to the payment of management fees and to provide for related matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_345">In light of the review being undertaken on the local property tax, I propose the Management Fees (Local Property Tax) Relief Bill 2018, which proposes to amend the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 to make provision for a partial reduction of property tax payable by a relevant owner whose property is located in a managed estate, which is the principal private residency on which the owner of said property is liable to the payment of management fees, and to provide for related matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_346"> I am aware that the Minister has given a cautious welcome for this Bill in the context of the thousands of people who are paying management fees and local property tax. This fully costed measure would apply to principal private residences only and would not apply to investment properties. I brought a Bill on the local property tax to the Seanad in 2015. We are trying to make the tax fair and acknowledge that some people are paying on the double. I refer to those who pay fees to management companies which are used to pay for upkeep, sinking funds and so on, and do not, therefore, derive the maximum benefit of local authority services. This Fianna Fáil Bill will permit those who have fully paid their management fees to date to receive a partial reduction in property tax of up to one third of the management fees, with the maximum reduction set at €300. According to the research I have done on this matter, the measure would probably result in an average reduction of some €86. Many people who bought homes at the height of the market are paying high management fees of up to €2,500 per annum. The proposed relief would give a break to these people up to a maximum reduction of €300. It would also acknowledge that people are effectively paying twice for services in their estates, some of which they do not receive despite paying for them. In light of the review of the local property tax, I hope to be able to work with all parties and Independents to see this change through and introduce a little more fairness into the system.</p>

          <p eId="para_351">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_352">That leave be given to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 and to provide for related matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_353">The Bill's purpose is to provide that, where a court has dismissed a case on the basis of being a fraudulent action, it is automatically referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP. Currently, if an insurance claim is taken to court and the evidence presented shows to be fraudulent, it is often the case that no action is taken against the claimant. There is good evidence to suggest that, to factor in fraudulent claims, a large cost is built into the insurance premiums of businesses across the State, leading to uncompetitiveness. Evidence provided to us by Insurance Ireland and many others dealing with this matter indicates a systemic abuse of the court process by fraudulent claimants. However, no action is being taken. I ask for the House's support in providing for a direct referral to the DPP from a court when a case is dismissed because of fraudulent evidence.</p>
          <p eId="para_354"> No Deputy wishes to diminish the right of any citizen who has been harmed or injured to take a case, but as is clearly shown by the evidence presented to Deputies by various organisations and by the statistics on prosecutions in this context, only one case has been referred and prosecuted. This sends a signal to many people that there is no downside to trying to gain money fraudulently.</p>
          <p eId="para_355"> The Bill contains a standard provision providing a definition relating to the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004. Section 2 inserts a subsection into section 26 of the 2004 Act to provide that, where a court dismisses an action pursuant to that section, the court must direct that the transcript of the action and any relevant evidence be sent to the DPP. Section 3 is a standard provision providing for the citation and commencement of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_356"> This is a short Bill, but it could have a significant impact by acting as a deterrent against people who regularly take fraudulent court cases. That they can do this without there being a downside is anathema to basic decency in terms of supporting businesses and individuals' rights to go about their lawful business without the fear of extortion. That extortion is almost being supported by the State, as the State has made no meaningful effort in years to address this issue. If this Bill were enacted, we could employ the Garda and an insurance fraud squad to investigate these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_357"> The current situation is unfair on businesses throughout the country. Their public liability insurance has increased by as much as 70% in the past four years alone even though the consumer price index only increased by 0.9% per year. These are the types of cost being incurred and carried by businesses continually. I am almost making a Second Stage speech now, so I will elaborate further later.</p>
          <p eId="para_358"> I urge the House, in particular the Government, to address this matter in a meaningful way and to accept that fraudulent insurance claims are having a negative impact on business and our economic competitiveness. Despite being clear, the emotional and psychological impact on small business owners, be they publicans, hoteliers or shopkeepers, seems to be going unreported. They are constantly being intimidated with threats of being taken to court by fraudsters. Often, nothing happens beyond an insurance company settling because fighting the claim in court is not worth the hassle. Sometimes, the policy holder is not even informed that the claim has been settled.</p>
          <p eId="para_359"> We have much work to do on this matter. Under the programme for Government, there is an obligation on the Government to act on this, particularly given that the cost of insurance working group was established with that purpose in mind. I urge cross-party support for addressing the issue of fraudulent claims in the economy.</p>

            <p eId="para_384">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 10, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_385"> I visited Northern Ireland on Thursday and Friday, 7 and 8 June. I had a number of different engagements during my recent visit to Northern Ireland. This was part of my own and the Government's continuing commitment to stay engaged with all parts of society in Northern Ireland, notwithstanding the absence of functioning political institutions there.</p>
            <p eId="para_386"> On Thursday, 7 June, I met a group called Civic Space, which is made up of civic unionism and others in Belfast. The meeting was a good opportunity for me to hear from a range of perspectives on major issues such as the political situation in Northern Ireland and Brexit.</p>
            <p eId="para_387"> On 8 June, my first engagement was a private meeting with Baroness Eileen Paisley at the Bannside Library, which houses the personal collection of Dr. Ian Paisley, Lord Bannside. That morning, I had another private meeting with Mr. Peadar Heffron and his wife, Fiona. Mr. Heffron was a Catholic PSNI officer who was seriously injured in an attack by dissident republicans in 2010. I also visited the Museum of Orange Heritage, where I was welcomed by the Orange Order Grand Master, Mr. Edward Stevenson, and met Orange Order representatives from across the island, including from Cavan, Donegal, Monaghan and Leitrim. I received a warm welcome from the Orange Order in Schomberg House and also from local residents outside the museum. I hope that my visit will be seen as a stepping stone to building relationships and a greater understanding between the Irish Government and the Orange Order into the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_388"> I also had a meeting with business and community leaders at Queen's University where I heard their views on the political situation in Northern Ireland and on Brexit. In the afternoon, I spoke at the launch event for the 30th year of Féile an Phobail in St. Mary's University College. Following my speech, I met some local guests and had a brief conversation with the vice president of Sinn Féin, Ms Michelle O'Neill.</p>
            <p eId="para_389"> On Friday evening, I had a very enjoyable visit to Down's oldest GAA club, Mayobridge. During the visit, I met the club chairperson, committee members and many club members, both young and old, including distinguished former All Ireland winning players, and the Down GAA county chairman, Mr. Sean Rooney. I was given a tour of the club grounds by the club secretary, Mr. Thomas O'Hare, during which I met a number of the club's teams.</p>
            <p eId="para_390"> The final event in my programme was a meeting with the CEOs of the cross-Border, North-South bodies in Newry, where we discussed the current cross-border issues relevant to their work and the future development and role of those bodies.</p>
            <p eId="para_391"> I was really glad to have the opportunity during this visit to meet with a range of groups from all sides of the community in Northern Ireland and to hear their concerns on the issues.</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_237">
            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin<recordedTime time="2018-06-20T13:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_392">I thank the Taoiseach for his reply. I welcome the return to a policy of regular visits to Northern Ireland by taoisigh. The Taoiseach, however, would be well advised to understand that the visit two weeks ago was not nearly as historic as he seems to be believe. It is a decade since Uachtarán na hÉireann visited the Orange Order and there has been a 12 July event in Áras an Uachtaráin for quite some time.</p>
            <p eId="para_393"> What stood out from the visit was the lack of hard substance in terms of the urgent crisis concerning the political, economic and social future of Northern Ireland. It is 520 days since the Northern Ireland Executive was collapsed and the assembly suspended, but there is not the slightest sign of movement. Alarmingly, Northern Ireland remains with no voice in the Brexit discussions, with the assembly denied even the basic right to make a protest similar to that of the Scottish Parliament, which is doing a great deal of good work, against London's catastrophic policies.</p>
            <p eId="para_394">The British Government has refused to re-establish the intergovernmental arrangements required in these circumstances. The Taoiseach might update me in that regard on his engagement with the British Prime Minister. The parties are not talking and neither of the heads of the two Governments has yet had even one day of inter-party negotiations. In the circumstances, it is surprising how little the Taoiseach appears to have had to say in recent times, including on this visit. Perhaps it is his policy to leave it to others. Is something going on, on which the media have yet to be briefed by the Taoiseach's normally hyperactive briefing staff?</p>
            <p eId="para_395"> As the Taoiseach knows, there was some surprise that, in visiting Féile, he had decided that it was not necessary to make any comment on attempts to distort history and give false equivalence to illegitimate campaigns which had been waged in the face of the opposition of the people. Was that a deliberate decision on his part or an oversight? It is an important issue. There has been an attempt for quite some time to shove a particular narrative of Irish history down everybody's throat with reference to the campaign of violence that continued for 30 years. Many innocent people were murdered and there were many unacceptable atrocities, yet some of the events were celebrated at Féile. It is an ongoing narrative led by Sinn Féin which needs to be challenged on every occasion. They are atrocities about which we all know and we cannot allow a distorted narrative to emerge which should be challenged. Perhaps it has something to do with the Taoiseach's satisfaction with the new electoral alliance with Sinn Féin which he recently road-tested in the Seanad elections. </p>
            <p eId="para_396"> I have not been able to find any copy of the Taoiseach's script at the launch of Féile. Will he explain why that is the case? Other remarks he made on the day are freely available but not this particular script. Is there a reason for it?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_238">
            <from>Deputy Joan Burton<recordedTime time="2018-06-20T13:20:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_397">In launching Féile an Phobail, the community festival in west Belfast, the Taoiseach was seen as lending his authority and that of his office to the event. Nobody has any difficulty with Olly Murs or the many cultural and music events that took place. However, it is unprecedented for a Taoiseach to be involved in launching an entire programme which included events such as IRA Prisoners' Day at the Felons' Club, particularly when the Chief Constable, Mr. George Hamilton, recently referred to his concern that the IRA army council was still involved in Sinn Féin's strategy. I understand the Taoiseach received a letter from our former Oireachtas colleague and Labour Party Senator, Mairia Cahill, in which she expressed her unhappiness and hurt at the Taoiseach launching Féile, given the resolute refusal of Sinn Féin to address the issue of child abuse, including her own case which we have debated in this Chamber and on which the former Taoiseach and leader of Fine Gael, Deputy Enda Kenny, took a strong line. I know that the Taoiseach has to be aware, from articles she has written, that effectively she had been groomed for sexual abuse through her participation as a child and teenager in Féile's radio station. Like many others, she was shocked by the Taoiseach's endorsement of the event, given its connection with the IRA in west Belfast. By extension, he will potentially be seen as either staying silent or, worse still, endorsing IRA violence, in respect of which we have never had an absolute apology. Will the Taoiseach consider apologising to people like Mairia Cahill and the Stack family who have also mentioned their unhappiness and concern, as well as other victims of IRA violence, for, in effect, failing when he visited Belfast for purposes we welcome, but there is a clear line to be drawn in the sand when it comes to violence perpetrated by the republican movement - the atrocities, killings and injuries.</p>

          <speech by="#BrendanHowlin" eId="spk_239">
            <from>Deputy Brendan Howlin<recordedTime time="2018-06-20T13:20:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_398">The Taoiseach is reported as having said during his visit to Northern Ireland that the tectonic plates were shifting. My understanding is the tectonic plates shift very slowly, but, whether they are speeding up, the Taoiseach's meaning is that there are significant shifts in opinions on the constitutional status of Northern Ireland. That will be in very sharp focus in the event of a hard Brexit which, unfortunately, as we will discuss when we deal with other questions, increasingly is becoming more likely. Many weeks ago, at the James Connolly commemorative event at Arbour Hill, a Labour Party event, I called for the establishment of a new forum. The knee-jerk reaction in saying let us have a Border poll if the numbers stack up such that a figure of 50% plus 1 changes the dynamics is very dangerous in that we could find ourselves, like the Brexiteers, arguing for something and not knowing how to proceed. I have asked for the establishment of a forum involving all of the political parties that will participate in it and also civic society to discuss the shape of a new Ireland. We previously had the New Ireland Forum and there is now scope for a new forum, rather than the knee-jerk reaction of simply making a demand for a Border poll. These issues have to be thought out very carefully. They will have to be the subject of much discussion which will have to be framed very carefully. If we could have dialogue to allow all citizens on the island of Ireland to feel at home in a new settlement, it would be a good process to begin. Will the Taoiseach consider sitting down with party leaders to explore that possibility?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PearseDoherty" eId="spk_240">
            <from>Deputy Pearse Doherty<recordedTime time="2018-06-20T13:20:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_399">The recommendation made by Deputy Brendan Howlin has merit. It is similar to a suggestion we put to party leaders in the past. Attitudes to Irish unity are changing. We can see the mess caused by the Brexit negotiations. The Brexiteers achieved the outcome they wanted without any thought being given to the shape it would take. I welcome the Taoiseach's recent visit to the North which was beneficial. There is no doubt that it was well received. We, in Sinn Féin, support the Taoiseach's ongoing engagement with both communities in the North. That is essential and I hope and have no doubt that it will continue. The small amount of criticism levelled at the Taoiseach was uncalled for - we have heard some of it again today - as was the criticism of Féile an Phobail, which represents all that is good in west Belfast. At the launch I am sure the Taoiseach got a taste of the vibrancy, creativity, talent, inclusivity and energy of the community. We know that Féile an Phobail is a grassroots organisation and that it has become the largest community festival throughout Europe. There is huge anticipation in advance of its landmark 30th anniversary. The Taoiseach's participation in the launch was a boost for all those who have made Féile an Phobail what it has become. I echo the words of the former Democratic Unionist Party mayor when he attended and launched the Féile an Phobail programme. He said it "reflects the true cultural tapestry of our city."</p>
            <p eId="para_400"> The Taoiseach's meeting with the Orange Order in Belfast was very welcome. I am glad to hear of the welcome he received both inside and outside the room. I hope the initiative might open a new era of engagement with the Grand Lodge and wider society, something which has been lacking. I do not want to downplay, as has been suggested, the importance of the initiative. We need many more such initiatives.</p>

          <speech by="#RichardBoydBarrett" eId="spk_241">
            <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett<recordedTime time="2018-06-20T13:20:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_401">Ireland's greatest revolutionary and socialist James Connolly believed passionately in uniting the country, not by trying to square the circle of green and orange tribal politics or, for that matter, scoring political points off others in the political debate, as we have heard in the last few comments made by Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party. He tried to find the social and economic issues that might practically unite people and advance a radical social and economic agenda that could break down sectarian divisions.</p>
            <p eId="para_402">The issue that presents itself very much at the moment in the aftermath of the referendum to repeal the eighth is the demand which is across the communities in the North - Catholic and Protestant, progressive people, young people - demanding the decriminalisation of abortion in the North. The situation persists and has resulted in, for example, the shocking prosecution of a 21 year old young woman for taking an abortion pill when she was reported by her house mates. She had taken that pill because she could not afford to go to Britain for an abortion. It is criminal for her to have an abortion in the North even though it is not in England or Wales. It seems to me that is the thing we should be advancing if we want to unite people across the sectarian divide and North and South. I appeal to the Taoiseach to lobby Prime Minister May directly on this matter and call on her to decriminalise abortion in the North.</p>
            <p eId="para_403"> I attended a fantastic demonstration in the North on Saturday of the week before last. Bus loads came from Together for Yes down here. We were involved in organising them. Thousands of people were in Belfast - Catholics and Protestants - on the streets saying they want rights for women and they want abortion rights in the North. Why does the Taoiseach not align with them and pressure Prime Minister May to decriminalise abortion in the North? That would be a step towards a united Ireland.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#LeoVaradkar" eId="spk_242">
            <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2018-06-20T13:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_404">I share with Deputy Micheál Martin a deep concern that the Northern Ireland Assembly and the Northern Ireland Executive are still not functioning. In order for them to function the two largest parties, namely, the DUP and Sinn Féin, will need to build trust and they will need to compromise. I know there were compromises but ultimately trust needs to be built. I have been involved in two coalitions and I know that neither building trust nor compromise is easy but it is what the two parties have to do and the two Governments as co-guarantors will assist them in any way possible to bring about the compromise and trust building that is necessary.</p>
            <p eId="para_405"> When I was in Northern Ireland I remarked on the fact that there were quite a number of billboards. There was a billboard campaign by the Simon Community telling us about the 100,000 people who it says are homeless in Northern Ireland currently. I read the <i>Irish News</i> last week. It commented on the fact that the Bengoa report, the ten-year plan to reform, modernise and save the NHS in Northern Ireland, has not been implemented. The <i>Irish News</i> called on politicians in particular to make sure there was a Minister for health in Northern Ireland to do that. There are major issues in Northern Ireland similar to the issues we have here around housing and homelessness and also a health service that is struggling. The failure of politicians to take responsibility for those issues in Northern Ireland cannot go without comment.</p>
            <p eId="para_406"> We have requested a meeting but we do not have a date yet for the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference. I will be attending the BIC, British-Irish Council, in Guernsey on Friday where I will have an opportunity to have bilateral meetings with First Minister Sturgeon and First Minister Jones and I will also be speaking to the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, David Lidington, about that particular issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_407"> I will ask my office to send Deputy Micheál Martin a script of my speech at Féile an Phobail. It is not controversial. I am sure it was recorded so if it had been controversial it would have been reported by now. There is no need for any new conspiracy theories from the office of the Fianna Fáil leader. I am sure it was just an oversight the fact that the particular speech is not on a website.</p>

          <speech by="#LeoVaradkar" eId="spk_244">
            <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2018-06-20T13:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_409">While I understand the terrible personal experience and the trauma that former Senator Cahill was put through, and I understand where the Stack family is coming from, Féile an Phobail is really not a Sinn Féin event, it is a community event in west Belfast. There are many Sinn Féin supporters involved in it. This is a part of Northern Ireland where Sinn Féin wins five out of six seats. Quite frankly, nothing is going to happen in west Belfast without having some people there who have a history or background in Sinn Féin or the republican movement. It is my view that one does not boycott an entire community because it happens to vote for or support a party one does not agree with. My policy is always one of engagement, not one of boycotts or no platform. That is one of the reasons I was very honoured to have been invited to attend the launch.</p>
            <p eId="para_410"> The event was set up in what was a very dark time in west Belfast when Belfast was a very difficult city to live in, very different to what it is now. When it was set up it gave people, in particular young people and children, a little bit of light in their lives during the summer and a little bit of hope. I do not think that is a bad thing. Other people who have attended in the past include Arlene Foster, Michael Moore, Noam Chomsky, Reg Empey and Mary McAleese. I cannot attend because I am not available the week it is on, but if the opportunity arises in future years I would like to be able to attend some of the events. I really do not think that launching an event is an endorsement of the entire programme. People launch film festivals, theatre festivals and art exhibitions. That does not mean they are endorsing everything on the programme or every piece of art that is being displayed. I think that is a very narrow-minded view. It is almost the kind of view one would have heard from Archbishop McQuaid or extreme Catholics in the past, that even to attend an event or launch an event implies an endorsement. It is a form of censorship and backward thinking that I do not share. It is the new version of the kind of extremism that existed in the past. The shoe is on the other foot so often when it comes to matters like this.</p>
            <p eId="para_411"> In terms of tectonic plates, Deputy Howlin is absolutely right - tectonic plates do shift slowly and also quickly. That is the nature of tectonic plates, but I did not say anything about tectonic plates on my visit at all. I did say that I was opposed to a Border poll and that I think it is a bad idea at this time and for the foreseeable future. First, I think it would be defeated, and all the polling indicates that. I also think it would be divisive and now is not a time when we need further division in Northern Ireland. I also think in particular it would send out the wrong message at this time of Brexit when all the time the Government is saying to the unionist parties and the unionist community that we have no hidden agenda when it comes to Brexit. All we want from Brexit is to retain the relationships we have currently, namely, that there is no hard border, that citizens’ rights are protected and that we do not see Brexit as an opportunity to change the constitutional status of Northern Ireland. We are not going to try to take advantage of Brexit or exploit it to bring about a united Ireland any faster than the people of Northern Ireland want it. That is why we need to be very careful about these types of things.</p>
            <p eId="para_412"> The same thing would apply to the suggestion of a forum on the issue. In principle, the idea of a forum on what a united Ireland might look like in the future sounds attractive. We could have a discussion with civic society and political parties on what that might look like but the difficulty is that I feel, in particular at this time, when people are talking about border polls and Brexit, that the vast majority of people who feel themselves to be British - the vast majority of unionist people - would not participate in that and then it would be seen as a pan-nationalist gathering or front.</p>

            <p eId="para_416">I have given my view on that, in the North and in an op-ed. My view on this is very simple. Any right or freedom that an Irish citizen has in Ireland and any right or freedom that a British citizen has in Britain should be enjoyed by Irish and British citizens in Northern Ireland, and that applies to things like marriage equality and abortion rights. I have said that to Prime Minister May. I have said it publicly, but ultimately this is a decision that should be made by the Northern Ireland Executive and the Northern Ireland Assembly, not by people in Dublin or London.</p>

            <p eId="para_423">Cabinet committee E covers issues relating to the health service including health system reforms. The next meeting of this Cabinet committee has not yet been scheduled but last week I met the Ministers for Health and Finance, Deputies Harris and Donohoe, to discuss the Sláintecare implementation report. In addition to meetings of the full Cabinet and Cabinet committees, I meet with Ministers on an individual basis as required to focus on particular issues. In this regard I meet regularly with the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, to discuss the challenges facing the health service.</p>
            <p eId="para_424"> The Government is committed to enhancing the quality of the health service and has allocated significant capital funding for investment in health infrastructure of €10.9 billion over the next ten years. This will provide major investment projects and programmes, including the provision of 2,600 additional acute hospital beds to be delivered across all hospitals, along with significant reform initiatives. Investment in our health services must go hand in hand with reform.</p>
            <p eId="para_425"> A number of actions have been advanced on foot of the Sláintecare report including the independent working group, chaired by Donal de Buitléir, which is examining the impact of removing private practice from public hospitals. We expect that working group to report later this year. We have commenced a public consultation on the geographical alignment of hospital groups and Community Healthcare Organisations, CHOs, as recommended in the Sláintecare report. The Minister for Health has also begun discussions with general practitioner representatives on the reform of the GP contract, while reductions have been made to prescription charges, in line with the Sláintecare recommendations.</p>
            <p eId="para_426"> The Government’s implementation plan will be published in the coming weeks and the recruitment of a lead executive for the programme is well advanced. We are awaiting final confirmation and will then inform the House of the identity of the new lead executive. Work is also underway to strengthen the governance arrangements in the HSE. The Minister for Health has published the general scheme of the Health (Amendment) Bill to establish a HSE board and earlier this month the Public Appointments Service advertised the position of chairperson of that board. This will be a different position to that which existed in the past. It will come with remuneration so that whoever is appointed will be able to devote two days per week or more to the role.</p>

            <from>Deputy Joan Burton<recordedTime time="2018-06-20T13:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_427">In the context of the Taoiseach's previous answer, I recall that during the last general election campaign in Dublin West the Taoiseach's slogan over the final days of the campaign was "Don't let Sinn Féin turn west Dublin into west Belfast". Having campaigned on that slogan, the Taoiseach's previous reply suggests that those who do not know history are condemned to repeat it.</p>
            <p eId="para_428"> The first issue I wish to raise regarding the health services is one that I have raised here previously. Where stand those who work in section 39 organisations? I am talking about the tens of thousands of workers in organisations funded through section 39 who experienced pay reductions at the beginning of the economic crisis. The Government of which the Labour Party was a member, through the then Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, put in place a mechanism for restoring public service pay and it was understood that section 39 organisations were to follow. These are people who work in hospices, in Rehab, in the Irish Wheelchair Association and in a wide variety of organisations vital to the health service. We know that discussions are ongoing with the Department of Health. In the summer economic statement which was published yesterday a sum of €2.6 billion has been set aside for "commitments". Does the money set aside in the summer economic statement include funding to restore pay levels for staff working in section 39 organisations or is their pay claim buried somewhere in the bowels of the Department of Health? Will those workers be left with no choice but to initiate the industrial action which they have threatened but stalled because the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance promised them meaningful discussions?</p>
            <p eId="para_429"> The Taoiseach made reference to Sláintecare in his reply. Sláintecare is a product of new politics in this Dáil to which all parties and Independent Deputies genuinely contributed. However, 18 months after first talking about it, the Government has not yet appointed an executive director of the Sláintecare implementation office. We all know that without an implementation pathway, it will be almost impossible to achieve anything. What is the fate of new politics as expressed in the comprehensive agreement between all of the Members of the Oireachtas? Where stands that now? Is it sidelined and jettisoned or does the Government intend to proceed with it?</p>
            <p eId="para_430"> There has been much debate on public radio lately around peoples' experiences of the health service. We can all agree that when one gets into the health system, the service is often very good. However, the bureaucracy and managerial confusion is heartbreaking. People go onto waiting lists which just get longer and longer. Sláintecare was meant to address that but the Government has not even addressed the implementation of same.</p>

            <p eId="para_432">It will come as no surprise to the Taoiseach that I raise an issue which is causing great concern in my region of the south east. There have been a number of resignations from psychiatric teams, particularly in the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services, CAMHS in Wexford. One of the consultant psychiatrists, Dr. Kieran Moore, said that he was resigning from the Wexford team because "it's untenable and unsafe". He also said that two of his colleagues were resigning for the same reason. There is real concern about psychiatric services across the country but the most acute and immediate concerns arise in the south east and in County Wexford in particular. What will the Government do to ensure that there is no hiatus whereby there are no mental health services available to the most vulnerable of people?</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_258">
            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin<recordedTime time="2018-06-20T13:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_433">The Government's decision to delay the implementation plan for Sláintecare is deeply cynical. The Government wanted to avoid a winter crisis last year but more importantly, it wanted to avoid the Estimates and the provision that would have been necessary for the establishment of an office, the development of an implementation plan, the changes to budgets and so on. This was all referenced subsequently by the HSE's director general. We are now hearing, as confirmed by the Taoiseach, that the plans will be announced in two to three weeks' time, but surely the plan should be announced to the Oireachtas Committee that was responsible for the development of Sláintecare. Will the Taoiseach or the Minister for Health commit to going before that committee to announce the plans to its members and chairperson? Otherwise, we will just see yet another Government signature launch with over the top claims, days of strategically placed articles in newspapers, active partisan briefing and so on. It is stretching credibility to a considerable degree that it would take 18 months to publish implementation plans. Perhaps this suggests that deep down and behind the scenes, despite the public announcements, the Government's heart is not in the Sláintecare plan and that it is not going to implement key elements of same.</p>
            <p eId="para_434"> Yesterday the Taoiseach said that costings for the global footprint strategy were not mentioned at the launch of the strategy but were included in a follow-up document. I ask the Taoiseach to give us an assurance that he will produce detailed, year to year spending and activity proposals for Sláintecare when he is announcing the implementation plans. Sláintecare represents the formal burying of the failed experiment of moving to compulsory health insurance initiated by the former Minister for Health, now Senator James Reilly, and followed up by the Taoiseach when he was Minister for Health. While off the record briefings regularly distanced the Taoiseach from this policy, the record shows a long series of measures announced by him which he said represented the steps in implementing the plan. If one looks at the massive increases in waiting lists during that period, there is a perfect correlation between the so-called reforms and increases in waiting times and delays in accident and emergency departments. Has any work been undertaken to undo the damage caused by many of these ill-fated changes?</p>

            <p eId="para_439">Some people in here would probably like to roll back the clock to a time when Sinn Féin did not have 500,000 voters on the island of Ireland, including many in west Belfast. The people have a right to choose who they want to represent them. Thankfully, more and more people have come towards Sinn Féin in each election.</p>
            <p eId="para_440"> My question relates to Cabinet committee E. The leader of Fianna Fáil has again demanded more investment in Sláintecare and all the rest. We know that cannot happen without the necessary investment. The Government and its partners in Fianna Fáil have set the limited parameters of this year's budget. The €800 million that is available is not exclusively for health. It will have to be used to deal with other areas of need, including the two-tier pay structure across the public service and social welfare. The Taoiseach has suggested that there may be tax cuts. The reality is that Sláintecare will not get off the ground unless the Government makes the necessary investment. Fianna Fáil can argue that we need this, that and the other, but it cannot happen on magic beans. We cannot open additional hospital beds or build capacity within our services on the basis of IOUs on the back of brown envelopes. The Government needs to make decisions and choices. When will we see a plan for the investment of approximately €3 billion that is being called for under Sláintecare to bring about a transformation in the issues that have been presided over by the Government with the support of Fianna Fáil every step of the way? The failure to draw up such a plan has led to the scandalous situation we have today. People are waiting two years for assessments. Scoliosis patients are waiting three years for their first appointments. Some 707,000 people are on hospital waiting lists and many more are on trolleys. The health service is facing many challenges. When can we expect the assisted human reproduction Bill to be published? Has it been considered by Cabinet committee E? In light of the number of complex issues involved in that legislation, would it be possible to deal with sections 2 and 3 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 in a separate Bill as a means of resolving the issues being faced by same-sex couples? Has this been considered by Cabinet committee E? What is the Government's intention in this regard?</p>

            <p eId="para_442">I want to ask about child mental health services, which have been raised by Deputy Howlin. I think the Taoiseach needs to say something about this serious matter. Child psychiatrists are resigning because they believe child psychiatric services are "untenable and unsafe". This problem is not isolated to Wexford. I will not go into individual cases. I am aware of other areas where exactly the same thing is happening. The numbers of child psychiatrists and mental health teams are not adequate. There are not enough staff, resources and primary care services. Too many people are being referred to the psychiatrists. Essentially, they are under pressure to prescribe drugs. If they do not want to do that because their clinical judgment is that they should not do so, they get into trouble with managers who just want to tick boxes. That is what is going on. The Taoiseach needs to say that child psychiatrists and specialists in this area should act on their clinical judgment and should do what they believe is best in their clinical judgment. Managers should not be forcing them to do things they do not consider right to do. It is very important to send out that message. If we are going to ensure these services are safe, tenable and of the standard necessary to do what they are supposed to do for young and vulnerable people, we need to ensure primary care services and mental health teams are properly resourced.</p>

They range in size from small organisations that receive just €10,000 in State funding to major employers that receive most of their income from the HSE or the Department of Health. The staff of section 39 organisations are not employed by the State and do not receive public sector pensions. The various section 39 organisations approached and dealt with the financial crisis in different ways. Some of them cut pay and some of them did not. Some of them are compliant with public pay policy and some of them are very much not. Some of them have restored pay and some of them have not. St. Francis Hospice in my constituency has restored pay to its staff. I am aware that other section 39 hospices have not done so.</p>

            <p eId="para_453">There is a lot going on in this space. There is now a process under way to examine this and resolve it. I am sure it will result in a cost to the taxpayer. We do not yet know what that cost will be. That is part of the work that is being done. It is difficult to allocate money until one knows the actual estimate.</p>
            <p eId="para_454"> Reference has been made to mental health services in the south east. Timely access to care is an essential part of good healthcare. We are committed to achieving this by increasing the funding allocated for mental health services. Indeed, the amount of money allocated for these services has increased by over €200 million each year since 2012. One CAMHS consultant in the Waterford-Wexford area is moving to Dublin. Two locums, who hold temporary posts in any case, will be resigning in August 2018. The Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, is meeting local representatives of the HSE CAMHS to discuss the actions that need to be taken to ensure people in the south east who need care continue to receive it. The Minister of State has scheduled a round-table meeting of all CAMHS service providers in the coming weeks. While there is no doubt that recruitment in this area is difficult, it is being dealt with. The HSE is currently operating a national and international recruitment campaign for CAMHS consultant psychiatrists. The service in the south east plans to draw on this resource to fill positions on a permanent basis, in addition to vacancies being filled on an interim or temporary basis. The recruitment of 114 assistant psychologists and 22 psychologists for primary care child psychology services has almost been completed, with 111 of the 114 assistant psychologist places and 20 of the 22 psychologist places having been filled. Of those who are being recruited, 13 will be assigned to CHO 5, which includes the south east.</p>
            <p eId="para_455"> Improvements are being made to children's counselling services. It is intended to extend the new Jigsaw service, which is already in Cork, Limerick and Dublin, to 13 sites nationally. The HSE is in the final stages of recruiting the staff required to deliver a mental health service seven days a week in areas that do not have a seven-day service currently. The annual number of undergraduate psychiatric nursing places will increase from the current level of approximately 270 to approximately 400 by the end of the decade. It is important to point out that in April, the total number of people on the CAMHS waiting list reduced by 76 to 2,615. The number of people who have been waiting for more than a year decreased from 386 in March to 356 in April. While I appreciate that too many people are waiting for too long, it is not the case that these waiting lists are increasing.</p>
            <p eId="para_456"> I think Sláintecare is a good plan. Those who are proposing it have admitted that it is at best a plan for a plan. There is no implementation plan. The Government has been tasked with drawing up such a plan and that is exactly what we are doing. There is a lot to be done because the costings were off. A lot of work has had to be done in that respect. There are issues with the phasing, which proposes that we extend free GP care to an extra 500,000 people each year. Members of the committee will privately admit they do not think it is a good idea because the capacity does not exist to extend by 500,000 a year the number of people with free GP care. It is just too quick, given the capacity constraints that exist in GP surgeries and elsewhere in primary care. It would probably lead to waiting lists to see GPs, which would not be desirable.</p>
            <p eId="para_457">I say that as the person who brought in free GP care for those over 70 and under six and announced the decision to extend medical cards as a right to children with serious disabilities. It is something I am very much committed to doing but I honestly believe that an extra half a million a year would be too quick, would overwhelm the services and would make them worse for everyone, not better for some.</p>
            <p eId="para_458"> I was asked about the transformation fund. It is there in Project Ireland 2040. There is a commitment of €10 billion to be invested over ten years in buildings. There are three hospitals now under construction. The national children's hospital was promised forever by successive health Ministers and is now very much under construction. The new National Rehabilitation Hospital in Dún Laoghaire is under construction. The new forensic mental health campus is under construction in Portrane. Some 100 primary care centres are now up and running. It will also involve the additional acute beds that are needed under the capacity review, additional equipment, and investment in ICT. If there is a game changer in health, it is going to be in ICT.</p>

            <p eId="para_463">I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, for being in the House to answer my questions. I call on the Minister for Health to urgently address the failings identified in a review of paediatric audiology services provided in more than 900 cases by one audiologist in counties Mayo and Roscommon in the period from 2011 to 2015 which may have left some children with lifelong hearing impairments. I congratulate "RTÉ Investigates" on another outstanding piece of work in uncovering this issue. As we now know, the HSE carried out a review of services provided in counties Mayo and Roscommon in the period from 2011 to 2015. More than 900 cases were examined and 49 children found to be affected. This is yet another unbelievable failure on the part of the HSE. It is staggering to think the particular audiologist had been working in the Mayo-Roscommon area for more than ten years. It is unforgivable that many of the children identified in the review may be left with lifelong hearing impairments. It is utterly shocking. What good is the apology that has been given to the families if their children were at an increased risk of a missed diagnosis or may be left with lifelong hearing impairments?</p>
            <p eId="para_464"> I also understand the clinical team which undertook the review found that many of the hearing assessments did not meet national audiology standards. Time and again, we hear about failures in the HSE such that it is now extremely difficult for the public to have faith in the organisation, which is a pity because there are some things it does very well and there are some excellent front-line staff, as the Minister of State has seen. If the review only covered the period from 2011 to 2015, what about the many other cases with which the individual audiologist was involved given that they worked in the Mayo-Roscommon area for over ten years? I call on the Minister - I know that the Minister of State is here to represent him - to clarify whether the review will be extended to cover the full period the audiologist worked in Mayo-Roscommon area, as well as to other parts of the country where they may also have worked. I have submitted a number of parliamentary questions on this matter in a bid to seek urgent clarification on this latest unwelcome development. </p>
            <p eId="para_465"> I have been contacted by a constituent whose daughter was misdiagnosed by the audiology service. Although the constituent was told that her child's hearing had not been impaired, her mother's instinct led her to pay for a private consultation and the child did have a hearing impediment. The family paid privately for an operation to deal with the problem. They paid over €2,000 to have their child's hearing impediment corrected and hearing protected. Will they receive a refund, given that it was HSE failings that led them to seek private treatment?</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Jim Daly)<recordedTime time="2018-06-20T15:00:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_466">I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to address the issue. This is an important forum in which to raise such issues where the Deputy has a chance to represent the views of the people he has the honour to represent to bring their fears and concerns to the fore and receive answers. On the other side, it provides an opportunity for the HSE, not to defend but to explain some of the background and put it in context.</p>
            <p eId="para_467"> Concerns raised by the HSE assistant clinical lead for audiology services in Mayo-Roscommon arising from a routine review of services in 2015 led to a look-back of paediatric services provided between 2011 and 2015. The HSE finalised the report on the look-back and shared it with the 49 families concerned on 7 June 2018. The report represents a thorough analysis of the quality of service delivery in the area against standards for such services that were set out in the national audiology review group's report. Since 2011, the recommendations made in the report, including on clinical governance and quality assurance processes, have been the benchmark for the quality of service delivery throughout the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_468"> The report and accompanying communication from the HSE include a clear apology for the failures identified and the anxiety caused for families and those who might have been harmed. The HSE has invited the parents of the children to meet a senior manager and a senior audiologist to discuss the findings made in the report and be updated on their child's care. Some have taken up this offer. The HSE has stated all of the families affected were informed that the audit was taking place and verbally advised of the reasons. All 49 children who needed a follow-up as a result of the look-back process are either receiving or have already received the appropriate care they need.</p>
            <p eId="para_469"> To respond to the Deputy's question about the audiologist's previous working arrangements, the HSE is reviewing the employment history of the individual clinician who provided the service. The review is being expedited. It is appropriate that the health service strive continually to improve the quality of the services it provides and promote a culture of learning in which shortcomings are identified.</p>
            <p eId="para_470"> The priority of the Minister for Health in regard to the families and children on whom the findings of this look-back have had an impact is that the HSE takes swift action, including the provision of appropriate care, and the Minister is satisfied this has been done in this case. In addition, the HSE now has clinical governance and a quality assurance process in place for its audiology services, including any contracted services. This is in line with the national audiology review group report published in 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_471"> The recommendations made in the look-back report on policies, procedures, team-based approach, audits as part of clinical governance, care pathways, recording of client information and service level agreements for external providers have been addressed and completed at both regional and national level. Outstanding recommendations, including the roll-out of an audiology patient management system, are being progressed.</p>

            <p eId="para_472">While I welcome the Minister of State's response, it is not adequate, and I am sure he will acknowledge I say that sincerely. The Minister of State is here to represent the Minister, Deputy Harris. In his contribution, he referred to the swift action of the HSE. He is quite an intelligent man. This review goes back five years and we could be looking at cases going back ten years with regard to a failure within the system. I would not call that swift action. More seriously, 49 of those who were reviewed were found not to have been properly diagnosed. If they ended up with issues for life, would the Minister of State or I not feel guilty? Should the HSE not feel guilty? Apologies are no good at this stage. Everyone who has been offered further assistance should take it up, however, and I am sure most of them will.</p>
            <p eId="para_473"> This is a very serious matter. It is more serious because the issue goes back over ten years whereas the review deals with five years. The HSE needs to revisit this and examine where this audiologist was working. Perhaps there could be an audit of the equipment as there might be equipment issues, although I do not know that. We have to stop this. People have trust in the service but they are let down by it. I rest my case.</p>

            <p eId="para_474">I note the sincerity and passion of the Deputy, who is noted for that in any of his presentations in this Chamber and in any other fora where I have had pleasure of working with him. To put this in context, a national audiology group was established in 2011 and one of its recommendations was that a national clinical lead be appointed. Subsequent to the recommendation, a national clinical lead for all audiology services was appointed, and in 2015, that national clinical lead carried out a routine review of a series of cases, something that is done periodically. Concerns arose during that routine review which led to this very specific look-back, which covered all the cases from 2011 to 2015.</p>
            <p eId="para_475"> The Deputy's community healthcare organisation, CHO, area was one of two CHO areas that had to outsource work to external staff due to the lack of available staff expertise within the CHO area. It was a routine review, like others carried out periodically in all services. There will be such situations, given 110,000 people are working in the HSE. Unless we robotise it and have procedures carried out by robots, there will always be error, which is a fact of life where human beings are involved. It is important that the HSE continues to carry out all of these routine reviews and reacts to any red flag that is raised, as it did in this case. I am not here to defend anybody, just to explain the situation. The HSE had a proper look-back for the cases from 2011 to 2015 and it identified these anomalies. As the Deputy knows, 990 children were called back and some were deemed to have issues arising. All of those children are either getting care at present or have received the care they need.</p>

            <p eId="para_476">In recent years the Tidy Towns has put in Trojan work in making villages and, indeed, Ireland look a better place, especially for tourists. I know more people are back at work throughout the country, which is welcome. We have to bear in mind, however, that those communities voluntarily put in a massive effort, week in, week out, to keep their village or town in pristine condition. The aid of community employment, Tús and the rural social scheme has brought great benefits in regard to making all of those villages look better through the work that is done, and Ireland would not look as good if this work were not done. Unfortunately, in the past year, while it is a sign that more people are getting work, which we appreciate, some schemes now have to pay people to cut the grass and do other jobs, which they do not have the money for, as the Minister of State will know, given where he is from.</p>
            <p eId="para_477"> I spoke to the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, before Christmas and she told me the Department would consider various measures. I know that people can go on Tús or a CE scheme through Seetec, but we need to look outside that. We need to make sure that if there is no replacement for a person, that person is left in place until the replacement is found. Otherwise, a village will be left without help. In addition, we should make a call and let people over 55 continue. If I get a job somewhere, I will go to it, but people should be given the opportunity to stay on a scheme because there are villages which are struggling at the moment to keep on top of things, whether painting, cleaning or cutting grass. Despite the great voluntary efforts these communities have made, from Donegal right down to the Minister of State's area, and from Dublin to Connemara, this is being undermined due to what is happening.</p>

            <from>Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív<recordedTime time="2018-06-20T15:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_478">At the moment there are 350 unfilled vacancies in the rural social scheme, 4,850 in the community employment scheme and 1,849 in the Tús scheme. It is not that there are not people who want to go on the schemes. It is that the rules, particularly in regard to Tús and CE, are ridiculously strict. I could never get my head around the logic of why we prefer to pay people on condition they do not work but seek work, rather than pay them on condition that they do work. The reality is that the difference between a Tús worker and somebody getting jobseeker's allowance is about €5,000 a year, which is quite small. The Minister of State might say €5,000 is a lot but if we take the 2,000 Tús vacancies and multiply that by €5,000, it gives us €10 million a year. To the Minister of State and me, that is a lot of money, but when we take it that the budget of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection is €20 billion, then €10 million out of €20 billion is the equivalent of €10 out of €20,000, and we would not think spending that was big expenditure. If we spent just that much, we would say we have not spent any of it yet.</p>
            <p eId="para_479"> How can the Minister of State deal with this issue practically? He could say that where there are Tús vacancies that cannot be filled by eligible people, those who are on the scheme could stay for a second or third year on the Tús scheme. It is as simple as that to resolve this and fill all the places.</p>

            <p eId="para_480">I thank both Deputies for raising this issue and giving me an opportunity to address the House on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty. Work schemes such as Tús and community employment schemes are positive initiatives that enable the long-term unemployed to make a contribution to their communities while upskilling themselves for prospective future employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_481">The rural social scheme, RSS, provides farmers and fishermen with income support, while they also make a contribution to their community. Tús and the rural social scheme are delivered and managed at local level through the network of local development companies and Udarás na Gaeltachta, known as the implementing bodies, each of which has been awarded a specific quota of Tús and RSS participants based on the ability to source suitable placements. Community employment schemes are typically sponsored by groups, known as sponsors, wishing to benefit the local community. The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection agrees participant numbers annually with each community employment sponsor organisation which, in turn, is responsible for the recruitment of participants and identifying suitable work placements. The current number on the live register is comparable with the figure in May 2008. The average number of participants supported in 2008 was 25,351, composed of 22,785 under the community employment scheme and 2,566 under the rural social scheme, whereas participants did not commence under the Tús initiative until 2011. There are 38,152 places available under these initiatives, of which 26,542 are under the community employment scheme, 3,350 are under the rural social scheme and 8,260 are under Tús.</p>
            <p eId="para_482"> In the context of economic recovery, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection undertook a review of all work programmes in 2016. Arising from the review, the Government agreed to implement changes to the qualifying conditions for Tús, the rural social scheme and the community employment scheme in order to broaden access for a wider range of people. Since 1 June, the Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, has also been facilitating persons to take up a placement under the community employment scheme or Tús while also attending their JobPath providers. </p>
            <p eId="para_483"> The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection has examined expenditure on the work schemes to ensure we will continue to deliver best value for the taxpayer and ensure the best use is being made of funding in this area. In that context, a decision was made to reduce the overall number of places under Tús to 6,500. The Department has engaged with the Irish Local Development Network, ILDN, which is the representative body for the Tús implementation bodies, and individually with each such body to seek to implement the reduction in participant numbers from 8,260 to 6,500 before year end.</p>
            <p eId="para_484"> As the Deputies are aware, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has taken the lead in addressing the entitlement of community employment scheme supervisors to occupational pensions. A community sector high level forum, chaired by the Department, is examining the issue. Other Departments, including the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, are represented on the group, as are the unions and Pobal. The group has held a number of meetings. Community employment scheme supervisors are employees of private companies in the community and voluntary sector which receive public funding. They are not employees of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection or public servants and, as such, were not subject to pay reductions under the provisions of the FEMPI legislation which only applied to public servants. A detailed scoping exercise was carried out with an input from the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service, IGEES, on the potential cost of providing Exchequer support for the establishment of a pension scheme for employees across the community and voluntary sector. The exercise clearly illustrated that this matter presented very significant issues for the Exchequer, with a potential cost to the State of €188 million per annum in respect of funding to enable an employer pension contribution in State funded community and voluntary organisations. That sum excludes provision for immediate <i>ex gratia</i> lump sum pension payments as sought, which could, depending on the size of the sector involved, entail a further Exchequer cost of up to €318 million.</p>

            <p eId="para_485">With all due respect, whoever wrote that reply did not even look at what we were talking about. We are talking about small villages and towns. Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív provided the Minister of State with statistics for the numbers of positions which remain unfilled nationally. We are not worried about all of the things that civil servant, or whoever it was, wrote in that long palaver. We are talking about ordinary people from County Donegal to County Cork and from Connemara to Dublin who are trying to keep villages in shape and cannot fill positions. The Minister of State should tell the civil servant concerned that they cannot fill the positions, yet he or she has given us a palaver on a piece of paper about everything bar what we want to know. We need solutions. We need to put people in a position where they can stay in a job, particularly if they are over 55 years of age. As Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív pointed out, it is worth €5,000 extra a year. What is the value to tourism of what the people in question have done throughout the country in every small village and town? That is what we need to address, not the rigmarole in the reply.</p>

            <p eId="para_486">Perhaps in his second reply the Minister of State might tell us how many are in receipt of long-term jobseeker's allowance. In other words, how many have been in receipt of the allowance for more than one year? The longer someone is on the allowance, the less likely it is he or she will ever find employment on a sustainable basis. </p>
            <p eId="para_487"> The second issue which has been totally ignored is that the older one gets, the more difficult it becomes to find commercial employment. I suggest two changes. Rather than cut the Tús scheme which is totally regressive, once someone is over 50 years of age, he or she should be able to stay on the scheme for as long as he or she wants. Second, everybody, no matter what age he or she is, should be offered a second year on the Tús scheme or the community employment scheme where there is no one else to take his or her place. The reason the scheme was transferred from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation was that the latter was living in cloud cuckoo land where everyone in the country was going to find a commercial job. The Minister of State tells us there is full employment, but there are 100,000 people signing on. The reality is that there are people who will never find commercial employment. It is time the State faced up to this and politicians took charge of the issue and said the people in question would be better off working than idle.</p>

However, it was mentioned in the Topical Issue as set down in which the Deputies sought to discuss filling all available places on the rural social scheme, Tús and community employment schemes, as well as the provision of a pension scheme for supervisors. As such, a specific reference was included to pensions, to be fair to the civil servant who drafted the reply. I appreciate that neither Deputy has raised the issue, but, to be fair, that is hardly the fault of the civil servant.</p>

I will not engage in a guessing game on an issue on which I am not sure-footed, but I take the point the Deputy is trying to make. As Deputy Michael Fitzmaurice acknowledged, I also operate in a rural constituency and I am very familiar with the frustration felt by people at these schemes. There are many people who would like them to be extended in order that they could spend more than one year participating in them. There are also a lot of people in the over-55 year age cohort. I agree with the Deputies that I would like to see an extension in that regard. The Department is reviewing the schemes which were designed for another time, as acknowledged by successive Governments. Thankfully, we are in a different era economically and in terms of job creation, but I take the point that there are many who will not enter the workplace. That is a fact of life which is acknowledged and accepted. I will take the Deputies' suggestions to the Minister and her officials to ensure the points will be adequately reflected on in the Department.</p>

          <speech by="#SeanSherlock" eId="spk_294">
            <from>Deputy Sean Sherlock<recordedTime time="2018-06-20T15:20:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_495">This is a very simple issue. I have been in contact with a member of An Garda Síochána who would be very happy, should the opportunity arise, to take up an offer of official accommodation in Buttevant, County Cork. He is a person of impeccable character, as are his family. I have been going around the houses on this issue with the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Minister of State with responsibility for the OPW, Deputy Kevin Boxer Moran. I have asked a number of parliamentary questions as to whether it would be possible to ensure the house in question would be allocated to the individual garda. While it requires some refurbishment, it is nothing major. The case speaks to the wider issue of the significant number of official Garda residences nationally which are empty at this time. With a little investment and refurbishment, it would be possible to place gardaí and their families in these residences which would give them a footprint and a great presence in local communities which might not otherwise have it. There are more than 300 such residences nationally, some of which are occupied, while others are not.</p>
            <p eId="para_496">I asked the Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Boxer Moran, the state of play. I got a lovely letter back from him stating that while Buttevant Garda station is in the ownership of the Commissioners of Public Works, matters relating to Garda accommodation do not come under the remit of his office and are instead a matter for An Garda Síochána. The application came up the line through the ranks of An Garda Síochána and it was sent back down the line again because the Garda was told this was a matter for the OPW.</p>
            <p eId="para_497"> I am confused. I would dearly love to be able to say to the person who has come to me that their application is being considered seriously because the applicant is a member of the Garda and this is an official Garda residence, but it seems that somewhere it is getting caught between the Department of Justice and Equality and the OPW. It seems that the Commissioners of Public Works, quite simply, do not want to deal with this issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_498"> I am sure that the Minister of State will tell me here today that it is not necessarily a matter for the Department of Justice and Equality on the basis that it does not have the resources to make such refurbishments of official dwellings, but I would hope that the Government, through the Minister of State, Deputy Moran, who in fairness is a straight man and an honourable person, his colleagues in the Independent Alliance and the Ministers in Fine Gael, would deal with the issue of Garda accommodation because it represents an opportunity to put gardaí and their families into unoccupied residences. For the want of a few bob, and a small few bob at that, it would represent good value for money because it would put gardaí back into the communities, particularly in rural settings.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government (Deputy John Paul Phelan)<recordedTime time="2018-06-20T15:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_499">I am taking this matter for the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, who regrets his absence but who has official commitments at the same time. Both he and I thank Deputy Sherlock for raising it.</p>
            <p eId="para_500"> It is a good issue for a Topical Issue debate because we all will be aware of villages around the country where there are Garda stations, many of which are still operational and have residences attached or in their grounds. Most of them are in central locations in villages or on the entrance to villages and tend to be landmark buildings where an improvement and use of the accommodation by a garda and his or her family would bring many benefits to the community as well as to the station itself.</p>
            <p eId="para_501"> As the Deputy will be aware, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for managing and controlling generally the administration and business of An Garda Síochána. Furthermore, the programme of replacement and refurbishment of Garda accommodation is progressed by the Garda authorities working in close co-operation with the OPW. The Minister has no direct responsibility, as the Deputy pointed out.</p>
            <p eId="para_502"> There has been significant investment in Garda resources throughout the State in recent years. Considerable efforts are being made by the Government to enhance the working environment generally for members of An Garda Síochána, and major investment has been committed under the capital plan 2016 to 2021 to upgrade Garda premises.</p>
            <p eId="para_503"> The Garda station building and refurbishment programme is an ambitious five-year programme based on agreed Garda priorities which will benefit more than 30 locations and includes €60 million of Exchequer funding. The programme is providing new stations and modernising older stations at key locations around the country, ensuring a safe, modern working environment for members and staff of the Garda as well as fit-for-purpose facilities for visitors, victims and suspects.</p>
            <p eId="para_504"> Dwelling units, known as official accommodation properties, are a matter for the Garda authorities in conjunction with the OPW, and the Minister for Justice and Equality has no direct role in these matters. I understand that the Minister has been informed by the Garda authorities that it is a matter for respective divisional officers in An Garda Síochána in the first instance to identify official accommodation properties that require attention before they can be allocated to a member of An Garda Síochána, having regard to the policing needs of the division.</p>
            <p eId="para_505"> I understand that the Minister is further informed by the Garda authorities that the most recently available survey of official accommodation was completed by An Garda Síochána in conjunction with the OPW in April of 2018. At that point, there were 221 official accommodation properties throughout the State. These properties are attached to or form part of the curtilage of Garda stations, mainly in rural areas. Of this total, the Garda authorities advise that at the time of the survey, 99 official accommodation properties were inhabited and 122 were vacant. Of the vacant units, 12 were considered to be habitable. I am informed that it was considered that the remaining units would require significant investment but that to ascertain the costs involved in bringing these official accommodation properties up to standard, detailed surveys of each property would be required. Any such survey would be a matter for An Garda Síochána in conjunction with the OPW. I understand that An Garda Síochána has advised the Minister that it liaises closely with the OPW on all matters relating to the Garda estate, including official accommodation, having regard to the funding available and the accommodation priorities of An Garda Síochána.</p>
            <p eId="para_506"> Of the 122 vacant premises, 12 are habitable. That means 110 need substantial work. It would be a wise investment by the OPW. I will certainly bring the point up with the Minister of State, Deputy Moran, to see that a programme to redevelop Garda accommodation properties throughout the country would take effect.</p>

            <from>Deputy Sean Sherlock<recordedTime time="2018-06-20T15:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_507">I welcome the Minister of State's response. I acknowledge there are limitations. He is not telling me what I want to hear in respect of the particular case.</p>
            <p eId="para_508"> It would be useful for the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, to know that in his own county of Kilkenny there are nine such premises. I asked the question lately of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. I asked him what number of residences were under his remit and how many were available to An Garda Síochána for official accommodation. He told me, for instance, that there were nine in Kilkenny, 19 in the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's fair county, and 34 in my county. I refer specifically to one such station, which is Buttevant.</p>
            <p eId="para_509"> The fundamental point is that for the sake of a relatively small investment in terms of the State's resources, an opportunity could be created for members of An Garda Síochána to live within their communities. Even though they may not be stationed there, there would at least be a presence. Families would be housed at the same time.</p>

            <p eId="para_511">I need clarification on the numbers that have been furnished to me. I have asked the question. I do not always get a straight answer when I table a question in this House on matters relating to the OPW. The commissioners could be described as semi-autonomous.</p>
            <p eId="para_512"> The issue is that the matter has gone up the line through An Garda Síochána and has come back down the line. There was a figure involved for refurbishment. It could be argued that the figure mentioned is slightly high for what needs to be done. I would like the issue to be sorted because it represents an opportunity.</p>

            <p eId="para_513">There is no response other than I agree with Deputy Sherlock that there is an opportunity to get gardaí living in their communities. In addition, these places, mostly villages, have these landmark buildings that are lying vacant. It would be good for those villages to have people living in those buildings as well. I will certainly speak to the Minister of State, Deputy Moran. What is needed is a scheme of some sort. There has to be, first, a survey of what is required and the cost and then a scheme of funding to update these premises throughout the country.</p>

          <speech by="#JohnBrady" eId="spk_300">
            <from>Deputy John Brady<recordedTime time="2018-06-20T15:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_514">I raise the issue of North Wicklow Educate Together secondary school, which is based in Bray. It is a voluntary secondary school under the patronage of Educate Together. That patronage was awarded in 2015.</p>
            <p eId="para_515"> The school is in temporary accommodation in the old Presentation College in Bray and that lease is due to expire on 30 April next year. The Minister made an announcement last year that arrangements had been put in place. They had identified a site in Bray town centre and that announcement was made last June.</p>
            <p eId="para_516">Since that time, no information has come from the Department. North Wicklow Educate Together is completely in the dark. Some concerns have been raised regarding the site identified on the site of Bray Institute of Further Education in the town centre. That site is controlled by Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board. There have been some controversies regarding the former chief executive officer of the education and training board and these are being investigated. Unfortunately, it appears that North Wicklow Educate Together is somehow being implicated in or held up by these investigations.</p>
            <p eId="para_517"> A crisis is looming. There are 200 students in a school that could not be described as being fit for purpose. It started enrolling in September 2016 and is due to enrol its third year in September when there will be 200 pupils in the current premises. The private lease on the building will expire in April 2019 and the school principal and the parents and future parents of students of the school do not know where the school will be accommodated after that time. </p>
            <p eId="para_518"> I and other Deputies representing Wicklow have made numerous approaches to the Minister. The five Wicklow Deputies sent a joint letter to him and I have spoken to him on numerous occasions but no information has been forthcoming on the site that has been identified. Some concern has been raised by Bray Institute of Further Education, which believes it was not consulted in the process of identifying the site. We are now caught in a vacuum and this is not being helped by the lack of information from the Minister, who has ultimate responsibility, or his Department. Representatives of North Wicklow Educate Together met officials from the Department last week on foot of a meeting that had taken place the previous day with, I understand, the new CEO of the Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board. No information was given to Educate Together on what had been discussed with the CEO of the education and training board.</p>
            <p eId="para_519"> We have a principal, 200 pupils and their parents who do not know where their school will be in April next year. It is unfortunate that the Minister is not in the Chamber to provide some clarity or a timeframe on when the parents, children and staff of the school can expect to get into their new school, wherever it is located. I hope the Minister of State will be able to outline some of the timeframes and give clear information</p>

            <from>Deputy John Paul Phelan<recordedTime time="2018-06-20T15:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_520">I thank Deputy Brady. I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, who is not available as he is before the Seanad to take Committee Stage of the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2016.</p>
            <p eId="para_521"> I thank the Deputy for raising the matter as it provides me with the opportunity to clarify the current position regarding the accommodation needs of North Wicklow Educate Together post-primary school. As the Deputy is aware, a major capital project for the provision of permanent accommodation for North Wicklow Educate Together to cater for a long-term projected enrolment of 1,000 pupils is being addressed through the Department's six-year construction programme. The Department's capital programme continues to address the challenge posed by a rapidly increasing school population, including in areas such as County Wicklow. In addition to major school projects, the capital programme also provides for devolved funding for additional classrooms for schools where an immediate enrolment need has been identified or an additional teacher has been appointed.</p>
            <p eId="para_522"> The Action Plan for Education sets out the Government's ambitions for the education system, including the commitment contained in the programme for Government towards the prioritisation of school educational infrastructure. Following the capital review, additional capital funding of €332 million will be available to the schools sector, primarily from 2019 onwards, boosting investment in our primary and post-primary school infrastructure. This significant investment reflects the priority the Government has placed on education and delivering on our ambition to deliver a fair society and strong economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_523"> It is planned that in the period to 2021, more than 350 announced large-scale projects, including a major project for North Wicklow Educate Together, will be advanced under the Department's construction programme. An option for the location of a permanent site for North Wicklow Educate Together post-primary school is being finalised. The school was established in 2016. As an interim measure and with the assistance of the Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board, it was housed in a property leased by the ETB at the old presentation building at Putland Road in Bray, which the Deputy mentioned. The school opened with an enrolment of 36 pupils and numbers are growing incrementally, with an enrolment of 119 pupils in 2017. The Department is aware that the existing lease on the Putland Road building is due to expire in May 2019. Officials from the Department are continuing to liaise with Kildare and Wicklow ETB to ensure North Wicklow Educate Together has adequate accommodation to cater for its growing pupil numbers from September 2019 onwards.</p>
            <p eId="para_524"> I want to clarify for the Deputy that the Department is continuing to prioritise this matter and will liaise with the patron of North Wicklow Educate Together when a further update is available. As I indicated, the Department is liaising with the Kildare and Wicklow ETB in the context of a permanent school building for North Wicklow Educate Together and will liaise further with the Educate Together patron in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_525"> I again thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to outline the position to the House. I assure him that the Department is concerned to ensure that both the interim and long-term accommodation needs of North Wicklow Educate Together post-primary school will be provided for.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JohnBrady" eId="spk_302">
            <from>Deputy John Brady<recordedTime time="2018-06-20T15:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_526">I thank the Minister of State for the response. While I do not wish to shoot the messenger, it did not provide any clarity. We are facing a crisis. In April next year, up to 200 children will not have a premises in which to be educated. A site has been identified in Bray, about which questions have arisen. I am not sure how long the process will take or what is happening. According to the Minister of State, an option for the location of a permanent site for North Wicklow Educate Together post-primary school "is being finalised". An announcement was made last year that a site had been identified. The school is not under the patronage of the Kildare Wicklow Education and Training Board, yet the ETB seems to have more information than Educate Together, which is bizarre to say the least.</p>
            <p eId="para_527"> Information is key, as is the fact that the school is well aware that some sort of temporary accommodation will need to be provided until the new school is constructed. Educate Together is conscious and aware of that requirement but it does not want to move the school into temporary accommodation on a site somewhere in north Wicklow. We do not know where the school will be located. Under an exhaustive process, three sites were initially identified, two of which were quickly ruled out as being totally inaccessible, leaving only the site we are discussing. The school is conscious that interim arrangements will be required. It wants prefabricated buildings erected on the site on which the school will be permanently based from April 2019 onwards, wherever that site will be. Some form of temporary accommodation must be provided on the site on which the purpose built school will be located.</p>
            <p eId="para_528"> What we need are clear timeframes and that is what is lacking in the Minister of State's nonsensical and disappointing statement. Educate Together needs answers, not the Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board because the former and not the ETB is the patron. The principal, the school, the pupils and the people of north Wicklow, including me, need answers.</p>

            <p eId="para_529">As outlined in the response, the Minister will liaise with the patron of North Wicklow Educate Together when a further update is available. As regards the issue being finalised, I have not been give specific timeframes but the matter is a priority for Government. Nobody wants a scenario to arise where an active school does not have accommodation. There is no prospect of 200 students being homeless next May, as the Deputy suggested. Short-term measures are needed until the new school is built, after which a permanent home must be provided. The Minister made clear in the statement I read out that he will liaise with the patron of North Wicklow Educate Together to that effect.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_549">— the introduction of an integrated IT system in the Portuguese National Health Service (NHS) helped to achieve new maximum wait times by actively transferring those on the list from hospitals that are failing to meet the target to hospitals that have the ability to offer the service on time;</p>

          <p eId="para_563">I will share time with colleagues. There is not a family in Ireland unaffected by the crisis of hospital waiting lists. Statistically, one in every seven Irish people is on a list across the State. In May, the list grew to a new record of more than 707,000 people waiting for a medical procedure. On this list, there are 511,904 waiting for an outpatient procedure, 147,387 of which are outstanding for more than a year as of May. The inpatient waiting list was no different in its severity. In May, it stood at 79,649 with almost 6,000 waiting for over a year. These people are not numbers. They are living, breathing, feeling people who are on a list because they need medical attention and this State is washing its hands of its responsibility to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_564"> These lists can never be normalised or accepted. Excessive waiting times are an indicator of poor quality of care in a health system because they show that the system does not have the capacity to meet the demand for the service. The Minister will tell us, in some convoluted statistical way, how he is succeeding in reducing waiting lists but waiting lists are up, month on month, under this Minister and the Government. That is the truth, it is reality and it is life under this Fine Gael Government. I do not ask Members to take my word for it, however. The Euro Health Consumer Index 2017 found that Ireland has the worst hospital waiting lists in Europe. We are topping the league tables but, funnily enough, the Taoiseach left this out of his list of achievements last week.</p>
          <p eId="para_565"> The real cost of excessive waiting times is the huge distress and pain it causes to those people who are suffering, as well as to their families. The inability to see and treat patients within a medically acceptable and humane timeframe leads to poorer clinical outcomes and increased mortality. According to researchers at Trinity College Dublin, problems arise when waiting times grow longer than three months for non-urgent cases and some patients suffer deterioration in physical functioning, vitality, social functioning, mental health and general health when waiting longer than three months for a procedure. Excessive waits also contribute to hospital costs and inefficiencies because hospitals must use resources to administer waiting lists and to reassess patient conditions after their long waits.</p>
          <p eId="para_566"> Since my first day in here I have identified problems and I have proposed solutions. Waiting lists is one area where I have been consistent in arguing for proven solutions. The introduction of an integrated hospital management waiting list IT system in the Portuguese national health service helped to achieve new maximum wait times by actively transferring those on the list from hospitals that are failing to meet the target to hospitals that have the ability to offer the service on time. The IT model introduced by the Portuguese, alongside greater investment in public hospitals, has delivered significant and sustained reductions in waiting times for surgery since it was first introduced in 2004. The 2013 OECD publication, Waiting Time Policies in the Health Sector: What Works?, described how in Portugal, over five years, waiting lists for surgeries decreased by almost 35%, the median waiting times decreased by almost 63% and how variations across providers are also diminishing. That is international evidence but a similar, smaller system is also working right under our noses. The RCSI group was the only hospital group in the State which managed to reduce its outpatient waiting lists from May 2017 to May 2018, doing so by 2,613.</p>
          <p eId="para_567"> The Minister should look at the evidence as it is all there for us to see. He should introduce a new and single integrated hospital waiting list management IT system as used in the Portuguese national health service and by the RCSI group. He should properly invest in our public health system to tackle waiting lists and stop diverting public money into the hands of private health interests. I have said on many occasions - I hate to have to repeat myself but I love to be right - that when one invests in the private sector one will never improve the public sector. Investing in the public sector is how we improve the public sector and investing in the private sector is how we improve the private sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_568"> The motion also calls for the immediate implementation of the Sláintecare report in its entirety because the longer we wait for Sláintecare to be implemented, the more time will have to be made up. The solutions are there and there is an alternative. Those on the right of politics tell us there is no alternative and that the health service is broken beyond repair but I have argued for a long time that it is not. The solutions are there and we need to implement them.</p>

          <p eId="para_569">There are 361 citizens lying on hospital trolleys in the corridors of our hospitals all over the country as this motion is being debated. This figure represents 72 more than on the same date in 2017 and 43 more than on the same date in 2016. It is an indictment of us as a society that, when it comes to our health system, we now reference the suffering of our citizens as figures. We need to remind ourselves that these figures are our parents, our partners, our siblings, our children, our extended family members, our friends and our neighbours. Day after day, patients lying on these trolleys end up joining the ever-growing waiting lists for medical procedures across our health system. We have to realise that these waiting lists represent people suffering and in pain and, for many, lives suspended until they secure the operation they need.</p>
          <p eId="para_570"> In April, the Department launched a plan to reduce hospital waiting lists for those waiting longest to have the procedures carried out through the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF. I am sure these people will welcome the fact that, for them at least, an end to their suffering is in sight. There is, however, a systemic problem. The NTPF is a fudge, another Irish solution to an Irish problem. Capacity is the only solution to the seemingly never-ending problem. It is simply logical to decide that the only way to end years of long waiting lists, once and for all, is to build more capacity.</p>
          <p eId="para_571"> It frightens me when I hear of tax cuts and sweeteners for the rich in the upcoming budget and then look at the waiting lists in our hospitals and the lists to get our homeless families into suitable accommodation. The ordinary, decent, socially just people of Ireland deserve and demand better. Yes, those who get up early would much rather sacrifice an extra couple of euro weekly from their pocket if the Government could present and commit to a clear solution to a hospital waiting list crisis. I urge the Minister to be ambitious, to reach for the socially just conscience which I know he has to end the misery of our people and to choose investment in budget 2019, not giveaways to those who quite clearly do not require them.</p>

          <p eId="para_572">It seems that, as we approach budget 2019, the big debate in Fine Gael and the Government is how they will cut taxes, which taxes, by how much and for whom. I do not hear much from the party about fixing the problems in our health service or, indeed, any of our public services.</p>
          <p eId="para_573"> The Minister will know that there are long waiting lists in many specialties in University Hospital Waterford, as long as four years in some cases for people to see an orthopaedic consultant because we do not have enough of them. We still have beds closed in the hospital in Waterford and in community hospitals elsewhere in the county, because we do not have enough nurses to reopen beds that were closed. People are waiting for two years and more to see consultants across a range of specialties, even though Government policy is that the maximum should be 15 months.</p>
          <p eId="para_574"> Only this week we heard that three consultant psychiatrists have resigned their posts. I listened to one of them this morning on the local radio station talking about the difficulties and the challenges he and his colleagues faced on a daily basis because of the very poor and archaic conditions under which they worked, as well as the extreme pressure they were under day in, day out. We had four consultant psychiatrists in University Hospital Waterford a number of weeks ago but we now have one, while a part-time locum consultant has been drafted in from Galway to supplement the team following the resignation of three members. Is it not enough of a shock to the Minister that we have consultant psychiatrists, of which there is already a shortage in the public system, resigning their posts because of the failure of the Government to deal with the very real challenges they meet on a daily basis?</p>
          <p eId="para_575"> I have met the Minister several times to discuss the issue of cardiac care. He knows that while the mobile laboratory deployed has done a good job on the diagnostics side, waiting times for interventions have increased. Time and again, we have asked for a modular laboratory to be put in place to provide, certainly in the short to medium term until we get a second permanent laboratory in place, an opportunity to reduce waiting times which are a big issue for patients. It may not be a big issue for those in Fine Gael who are talking about tax cuts, but it is for the people we represent outside this bubble. It is high time the Minister did his job. He needs to ensure at Cabinet level that we will get the resources necessary in the budget to invest in public service and thereby reduce waiting times across the board.</p>

          <p eId="para_576">The position on waiting lists is a scandal. In May more than 700,000 people were on waiting lists. We have the worst waiting lists in Europe. Patients have no idea where they are on waiting lists. As a result, people are left in pain and discomfort for years. To top it all off, 54,306 children are on waiting lists across the State. The Government should be ashamed of that record.</p>
          <p eId="para_577"> That there is still no integrated waiting list management system is ridiculous. It means that it is pot luck whether someone is treated in a few weeks or a few years because patients have no idea how lists for certain procedures are dealt with in each hospital. Fine Gael's solution to this problem is to throw money at private healthcare providers, while the reality is that we should be investing in the public health service. That is reason people pay their taxes. Many who want to receive treatment in a timely fashion are being forced to go to private hospitals. I do not know on what planet members of Fine Gael live, but citizens in my constituency who are hard workers, raising families and trying to keep a roof over their heads simply cannot afford private healthcare, nor should they have to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_578"> The huge waiting lists are causing massive distress. I want to raise a case with the Minister. Last Thursday a lady in my constituency telephoned me. She was very upset about a letter which had arrived from Beaumont Hospital addressed to her son. It was to remind her son that he had an upcoming outpatient appointment. Her son had died in April 2006. Twelve years after his death, his mother received a letter to remind her of an outpatient appointment. </p>
          <p eId="para_579"> The position on waiting lists is a disgrace. We need to get a handle on the issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_580">The health system has always been dysfunctional. We have always had unacceptable waiting lists for procedures. Even when the State had more money than it could spend, we could not get the health system right. That is because it is a two-tier system and such a system cannot work. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael cannot accept this because it goes against their neoliberal agenda. When successive Governments value the earning potential of consultants and insurance companies more than the health and well-being of the people they serve, it is always going to be a disaster. It is to the Government's shame and that of Fianna Fál and the Labour Party that the problem is still ongoing.</p>
          <p eId="para_581"> I recently raised the case of a nurse in my constituency who had been waiting for than a year for back surgery to treat scoliosis. On two occasions surgery was cancelled on the morning it was scheduled to take place because there was no high-dependency bed available. Her surgeon advised her that further cancellations were likely because nothing was being done to address that issue. </p>
          <p eId="para_582"> Another constituent, also with scoliosis, has been waiting for seven years for an operation. Every day she is in agonising pain. If the HSE cannot manage simple matters such as this and the system is that dysfunctional, we need an overhaul of the entire health service. </p>
          <p eId="para_583"> At Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda staff have serious concerns about the provision of services owing to insufficient staff and resources such as equipment. The computed tomography, CT, scanner is out of date. A new one was approved on paper in 2016, but there is still no sign of it. The old scanner is constantly breaking down. Daily patients are being sent to Dundalk in a taxi to have scans. People have to wait for five months for a CAT scan, nine to ten months for an ultrasound and 59 weeks, or more than a year, for magnetic resonance imagining, MRI, scans. These are diagnostic tests, not treatment. If people are left to languish on waiting lists for months and years, the Government ought to be ashamed of itself. The Minister knows the condition and state of the health service day in and day out. If it was not for the dedication of front-line staff, we would not have a health service.</p>

          <p eId="para_584">I commend the Minister for his leadership role in the referendum on the eight amendment. I have not had the chance to say that to him until now. That shows what is possible if there is a will to achieve such outcomes.</p>
          <p eId="para_585"> At the core of the crisis in the health service is a lack of will to build a genuine public health service, which is creating difficulties, as is evident in the cervical screening scandal and the ongoing crisis in emergency departments. Some 9,000 patients were on trolleys last month and they included 92 children. The crisis is evident in the failure to retain staff. In that respect, I commend health workers.</p>
          <p eId="para_586"> The failure to provide children in north Louth with access to child and adolescent mental health services and the absence of a minor injuries unit at Louth County Hospital are examples of the crisis. There is a chronic lack of capacity as a result of Government policy, which means that there is a perpetual crisis in the health service. Nowhere is it more obvious than in the 700,000 on hospital waiting lists. More than 500,000 citizens are on outpatient waitings lists, while there are almost 80,000 on inpatient waiting lists. The two hospitals in County Louth, Louth County Hospital and Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda, have almost 15,000 on their outpatient waiting lists and 1,330 on their inpatient waiting lists. As a practising politician, the Minister will know that behind these statistics are stories of real stress, hurt and distress caused in people's lives. It is a scandal.</p>
          <p eId="para_587"> We have suggested alternatives. I commend Teachta Louse O'Reilly for her leadership role and bringing forward this Private Members' motion.

          <p eId="para_588">The numbers on waiting lists are at their highest since records began. An astonishing 707,000 patients are waiting for treatment. Repeated comparisons of healthcare waiting times with those in other OECD countries show that there is very significant scope for improvement in Ireland. An example at which we could look is the Portuguese IT model which has led to significant reductions in hospital waiting times. If we consider the position in Ireland, as far back as 2001, there was a commitment given in the health strategy, Quality and Fairness, that by the end of 2004 no public patient would have to wait for more than three months to commence treatment, following referral from an outpatient department. However, no serious effort was ever made to achieve that target and waiting times have grown substantially ever since. The reality is that the number waiting for more than 18 months for inpatient or day case treatment has soared. The number of long-term waiters on outpatient waiting lists has increased substantially. They show an increase of 29,956 since May last year. According to the 2017 Euro Health Consumer Index, Ireland had the worst hospital waiting lists in Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_589">The report also concluded that the number of Irish patients waiting for surgery or an outpatient appointment is “abysmal”. The ever-lengthening hospital waiting lists are a product of understaffing, a lack of capacity, and inefficiencies in the system. To resolve this ever-growing crisis the Government must increase the capacity of the hospital system by recruiting the necessary staff, opening more beds and investing in care in the community.</p>
          <p eId="para_590"> To reduce waiting times further, Sinn Féin would introduce an integrated hospital waiting list management system which we call Comhliosta. This is a waiting list initiative similar to that used by the Portuguese national health system, which has proven to have had a sustained and positive impact on waiting times.</p>
          <p eId="para_591"> Will it require more people to continue to suffer while on waiting lists before this issue is finally sorted? Tá áthas orm go bhfuil an tAire ag glacadh leis an Private Members' business seo. Tá sé thar am.</p>

          <from>Minister for Health (Deputy Simon Harris)<recordedTime time="2018-06-20T16:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_592">I thank Deputy Adams for his kind words on the referendum and I acknowledge the commitment of Sinn Féin, and especially Deputies O'Reilly and McDonald, on the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_593"> I very much welcome the opportunity to address the House on this important issue. Reducing waiting times for patients is a key priority for me as the Minister for Health and for my Government colleagues.</p>
          <p eId="para_594"> I acknowledge that waiting times for hospital procedures and appointments are often unacceptably long. Many areas in our health service lack sufficient capacity to meet the ever-increasing demand for services and the needs of patients. The evidence of this can be seen not only in the waiting lists but also in my Department’s health service capacity review. Therefore, maximising the use of existing capacity in the short term and seeking to build new capacity through the national development plan is central to improving waiting times. I will outline the approach the Government is taking in this regard in the course of my address.</p>
          <p eId="para_595"> Increasing capacity alone will not position our system to provide the services and access that our citizens demand. The Irish health service is undergoing a major transformation. The Sláintecare report, and the cross-party support that it enjoys, presents a unique opportunity to embed long-lasting reform in our health system. It is against this background that the Government will not be opposing this motion. It is clear to me that all of the Deputies here today have the same objective in mind, which is to improve access for patients. I would like to approach this debate in the spirit of solutions, and I am here to listen and consider ideas from all Deputies for sustainable solutions to improve access for patients. I hope that, in that spirit, it is also possible to acknowledge some of the progress and to accept the factual context that our health service will treat 3.3 million patients as outpatients this year and deliver 1.7 million hospital operations or procedures outside of the additional work undertaken by the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF.</p>
          <p eId="para_596"> The NTPF is responsible for collecting and validating all waiting lists for public hospitals. The most recently published NTPF figures for the end of May confirm that just under 78,600 patients are waiting for a hospital inpatient or day case procedure. In July 2017, the number of patients waiting for an inpatient or day case procedure stood at 86,100. This represents a fall of more than 7,500 patients, or almost 9%, in just ten months. The NTPF figures for the end of May this year also show that 56% of patients who are on the waiting list for a hospital operation or a day case procedure were waiting less than six months. In much of the coverage on waiting lists, one never gets the impression that 56% of patients wait less than six months for a hospital operation and 82% were waiting less than 12 months for their procedure. In the area of day case procedures, operations and procedures, we are making good progress as a result of the investment being made and we have much more to do in that regard. This progress in reducing the time patients are waiting for a hospital procedure is a result of the focus and investment by Government in this area. In budget 2018, for example, €50 million was provided to the NTPF to provide treatment for public patients this year, which more than doubled its 2017 total allocation.</p>
          <p eId="para_597"> I published the inpatient and day case action plan in April, which marked a very important milestone in delivering on the Government’s objective to tackle waiting lists. The action plan is a joint initiative between my Department, the NTPF and the HSE with the aim of reducing the overall number of patients waiting for treatment. One of the central goals set out in the action plan is that by the end of 2018, the number of patients waiting for treatment will fall below 70,000, down from that historic peak figure of 86,100 in July 2017, and that the number of patients waiting longer than nine months will also fall dramatically.</p>
          <p eId="para_598"> To the end of May the NTPF has organised treatment for almost 7,600 patients. The total number treated in 2017 through the NTPF was just over 6,600, so already this year we have treated more patients through the NTPF than were treated in the entirety of 2017.</p>
          <p eId="para_599"> There are seven high-volume procedures that are the focus of the action plan, specifically, cataracts, hip or knee replacements, tonsils, angiograms, cystoscopies, skin lesions and varicose veins. All patients who are waiting more than nine months and are clinically suitable for treatment in an outsourced facility will be offered treatment in 2018 for these seven high-volume procedures. I hear a lot from Members about waiting times for cataracts and hip and knee replacements. If a Member's constituent is waiting for longer than nine months for any of those seven high-volume procedures and he or she is clinically suitable to have the procedure carried out, then he or she will have it carried out by the end of the year. For patients who are waiting longest for other procedures, the NTPF and the HSE will work together to identify their requirements, develop treatment plans and, where possible, offer treatments from within existing HSE or NTPF resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_600"> The cancellations of elective treatment and the increase of emergency procedures arising from significant emergency department pressures have resulted in some difficulties in tackling waiting lists. In the action plan the NTPF has committed to provide 20,000 procedures for patients. This activity is being actively monitored by my Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_601"> The NTPF will provide all the treatment for patients in both public and private hospitals. This is an important point because it is not always about private hospitals and the NTPF is also investing resources in public hospitals. The NTPF has invited all hospital groups to develop proposals for its consideration to maximise the use of existing facilities. Through the University of Limerick hospital group, for example, a dedicated cataract theatre is being opened in Nenagh Hospital and the NTPF will fund treatment for patients in this new facility in 2018. I look forward to opening that facility in the coming weeks. In addition, my Department, the HSE and the NTPF recently met representatives from the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital, and we have asked them to put forward a new proposal for priority consideration. These are two practical examples of where we work with the public sector to invest in more capacity.</p>
          <p eId="para_602"> While positive results have been witnessed through the work of the inpatient day case action plan, and while we are making progress in reducing the numbers of patients on the lists and in reducing the length of time people wait for a hospital operation or procedure, I acknowledge that the outpatient waiting list remains a significant challenge, with 511,000 people waiting for an outpatient appointment. This figure, however, needs to be seen in the context of the 3.3 million patients attending hospital outpatient clinics for appointments every year. It is important to say that more than 70% wait less than 12 months, 60% wait less than nine months and just under half wait less than six months. Sometimes in this House we get the impression from some Members that everybody waits for 18 months or two years on the waiting lists. It is unacceptable for anybody to wait that length of time but the statistics do not back up the idea that this is the norm. We see that a majority of patients are being treated in less than nine months. This does not in any way down play the very serious situation for those people who are waiting too long, which we are determined to address. We have made progress with inpatient and day case procedures and we have worked with Opposition parties to re-establish the NTPF to do work on this. We now need to apply the same level of focus to our outpatient waiting lists. This is why I have asked the HSE and the NTPF to develop and outpatient waiting list plan, to provide the same degree of targeted focus to the lists.</p>
          <p eId="para_603"> In 2017 some 477,000 outpatients did not attend their appointment. This shows the importance of validating hospital waiting lists, given there are 477,000 missed outpatient appointments. Deputy Mitchell raised this issue, and I have had a private word with the Deputy. I will take the details of that case. It shows the importance of having accurate lists when 477,000 people last year were offered outpatient appointments and did not take up the appointments. This week I approved the establishment of a central validation office in the National Treatment Purchase Fund to centralise the validation of all waiting lists across the HSE. Our citizens deserve to have accurate lists so we can target the resources to where they are most needed and so we do not have almost half a million outpatient appointment slots missed each and every year.</p>
          <p eId="para_604"> I note and share the concern expressed in the motion about the monitoring of private practice in public hospitals. Under the consultant settlement agreement, all parties acknowledge that they are committed to providing a high-quality public health service and recognise that the consultant contract is fundamental to that provision. A central concern of mine and of this Government is the monitoring of the private practices in public hospitals, and my Department and the HSE have recently agreed a robust framework at national and local level to ensure compliance. I heard some stereotypes and labels thrown at me, at Fine Gael and at the Government. It might be useful politics to try to label one's opponents, but let me be very clear that I want to see the ending of private practice in public hospitals. This is why I have signed up to the commitment in Sláintecare and why I have established the Donal de Buitléir working group, which is under way. I hope that all other parties will make their views clear on this issue also. I want to see private practice removed from public hospitals, but done in an organised, intelligent and logical way as envisaged in the Sláintecare report.</p>
          <p eId="para_605"> I turn now to Sláintecare. It presents the opportunity to reform our health service and the implementation of this report is central to the development of sustainable solutions to reduce waiting lists significantly. In the 12 months since the publication of the Sláintecare report, the Government has taken significant steps to commence the programme of reform, including a commitment to the establishment of a Sláintecare programme office, the establishment of an independent review group to consider how best to remove private practice from public hospitals, and the completion of a consultation on the geographical alignment of hospital groups and community healthcare organisations.</p>
          <p eId="para_606">The development of an integrated waiting list solution tailored specifically to meet the needs of our complex health system is being considered as part of this major reform programme. I fully support the view that there is a need for a more integrated approach to waiting list management at hospital group level. At my request, the NTPF has examined the feasibility of progressing to an integrated system. The report, which includes a review of models used in jurisdictions such as Portugal, is being considered by my Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_607"> The national development plan provides for a major increase in capacity across the health system. It is an exciting development that we can build three new dedicated elective-only hospitals to drive down waiting lists - one in Dublin, one in Galway and one in Cork. When the same was done in Scotland, waiting lists were reduced dramatically. We now have the funding to develop the three hospitals. They will not have emergency departments to provide emergency care; rather, they will just drive down waiting lists. This was a key Sláintecare recommendation, for which I have received full funding under the recent development plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_608"> I welcome this debate. I am committed to working collaboratively with all Deputies to find solutions. We can report some progress on the issue of hospital operations and procedures, as shown by the independent figures from the NTPF. However, we still have a large amount of work to do, particularly in outpatient services and ensuring we have accurate lists in order that 500,000 patients will not take up outpatient slots, which indicates a difficulty with the waiting lists. We must work together to increase capacity.</p>

          <p eId="para_610"> Imagine spending every day in intense and debilitating pain knowing that there is a standard operation available but that, because one lives in Ireland and does not have private health insurance, one has to wait two and a half years for it. That is the story of Sarah from Wicklow who is waiting for a hip replacement operation. Imagine having a daughter with scoliosis and seeing her spine curve more and more to the point where she will no longer fit in her wheelchair and knowing that because she lives in Ireland and her parent does not have private health insurance she must wait for more than a year for an assessment to receive a new wheelchair. That is the reality for a mum and her daughter in Bray. Imagine being a manual labourer with shoulder pain that has got so bad that they cannot work who faces the prospect of losing their home because they live in Ireland, do not have health insurance and have waited a long time, not even to be treated but only to be assessed. Imagine being the patient of a GP who contacted me this week, having just been told that she would have to wait for 160 weeks to see an ear, nose and throat specialist. That is the reality on the ground. Some 55,000 children are waiting to see specialists, never mind receive treatment. For the first time in the history of the State, more than 10,000 children are waiting for longer than a year and a half to see specialists. There are not many of us living in the Republic, but more than 500,000 are waiting to see specialists and more than 700,000 are waiting for procedures, the highest number in the history of the Republic.</p>
          <p eId="para_611"> This morning I met two mothers whose sons had scoliosis. It was difficult to listen to what they and their sons were going through. If a GP believes a child might have scoliosis, that child will be referred to a specialist in a children's hospital. In the case of Crumlin, the child will have to wait between two and three years to be seen by the specialist. That is where we are with waiting lists for children with scoliosis. In January 2017 the target for the length of time taken from finally being seen by a specialist to undergoing a procedure was set at four months. The women whom I met and the parents of other children with scoliosis were told that an action plan would be published by the end of last year. Needless to say, it has not been published and the four-month target has not been met.</p>
          <p eId="para_612"> The latest Euro Health Consumer Index, EHCI, shows that, of the 35 European countries surveyed, Ireland came last in ease of access to healthcare. It noted that in 2015 Ireland had set a target of no patient having to wait for longer than 18 months for a specialist appointment. The authors put a large exclamation point in one part of their report. It read: "Even if and when that target is reached, it will still be the worst waiting time situation in Europe". To be clear, Fine Gael's target for waiting lists, which it cannot even hit, would still leave us with the worst waiting times in Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_613"> It is not down to a lack of funding. Ireland spends more money per person on healthcare than almost any country on Earth. Since Ireland has a significantly younger population than most other countries, we should be getting better healthcare for the same amount of money that other countries are spending. Instead, we are spending more and receiving worse healthcare. Neither are the problems due to a lack of talent or passion on the part of clinicians. We have some of the best trained doctors and nurses in the world who, as we all know, are dedicated to the cause and want to do the best job possible. It is down to a lack of ambition, vision and competence. </p>
          <p eId="para_614"> In 2011 Fine Gael announced that the HSE would be disbanded. In 2012 the Government fired the HSE board in front of the cameras. In 2014 the HSE was again told by the Government that it would be disbanded. This time it was told that it would happen by 2020. In 2016 it was told by the Government that it would no longer be disbanded. In 2017 it was told that it would be reorganised according to Sláintecare. In 2018 it was told that it would be getting its board back. There is not a management team on Earth that could deliver for the people a great healthcare system given this level of organisational chaos. In that chaos waiting lists have spiralled and men, women and children are suffering every day.</p>
          <p eId="para_615"> What did the Government try to do to tackle waiting lists? It moved the target from six months to nine. As it did not achieve it, it moved the target to 15 months. As it did not achieve it, it moved the target to 18 months, which is where we are now. Will it, please, not do that? Will it provide clinicians and managers with the tools they need and identify where things are working? In some places they are working. In the RCSI hospital group many waiting lists are decreasing. We should find out why and share the learning across the system. The Government should help hospitals to reduce admissions from their emergency department. In some hospitals the relevant figures are in the teens, but in others, they are in the high 20s. Why is that the case? The Government should help hospitals to find appropriate step-down care when they discharge patients in order that they will not end up back in emergency departments a few weeks later. The Government should help hospitals to tackle bottlenecks owing to bed shortages, be it in intensive care units, ICUs, wards or elsewhere. The Government should deploy technology and education to help patients to manage their own care. The Government should held GPs to provide as much care as possible in their surgeries in order that they will not need to keep referring patients to local hospitals. The Government should ensure spare capacity in hospitals is being used. In many cases, it is not. The Government should balance the load between hospitals throughout the country in order to reduce the worst waiting lists. The Government should provide higher volume, simpler care in smaller hospitals, provide complex care in larger hospitals and ensure doctors get to work in both settings. The Government should use the NTPF as a temporary measure to provide men, women and children the care they so desperately need.</p>
          <p eId="para_616"> If the Government sets targets that will give us the worst waiting times in Europe, we will have the worst waiting times in Europe; therefore, it should do not do that. It should set targets that are humane and ambitious and reflect the level of service we want and that the people deserve. It should work closely with doctors, nurses and hospital managers to turn the targets into the reality they must become.</p>

          <p eId="para_617">In the limited time available to me I wish to outline my grave concerns about the current state of the health service. Its deterioration under Senator James Reilly, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, has been appalling. The figures mentioned in the debate so far are unbelievable. The Minister stated that, if there was a clinical need, patients would be seen within nine months. He should tell that to the lady in Mullingar who has been waiting for 24 months to have a knee replaced and cannot walk. He should tell it to Maureen who is over 80 years of age, has worked long and hard all her life and been told that it will be 36 months before her cataract will be removed. He should tell it to the countless scores of teenagers in my constituency who have been waiting for 36 months for referrals to orthodontists.</p>
          <p eId="para_618"> The figures the Minister has outlined are inaccurate and untrue.</p>
          <p eId="para_619">We have such a crisis in our health service because we have a staffing crisis. I will give an example from the Midlands Regional Hospital in Mullingar. A woman, a qualified nurse, was appointed in September 2017. She is still awaiting a contract. Another person was appointed in June 2017 and is still awaiting a contract. Senior people leave our health service day-in, day-out. They leave our health service because of the lack of flexibility, poor pay and conditions and the lack of availability of proper career progression. In the Midlands Regional Hospital in Mullingar, the prefab that was opened to deal with the winter initiative is now operating 24-7 and is doing so predominantly with agency staff. Mullingar hospital and the maternity hospital are down by 15 whole-time equivalents and the only reason it continues to keep going is because of the goodwill of the people who operate it. The Government needs to wake up and address the challenges facing our health service before it is too late.</p>

          <p eId="para_620">Waiting lists are now the worst ever. There are 707,000 people on waiting lists for medical procedures, 511,000 on outpatient lists, 147,000 waiting for over 12 months and almost 80,000 waiting for over 18 months. We have the worst waiting times in Europe for specialist treatment. We have a target of 18 months and the targets are failing. We are the second worst for value for money. These lists are serious, dangerous and very real. They include very serious cardiac and neurosurgery procedures, children with debilitating pain and spinal deformations and children who are self-harming and suicidal. General practitioners, GPs, are leaving. Nurses are lining up at the airport to get out. Psychiatrists are resigning in a last, desperate protest to highlight the Government's failure in our child mental health services and nobody is listening. The Government is in its eighth year of power yet still behaves as rubberneckers, looking on at a car crash, shaking its head and saying that this is awful, when in fact it is responsible. There has been no vision, no plan and no responsibility. The Government has had eight years. Why should anybody trust it to give it any more?</p>
          <p eId="para_621"> I want to give one example, of a lady who is 79 years of age. In November 2016, she underwent a procedure relating to her gallbladder which resulted in perforated bile ducts. As a temporary measure, a drain was put in her side. Some 20 months later, waiting for corrective surgery, the drain remains in place. Every Monday, she attends her local GP to make sure it is okay and every six weeks, she attends a hospital appointment where nurses and doctors query why the temporary measure is still present. This lady is in chronic pain, on a specialised diet and she cannot get help. There is a 34-month waiting list for child psychology in my county and no emergency appointments are available. This is unacceptable and needs to be addressed.</p>

          <p eId="para_622">Waiting times are off the rails. The figures speak for themselves. I want to address a couple of issues that we should look at that are of no great cost to the Exchequer but would, in my opinion, make an appreciable difference. The first is that the winter planning should be done now so that when the crisis occurs and our emergency departments start to fill up in the winter months, we have a plan in place that does not result in cancelling elective procedures and closing up all other areas of the hospital to deal with an emergency department crisis. I ask that, in the winter planning process the Government is undergoing, which I hope it is undergoing as we speak, no elective procedures are cancelled as part of that plan. All the Government is doing is exacerbating the problem and further increasing waiting lists.</p>
          <p eId="para_623"> I have just come from a briefing by Nursing Homes Ireland in Buswells, and I am reliably informed that at any one time there are approximately 1,000 to 1,200 beds in the system which are unused. Surely it is within the mindset and ability of the HSE to liaise with Nursing Homes Ireland to get patients who are well enough to be out of hospital but not well enough to be at home to convalesce in nursing homes, which would free up, at any one time, 1,000 to 1,200 places, where elective surgeries and waiting lists could be dealt with in a manner which would improve the situation. Rather than rattle off figures for the Minister of State and tell him the obvious that he knows already, I make those two suggestions as something that he could work at to try to improve the situation, because for a population of 4 million people to have a waiting list in excess of 500,000 is unacceptable.</p>

          <p eId="para_624">The programme for Government provides that continued investment of €50 million per year will be made available to reduce waiting lists and overcrowding, particularly for urgent cases and for those who have been waiting longest. Yet over 660,000 people are currently on waiting lists. Alarmingly, this represents a steady increase of approximately 30,000 since last February. Behind all these figures are human beings and the Minister of State knows as well as I do that many people in west Cork are now on waiting lists for long periods and this really has to addressed. Aside from the distress these long and protracted waiting lists have on patients and the impact it has on their medical conditions, there is also the knock-on effect that waiting lists and overcrowding have on day-to-day treatments and procedures, particularly if emergency departments are only dealing with overcrowding and emergency situations. There is no doubt that making more facilities available at primary care level will help to alleviate the pressure experienced in hospital waiting rooms and emergency departments. However, it also needs to be noted that extra resources afforded to general hospitals would certainly ease the burden on the larger university hospitals. I know the Minister of State is working on it and that progress is slowly being made on a rehabilitation unit and endoscopy unit for Bantry General Hospital in our constituency of Cork South-West. Should these facilities be in place, there would be no need for patients to present at the various Cork city hospitals for such treatments. Efforts to address waiting lists and overcrowding should be all-encompassing and inefficiencies in the health system will prove to be counterproductive in the long run.</p>

          <p eId="para_625">We all know that the hospital waiting list times are appalling and something needs to be done to alter the situation. I believe that no patient who is in pain should have to languish on any waiting list for any long period. Fianna Fáil wants to see legislation similar to what has been enacted in Scotland whereby there would be a guaranteed maximum waiting time for any procedure, whether an inpatient or day case patient. The maximum time under the legislation in Scotland is 12 weeks. There are two hospitals in Louth, Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital and Louth County Hospital. Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital has more than 446 people on waiting lists for over three months while Louth County Hospital has more than 155. It is too long for people, particularly those who are in pain. It is shameful that we have over 10,000 children nationally who have been waiting over 18 months for an outpatient appointment. I have had representations, like many in this House, from many families of those children. It can be extremely frustrating to have a child who one knows needs attention from a consultant and needs pain relief left waiting. Apart from making greater use of the National Treatment Purchase Fund, I have been amazed, since I came into this House, that not just the National Treatment Purchase Fund but the Cross Border Directive have been so badly advertised. One would expect that in a Border county like my own, and right across the Border region, people would be aware of it. I call on the Minister of State to ensure that proper advertising about this is put in both hospitals and general practitioners' clinics to make people more aware of it.</p>

          <p eId="para_626">Fine Gael's record on waiting lists for the hospital service, having been in government since 2011, is shocking. If we are to see any solution to this waiting list crisis, the Taoiseach and the Government must accept that there is a crisis. In July 2014, there were 360,000 on the outpatient waiting list. In May 2018, that had risen to 511,904, an increase of 151,151.</p>
          <p eId="para_627">It is truly shocking that more than half a million people are now stuck on outpatient waiting lists. The latest waiting list figures for May 2018 show that we are further away than ever from reaching the targets set by the Taoiseach three years ago. The half a million people on the outpatient waiting list is another new record. However, the waiting times being endured within that list are truly shocking. Approximately 80,000 people who need to see a specialist have been waiting for more than 18 months, another all-time high. These figures are not in dispute; they are cold facts. However, behind those facts are patients of every age waiting to be seen by a specialist. Families with children waiting for much needed care are at their wits' end with worry. The quality of life of older people is being badly affected while they wait months for a simple procedure and during that time, the HSE is involved in controversy after controversy.</p>
          <p eId="para_628"> The situation has reached such a level that people are losing faith in the HSE's ability to solve the waiting list crisis. That is where political accountability comes in. The Taoiseach seems to believe he can float through these scandals offering soft intellectual observations without taking any real responsibility. If the waiting list crisis is to be resolved, the Taoiseach must cancel the promotional tour he has embarked on and get back to reality. Being Taoiseach is not some sort of reality TV show where he plays the hero. It is about working hard for the people of this country and it is about time he understood that.</p>

          <p eId="para_629">I have a sense of it being Groundhog Day again. We have been here many times. One of my daughter's favourite artists is Pixie Lott who has a song called "Here We Go Again". We could recycle much of the debate from the previous three or four discussions we had on this issue. I will not bother the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, with any political point-scoring, but I will make a few points that might be helpful. We are aware of the issues concerning emergency departments and waiting lists. We know the consequences in terms of the number of people who die as a result of waiting lists and the current crisis. That is not a reflection on health service staff and I dare say it is not a reflection on management. One significant issue is that we do not have enough consultants or specialists. Hiring consultants who are not even on the register poses a serious risk. Hospitals are acting at a capacity that would be considered a national crisis or emergency in most other jurisdictions. In Britain and other jurisdictions hospitals stopped taking on new cases and cancelled elective surgery because of the situation with emergency theatres in particular. We could also create greater efficiencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_630"> I will make one or two points which I believe will improve matters. We have a number of different tiered hospitals. In fairness to the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, he was in the grounds of Nenagh hospital not so long ago where he saw the extensive space available and the major advances that are taking place. Let us take the mid-west as an example and, if necessary, the south west and Bantry General Hospital. In the cases of Ennis Hospital, St. John's Hospital and Nenagh Hospital, the pathways for managing how people are treated in hospital networks must change. The minor injuries units are too restricted in terms of what types of patients they can take. They should be able to take fracture patients and deal with a number of other issues. That would mean University Hospital Limerick would not be clogged up. I have been making that argument for some time.</p>
          <p eId="para_631"> The grade 2 hospitals should be open for longer and be able to deal with a wider range of ailments. They should also be able to provide step-down facilities and take patients preparing for surgery and following surgery. They should be able to do so more quickly to free up beds in the acute hospitals, in this case University Hospital Limerick and in the case of the Minister of State, University College Cork. The cost of such an initiative would be small and it would save money because people would no longer block beds. In many cases, people cannot be transported from Limerick to Nenagh. We have transport known as intermediate care vehicles but there are not enough of them, they only run from Monday to Friday and sometimes they are not available. Ambulances transport people from an acute setting to the grade 2 hospital where they are treated in a fantastic setting but we cannot move enough people out quickly. The same story is replicated across all the networks. I urge the Minister of State to take that on board. I sound like a broken record speaking about this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_632"> We also need to create greater capacity in hospitals. It is proposed to build a new 96-bed unit in University Hospital Limerick. Given that it will take years to build the new unit, we will have to consider taking a modular approach. A proposal has been put together which would cost the HSE €19.45 million in capital expenditure following the bed capacity review.</p>
          <p eId="para_633"> In the south of my county, in Clonmel hospital, the situation is chronic and to the north, in Limerick, the situation is woeful. The two worst emergency departments in Ireland in terms of overcrowding and trolleys are on either side of me. There are plans for a modular unit in Clonmel hospital and I am told this will be built and ready for the coming winter. I hope it will be ready but I have my doubts. The biggest issue in the country is in Limerick. We will have to support the CEO of the University Limerick hospital group in the application the group has made for funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_634"> I have a concern about Sláintecare not being implemented. A head of Sláintecare has not been appointed despite the post being advertised for a long time. I understand a number of other positions are being advertised within the HSE. If these positions are filled, I wonder how the roles we have planned in Sláintecare can be upfilled. I urge the Minister of State to examine the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_635"> I will not repeat what is already on the record about the necessity for primary care but the current model, under which bundles of primary care buildings are being developed across the country, is not working in some cases. It has led to speculation. Speculators are getting a licence to build a primary care centre, sitting on it for a period and then trying to sell it on at a profit. This practice should not be tolerated. A deadline should be set within which a developer must meet all requirements in terms of providing general practice and other facilities. The project should be taken off any developer who fails to meet the requirements and re-advertised because speculation is taking place all over the country, including in my county.</p>
          <p eId="para_636"> Issues affecting waiting lists span a range of areas. I wish to raise two cases which I have been given permission to bring up. One is a case I raised previously with the Minister of State involving a young man who is not even from my constituency - he is from Waterford. We will call him by the initials ND. He has various issues affecting him and his family has been looking for residential care for a long time. I will not name him or his family but I have permission to do so if the need arises. I have written to the Minister of State to explain that some families are being put in dangerous situations due to the lack of residential care. This will become the next scandal if physical violence or issues relating to sexual activity arise. I have dealt with a number of such cases. In fairness to the HSE, it has dealt with many of the cases I have raised with it, but this is one of the more worrying cases. I urge the Minister of State to examine it.</p>
          <p eId="para_637"> I also raise the case of Matthew Quinn, which is a little closer to home. Matthew lives about a quarter of a mile away from me, just over the hill. He was delighted to feature on RTÉ last week. He is a 14 year old with Down's syndrome who has been waiting for a hip replacement for two years. He asked Santa Claus to bring him a new hip and when I visited him he asked me to help him to get a new hip. He does not want anything else except a new hip because he is totally immobile and in pain. He featured on "Six One" news last week. We fight for various issues but this young boy, who is a big lad, deserves to have his surgery. Issues have arisen between the paediatrics services in Crumlin and Tallaght hospitals. I have been raising these for months and I do not understand what is going on. I have spoken to the surgeon and there is no reason this issue cannot be dealt with. It is symbolic of a bigger issue between the hospitals. I urge the Minister of State to investigate this case because this young man, and others like him, do not deserve to be left in this position.</p>

          <p eId="para_638">I welcome this Sinn Féin motion. We all know that the solution is not one based on information technology, software or even better administration. The health crisis and the lengthy waiting lists are not caused by unfortunate incidents that somehow result in thousands of citizens being left to languish on lists for an eternity but are the result of political decisions that prioritise certain interests over others. Decisions taken in here by this and previous Governments led by Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael have promoted privatised health care over and above health care for the public. Successive governments put recruitment bans in place during austerity, cut hospital bed capacity repeatedly and accepted and enthusiastically enforced neoliberal management models that saw a mushrooming of management structures and a diminishing of front-line services. We have a public health system that is designed to fail to frighten people into taking out private health insurance. The guarantee people get by taking out such insurance is that they will be seen first and will get a diagnosis faster than would be the case if they remained in the public health system. The private system and the profits that accrue to it would not be possible if we did not have a failing public system.</p>
          <p eId="para_639"> A person born into a lower socio-economic group has, on average, four years less to live than someone from an upper professional group. The higher rates of lung, stomach and cervical cancers in deprived areas mean that there is a lower chance of survival. The real scandal is that these facts have been known to us for a very long time but the political establishment deliberately devised health policies which exacerbate rather than reduce the health divide, not to mention the class divide. There is no strategy to increase the life expectancy of the poorest groups in Ireland. The health system encourages a certain sector to profit from human misery.</p>
          <p eId="para_640"> We can scratch our heads and seek solutions here but we must start by accepting that cuts to the pay and pensions and increases in the working hours of front-line staff, including nurses, do not help. We can wax lyrical in here about the great efforts being planned by the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, and the Government, but the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, will come into the House next week and tell us that we still have a financial emergency. He will then pass the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, legislation for another year which maintains inequality and division and keeps public servants working in hospitals and other areas of our health service on lower rates of pay.</p>
          <p eId="para_641"> I want to deal with an issue that is not covered in the motion but which is very familiar to many parents, namely, the dire situation with regard to assessments of needs for children. Just 25% of needs assessments were completed by the HSE within the three-month timeframe provided for in the regulations. The target is 100%. A High Court judge made an order earlier this month giving the HSE between six to eight weeks to complete assessments of health needs for 12 children with suspected autism and other conditions. One example of the profound and telling effect of this failure is a three year old lad called Carter Keogh from the Coombe . He was seen by his GP seven months ago. He was then seen by a developmental paediatrician and referred on to the very badly named early intervention team. His parents were told that they would have an appointment at the end of 2019. It is not rocket science to figure out that the earlier an intervention happens with children like Carter, the better the outcome. As soon as a diagnosis is made, then getting the intervention of a speech therapist, a psychologist and other intensive front-line services that are required can make a real difference to this young boy's life and that of his family, but the State is completely failing thousands of families in this regard. This is not an IT problem. This is a systemic problem stemming from decisions made about resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_642"> I refer to the shocking resignation of three consultant psychiatrists in the south east. Dr. Kieran Moore addressed the Joint Committee on the Future of Mental Health Care recently and told members that he and two of his colleagues were resigning. He said that patients were coming into a building that is in a dreadful state and that staff are burnt out. That says it all. Dr. Moore has just been awarded a pay increase but he has resigned, along with two of his colleagues, because of the state of our health service.</p>

          <p eId="para_643">One in seven people in this country is on a waiting list of some kind. We have the highest bed occupancy rate in the OECD. We have a shortage of doctors, nurses and therapists due to an ongoing recruitment embargo initiated during the bailout programme. I agree that any computer system that assists in reducing waiting lists is welcome, but that is not the solution.</p>
          <p eId="para_644"> I want to focus my remarks on the impact of lengthy waiting lists on children in particular. More than 10,000 children are waiting for more than 18 months for a hospital appointment. That figure has multiplied by a factor of 12 in two years on this Government's watch. The crisis is most acute in Dublin. The three Dublin children's hospitals have 80% of the total number of children on waiting lists, and 99% of those children have been waiting for 18 months or more. This is clearly a failure to meet the needs of the growing population in our capital city.</p>
          <p eId="para_645"> I will mention some cases in Dublin West, the Taoiseach's constituency, which demonstrate the extent of the problem. These are just some random people who have contacted my office recently. One mother has been waiting for a psychiatric appointment for her eight year old son who is partially blind, has autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD, and is physically violent, including towards his teachers. There is one psychiatrist in Beechpark and the waiting list has been suspended for a full year. There will be no new appointments for an entire year.</p>
          <p eId="para_646"> Another mother contacted me who has been waiting for occupational therapy for her six year old daughter who has developmental issues. She failed an eyesight test. One can only imagine how traumatic it must have been for her to try to learn in school. Her mother paid privately for a diagnosis but cannot afford to pay privately for occupational therapy. Three members of staff are on long-term illness leave or maternity leave and have not been replaced.</p>
          <p eId="para_647"> In terms of autism and speech and language difficulties, people are waiting for eight to ten months for a needs assessment but when they get that assessment, they then have to go on another waiting list for therapy. Children are being left with no help whatsoever. As for orthodontic services, teeth are obviously considered a luxury, cosmetic item in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_648"> What is the solution? We have these ongoing issues for children in particular but we have a refusal by this Government to use the Apple surplus. Ireland is one of the biggest corporate tax havens in the world. We partied here. It was great to hear some of the contributions from Fianna Fáil and, indeed, the Labour Party but we all know that they are collectively responsible for this situation thanks to the last ten years of the austerity bailout programme which they agreed with the EU and the IMF. The only solution is to use our wealth and resources to create a publicly funded national health service.</p>

          <from>Deputy Joan Collins<recordedTime time="2018-06-20T16:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_649">There are many good proposals in this motion and I thank Deputy Louise O'Reilly for tabling it today. The issue of our health service is raised in the Dáil every couple of weeks because the agreed Sláintecare report, which received all-party support, has not been implemented yet.</p>
          <p eId="para_650"> Not only do we have exceptionally long waiting lists for medical procedures, the figures for which are contained in the motion, in recent months there has been a marked increase in the numbers of people who have gone into hospital for surgery only to have the procedure cancelled at the last minute. Patients are going off their medication, fasting and so forth only to have the scheduled procedure cancelled, in some cases two or three times. This seems to be a new feature of our health service.</p>
          <p eId="para_651"> I wish to concentrate on the key issue referenced in the motion, namely, the urgent implementation of the Sláintecare report. I was very disappointed to see that the summer economic statement published yesterday, which outlined the general approach of the Minister for Finance and his Department in preparing for the budget in October, makes no mention whatsoever of funding for Sláintecare. This follows on from the 2018 budget which contained not a single reference to Sláintecare. The whole emphasis of the summer economic statement was to maintain services at existing levels given the demographic pressures and to improve public services within existing allocations.</p>
          <p eId="para_652">A key point of Sláintecare was the establishment of a national health fund. It called for a transitional fund of €3 billion, to be implemented over five years at €600 million a year, over and above the funding for the service in general. The report also called for €2.8 billion in ring-fenced funding to be provided over ten years to pay for expanded entitlements. Again, this would be extra funding for specific targeted entitlements and would be in addition to the funding needed to maintain the existing level of service. Sláintecare cannot be implemented without this ring-fenced funding and the proposed national health fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_653"> Sláintecare also set quite clear targets for action towards its implementation. The report proposed that a programme implementation office, under the remit of the Taoiseach, should be established in July 2017 and fully staffed by October 2017. It called for the appointment of an independent lead official and the establishment of a Cabinet sub-committee to oversee the implementation of the report. The reason for these measures were very clear: there was no confidence in the ability of the Department of Health to oversee and introduce the radical reform of healthcare that is envisaged in the report. When these measures were proposed, it was anticipated that there would be opposition from vested interests in the healthcare service and it was suggested that the authority of the Taoiseach and his Cabinet colleagues would be necessary to drive through these reforms. None of this has happened - quite the opposite. Despite the claims of the Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Harris, that they support Sláintecare, they have set up a committee in the Department of Health to respond to the report. If they want to kill Sláintecare, they could not have chosen a better way to go about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_654"> All the signs are that the Government will quietly shelve Sláintecare and pick certain aspects of it for implementation. The Minister referred in his speech to elective hospitals and electronic health data, which were proposed in the Sláintecare report. The report, which received widespread support in this House, represents a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to give the people of this country a modern universal healthcare system that is fit for purpose. If the State fails to take its responsibilities seriously and bends the knee to vested interests, that opportunity will be lost and history will repeat itself. It was proposed in Sláintecare that legislation setting targets for phased reductions in waiting times over five years would be introduced by spring 2018. It was suggested that waiting times for inpatient procedures would be reduced to a maximum of 12 weeks, for outpatient appointments it would be reduced to ten weeks and for diagnostic tests it would be reduced to ten days. The proposed target for waiting times in accident and emergency units was four hours. That legislation was supposed to be introduced in spring of this year. How long will we be waiting? Is it going to be shelved again?</p>

          <p eId="para_655">I am grateful to have an opportunity to speak briefly on this motion. I commend Sinn Féin on its introduction this afternoon. More than 700,000 people are on health waiting lists for treatment and assessment. The figures from the National Treatment Purchase Fund for May 2018 represent an increase of 6,200 on the figures for April 2018. There has been a jump of 4,300 to 511,904 in the number of people awaiting initial assessment by a consultant following a referral from a general practitioner. More than 147,000 people have been waiting for more than a year for an outpatient appointment. Almost 80,000 people have been waiting for more than 18 months for such an appointment. Almost 79,000 people are on inpatient waiting lists and almost 6,000 of them have been waiting for more than 18 months. These figures are appalling and shameful. It was laughable and disgusting to listen to the Taoiseach responding to Deputy Pearse Doherty this morning. Deputy Doherty rightly took the Taoiseach to task with regard to the pathetic figures in the summer economic statement, which indicates that the Government has precisely no plans whatsoever to do anything about these horrendous statistics.</p>
          <p eId="para_656"> The health service has been decimated over the decade of austerity. The Taoiseach played a crucial part in precipitating that austerity by voting for the blanket bank guarantee, aligning with Fianna Fáil and being prepared to allow people to suffer, particularly with regard to health and housing, over a disgraceful decade. Like other Deputies, I meet families that are desperate for early interventions and assessments for children who may be on the autistic spectrum. I meet people who are in pain, probably like the Ceann Comhairle, as they await treatments like cataract operations and knee and hip replacements. I meet people who are waiting to get home help hours and home care packages. I meet siblings and children who are desperately trying to assist elderly relatives in their 80s and early 90s who are not getting the supports they need from the Minister and the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_657"> I have been calling for increased resources for our health services, along with improved accountability for those in management positions, for a long time. The hard-working nurses and staff on the front line of service delivery are not sufficiently appreciated or remunerated. It is unsurprising that there is a recruitment and retention crisis in the health sector. Galway University Hospital is experiencing the longest waiting lists, with almost 40,000 people on those lists. One of my local hospitals in Dublin, the Mater Hospital, is not far behind, with almost 39,000 people on waiting lists. There are just over 36,000 people on waiting lists at Waterford University Hospital. Appallingly, from next month children in Waterford and Wexford might not be able to access consultant psychiatric services from the south-east CAMHS.</p>
          <p eId="para_658"> We ask the Minister for Health question after question and we keep getting distressing news about waiting lists in various areas where urgent treatment is needed. We learned yesterday that almost 10,300 children have been waiting for more than 18 months to see specialists. Almost 54,500 children are awaiting appointments with specialists, including for orthopaedic and cardiac care. In February 2017, we were all shocked and devastated to watch the "RTÉ Investigates: Living on the List" documentary. Over a year later, children with spinal scoliosis are still awaiting treatment. The motion before the House rightly references the 2017 European health consumer index, which rated Ireland as the worst country in Europe for hospital waiting lists. According to the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation's Trolley Watch figures for May, there were 9,091 people waiting for inpatient beds in that month. As we prepare for budget 2019 - we will get another chance to talk about the summer economic statement this evening - I hope the Taoiseach and his Ministers are working on measures to begin the implementation of the Sláintecare report at long last, as my colleague has said. The statistics revealed in the Sinn Féin motion this afternoon are utterly shameful. We need to take action to remedy them.</p>

          <p eId="para_659">The reality in this motion is that HSE management structures are not fit for purpose because they cannot deliver a timely service. That is the issue which underpins Sláintecare, about which many Deputies have spoken this afternoon. HSE management structures are not fit for purpose. Sláintecare underpins that and offers solutions to that. In addition, the Department of Health is not fit for purpose because it cannot develop policies to modernise our outdated health service. This is a huge issue. The HSE is unable to deliver. The Department of Health is unable to develop policies that will deliver a modern service. I was very disappointed with the Minister's delusional comment that the situation in respect of waiting lists is getting better. It is getting worse as each month goes by. He said that health reform is a key policy of the Government, but those were empty words because there is no evidence that the Government is developing any key policy that will help the health service. There is a lack of vision, ambition and curiosity about why we are in the situation we are in. The Sláintecare report is one of the most abused reports in this Dáil. The report sets out a ten-year vision, but the Government does not have any vision. The Government claims that Sláintecare is one of its central policy planks, but it has done nothing to implement it. No Sláintecare recommendation of any significance has been implemented. It is important for patient testimony to be heard. The Minister spoke in abstract terms about the hundreds of thousands of people who are on waiting lists and the percentages that are increasing and decreasing, but his remarks did not encompass the individual person who is suffering. I am aware of a patient who was diagnosed with bowel cancer four months ago. It is absolutely scandalous that this person is still waiting for surgery even though the actual diagnosis was made four months ago.</p>

          <p eId="para_660">I want to express my utter disappointment that this country's excessive waiting lists have continued since well before I was elected to this House. People of all ages are having to wait for unacceptable lengths of time. My offices are inundated with people who are suffering with medical conditions and are looking for help because they have been on waiting lists for excessive periods of time. Many people have been waiting for two years or more to be treated.</p>
          <p eId="para_661">In west Cork, many people are waiting up to five years for cataract operations. Many of them are elderly. This is an utterly unacceptable length of time to wait for a procedure that takes only ten or 15 minutes. As we cannot resolve this issue in the Republic, Deputy Danny Healy-Rae and myself have sent ten buses to Belfast to relieve the pressure we have in west Cork.</p>
          <p eId="para_662"> West Cork has the largest population of elderly people in Ireland and we need extra beds for respite care. Waiting times for respite beds need to be reduced. We also have children waiting a year and half or longer for ophthalmic appointments while children with scoliosis are on long waiting lists as well. Their medical conditions worsen while they are waiting to be seen and treated. This is a disgrace. The children of today are our future of tomorrow and they deserve better. The closures of the accident and emergency departments in Bantry, Mallow and the South Infirmary hospitals without sufficient capacity being made available in Cork University Hospital, CUH, and the Mercy hospitals have contributed to the excessive waiting lists. The programme for Government promised the most fundamental reform of our health service in the history of the State. The need for change in the health service is unquestionable and waiting lists need to be dramatically reduced. Where is this change and when will we see it?</p>

          <p eId="para_663">I feel sorry for the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, who was shoved in here to take this. Harris was here but he fled when someone wanted to come in to talk because he cannot face the heat in the kitchen.</p>
          <p eId="para_664"> Last year I had confirmation of patients in Tipperary who were routinely waiting for 51 months for an appointment with a consultant urologist at University Hospital Waterford, UHW. This is absolutely outrageous. What is worse is that it is not getting any better. The problem is literally deepening with every passing week. I have had to make representations to UHW for a constituent and was told that the waiting time for urology was 48 months - four years. In a Third World country it would not happen. Less than a month after that, I was informed that the waiting time for the same consultant was now 51 months, steadily approaching five years. Every week, the waiting time is increasing by a month. What on earth is going on when it takes nearly five years for a patient to be seen? Has the Government no shame and no moral compass that it would allow that to happen? It is getting worse by the hour.</p>
          <p eId="para_665"> My main concern is that in the intervening time period, what might initially have been a routine or non-urgent case may develop into something far more invasive and dangerous. The people of Tipperary and the south east generally are appalled by this kind of service. I am also aware that even urgent ear, nose and throat patients can now expect to wait between 15 and 18 months. This would not be tolerated in any democracy. The Government is just hiding behind the HSE. In any other democracy, the Minister, Deputy Harris, would be long gone. He would have been long gone with the cervical scandal but the Government wanted to get the referendum over the line. It stuck together like glue to get that over. Where is the compassion now for women or patients? It is disgusting. It gets worse and worse; to hell with the people. Let them eat cake. Let them do what they like. Let them die on the side of the road or whatever. Next the Government will probably want to bring in euthanasia to get rid of them. It is nothing short of a disgrace and I do not know how the Government has the guts or moral feeling to listen to this puppet Minister who would not even come to the House to listen. He is nothing short of a puppet.</p>

          <p eId="para_666">Parents are waiting with sick children. They cannot sleep as they are worried about when consultants will see them and they are waiting for treatment. Elderly people are waiting for hips and knees and every other type of operation. The most serious thing at present is that people are waiting in our cardiac unit, a unit that does massive work for many people in Kerry, Cork and the south of Ireland. In CUH there are people waiting as we are speaking. We have five Ministers for Health, a Government and a Department of Health but we do not have a health system. That is the truth of the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_667"> One man I know very well was to have a planned triple bypass. It was arranged for sometime at the start of April. The day he was to go in, it was cancelled and then he was waiting for three or four weeks. The next thing that happened was he got the heart attack and he was admitted to the hospital and he was there for three weeks. He was promised day after day that he would be done the next day and he was only done in the last week. That is not good enough. I have raised this point at different times on the Order of Business. It is happening again. There are several patients there at present in the same capacity, waiting for a triple bypass. What is wrong? The Government needs to put more resources and more surgeons in there. The work needs to be done. These people do not have time. They will get a heart attack and die and that will be the end of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_668"> The other thing is intermediary care vehicles. It is a nonsense - a joke. The Government did this thing called "reconfiguration of the ambulance service" in Kerry and emergency ambulances were cut way down. That is the result of it. An 85 year old man was to be taken from Tralee to Cork and because the emergency ambulance could not or would not take him, he remained on a trolley for two whole days. That is not good enough. That is not the way to treat our elderly who have served our country and brought us to where we are. I am told there is a way better health service in Cuba where there is a dictatorship. That is the truth. In spite of having five Ministers for Health, a Government and a health service, we cannot serve the people.</p>

          <p eId="para_669">I commend Deputy O'Reilly of Sinn Féin for proposing the motion. The motion and the whole waiting lists scandal emphasises again the dysfunctional nature of the HSE and the fact that it is not fit for purpose. There is absolutely no democratic control of the HSE. It should never have been established. Many of us who voted against its establishment warned of situations just like this arising. The HSE was never fit for purpose.</p>
          <p eId="para_670"> It is worthwhile putting the numbers on the record again: 700,000 people waiting for medical procedures in May of this year; 511,000 on outpatient waiting lists; 147,000 awaiting outpatient appointments for over a year; and almost 80,000 awaiting outpatient appointments longer than 18 months. These are scandalous figures. They affect not just the patients but also their families. The two-tier health system that we have ensures that the vast majority of people on these waiting lists are in the public system. They are people on social welfare payments, people on low incomes, people who are PAYE workers. There is very little waiting at all in the private system. This system affects ordinary individuals and families almost exclusively. That needs to be changed.</p>
          <p eId="para_671"> The summer economic statement we saw yesterday indicated that the situation is going to continue into the future. There is no significant development in that statement to suggest there will be any additional money, for instance for the Sláintecare report. It condemns 700,000 people to waiting lists right into the future. Waiting times for scoliosis, cataracts, orthopaedic procedures, urology and for the child and adolescent mental health services are absolutely outrageous. I got a letter recently from the HSE referring to urology waiting lists, on which the waiting times are about four years for urgent cases. The HSE now refuses even to put a time limit on it. The letter states that the current waiting time for the urology list is extensive - four years.</p>
          <p eId="para_672"> The other area I want to address specifically is the question of assessment of needs for children with disabilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_673">As the Minister of State is aware, the Disability Act 2005 provides that in respect of children who are referred for assessment, the commencement of assessment should be within a three month period and should be finalised within a further three month period. This is simply non-existent now. Thousands of children across the country are waiting to be assessed. There are hundreds of children waiting to be assessed in my constituency of Tipperary. I remind the Minister of State that there is a legal obligation on the HSE to provide this assessment of needs. It is breaking the law by not doing so. A blind eye is being turned to it. I have raised this matter on a number of occasions in this Chamber and have asked the Minister to deal with the matter. He has indicated that he would but, effectively, nothing has happened. We are allowing the HSE to continue to break the law and discriminate against children who require an assessment of needs and services deriving from that assessment.</p>
          <p eId="para_674"> I have a letter from the HSE dated 24 May 2018 that refers to an individual child. The letter states that this child's case was discussed at a recent disability services administration meeting and that the HSE could confirm that the scheduled date for assessment would be April 2020 - two years hence. That child will be over five years of age in two years time. We all know how necessary it is for these assessments to be carried out early and for services to be provided early to children who need services such as speech therapy, psychological services, occupational therapy and a range of other necessary services. The HSE is breaking the law with regard to this service and these children. It is the duty and responsibility of the Minister to take this matter up urgently with the HSE and to have it rectified immediately.</p>
          <p eId="para_675"> I refer to the final item referred to by Deputy O'Reilly in the motion, which is the role of properly resourced and staffed community hospitals in taking pressure off the main hospitals and helping to reduce waiting lists. I refer to Our Lady's Hospital in Cashel in my constituency. This is a refurbished hospital that cost about €14 million. It was refurbished to provide 65 beds consisting of convalescent, district hospital and palliative care beds. That hospital has been lying idle for eight years. It has been fully refurbished at a cost of some €14 million. It is a white elephant without a single bed in it. It is empty. This hospital should be opened immediately to provide the kind of beds to which I referred. That is what the refurbishment was about. It would take huge pressure off South Tipperary General Hospital, which works at about 120% capacity every hour, every day, every week, every month and every year. The hospital should be opened immediately. The Minister has already been to the hospital and has seen the modern standards provided there and the fact that it is a white elephant that is vacant. It is time he opened that hospital. This would help with regard to waiting lists.</p>

						</b>I take this opportunity to thank Deputy O'Reilly for bringing forward this motion. The Sláintecare report was mentioned a couple of times tonight. Yes, it could be the blueprint for the future if the Government would actually implement it or even set up an implementation body to implement it. We are talking about waiting lists. There is another side to waiting lists, namely, the impact on families and the individuals in pain. The documentary entitled "Living on the List" was mentioned. It brought me to tears a number of weeks ago to look at a 16 year old girl with scoliosis. It took nearly three years for her to get an operation. When she was eventually operated on, her condition has got so bad that the operation was far more complicated. Complications became apparent a number of months later when the spinal cord came off where it had been pinned. Instead of taking that young girl back to the hospital and rectifying that problem, she was nursed at home by her mother, could not go to school and was in pain 24-7. It was only when the wound at the back of her neck became septic that her mother brought her to a hospital and eventually they decided to rectify the problem. These are the real issues when it comes to waiting lists. We know that we can all provide figures but the human cost of all of this and the suffering are atrocious.</p>
          <p eId="para_677"> A number of weeks ago, I raised the case of a lovely little lad from east Cork who has Escobar syndrome - one of only 200 cases in the world. That poor little lad, who is seven years of age, could not even get on to a waiting list because there was no waiting list for what he needed, which was a specialist wheelchair. It was budgetary so it just goes to show how unfit for purpose the HSE is. We need to think outside the box and start looking at people again who are human.</p>
          <p eId="para_678"> There are over 2,400 people on the mental health waiting list waiting for CAMHS. It is totally understaffed. The fact that Waterford and Wexford will lose their full service by July was mentioned.</p>
          <p eId="para_679"> We must remember and be respectful towards the front-line staff in the HSE working across all services. They are stretched to the limit. It is disingenuous to knock everybody. They are the heroes but when there are constant and long waiting lists, mothers suffer mental torture and are broken emotionally because they cannot look after their child. This year alone, I sourced three wheelchairs through my office for old people because they could not even get on to a waiting list to get help. They are relying on the wheelchair until the problem festers so much that it becomes an emergency. It has been absolutely atrocious. We must sort this out. I have to say that the HSE is not fit for purpose</p>

          <p eId="para_680"><b>
						</b>I will begin with some statistics. Between the various hospitals in Cork, there are 31,265 people on outpatient lists and 998 inpatients on waiting lists while 707,000 people are waiting lists nationally. Statistics can serve a good or bad purpose. On the one hand, they are evidence of a reality and outline the scale of a problem. In this instance, that is quite stark. A total of 707,000 people are on waiting lists in a State where the population is only about 5 million. A total of 35,000 or so people are on waiting lists in a city and greater region with a population of 300,000. In both instances, that is in or around one in ten or over one in ten for the State as a whole so the scale of this is enormous.</p>
          <p eId="para_681"> On the other hand, statistics can obscure the reality of each of those individuals and the situations they face because these people are not simply waiting. They are suffering, their condition is deteriorating, their pain is increasing, their options are reducing, their health is declining and in quite serious circumstances, their prognosis is in serious decline. This is particularly stark in disciplines such as obstetrics and gynaecology, ophthalmology, neurology and, obviously, mental health. I also note the serious waiting list that exists in Cork University Maternity Hospital, which is a absolute scandal. The numbers are way above national averages and the hospital is desperate need of further investment. </p>
          <p eId="para_682"> This needs to be resolved. It is not just a question of resources. There is also the question of management. Sometimes there is a lack of common sense. I came across a case recently where a lady needed an ultrasound for two knees.</p>
          <p eId="para_683">She was in contact with the hospital and then received two different dates for the two knees. She spoke to the receptionist who was trying to arrange it, and who obviously had no control over it, and said to her, "Look, I will be bringing both knees with me on the day". Nonetheless, it ended up being done on two different days.</p>
          <p eId="para_684"> Deputy O'Reilly has clearly given real options. This is not just a debate that is trying to put it up to the Government. We have given alternatives which have been on the table for some time. The Government needs to implement them.</p>

          <p eId="para_685">There are 707,000 people waiting for medical procedures in this country. That is equivalent to everyone living in Westmeath, Laois, Offaly, Cavan, Sligo, Roscommon, Fermanagh, Monaghan, Carlow, Longford and Leitrim. The Fine Gael hospital waiting list is equivalent to the total population of 11 Irish counties. For the majority of these people, there are serious consequences. Many are in constant pain and discomfort, many are incapacitated or disabled by their illness, many will not be able to work and are forced to live on disability payments and many will watch in horror as their health slowly deteriorates while Fine Gael stands idly by.</p>
          <p eId="para_686"> Our Lady's Hospital in Navan has seen a doubling of figures for waiting lists in the outpatient clinic. In the past two years there has been an increase of 1,255 people waiting for treatment. There are 347 people who have been waiting more than 18 months for treatment whereas, two years ago, there was only one person in that position.</p>
          <p eId="para_687"> Even if we delete the humanity from this shocking crisis, we are talking about a false economy. Timely medical intervention saves money whereas conditions left to worsen for months and years need more invasive and costly interventions. For the past seven years we have come in here and the Government has pleaded the poor mouth and said it does not have the money. However, in the past three years the Government has given back €1.5 billion in tax breaks to people who are mostly on upper incomes. The front page of the<i> Irish Independent</i> today is splashed with speculation that a further €250 million will be given back in tax breaks in October.</p>
          <p eId="para_688"> It is important to remember that, as Deputies, we are individually and personally responsible for the outcomes of the decisions we make here. It seems Deputy Simon Harris has recently become the Minister for saying sorry. Year after year, Fine Gael makes budgetary decisions that prioritise those living on Fine Gael street and it allows thousands of others to rot on waiting lists.</p>

          <p eId="para_689">I commend the Sinn Féin party on bringing forward this very important motion. It is, yet again, with great frustration that I speak on this issue. Many of us have spoken time and again but the Minister is clearly not heeding us. He needs to take action because this cannot go on any longer. We cannot allow our citizens to languish on long waiting lists with nothing being done about it. We need an efficient health service that cares for people. In May of this year the Government was presiding over a waiting list of 707,000 people, which is incredible and unacceptable. This waiting list includes, for example, children suffering from juvenile arthritis. As of 22 May, 120 children were awaiting inpatient rheumatology treatment and 976 were awaiting outpatient treatment. Of these, 1,200 children have been waiting beyond the Sláintecare recommended wait time of 12 weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_690"> I have been contacted by many distressed parents on this issue. It is unacceptable. We need urgent intervention. If we really want to be a caring society, let us show that we care and let us lead by example. We know there are 3,180 older people waiting for cataract surgery. Again, we see that it is the most vulnerable - the young and the elderly - who are suffering.</p>
          <p eId="para_691"> According to a survey carried out by the Association of Optometrists Ireland, the average wait time across the country is 28 months and up to five years in some areas. We also know the overcrowding in our hospitals is having a major impact on waiting lists. It is leading to the cancellation of the much sought-after elective surgery that an elderly patient or young person needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_692"> We need to take action. Today, as we gather in this Chamber, there are 30 people awaiting a proper bed at the Midland Regional Hospital in Tullamore. That is totally unacceptable but is a regular occurrence. We need action from the Minister, not a great, aspirational speech. He needs to prove himself as Minister for Health and he is not doing that. He is homing in on certain areas with a certain agenda but he is neglecting many in society. It needs to stop.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Catherine Byrne)<recordedTime time="2018-06-20T17:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_693">I thank Deputy Louise O'Reilly for bringing the motion before the House. As the Minister, Deputy Harris, has outlined, the Government will not oppose the motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_694"> I want to comment on some of the remarks before I deliver my speech. Deputy Joan Collins referred to the killing of Sláintecare. I assure the Deputy that the Taoiseach, Ministers and the Government are committed to Sláintecare. Deputy Harty relayed a story about a man who has been diagnosed with cancer and has not received the necessary treatment for the last four months. I will certainly raise that with the Minister, Deputy Harris, when I see him this evening. As for Deputy Mattie McGrath, what can I say? I do not know whether to be amused or bemused, to be honest. I know where my moral compass is and I do not need anybody in this House to tell me where it should be. As for where the Minister has fled to, I cannot comment on that as I have no idea.</p>
          <p eId="para_695"> All Deputies have spoken from the heart, which I would expect on an issue such as waiting lists and people attending accident and emergency services. I am somebody who has experience from recent months of the importance of having accident and emergency departments where people can be taken in emergency situations, given I had to go there on Christmas morning with my husband. I was taken aback by the fact there were only six people in the intensive care area on Christmas morning, with the patients waiting in cubicles. I am not sure if that happens every Christmas but it certainly happened last Christmas.</p>
          <p eId="para_696"> The reduction in the number of patients waiting for a hospital procedure over the last ten months, from 86,100 in July 2017 to 78,600 in May, is significant. The target of below 70,000 by the end of the year is equally significant and demonstrates that investment in our health services, in combination with a solid implementation plan, will deliver results. Regarding the request to properly invest in our public health system, I draw attention to the fact the Government has committed a record level of €10.9 billion in the national development plan to the health sector over the coming decade. This is building on the momentum of past years, where the Government increased funding for health services each year since 2013, totalling a 19% increase over the period. A Programme for a Partnership Government commits to sustain these increases.</p>
          <p eId="para_697"> Investments in budget 2018 were closely aligned with the recommendations in the Sláintecare report. New initiatives included investing €25 million in a new primary care fund, additional funding of €25 million for home care and transition beds, €17 million to reduce medicine and prescription charges, €75 million targeted to reduce waiting lists and €1 million for the Sláintecare programme office.</p>
          <p eId="para_698"> The demand for nearly all health and social care services is growing, primarily as a result of overall population growth and the ageing of the population. This trend has been demonstrated by analysis from the ESRI last year and the Department's health service capacity review 2018. The review stated that the system will need nearly 2,600 additional acute hospital beds by 2031. The Minister has asked the Department to work with the HSE to identify the location and mix of beds across the hospital system which can be opened and staffed this year and into 2019 in order to improve preparedness for winter 2018-19.</p>
          <p eId="para_699"> As outlined in the capacity review, the demographic pressures being experienced by the health service are such that they demand not just additional capacity but also continued emphasis on health and well-being initiatives, an improved model of care with a stronger role for enhanced community-based services and continued improvement in productivity, including in acute hospitals. Importantly, the accelerated introduction of additional capacity for 2018-19 will be matched by forthcoming reforms, including the publication of a detailed Sláintecare implementation plan and the overhaul of the current GP contract.</p>
          <p eId="para_700">In addition, a review of the winter initiative 2017-18 is being undertaken which will inform a three-year plan for unscheduled care and support the provision of additional capacity in winter 2018-19. The Government is committed to investment in additional capacity in line with the national development plan which includes provision for 2,600 acute hospital beds, including three new elective facilities, 4,300 community care beds, diagnostic hubs in the community and the roll-out of e-health infrastructure across the health system. Work is also under way to identify the number and location of additional beds that can be opened and staffed in 2018 and into 2019. This increase in capacity is at the centre of future-proofing our health system.</p>
          <p eId="para_701"> One way to increase elective work is through the provision of new dedicated ambulatory elective-only hospitals as proposed for Dublin, Galway and Cork in the national development plan. The introduction of these dedicated day and ambulatory centres is in line with health care developments internationally and the recommendations of the 2018 health service capacity review. They should both increase capacity in the hospital system and provide a better separation of scheduled and unscheduled care. However, investment and reform must go hand in hand.</p>
          <p eId="para_702"> The Sláintecare report and its recommendations will transform how our health system functions in the very best interest of patients. There is the opportunity for many of the patients who are currently waiting for an appointment to a hospital outpatient clinic to receive care in the community. Early intervention in the community can play a key role in reducing the number of patients referred to acute hospital services. There has been continued investment in the primary care sector to enable people to be treated in their communities or at home and 118 primary care centres are now operational across the country. Of these, ten have opened in 2018 while a further nine are scheduled to open before year end. These centres provide modern, well-equipped infrastructure and are central to the effective functioning of multidisciplinary teams providing a range of therapy and other services on-site. There is also the opportunity to ensure that patient stays in hospital are as short as is clinically necessary and that facilities in the community are available for patients who require them.</p>
          <p eId="para_703"> The implementation of Sláintecare provides the opportunity to transform our health services and to ensure access for patients to care when they need it and in the most appropriate settings. However, we must continue to take action to improve access to services. Patients receive a high quality service in our health system as confirmed in patient satisfaction surveys. The major challenge is to secure access to those services in the first instance. As the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, outlined earlier, the Government is acutely aware of this challenge, is taking action to address it and welcomes and will consider proposed solutions from all Deputies on this important issue. I thank Deputy O'Reilly for proposing the motion.</p>

          <p eId="para_704">I thank Deputy Louise O'Reilly for bringing forward the motion. I am disappointed that the Minister, Deputy Harris, is not here. While he was here at the start of the debate, he has now left. In fairness, this is a very important issue and he should have been here for the duration of the debate. I have raised the issues at University Hospital Limerick with the Minister on numerous occasions, but he has yet to turn up to address a Topical Issue Matter or a parliamentary question.</p>
          <p eId="para_705"> It is a damning indictment of our country that 707,000 people are on hospital waiting lists. Over 20,000 of those people have joined the lists since the Taoiseach took office. Unsurprisingly, these figures do not appear on the self-congratulatory posters or social media notices he produces on an almost daily basis. Fine Gael no longer has the option of passing the buck to Fianna Fáil, which caused the financial crisis. Fine Gael has had ample time and money over seven years in government to invest in change and assure Irish people of access to quality medical facilities. University Hospital Limerick remains in a ridiculous state of overcrowding. There are 31,117 people waiting for outpatient appointments while 2,805 are on inpatient waiting lists. It is ridiculous. To put these figures in perspective, Limerick city has a population of 100,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_706"> I hope the Minister will examine the issue of the full-capacity protocol which was designed as an emergency measure to deal with overcrowding. It results in patients being placed in inappropriate areas of hospitals, overcrowding on wards, the cancellation of elective procedures and aggressive discharging practices. The protocol was not intended to be used every day or to become the norm. While the protocol was used 30 times in 2011, the year Fine Gael took office, it was, unfortunately, used every single day in 2017. It has also been used every single day this year so far. That is simply not good enough. The Minister must come to the Chamber to tell us when the use of the full-capacity protocol will be discontinued in Limerick.</p>

          <p eId="para_707">I commend Deputy O'Reilly for bringing forward the motion. At the core of this issue is Sláintecare, which must be implemented. I have read the speeches of the Minister and Minister of State. While they are not opposing the motion tonight and are supporting its general context, the public is not seeing Sláintecare being implemented. No one is seeing that. These lists are not merely about numbers or statistics. The point has been made that a lot of people are seen within a short period while very few are on long-term lists. People on long-term lists are human beings, however, and they are suffering, which seems to have been missed in all of this. The issue at the centre of all this is staffing. The reason we do not have enough staff in the HSE and the reason it has failed is that it is an overmanaged service which has been understaffed in all areas. Frontline staffing is the big problem everywhere we go. When one talks to staff, who do a tremendous job and their very best, as everyone in the House acknowledges, they will tell you that it is such a pressurised atmosphere in which to work that people do not stay. They look for somewhere else to go. The only way to fix that problem is with vision. This or some other Government must have the vision to create something different which will work and deliver for people.</p>
          <p eId="para_708"> This has become an enormous problem over the years. Ministers may come and go, but if we do not recognise that the HSE has become a hostage to the private sector, nothing will change. That is the issue which has not been faced. While the Minister told the House this evening that he wants to ensure no private work is done in public hospitals, it continues to happen. There is no plan to stop it. In my constituency, the neurology list for Sligo Hospital includes people who have been waiting for more than two years to see a neurologist. Think of the pain, discomfort and agony people are in. Even if they are not in pain, their lives are on hold during that time. That is what is happening to people out there. Their whole lives and the lives of their families are frozen because of the waiting lists. Continuing to privatise services will simply not work. What we need in the end is vision. We need a Government with the vision and capacity to put the funding in place to implement the policies we need. At the core of that is the Sláintecare report which to date the Government has failed to do anything about.</p>

          <from>Deputy Brian Stanley<recordedTime time="2018-06-20T17:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_709">The two-tier health system which puts private patients first and leaves public patients to wait must end. The system is not an accident and has been overseen by successive Governments over the years. A constituent of mine in Laois contacted the HSE this month and was given a shocking waiting time of four to five years for her child to see a psychologist. The same timeframe applies in Offaly and in many other parts of the country. There is a one to three year waiting period for an assessment of needs. Parents are being told that there are extreme staff shortages across the two counties. Almost 2,000 children are on waiting lists for occupational therapy in Laois-Offaly, of whom 1,000 have been waiting for more than 12 months, and there are almost 400 children waiting for physiotherapy. This is to mention only two waiting lists among many. There are 436 people on a hospital waiting list in Portlaoise while there are 1,918 people on waiting lists in Tullamore.</p>
          <p eId="para_710">Instead of increasing facilities across Laois and Offaly and across the system in general where we have a growing population in the State, we are cutting services. In the case of Portlaoise, we need retention of the full services in that hospital and we need to expand and provide more beds. We need the renovation of nursing homes such as those in Abbeyleix and Mountmellick and their expansion for use as step-down facilities to care for the elderly.</p>
          <p eId="para_711"> That there are more than 700,000 on waiting lists is outrageous. I thought when it hit 500,000 a national emergency would be declared. We have now broken 700,000 on hospital waiting lists and this needs to be treated as a national emergency.</p>
          <p eId="para_712"> The problems in the health services will take time to solve but nothing will happen if the Government does not begin the process. The Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, mentioned the implementation of the Sláintecare report. Most parties were on board with that. We need to push on with that and implement the Sláintecare report. We need to create a proper national health system here in this country - a single-tier public health system.</p>

          <p eId="para_713">Is ceart a rá go bhfuil beagán ábhair níos tábhachtaí nó níos práinní ná an ábhar a táimid ag plé. Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a chur in iúl don Teachta Louise O'Reilly as ucht an rún seo a chur os comhair na Dála.</p>
          <p eId="para_714"> Deputy Louise O'Reilly, my party's health spokesperson, deserves commendation on bringing forward again in the House the issue of our health service. In the motion that Deputy O'Reilly has tabled on behalf of our party, she not only analyses the issues that face hundreds of thousands of people but also comes up with the solutions in the form of a nine-point action plan that we are asking the Government to implement.</p>
          <p eId="para_715"> As on previous occasions, Deputy O'Reilly has shown leadership on this issue in dealing with the crisis in our health service. It was only a number of months ago that the Deputy won popular support for her realistic proposals to deal with the issues of recruitment and retention.</p>
          <p eId="para_716"> We have heard from previous speakers of the crisis that we are facing with 707,000 people waiting for medical procedures across our public hospitals. No county is immune from that crisis. In my county, the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, tells us that 17,673 patients either require outpatient or day-case treatment in Letterkenny University Hospital. When we break these figures down, we see the pain and suffering that these people have to wait through. A total of 2,319 of them have been on a waiting list for more than a year and a further 2,308 have been waiting for more than 18 months.</p>
          <p eId="para_717"> At Letterkenny hospital's emergency department, we see more turmoil. We see there were 4,889 patients forced onto trolleys last year, an average of 19 patients every day. Meanwhile, beyond all comprehension, only a number of metres away is a closed ward with 19 beds. A closed ward has been lying empty for the past number of years. The Government refuses to provide the funding to reopen it and to ensure that every patient on a trolley has a bed, which in itself would allow for more capacity within the system to deal with the atrocious waiting lists.</p>
          <p eId="para_718"> It is easy to focus on statistics but we must be mindful that behind every one of these numbers is a human being. They are our mothers, our fathers, our brothers, our sisters, somebody's son or somebody's daughter. They are people, just like the Minister of State and me. They are sick and vulnerable and they need the State to help them, to care for them and in some instances to save their lives, and yet, month after month, year after year, they are being failed by the Government. Tá siad á ligint síos arís agus arís eile ag an Rialtas They are being failed by a Government whose policies and reluctance to prioritise health more broadly put the health, well-being and lives of patients and their families at risk. That is the reality of the situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_719"> Yesterday, we heard that despite having €1.4 billion available to invest to deal with this crisis and address this challenge head on, the Government has decided in the summer economic statement that is not the best course of action.</p>

          <p eId="para_723">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_724">That Dáil Éireann shares the dismay and condemnation articulated internationally and in the U.S. following the recent U.S. policy of removing children from their immigrant parents to take them into custody, views this as inhumane, undignified and unwarranted, and calls for it to be reversed immediately.</p>
          <p eId="para_725">I speak in favour of the all-party motion and the sentiments it conveys. I thank Opposition parties for working to try to find agreement on the motion that we are all supporting.</p>
          <p eId="para_726"> We have all been rightly appalled by the images which have recently emerged of immigrant children being separated from their parents at the southern US border and held in detention by the US authorities. I have no desire to become involved in a US domestic debate about immigration. Clearly, every state has the right, indeed, a duty, to police its own borders and to enforce its immigration laws. This duty should, however, be discharged by all countries in line with international obligations and with respect for the human rights of all involved, especially children.</p>
          <p eId="para_727"> It would be helpful at the outset of this debate to outline the factors which have brought us to what is, in my opinion, a shocking and unacceptable situation. As the House will be aware, the issue of immigration has long been a politically sensitive one in the United States. We are all familiar with the situation of undocumented Irish citizens in the US. Many of us on all sides of the House will have discussed the plight of our citizens over the years with representatives of successive US Administrations and with politicians from both sides of the US political divide. We know first-hand how sensitive and challenging the issue of migration is in Washington.</p>
          <p eId="para_728"> The sensitivity of the issue has become even more acute in recent years. The southern border with Mexico has featured heavily in recent political campaigns and this led to the announcement in April this year of a so-called zero tolerance approach, whereby any adult found to be entering the United States illegally is liable to automatic criminal prosecution. I understand that US legal protocols prohibit the detention of children along with their parents where the children are not charged with a crime but the parents are so charged. It is as a consequence of this zero tolerance approach that, while adults are being detained by the US Marshals Service or the Bureau of Prisons pending a federal trial, their children are being separated from them and placed in the custody of the Department of Health and Human Services.</p>
          <p eId="para_729"> According to US Customs and Border Protection, since early April, 2,300 children have been separated from their parents at the US-Mexico border and placed in detention. It is unclear how long these children will be separated from their families, but clearly such a policy risks having a traumatic effect on young children. As the Taoiseach said yesterday, we know from our own recent history how damaging the consequences can be of separating children from their parents. A number of medical organisations in the US have issued strong letters of protest citing an increased risk of anxiety and depression in the affected children as well as risks of post-traumatic stress and attention deficit disorder. Prior to this, the US authorities had followed policies that ensured that immigrant families who arrived illegally were not automatically split up when parents and children were detained. This approach was followed by the US Administration until April.</p>
          <p eId="para_730"> Deputies will have seen the shocking images of cages, foil blankets and crying children at US detention centres near the border and will be aware of widespread criticism of this policy from business groups, human rights organisations and many prominent Americans from across the political spectrum. All four living former US first ladies have publicly expressed opposition to this programme. I cannot do much better than quote Mrs. Laura Bush who said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_731">I appreciate the need to enforce and protect our international boundaries, but this zero-tolerance policy is cruel. It is immoral. And it breaks my heart.</p>
          <p eId="para_732">This dismay is also reflected in wider civil society across the United States. We are by no means alone in voicing our concern in this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_733"> The United States and Ireland enjoy a unique relationship, built historically on the emigration of so many of our people to that country. This history of migration to the United States long predates US independence in 1776 and was particularly acute during the dark Famine years of the 1840s and in the generations that followed, right up to recent decades. This movement of people from Ireland to the United States formed the foundation of what is now a 33 million strong Irish-American diaspora.</p>
          <p eId="para_734">Irish America has made an immense contribution to the United States, something that we should all be proud of. The US provided a refuge from persecution and poverty to generations of Irish people as it opened its doors not just to us but to many millions of immigrants from all over the world who will never forget their generosity and openness. We, the people of Ireland, will be forever indebted to the people of the United States for that welcome when our need was at its greatest.</p>
          <p eId="para_735"> We understand and accept that no country could now afford to have the kind of open immigration laws the US had in the 19th century. We in the European Union have ourselves struggled to agree on how best to deal with the challenges posed by large movements of people fleeing violence and despair in their home countries and seeing within our borders the prospects of a better life for themselves and their families. We have also seen, however, the terrible human suffering which lies at the heart of such migration, and we are acutely conscious of our responsibilities to afford protection to people who find themselves and their families in the most trying and dangerous of circumstances. We are particularly aware of the need to safeguard the rights and well-being of children who have been caught up in situations far beyond their control.</p>
          <p eId="para_736"> Ireland, in common with all member states of the European Union, has ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which establishes clear universal standards for the protection of all children. The convention states that signatories shall ensure that children shall not be separated from their parents against their will, unless such a separation is necessary in the best interests of the child. I cannot see any way in which the current policy could be said to be in the best interests of the children who have been separated from their parents. While the United States has not ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the only UN member which has not done so, nevertheless there is surely an onus on all of us to pay due regard to internationally accepted standards of behaviour in the implementation of our laws.</p>
          <p eId="para_737"> It is doubly unfortunate that, just yesterday, at a time when international attention was focused on the treatment by the US of immigrant children, the US announced its intention to withdraw from the UN Human Rights Council. This is a big setback in the standing of the US in the world. The United States has long been a key player in the development of a rules-based, multilateral system which has placed human rights at the centre of international relations. Famously, this included the leading role played by US First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt 70 years ago in securing agreement on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The United States has a long and proud tradition of participating in multilateral fora in defence of human rights. Its continued full and active participation is essential to challenge the chorus of those who seek to decry and diminish the universal value of human rights. Now is not the time for the US to be stepping back from its international leadership responsibilities. The United States, as I have said, is entitled to police its own borders and enforce its immigration laws. It is clear to me, however, that the US authorities are not going about this the right way when it comes to dealing with families who have been apprehended while trying to enter the United States illegally across its southern border.</p>
          <p eId="para_738"> I hope that our friends in the United States will take these comments in the spirit in which they are intended, as friends speaking truthfully to one another, with a genuine concern. I am speaking here as a friend, as someone who looks to the United States for global leadership. Against this backdrop, it is deeply regrettable to see the good name of America being damaged by the shocking images that have been seen around the world in recent days. The policy of separating children from their parents is inhumane and simply wrong. This is not the America that I know and respect, nor is it in the best traditions of the great and generous American people. I urge the US, therefore, to reverse this policy of separation immediately, and I think everybody in this House is making the same call. I call on the US authorities to return these children to their parents without delay before potentially irreversible damage is done to them and also to the reputation of the United States.</p>
          <p eId="para_739"> I think there is some good news on the horizon. We have been hearing from Washington D.C. that the President intends to sign a document today that may well end this practice, and do so quickly, but we will await details with interest.</p>

          <p eId="para_740">I am sharing time with Deputy O'Loughlin and Deputy Lisa Chambers. I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to allow us to speak on this important matter. Fianna Fáil has sought and secured support from almost all of our colleagues on our motion condemning the US policy of removing children from their immigrant parents. Such a policy is, in my view and that of my party, cruel and demeaning. It is an act of inhumanity and one to which we cannot and should not turn a blind eye. The US Government has separated approximately 2,000 children from their parents at the border since implementing a practice that results in family separations.</p>
          <p eId="para_741"> This zero tolerance policy entails criminally charging those entering the US illegally, including asylum seekers. This has led to parents being separated from their children, who are not being charged with a crime. As a result of this policy, hundreds of children are being housed in detention centres, including warehouses and converted supermarkets. Images and videos of children in what are effectively cages and crying out for their parents are very distressing. This latest policy follows on from an executive order in February which included a 90 day travel ban from seven Muslim majority countries, a 120 day freeze on admission of any refugees into the United States, as well as an indefinite halt to admitting any refugees from Syria. At that time Fianna Fáil rightly criticised the executive order as discriminatory and a policy that undermined the integrity of the international refugee protection programme. I have no hesitation today in criticising this latest policy which results in children being mercilessly separated from their parents. It is simply wrong and America can and must do better.</p>
          <p eId="para_742"> Ireland is a friend of the United States, our countries enjoy a warm and enduring relationship and thousands of Irish people have come to consider the United States as their home. Our party very much values this relationship with the United States and recognises the importance of the close ties and strong bonds that we have built over many years and over different US administrations, and we want to maintain this relationship. Our friendship should not prevent us, however, from speaking the truth and calling out injustices when and where we see them. This is one time when we must speak up and speak out. I am calling, therefore, for this policy to be reversed immediately and for a more compassionate approach to be adopted.</p>
          <p eId="para_743"> We as a party recognise that migration poses challenges and some countries face more challenges than others, but all countries that believe in human rights, dignity and the fair and proportionate application of the law have a duty to deal with such challenges compassionately and fairly. While it is not always easy we must never lose sight of what is morally indefensible.</p>
          <p eId="para_744"> In a recently released report the UN Refugee Agency said that 68.5 million people were displaced as of the end of 2017. Among them were 16.2 million people who became displaced during 2017 itself, either for the first time or on a repeated basis, indicating a huge number of people on the move and equivalent to 44,500 people being displaced each day, or a person becoming displaced every two seconds. War, conflict and poverty are forcing people to flee their homes and their countries to seek better lives elsewhere. The reality is that many do not undertake these journeys lightly and often risk their lives in the process. The scale of the migration crisis has presented many countries with challenges and America is no different, but what sets countries apart is how humanely they deal with this challenge. It is imperative that America, as a country that has so often led on human rights, reverses this indefensible policy immediately and reunites the children with their parents.</p>

          <p eId="para_745">Events in Texas in the US have rightly caused an outrage right across the world. We see and hear that almost 2,000 immigrant children have been separated from their parents in April and May according to the Department of Homeland Security, and there is no doubt that this zero tolerance policy from the Trump Administration will serve to increase business for human smugglers who will use the separation policy to sell their services, arguing that they can help migrants to avoid border controls and hence stay with their children.</p>
          <p eId="para_746">The Irish author, Donal Ryan, is a great chronicler of our times on social issues. I recently read his last novel, <i>From a Low and Quiet Sea</i>, which paints in words far stronger than mine the harsh reality for people trying to escape. When they are at their most vulnerable, they are taken advantage of by smugglers. Migrant babies and toddlers have been sent to so-called tender age shelters and we have seen pictures of distraught children in cages and heard audio of them calling out in distress for their parents. Using children as political bargaining chips must be the lowest form of politics and the Trump Administration must be condemned for its actions. If President Trump does sign the order today to cease these actions, we will have to ensure the 2,000 children who were separated from their parents in April and May are reunited.</p>
          <p eId="para_747"> This is World Refugee Day and we need to look at our own treatment of refugees in this country. The Government has limited the opportunities for family reunion under the International Protection Act 2015. Changes introduced in this law mean that only family members in a very restricted category can apply to be reunited and only within a very tight timeframe. The International Protection (Family Reunification) Amendment Bill 2017 passed through the Seanad in 2017 and now needs to progress through the Dáil. It is in the lottery system in my name and I call on anyone who condemns the US Administration to give their full support to the Bill to allow the State to deliver on its humanitarian commitments to allow grandparents to be reunited with grandchildren, children aged over 18 years to be reunited with their parents and elder brothers and sisters to be reunited with their younger siblings. The effects of separation are devastating and the right to family life and the protection of the family are enshrined in international human rights law. These are values that cut across cultures and unite all of us, or should. We need to show America and the rest of the world that Ireland is serious about sharing responsibility for those in need of international protection.</p>

          <p eId="para_748">I welcome the opportunity to speak in favour of this all-party motion. I will begin with a quote from Robert F. Kennedy:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_749">The United States was born in revolution and nurtured by struggle. Throughout our history, the American people have befriended and supported all those who seek independence and a better way of life.</p>
          <p eId="para_750">If he were alive to see the America of today, he would find it far beyond the vision he had for his country and people. The United States is fast becoming an unrecognisable country. Children as young as one year are being kept in cages in areas which have been deemed to be concentration camps in Texas, with children whom they do not know minding them. We heard audio of children crying, wailing as they searched for their mothers and fathers, which is beyond reprehensible. It is disgraceful, disgusting and without excuse.</p>
          <p eId="para_751"> We are very afraid to condemn these actions. I wonder if it were Russia taking these actions, or other countries with which we are not so friendly, would we be as cautious in our words as we are being in this Chamber today? We have to very clear that we condemn, in the strongest possible terms, the actions of the Trump Administration and US immigration policy. These shelters have been termed "tender age shelters" for toddlers. Children are being torn from the arms of their mothers who do not know if they will ever get them back, which is beyond words. There is an element of disbelief across the world. We hear that there is to be some movement this evening and some law signed by the Republican Party to change this because, as President Trump said, "it looks bad." It looks far more than bad - it is downright disgraceful.</p>
          <p eId="para_752"> The damage caused by the trauma of what is being done to the children can never be repaired, even if they are reunited with their parents and I hope every effort will be made to do so. The United States should be championing human rights. It was the country which, 50 years ago, led the way on civil rights. It should be standing up for human rights, rather than stepping on people.</p>

        <speech by="#SeanCroweSF" eId="spk_344">
          <from>Deputy Seán Crowe<recordedTime time="2018-06-20T18:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_753">Sinn Féin supports the motion. Like many others, I have been disturbed and appalled by the images coming from the US-Mexico border. Separating children from their parents and detaining them in cages is inhumane and a violation of child and human rights. The audio mentioned of children crying out for their parents, while a federal officer said it was like an "orchestra", reveals just how far wrong the policy has gone. There are reports of lights being kept on for 24 hours a day in the detention centres where these cages are to be found and young children relying on others for basic things such as having their nappies changed. Another report revealed that a ten year old girl with Down's syndrome had recently been separated from her mother and young brother as they attempted to enter the USA. Clearly, children are getting lost in the new system and, increasingly, there are parents who are trying to find out where their children are being detained. A spokesperson for the US Department of Homeland Security has confirmed that over 2,300 children were separated from the 2,200 parents who had crossed the US border without documents between 5 May and 9 June. Amnesty International has stated the new policy of separation and the caging of children were nothing short of torture. I agree. It is mental and physical abuse.</p>
          <p eId="para_754"> The Trump Administration has reached a new low with this immoral policy which it should end. It is clear there has been a deep shift under the Trump Administration to criminalise immigration and dehumanise immigrants and those seeking asylum. President Trump said last night that immigrants were pouring into the USA and infesting the country. He has previously called immigrants "rapists" and claimed that the majority were criminals. Many of the families in question have gone through hell to reach the US border and risked death, rape, hunger and thirst, believing they would be granted asylum in a country that would protect them. No human being is illegal and no one should be treated like this, especially vulnerable children. The US Government is violating its international responsibilities. It is disappointing but not entirely surprising that it is now also removing itself from the UN Human Rights Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_755"> US Government officials have claimed they are being forced to break up families to follow the law, but legal experts believe these claims are false and that there are currently no legal statutes that mandate the separating of children from families at the US border. It appears to many that President Trump's Administration is using the issue as a way of somehow pressurising Democrats into pushing through immigration reform legislation which includes funding for his border wall which clearly neither the Mexican people or Government will fund. The Minister must also express Ireland's opposition to this policy of separation and the caging of children directly with the US Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_756"> There is also a responsibility on us to review our own immigration policies. Ireland's direct provision system is clearly a gross violation of people's human's rights and should be dismantled immediately. Many people have been languishing in this repressive system for years and we need to replace it with a new system that will have human rights and the protection of human dignity at its core. A regularisation scheme for undocumented immigrants in Ireland should also be introduced. Migrant Rights Centre Ireland estimates that between 20,000 and 26,000 undocumented immigrants, including children and families, are living and working in Ireland. Regularisation would not just be the smart thing to do, it would also be the right thing to do. No young child should have to grow up here in fear and undocumented, with no rights and no supports. These workers and their families should have the right to move from the shadows into the open. The undocumented and their families should have the chance to live in dignity and safety, free from the awful worry of the unexpected knock on the door in the middle of the night that tells them that they are to be placed in custody with the possibility of being put on an aeroplane to God knows where.</p>
          <p eId="para_757">While we rightly condemn the US Government's inhumane and cruel immigration policies, collectively we need to commit to creating a more humane refugee and immigration system in Ireland.</p>

          <from>Deputy Kathleen Funchion<recordedTime time="2018-06-20T18:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_758">It is welcome that time has been given to make statements on this extremely important issue. As other Members said, we condemn the actions taken. It is unbelievable in this day and age to see such actions being taken by what we deem to be a western country. It has been estimated that 2,342 children were separated from their parents along the US-Mexican border between 5 May and 9 June, or in a little more than a month. It is very distressing and disturbing to watch the images and I am sure any Member who is a parent feels the same way. One immediately thinks of one's own children and the panic the parents must be experiencing in not knowing where their children are located. I cannot even begin to think what it must be like. We need to condemn it in the strongest possible terms and send a very clear message that it is completely unacceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_759"> I understand the Tánaiste has said there might be some news coming from Washington D.C. The Administration has been embarrassed significantly on the international stage and perhaps intends to draw back on its actions, but I fear that it may be a temporary measure because three months ago the US Office of Refugee Resettlement stated it was ending its funding of a particular programme that ran emergency shelters and foster care programmes for younger children and pregnant teenagers arriving in the United States as unaccompanied minors. It transferred all of the children to other facilities and gave no explanation for doing so, but obviously it was planning its current policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_760"> While we are discussing children who find themselves in extremely difficult circumstances, as well as very vulnerable children, we should also be mindful of children in Palestine and Syria, as well as all unaccompanied minors in Europe. It is not good enough for us to single out one country. The issue is topical and we all are completely distressed and shocked by what is happening and condemn it, but we also need to ensure we will look after and stand up for children in all parts of the world. In that regard, we do not have a good history, given the way we have treated children in this country - Deputy Seán Crowe referred to direct provision centres and the fact that there are children in very difficult circumstances in this as well as other countries - but when it comes to issues in other places such as Palestine and Syria, we need to ensure we treat all children equally and condemn what is happening. I hope the international outrage expressed about its actions will embarrass the US Government and that it will row back on them. We need to be as strong on this issue as we are on all issues concerning children, regardless of where they are in world, including our own country.</p>

          <p eId="para_761">To see children being forcibly separated from parents and guardians and put in cages like animals and hear their cries for help was shocking. How anyone could defend it is beyond me. The actions taken, and the accompanying rhetoric from the American President and his defenders in politics, public life and the American media, are an indication that that society has morally lost its way. The defenders of this practice have sought to normalise it in the way people sought to normalise fascism in pre-war Europe, but it is not only in America where we are seeing a decent into nativism and xenophobia and a rise in fascism.</p>
          <p eId="para_762"> In recent weeks we saw a betrayal of what could be described as core European values when a boat carrying hundreds of migrants and refugees on board was turned away from numerous European countries. In Italy we saw the far right government launching an attack on migrants and now on the Roma people. The Hungarian Government has submitted a proposal for a tax on an organisation that supports or portrays migration positively. Only two weeks ago in London we saw xenophobes and hate-filled racists rioting in support of Tommy Robinson. That the media normalise this behaviour and its proponents had their establishment defenders in politics should be a warning to us all. Such normalisation has also happened in this state. The well-known right-wing commentator Katie Hopkins appeared on "The Late Late Show", while the American right-wing commentator Ann Coulter has appeared on Today FM. <i>The Irish Times </i> published an alt-right article by Nicholas Pell. That is how fascism was normalised, how minds are manipulated and how evil grows.</p>
          <p eId="para_763"> I cannot criticise America without rightly criticising the direct provision system. It is abhorrent and should be dismantled. Those who established it should apologise to the people whose lives they have destroyed. The Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland estimates that mental health problems are up to five times higher among those living in direct provision accommodation than in the wider community. Mothers have tried to have their children placed in care to get them out of direct provision centres. While we are right to criticise what is happening in America, we need to get our own house in order. I reiterate that every party that has supported the direct provision system or failed to act on it should apologise to the people whose lives they have destroyed.</p>

          <p eId="para_764">At least 50 million people died in the Second World War during which entire towns and cities were reduced to rubble and millions of people across Europe and elsewhere were displaced. One of the greatest mass movements of people took place in the aftermath of that conflagration, but from the ashes of that catastrophe, a new international order was built. Under the guiding hand of one remarkable woman, Eleanor Roosevelt, who chaired the United Nations Human Rights Commission, the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights was written. It has been a beacon of light and hope for oppressed peoples across the world ever since.</p>
          <p eId="para_765"> For 60 years national governments and non-governmental organisations have been engaged in a painstaking process of building a durable system of international law and human rights protection. That international system is far from perfect. In the area of foreign affairs we engage in diplomacy. Sometimes our ambassadors, Ministers or Deputies have to bite their tongue as they deal with rulers in oppressive regimes. However, we engage with authoritarian countries for a purpose, in the hope that over time we can bring them with us into a global system that respects human rights. While engaging in respectful diplomacy, we also criticise abuses and exert whatever pressure we can to get regimes to comply with international norms.</p>
          <p eId="para_766"> Despite its flaws, the United Nations' human rights system has provided guidance and moral authority in helping to bring more countries towards a stable rule of law, international co-operation and respect for human rights. Increasing numbers of countries hold genuinely democratic elections and when democracy becomes imbedded, elected governments tend to be more responsive to the needs and concerns of their peoples about human rights. Advancing human rights and international law is a long-term project. It requires optimism, a vision of a better future and a commitment to honour the principles of human rights and to play by the rules, even when the going gets tough.</p>
          <p eId="para_767"> Yesterday, in the 60th year since the Universal Declaration of Human Rghts was signed, the US ambassador to the United Nations, Ms Nikki Haley, called the UN Human Rights Council a “cesspool of political bias" and the United States of America withdrew from the Council. This hugely regrettable and short-sighted move provides the context for a number of policies of the current US regime. The immigration policies we see playing out along the border between the United States and Mexico are a prime example of a failure to have vision and to adhere to commitments. The commitment to protect human rights is not something to be abandoned lightly. Despite all of the setbacks in the past 60 years, one thing we have learned is that there is no alternative on offer. There is no international order other than what has been developed over time within a set of international rules and ethically based international systems.</p>
          <p eId="para_768"> It is sad to see some of our partner countries in the European Union erecting barriers to keep out migrants and asylum seekers, including those who are fleeing war, torture and persecution in Syria and elsewhere.</p>
          <p eId="para_769">The Missing Migrants Project estimates that 3,116 people died or went missing in their attempt to reach Europe in 2017. Most of these deaths involve desperate people seeking to cross the Mediterranean Sea. When compared with the number of people who arrived in Europe, it means one person died or went missing for every 60 people who landed in Europe. These desperate people have a one in 60 chance of dying <i>en route </i>to Europe<i>. </i>In a leaky boat and on a journey for which they have borrowed money or have been charged their life savings, they have involved themselves in a game of Russian roulette in the hope of a better future.</p>
          <p eId="para_770"> The people fleeing to Europe are desperate. While some of them are economic migrants who are desperately anxious for a better life and some migrants may ultimately be sent home, at all times we must maintain a minimum threshold of decency. We must maintain a minimum standard of behaviour in how we treat people who take these incredibly hazardous journeys. That minimum standard is known as human rights. This is our responsibility, as Irish legislators, Europeans and human beings. For this reason, Ireland should abolish its failed system of direct provision and allow asylum seekers here to work and cook their own meals, as a basic recognition of human rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_771"> These human rights standards apply equally to the United States of America in how it treats its migrants. For a country whose economic dominance on the world stage is built so obviously and so significantly on the efforts of migrants, it is unconscionable that the US is breaking the most basic laws of human decency by removing children from their parents in an obscene attempt to deter people from seeking to cross the border in the first place. I cannot think of anything more obscene than a country using the threat of removing a person's children to discourage attempts to cross the border.</p>
          <p eId="para_772"> The US is not alone in facing the challenge of mass migration. Ireland understands that challenge all too well, both as a nation that has sent its people to the far corners of the world and as a State that has seen unprecedented levels of inward migration over the past 20 years. Ireland has benefited enormously from the contributions made by the migrant communities that have made the country their home. The United States of America has, even more demonstrably, also enjoyed those benefits. In engaging in this so-called zero tolerance policy against migrants on its southern border, the United States of America is not just creating unimaginable trauma for thousands of children and their parents, it is working against the spirit and letter of the law of internationalism that has built up over the last 60 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_773"> What is the alternative? Are the nations of the world to pull up the drawbridge and ignore the plight of our brothers and sisters from around the world? The Labour Party is a proud member of the Party of European Socialists and the Socialist International. We are committed to a global system that recognises the human rights of every person and works towards the fulfilment of those rights. As part of that, we recognise that many of the problems from which people are fleeing - war, drought caused by global warming and economic ruin - can be traced to the failures and inequalities of the global economic system. The solution to mass migration is not for us to fortify our borders but to work with local people to accelerate the social and economic development of all countries in line with the world's sustainable development goals and human rights norms and commitments to which Ireland is committed.</p>
          <p eId="para_774"> For a long time, we have heard of the need for a Marshall Plan for Africa. We have spoken of a real and genuine support base for countries that need such a plan, but it has not materialised. It must be delivered now.</p>
          <p eId="para_775"> For those reasons, and more, and to preserve the basic decency of the world’s human rights system, the Labour Party endorses the motion condemning the abhorrent treatment of human beings on the border of the United States of America, and we hope the policy will speedily end.</p>

          <p eId="para_776">A parent will do anything for his or her child and anything to make the child's life easier. We live in a grossly unfair world in which wealth is sucked like a magnet to the top and the eight men control the same amount of wealth as 3.5 billion people. People from countries that are ravaged by poverty and war will, just like us, do anything for their children. They will take huge risks such as crossing a border into the United States or they will cross the Mediterranean Sea in a dinghy in the dark. People who are unlucky enough to be born into parts of the world ravaged by imperialism now face the absolute barbarism such as that exemplified by Trump and his approach to migrants. They face tactics reminiscent of those practised under fascism. A parent's biggest fear is to be separated from his or her child. Imagine the terror of separation of a child locked in a cage in a gulag, exposed to all sorts of physical, sexual and other abuse.</p>
          <p eId="para_777"> The Government must decide if Ireland will break decisively with Trump on this issue and with unjust immigration policies in general. The Irish establishment is already part of an EU bloc that is silent on the issue of the plundering resources in the Third World and then turning away its victims through a fortress Europe policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_778"> Ireland operates a system of direct provision. While the effect is not the same as the US system, the intent is the same, namely, to discourage migrants from seeking a better life in Ireland. These are the new policies of capitalism.</p>
          <p eId="para_779"> Trump's terror campaign against migrants was signalled at the beginning of his election campaign. These are not un-American values; they are written into the history of America with the Trail of Tears, the actions against Native Americans and slavery. It is not as if children have not been separated from parents before this.</p>
          <p eId="para_780"> On his election, Donald Trump made it clear that undocumented immigrants would be a key target. He used lies against Mexicans and stirred up a climate of terror against many of the undocumented Irish in the US. While there were deportations under Presidents Bush and Obama, these recent actions have raised the terror a notch.</p>
          <p eId="para_781"> US Immigration and Customs Enforcement is hugely feared in the United States. Immigration is obviously essential to capitalism in driving down wages and conditions for all workers and immigration is vital to divide workers. Under Trump, however, racism is being stirred up, encouraged and brought out into the open from under rocks. Only slightly more disturbing than seeing children mistreated in this way was to read some of the comments posted on Facebook under pictures of some of these children in cages. I will read some of them in order that we can realise the effect of Trump and what he has brought out in the US. These comments are by some racist people in the US who feel emboldened to come out. Under a picture of a child in a cage one comment says, "I want to order one to do laundry". Another commented, "I will give you 50 bucks for it, can it paint a living room?" I could go on.</p>
          <p eId="para_782"> If a Rubicon has been crossed, even by Trump, a debate on the issue in the Dáil is very welcome. It is welcome that we are passing a motion condemning his actions but it must go further. Ireland should immediately withdraw any invitation to Trump to visit this State. If the Taoiseach proceeds with the invitation, it will not be in our name. The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade should also bear those comments in mind if any consideration is being given to visiting the US for another bowl of shamrock next St. Patrick's Day. I appeal to ordinary people to join the protests tomorrow outside the US embassy. There will be one at 4 p.m., called by Amnesty International, and another at 5 p.m., called by United Against Racism.</p>
          <p eId="para_783">I would send all of our encouragement and solidarity to the ordinary people of all colours in America who have taken action against Trump, for example, when he enforced a Muslim travel ban. I encourage them to do the same in respect of this horrific policy.</p>

          <p eId="para_784">Tearing children away from their parents and incarcerating them in cages is, as we all understand, barbaric and beyond the Pale. It crosses every line of human rights and civilised behaviour imaginable. What will we do about a president like Trump who is willing to do this to children and then defend it? Like me, the Tánaiste probably heard spokespeople on the radio defending Trump's actions, blaming the parents and saying that, although it was unfortunate, it had to be done to deter these terrible people from entering the United States illegally. It was shocking. When people's morality or values get twisted to the point of being willing to justify this kind of abuse against children, they are crossing normal lines.</p>
          <p eId="para_785"> This is not just a polite difference of political opinion. Something has to be done about it. Words of condemnation are welcome but, frankly, we know that they mean nothing to Trump. Trump is completely immune to criticism. He is willing to go to any length. It does not bother him in the least that his racist policies directed against immigrants - Muslims, Mexicans and so on - have stoked up the fascist far right in the United States and across the world. I watched a programme on Netflix during the week where the neo-Nazis who organised the Charlottesville horrors said openly that Trump had given them a new confidence to organise on a national scale and had given credibility to their neo-Nazi ideas. They are delighted with him. When we start making comparisons with the 1930s, it is not left-wing scaremongering. It is the reality, and one that is developing across Europe. The far right in Europe is encouraged by the sorts of action that Trump is taking.</p>
          <p eId="para_786"> There is a point at which normal diplomatic discourse, debate, niceties and politeness do not work and one must take a stand. Those of us who oppose racism, the far right, fascism and this barbaric treatment of children must say that we will do something about it because what we are facing in this instance is different. We must confront that point. It is fantastic that, notwithstanding all of our political differences, no political party in this Parliament has gone down the race road or played the race card, but let us go further and do something about this. That something is to make it clear that President Trump and people who are a party to this barbaric policy are not welcome in our country while they continue with that policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_787"> The Taoiseach said that we had to engage, as if this was a case of normal political differences. It is not. Frankly, what he said smacked of double standards. I have asked the Tánaiste to meet the elected representatives in Gaza, but he will not do it. What have they done that Trump has not? In fact, what Trump is doing is worse, but as far as the Tánaiste and Taoiseach are concerned, it is okay to boycott the elected representatives of the Parliament in Gaza. The Tánaiste will say that it is a difficult and complicated situation, mention Israel and so on. He can give all the reasons he likes, but the Government is treating them differently from how it is treating Trump even though what he is doing is far worse and more dangerous. Despite that, we continue to extend the normal diplomatic niceties to a person who is doing these barbaric and horrific things to young people and who is stirring up the most dangerous political forces that we have seen since the horrors of the 1930s and all that followed from them.</p>
          <p eId="para_788"> I am saying in all seriousness that this is different and, therefore, actions must follow. We should withdraw the invitation to Trump and consider other actions that would have an impact and make it clear that this is not just a polite difference of opinion, but that we are horrified and unwilling to stand idly by while these horrific, racist policies directed at immigrants, most of all children, are allowed by the international community to continue.</p>

          <p eId="para_790">It is not easy for a small country to influence much of what happens in the world, but being small does not mean that we are not entitled to a voice. We have a right and a responsibility to speak for justice worldwide. We should be neutral.</p>
          <p eId="para_791"> Obviously, having a large and powerful army makes a country powerful. Likewise, controlling much of the world's big business makes a country powerful, as does having unlimited access to money. We can bow to that power or we can retain our voice by insisting on speaking out.</p>
          <p eId="para_792"> Today is the sixth anniversary of Julian Assange being locked up in the Ecuadorian embassy. He has now been denied communications and the Internet. He has been denied sunlight for six years. A person in direct provision in Maghaberry would probably have an easier time of it, yet we say nothing about it. At the same time, Hillary Clinton is in Ireland this week to be honoured by Trinity College. She is responsible for the deaths of thousands, yet she is being honoured here when we will not speak up for someone like Julian Assange who has highlighted how large countries operate, set about going to war and carry out untold destruction.</p>
          <p eId="para_793"> It is good that we are having this debate. I have given the Tánaiste credit previously. I have more respect for his take on these matters than I had for that of many of his predecessors. It is terrible that children are being separated from their parents, but it is even more terrible to drop bombs on their homes and wipe them out altogether. Numerous parties in the House have allowed Shannon Airport to be used for US military purposes. The destruction that the US military has caused in the Middle East and elsewhere is beyond horrific. We talk about facilitating and accepting refugees into Ireland, operating the direct provision system better and pulling people out of the sea in the Mediterranean, but why do people become refugees? At the last count, 33 million people had become refugees because of war, the majority of which was driven by the US military. We allow it to use Shannon Airport to facilitate its efforts. In God's name, will the Government reconsider? We have to stop because it is wrong and horrific.</p>
          <p eId="para_794"> The argument that has often been put to me is that we cannot push the US military out of Shannon Airport because we might lose jobs and it might affect American investment in Ireland. Let us make up our minds about what we want. In Obama's eight years in power, he dropped an average of 36,000 bombs per year.</p>
          <p eId="para_795">Believe it or not, Trump has not got up to those numbers yet, but I am sure he will not be long getting there. There were 36,000 bombs a year for eight years under Obama. What did we say about it? Was that okay? It is terrible to separate kids from their parents but it was okay to support Obama's effort to drop 36,000 bombs per year. Where was our voice? It does not stack up. We need to become a neutral, independent, small country again with a voice of our own. We do not have to shoot anybody, drop bombs on anyone, encourage anyone or participate in it. We just need a voice because it can make a difference.</p>

          <p eId="para_798">-----by European boats in Operation Sophia in which the Irish Defence Forces participate, on a day in which migrants are shot with rubber bullets as they try to climb barbed wire in Europe, have we lost our minds? Everybody with half a heart or a shred of humanity would support the motion before the House today and I am as happy as anybody else to condemn the hideousness of the American Government's policy of separating migrant children from their parents, very deliberately, with maximum cruelty.</p>
          <p eId="para_799"> We condemn absolutely the US policy of locking migrants up in cages but let us not take our eye off the ball. Migrants are being locked up in cages in Europe too. A joint report by the International Rescue Committee, the Norwegian Refugee Council and Oxfam last year talked about refugees landing in Greece and being kept in cages behind barbed wire. Conditions in European detention centres are so bad that refugees have sewn up their lips, gone on hunger strike and set themselves on fire to protest the inhumanity of their conditions.</p>
          <p eId="para_800"> Let us discuss actions we will be involved in. Next week, on 28 and 29 June, the EU is to debate proposals to expand the network of detention centres in Libya and to expand the arbitrary detention of vulnerable people in warehouses run by militias where torture is rife, all of which is paid for by the EU. We have some neck to condemn the behaviour of the US in that context when we have been so culpable ourselves. Deputy Wallace is right that it is a bit sickening to listen to elements of the media and the political establishment who have been silent on the role of the US military in making people refugees in the first place but who are now ochoning their treatment when they end up on US shores. It is disgraceful and sickening. We do not have the time to deal with the conditions in some of the camps of Europe but they are there. We have no standing to criticise the United States. We are just as bad. One could say that we are worse in some ways because we have the hypocrisy and pretence of thinking that Europe is somehow different.</p>
          <p eId="para_801"> Deputy Wallace is right to highlight that today is the sixth anniversary of the arbitrary detention of Julian Assange. I hand it to Europe here that the United States is in a league of its own when it comes to prosecuting people who threaten to get in the way of that country's pursuit of endless and profitable war. Julian Assange has been in the Ecuadorian embassy for six years, denied any form of serious human contact, with no Internet, no outdoor air, no phone calls and no visits, except from his lawyers, once a month for the past three months. He faces prosecution under the Espionage Act and could potentially spend the rest of his life in solitary confinement in a US prison. His crime is being a journalist who has upset the United States. As Human Rights Watch points out, any extradition or prosecution of Assange under the Act will open the door for similar prosecutions of other publications and journalists in the US who dare to upset that country's Government. Assange has agreed to surrender himself to British police only if he is guaranteed against extradition, which the UK will not give.</p>
          <p eId="para_802"> We should be leading the charge on this with regard to arbitrary detention, solitary confinement and appalling treatment of refugees on World Refugee Day. We have plenty to do. If we are serious about taking on the US with regard to how it deals with migrants, let us do it by ending, once and for all, its use of Shannon, which has contributed so shamefully to the deaths and permanent separation of so many children from their families across the world.</p>

          <p eId="para_803">The forceful separation of children from their families distresses us all. Having one's children removed in what is quite often already a traumatic situation is every parent's nightmare. What I find deeply objectionable is the nauseating political opportunism and virtue signalling that this motion represents. Let us not kid ourselves. If the policy was still being pursued by President Barack Obama, we would not hear a word about it. I say that because the policy that the current United States Government is enforcing has been in place since at least 2010 when the US Office of Refugee Resettlement's, ORR, division of unaccompanied children's services requested public applications to provide temporary shelter, care and related services to the children in the ORR's custody. What outcry was there then? Instead we had deafening silence.</p>
          <p eId="para_804"> It has been reported that, according to the non-profit immigrant advocacy group, the American Immigration Council, the trend in growing deportation numbers is a policy that has been pursued by the US federal Government for nearly two decades. It also notes that while the policy campaign precedes the Obama Administration by many years, it grew intensely during his tenure in the White House. Where was the outrage then? This motion, while speaking to a genuine human rights tragedy, is nothing short of political points scoring at its worst.</p>
          <p eId="para_805"> When hundreds of thousands of Christians and Muslim minorities were forcibly separated from their families, as Deputies Wallace and Clare Daly referred to, through rape, murder, slavery and genocide, I could not get a debate in this House to agree to spend time condemning it in a cross-party motion despite four years of attempts to do so. The genocide got a triple Topical Issue matter from the Ceann Comhairle on Holy Thursday evening, which was very appropriate. It could not get a debate here. No side would agree to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_806"> As we speak, countries that we continue to trade with such as Saudi Arabia and Qatar are engaged in blatant and violent human rights violations. As Human Rights Watch observed in its 2018 report, Saudi Arabia is the leader of the nine-nation coalition that began military operations in Yemen on 26 March 2015. It has committed numerous violations of international humanitarian law. Where has been the outcry? As of November this year, at least 5,295 civilians have been killed and 8,873 wounded, according to the UN human rights office, although the actual civilian casualty count is likely to be much higher. In 2017, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights reported that airstrikes remained the single largest cause of civilian casualties. Where was our motion on that issue and what happened to us in here that we sat silent, did not open our mouths and did not make any efforts to raise this anywhere? The fact is that this Dáil is being asked to support this motion while it stays silent on the atrocious human rights crimes being committed by people it considers its partners.</p>
          <p eId="para_807"> The US Department of Homeland Security, DHS, has issued clarifications in the past two days on a number of myths that have been doing the rounds. The first myth is that the DHS has a policy to separate families at the border. The fact is that the DHS does not have a blanket policy of separating families at the border. It has a responsibility to protect all minors in its custody. This means the DHS will separate adults and minors under certain circumstances. These circumstances include when the DHS is unable to determine the family relationship. If there is a reason to question the claimed familial relationship between an adult and child, it is not appropriate to detain adults and children together, for obvious reasons.</p>
          <p eId="para_808">If there is reason to suspect the purported or alleged parent or legal guardian of human trafficking or smuggling, the DHS detains the adult in an appropriate, secure detention facility, separate from the minor. The DHS continues to see instances and intelligence reports indicating minors are trafficked by unrelated adults posing as a family in an effort to avoid detention. Are we going to allow that?</p>
          <p eId="para_809"> If there is reason to suspect the purported parent or legal guardian poses a safety risk to the child, for example, suspected child abuse, it is not appropriate to detain the adult and child together. If an adult is referred for criminal prosecution, the adult will be transferred to the custody of US Marshals Service and any children will be classified as an unaccompanied alien child and transferred to the custody of the Department of Health and Human Services. The DHS also notes that in recent months there has been a staggering increase in the number of illegal aliens using children to pose as family units to gain entry into the United States. From October 2017 to February 2018, there was a 315% increase in the number of cases of adults with minors fraudulently posing as family units to gain entry. Do we want to support or condone that? Will any of those facts be heard in the current anti-Trump frenzy? I fear not.</p>

          <p eId="para_812">I deplore the separation of immigrant children from their parents. That goes against the grain of humane behaviour. I would not condone it and I deplore it. We are depending on the same Government led by President Trump to be lenient with Irish immigrants to the US who have played a major part in building America since the 1700s when many of our forefathers went there on the coffin ships in the hope that they would survive. Many of them lived and they played a great part in building that great country, the United States. We all have relatives there today. We appeal to President Trump to be lenient with illegal immigrants from Ireland who continue to work there. We hope they will be provided with some mechanism to allow them to come home for weddings and funerals, as it breaks their hearts when they miss such events. They cannot come back here, because if they did, they could not go back to their jobs again. We hope President Trump will do something for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_813"> There has been much bashing of President Trump since his election, although many people voted for him. He has played a vital role in neutralising Korea. A few of our Ministers wanted to go there to sort it out but perhaps they will stay at home and do something here instead. It appears that President Trump has alleviated that threat to world peace. We must give him a chance in that regard. We appeal to him not to separate children from their parents.</p>

          <p eId="para_814">I thank the Tánaiste for what he did last night. I accept it was his own personal view, but he is a leading member of the Government. It is only right that we should all show our outrage at what is happening in terms of parents and children being separated. Whatever one's viewpoint on immigration and however tough or lenient a position one takes, in anyone's normal psyche it is wrong to think about separating young children from their mothers and fathers. It is just not proper behaviour. It is not right. One can have arguments and policies or one can engage in diplomacy but one should not separate small children from their parents. For God's sake, that is totally wrong. I thank the Tánaiste personally for what he did last night because he highlighted the situation from an Irish point of view. Everybody who has spoken here today to express outrage at what is happening is right to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_815"> That said, I accept we must have rules, regulations and immigration controls. One issue I would like to see highlighted in this debate is how we deal with immigrants to this country. One thing I do not agree with is the fact that people who come here seeking asylum are not allowed to work. That goes against the grain completely if people are strong, fit, healthy enough and able to work. If people are willing to give them gainful work, for God's sake why not let them work? There is a lot of controversy going on about the issue currently in that the Government introduced a mechanism to allow asylum seekers to work, but they have been tied up in so many knots that it is not practicable and they are not able to get work. It is inhumane of us to have people in direct provision accommodation and saying to them that the one thing they cannot do is work. That is wrong. If people have work for them, for God's sake we should allow them to work because the right to work is a basic dignity. I refer to the ability to get up in the morning, roll up our sleeves, go out and do a day's work for somebody.</p>

          <p eId="para_818">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the motion. It has been deeply disturbing to see the reports and footage emanating from the US in recent weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_819"> I begin by echoing the points made by a number of previous speakers and unreservedly condemning the policy choices by the Trump Administration that have led to this appalling situation. Children are being forcibly taken from their parents and kept in cages with foil for blankets. Immigration officers are being told not to comfort or hold distressed children. Parents are not being told when, or indeed if, they will be reunited with their children before they are deported. The United States, which is a developed nation with which we share historically strong links, is engaging in the deliberate traumatisation and abuse of children to deter immigration and asylum seeking. By any stretch of the imagination that can only be called torture and it is unconscionable.</p>
          <p eId="para_820"> Many commentators have surmised that this may be Trump's Katrina moment, the point where the horror of the images and reports clash so irreversibly with the justifications being proffered by the Administration that his supporters will finally have enough. However, I am unsure if that will be the case. Since November 2016 we have seen example after example of the Trump Administration, cravenly backed by a seemingly spineless Republican Party, pander to the worst characteristics of middle America. The cruelty and inhumanity we are now seeing in those detention camps is the direct outworking of the toxic idea that was sold to his supporters in the run-up to the presidential election. The idea that reducing the number of foreign-born people in the United States will make native born Americans richer and safer was a lie then and it is a lie now. What Trump is selling his supporters with this brutalising policy is the idea that cracking down on immigration and suffering condemnation of so-called elites demonstrates his dedication to being on their side. What was once a dog whistle for white nationalists has now been replaced by unabashed xenophobia. We can no longer give credence to the idea that the majority of Trump supporters voted for him in 2016 because of economic insecurity. Let us make no mistake, these policies have support and the outrage of Democrats, so-called cultural elites and foreign governments make his supporters even more sure of their correctness. US political discourse has become a toxic zero-sum game of winners and losers.</p>
          <p eId="para_821"> That a country whose political culture was once an example to the rest of the democratic world could have unravelled and debased itself in such a short timeframe is a stark warning to us all.</p>
          <p eId="para_822">The net effect of Trump's shocking xenophobia can be seen in the emboldening of racists and right-wing populists closer to home. Political leaders in Hungary, Italy, Poland and other European states have drawn inspiration from Trump's immigration policies. We ourselves are not immune and it would be remiss of me not to mention our own appalling legacy in the form of direct provision. I reiterate my call from last week that this system be closed down.</p>
          <p eId="para_823"> I repeat my call from yesterday that representatives from the US embassy be summoned by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and that the sentiments expressed in this debate be made very clear to them and relayed to Washington. In particular, I ask Ministers, some of whom enjoy a very close relationship with the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Mr. Paul Ryan, to express their abhorrence of these policies. I do not believe that the Trump Administration can be shamed or embarrassed into action because the man leading it is incapable of shame, it would seem. If the Republican Party, however, has any shred of decency left or any respect for the functioning of US democracy, it cannot allow this appalling situation to continue.</p>

          <p eId="para_824">Due to President Donald Trump’s Administration’s zero tolerance border policy, all people crossing the US-Mexico border illegally, even those seeking asylum, face criminal prosecution. The US Department of Homeland Security claims that between mid-April and May of this year it has separated nearly 2,000 children from their parents after they crossed the Mexico border into the US. That equates to 65 children being split from their parents each day for the past six weeks. More than 100 of these children were under the age of four. Parents were told that their children were being taken for a bath or being taken away briefly for questioning. It took hours for parents to realise their children had been taken away indefinitely. One father died by suicide in a detention cell the night after his three year old child was physically ripped out of his arms. One mother had her child taken from her while she was nursing and she was placed in handcuffs when she tried to protest. Children are being held for weeks and months in cages and there are reports that parents who choose to return across the border cannot find their children.</p>
          <p eId="para_825"> None of these children in Trump’s America will have a parent with them to protect them from the sickening reality of being caged <i>en masse</i>, alone and terrified, sleeping under foil blankets in a foreign land for months, if not years, on end. The only crime their parents committed was to try to escape from persecution and poverty and make a better life for their children. We have all heard the audio clip of children in a US Customs and Border Protection facility obtained by ProPublica. We have heard the children crying, in terrible distress, calling out for their parents and we have heard border patrol agents joking and laughing at them. The cries I heard on that clip, the young cries of "Mama" and "Papa", will haunt me as they will haunt us all. As a mother, it is haunting and truly frightening to hear these cries, the cries of frightened children, some no more than four years old, calling for their parents, aunts or relatives, alone, abandoned, surrounded by unfriendly faces in an unfriendly country and treated without dignity, respect, compassion or the most basic forms of human decency.</p>
          <p eId="para_826"> There are no words strong enough to condemn the despicable actions of an Administration that would be willing to do this. This is coming from an Administration whose defence of these actions has been one of wild and fanciful evasion. President Trump has declared that the US is withdrawing from the UN Human Rights Council, calling it a “hypocritical and self-serving” body that “makes a mockery of human rights”and “a cesspool of political bias”. There is absolutely no remorse from this President and no regret for the pain inflicted. The most basic and fundamental aspects of what we term human rights are being eroded in word and deed by an Administration full of hate, bile and vicious anger towards the most vulnerable of human beings.</p>
          <p eId="para_827"> The EU is not blameless or innocent either. We cannot pretend that the EU does not have its own deterrence policies. The EU, including Ireland, is spending €180 million in Libya to deter migrants from making a journey that has drowned thousands in the Mediterranean Sea, including 784 people so far this year alone. The US treats people like cattle, while we in Europe treat them like cargo. Let the US be a warning to us. Let us end direct provision and use our influence here in Ireland to prevent the EU from following further the same poisonous route which comes only to one known end - children in cages and sinking boats labelled as “infestation” by demagogues like Trump.</p>

          <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Paschal Donohoe)<recordedTime time="2018-06-20T19:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_830">It is my privilege to open tonight’s statements on the 2018 summer economic statement.</p>
          <p eId="para_831"> Ten years after we were hit by the worst economic shock this country has ever faced, I am happy to report that the public finances have been stabilised, unemployment continues to fall, progress is being made in improving our public services and our economy is one of the fastest growing in the EU. A suite of economic indicators confirm that the Irish economy is growing at a healthy pace. My Department expects national income growth of 5.6% this year and 4% next year. Today’s Central Statistics Office, CSO, data also confirm that strong economic growth is delivering improvements in the number of jobs in our country. There are now more people at work than ever before. Indeed, we are fast approaching full employment, and in this context we need to take care with the management of our economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_832"> Against this positive backdrop, we plan broadly to balance our books again by running a very small deficit next year because of the political choices we have made in Project Ireland 2040 and the national development plan to increase capital spending substantially by €1.5 billion or 25% next year, bringing expenditure to in excess of €7 billion. We are prioritising capital spending in our schools, hospitals, universities and public transport system to deal with the deficits that emerged during the recession and to position our economy and society for the opportunities and difficulties that lie ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_833">As the ESRI noted in its quarterly economic commentary, more public investment increases the potential output of the economy by enhancing productivity and employment, thereby supporting growth in the long run. Crucially, by increasing internal demand appropriately, the impact of public investment is felt in the domestic sector of the economy. This is the right way to rebalance our economy in the context of the increasingly volatile world that was vividly demonstrated during the previous debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_834"> Well-managed economies are characterised by durable improvements in living standards rather than the all-or-nothing approach that has been a feature of Irish economic history, especially in more recent times. Our economic performance has been less consistent than that of other small open economies. Our propensity to suffer economic shocks and resilience to withstand such shocks has been out of line with countries with which we can compare ourselves. When we pursued a procyclical approach to fiscal policy, our comparator countries witnessed incremental and sustainable increases in living standards and retained their national sovereignty when the global financial crisis struck. To avoid repeating the mistakes of the past, it is critical that we are constant in our approach. In essence, this means deciding on the appropriate economic and social model for the country and having the political commitment and consensus to stick with it across many different cycles.</p>
          <p eId="para_835"> The Government will frame budgetary policy on the basis of what is right for the economy to ensure continued steady improvements in Irish employment and living standards and to make a difference to the many challenges we face in areas like housing and homelessness and the daily challenges we face in our health services. If we look at other small open countries like Finland, Sweden and Denmark, we will see how they deliver economies with public services that are paid for gradually. This is what I want for the Irish people. This Government and its predecessor have pursued central elements of this approach since 2011. We have taken care with our budgets, we have taken active approaches to jobs markets and we have gradually broadened the tax base. However, this work is far from complete.</p>
          <p eId="para_836"> Our particular priorities for the period ahead include a revised approach to social dialogue. This is why I am looking forward to next week's national economic and social dialogue. We are working on how to improve social insurance to deliver greater economic security, for example, for our self-employed. We need to continue to rebalance our economy to support our indigenous sector and improve productivity. We want to have a broad and sustainable tax base. The Minister of State, Deputy English, is at the forefront of adopting a better approach to land planning to ensure it is developed in a co-ordinated manner for the public interest. We will seek to improve incomes, particularly for people in low-income and middle-income parts of our economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_837"> The central argument I want to make and which is reflected in the summer economic statement is that there is a need for us to actively pursue policies that lead to an improvement in living standards for all and ensure Ireland never again faces the risks it faced in the past. That is why our budgetary strategy is based on steady increases in public expenditure and predictable tax revenue. Our minimum objective is to continue to deliver a balanced budget. I argue that incremental and sustainable improvements in public services are preferable to how we dealt with this in the past. We want to broaden our broad tax base and ensure expenditure commitments are based on revenues that will be sustainable. This is necessary not just because of the lessons of our history but also because it is common sense. This is why we will be setting aside some of the high levels of corporation tax for the purpose of creating a rainy day fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_838"> Outside of Ireland, we can see greater levels of uncertainty than have existed for a long time. We need to take care of what is inside our control. First, we need to continue to be careful in how we manage our public finances. The fiscal rules are currently unhelpful in this regard. A full and literal application of these rules would involve the adoption of policies that would mean more borrowing, which is not appropriate for where our economy is now. Second, we must balance the budget over the cycle and use windfall receipts to reduce public debt. Third, the Government will prioritise spending that mitigates risk, does the right thing by our society and improves the ability of our economy to grow in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_839"> A headline deficit of 0.1% in the forthcoming budget was projected in the stability programme update. The Government will not adopt taxation and spending measures that result in a larger deficit than this. Pre-committed expenditure for next year amounts to €2.6 billion. That will provide for an increase of €1.5 billion in capital expenditure, €300 million in carryover costs, €400 million in public sector pay and another €400 million for demographic costs. With the deficit I mentioned earlier, all of this will accommodate a budgetary package of €3.4 billion, of which €2.6 billion has been pre-committed to expenditure measures. This leaves €800 million for further allocation. Any unfunded taxation or expenditure measures that go beyond this will necessarily involve even more borrowing. I believe this would be wrong. Targeting minimum compliance with the expenditure benchmark would allow an additional €900 million to be spent or used for tax reductions, but this in turn would increase our deficit.</p>
          <p eId="para_840"> We are approaching the tenth anniversary of our deepest crisis. While the economic situation is relatively healthy, we have many demands in our society. Developments in the outside world, including Brexit, changes in the international corporate tax landscape and the possibility of disruptions to trade are some of the risks we face. We need to respond to all of this to build up our budgetary strength for the future. That is why the Government is prioritising reducing public debt, establishing a rainy day fund and avoiding pro-cyclical budgetary policies. While there are risks ahead, there are also great opportunities. It is clear that there are many needs within our society. As I said yesterday, economic growth is not an end in itself. It is a necessary precondition for the creation of the resources needed to deliver a better Ireland. Continued growth is the way we will achieve our objectives of bringing about steady improvements in the lives of our citizens and meeting the sharpest needs in our society.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMcGrath" eId="spk_367">
          <from>Deputy Michael McGrath<recordedTime time="2018-06-20T19:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_841">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the summer economic statement, which was published yesterday. The statement sets out the economic backdrop as we begin the process of preparing budget 2019. It is fair to say that the economic picture in mid-2018 is pretty positive in overall terms. We want to ensure we make the right decisions to sustain this country's economic growth in a sustainable manner. No one wants to see boom and bust. We want to see a period of steady economic growth. If a country like Ireland could sustain annual economic growth of between 3% and 4%, and use the fruits of that economic growth to deal with many of the serious challenges in our society, we would be doing a good job.</p>
          <p eId="para_842"> There is a need to recognise the position our party is in and what we have done for the country to facilitate and sustain a minority Government over the past two years by means of the confidence and supply agreement. At a challenging time, especially on the external front, that agreement has been an important source of stability for our country. The value of that needs to be recognised.</p>
          <p eId="para_843">We are four months out from budget 2019. It is important in the lead up to it that we make the right decisions for the people who elected us and whom we represent. Based on the summer economic statement, the budget day package will be in the region of €3.4 billion, not €800 million. It happens to be the case that there are very significant pre-committed lines of expenditure of €2.6 billion which are important matters in respect of capital expenditure, demographics, public sector pay and so on. It is a €3.4 billion budget and, if we were to add the €900 million that others wish to spend plus the €500 million earmarked for the rainy day fund, we would be looking at a €5 billion budget. That would be directly contrary to the advice of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC. Yes, the Government does not have to take its advice. It is a matter for the elected Government of the day to make budgetary decisions. However, we do have to take account of the advice it has given. The fiscal council has been very clear as to what is an appropriate budgetary stance in respect of 2019, namely, a package in the order of €3.5 billion. Anything more expansionary than this suggested maximum limit is not likely to be appropriate. The fiscal council goes on to say that from its point of view it would be even more desirable if a more conservative approach was adopted. I do not agree with that but I do agree with the need to continue to reduce the deficit.</p>
          <p eId="para_844"> If this budgetary stance is put into effect, the general Government balance next year will be 0.1% of a deficit and the structural balance will be 0.4% of a deficit, which would meet our medium term objective. If we were to spend the extra €1.4 billion, the general Government deficit would be in the order of 0.6% and the structural deficit would be approximately 0.9%.</p>

          <p eId="para_847">It is correct. The outturn expected in the current year in general Government terms is a deficit of 0.2%. At a time when the economy is growing so strongly after seven or eight consecutive years of growth, that proposal would result in the budget deficit trebling next year in proportionate terms. That is not the right decision or the right course on which to take our country at this time.</p>
          <p eId="para_848"> The rainy day fund proposal is one which we very much support. Of course, it has to be structured correctly and we look forward to engaging with the Government in respect of the legislation in that regard. In very simple terms, one of the real lessons we must have learned from the crisis is the need to pursue counter-cyclical policies at the appropriate time. Hopefully it will not materialise, but there is a significant risk of the economy overheating. We need to start putting money aside to have a buffer in place so that when an economic shock arrives at our door, probably from an external source, we do have resources to deploy and the first decision the next Minister for Finance, whether that be Deputy Pearse Doherty, Deputy Donohoe, myself, Deputy Burton or whoever, has to make-----</p>

          <p eId="para_853">When an economic shock hits this country again, the first decision will not have to be to cut public expenditure or raise taxes. That is a scenario that we certainly want to avoid.</p>
          <p eId="para_854"> The risk of overheating is significant. If we look at the economy around us and the issues in terms of labour shortages, very noticeable trends in traffic and the difficulty in getting projects under way, it is evident that there are signs of it. We also have to be cognisant of the real risks that exist. The outturn from Brexit is a huge unknown with potentially very significant ramifications for our country. On the corporate tax front there are so many challenges. The growth in receipts is great but it is also a risk. We must be cognisant of the concentration of receipts among a small number of companies, the threats from the Trump Administration reforms, and the constant threats from the European Union in respect of the common consolidated corporate tax base, CCCTB, digital tax and so on. We are at the bottom of the interest rate cycle. We know quantitative easing, QE, is going to be unwound and do not know what the effect of that will be. We have a possible trade war. These are real risks. It is important to make the right decisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_855"> Absolutely, we have to deliver on the challenges facing our people. There is frustration at the lack of progress and delivery in the housing area. One of the provisions of the agreement we entered into two years ago was that there would be an affordable housing scheme. We have had various announcements of affordability measures but as of now we do not have an affordable housing scheme in this country and we are crying out for it. The people we represent really need to see that delivered and quickly. We need to see red tape and bureaucracy cut. Local authorities need to be allowed to get on with the job of delivering social housing units. When the Minister stood up last October and announced a new €750 million fund of private finance to facilitate construction, we welcomed it. We did expect that it would take eight months to publish the legislation and God only knows when the first euro of that money will start to be provided to enable construction to take place.</p>
          <p eId="para_856"> On health, we all know what the challenges are. We need to improve and increase capacity in the public system but the Government needs to increase resources in the National Treatment Purchase Fund as well, to make short-term progress in respect of waiting lists which have gone out of control and are not going in the right direction. That issue has to be dealt with.</p>
          <p eId="para_857"> There are really important cost of living issues of which the Government is losing control. The whole issue of insurance is becoming more important by the day, not just for motorists but for businesses the length and breadth of the country, community groups, sporting bodies and voluntary organisations. They are crippled with insurance costs. The issue needs to be dealt with, as does that of rent. That relates very much to the lack of supply on the housing front. Childcare, education and transport costs need to be addressed. When I look at the balance of our economy, I see that the Minister needs to focus on a renewed enterprise strategy in the indigenous economy. He needs to look at the challenges facing SMEs and, on the taxation front, he needs to consider specific measures to deal with that. We want to see longer term budgetary, economic and fiscal forecasts. At the moment they go out to 2021. We should see them covering at least five years and, at a lower level, we should see some forecasts out over a period of up to ten years.</p>
          <p eId="para_858"> We need to have an honest and open discussion in the months ahead about where our priorities lie. The Minister is already talking about income tax cuts before even talking about the really serious challenges that people are facing in housing and health. We must address where we are in terms of funding our education sector and third level. The Minister seems to be working backwards from a starting position that we have to cut tax. Let us look at the resources and the needs of our country and make the right decisions. Issues we have set out in the agreement include early assessment of children with special needs, intervention services, mental health funding and supports for older persons who wish to stay in the home. We will engage constructively over the next four months with the Minister, his officials and his colleagues in government to make the right decisions. It has to be a sensible and prudent budget but where individual budgetary decisions are made, they have to speak to the priorities and real issues that are facing people in their day-to-day lives.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PearseDoherty" eId="spk_376">
          <from>Deputy Pearse Doherty<recordedTime time="2018-06-20T19:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_859">Deputy Michael McGrath was wrong in terms of his facts and figures but we will forgive him for that. The deficit would be 0.4% and indeed the Minister addressed that in his opening speech. On the "significant" risks of overheating, the chair of the IFAC has said the risk of overheating is muted. He has suggested that they are medium risks with medium impact. The Deputy should not create a narrative just for the sake of supporting his own economic vision of not investing in the crisis that we have.</p>
          <p eId="para_860"> This document is completely out of tune with the reality of life in Ireland in 2018. If we did not know better, we would imagine Deputy Donohoe had not been Minister for Finance for the last number of months. Nowhere in this document is there a credible plan to address the massive problems we face as a State. Nowhere is there at least an intention to reclaim the lost decade of underinvestment that was presided over by Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil Governments. Families and young people at home this evening will not recognise the Ireland painted in this document. Like everyone, they see the signs of recovery but they still see the scars of the wasted potential and of budgetary policies which imposed an extortionate cost of living burden upon them and which this Government is on track to continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_861">They also see a Government that has created crisis after crisis. </p>
          <p eId="para_862"> This statement is an attempt to build on the Fine Gael myth that nothing can or should be done about these crises that it has created in this State. The Minister is telling the families who live in fear of financial distress and who are concerned about one missed wage packet, the car breaking down or the unexpected visit to the doctor that not lifting this burden is "good governance". He is telling the 4,000 children who woke up this morning in emergency accommodation that homelessness is "prudent" because he does not attempt to deal with it using the policy response that is required. He is telling the hundreds of thousands on waiting lists that essential healthcare is beyond their grasp and that they just need to get used to the fact that they are on these lists. </p>
          <p eId="para_863"> This statement tries to drag the public's gaze away from the hospital trolleys and the social tragedies that all of us, not just those in this city but right across the State, hear about day in and day our in our constituency clinics. It is an attempt to convince the people of Ireland that the burden they feel every day is normal - it is about normalising all of this - and there is nothing that can be done for them. We reject this message. We reject it as a reckless choice of Fine Gael just as we rejected the Government's proposal to abolish the USC, which would have left a €5 billion hole in the public purse, or indeed Fianna Fáil's proposal, which would have left a hole of over €3 billion in the public purse. We completely reject the argument that the Government must stand idly by as thousands of young families across the island live from week to week and we reject the argument that rural communities must remain isolated with crumbling infrastructure and basic broadband. </p>
          <p eId="para_864"> For what will soon be three consecutive budgets, Fine Gael, in lockstep with Fianna Fáil, is on course to decide that all of this will continue. That is clear from this summer economic statement. Fianna Fáil, a party that is devoid of a coherent strategy or message, is meekly peddling the same Government line of prudence before people. In addressing the budget last year, the Fianna Fáil spokesperson, Deputy Michael McGrath, said that the budget and, more importantly, the Government will be judged by how they tackle the scourge of homelessness more than any other issue so is it time to judge this Government? What do the 10,000 people who are homeless or the 100,000 people on waiting lists think? What does Fine Gael think of this crisis and indeed what does Fianna Fáil, which supported every single one of the Government's budgets that made sure that available resources were spent on tax cuts that benefitted the well off instead of dealing with these crises, think of it? Sinn Féin hears these citizens who have been failed and ignored by the Government's policies. I believe their verdict is clear. They are the same old parties, the same old choices and the same old failures. </p>
          <p eId="para_865"> However, there are choices. These are the Minister's choices, these are the results of his choices but other choices can be made. Under our plan, we would use the existing space within the fiscal rules to ensure that there would be a Government surplus by 2021. The difference between our target for a Government surplus and that of the Government is 12 months. By using the available fiscal space for urgent investment, debt to GDP will still fall below 60% in the same period, as has been indicated by the Government. However, the Minister has turned his back on this need for urgent investment to deal with the social crisis we face, the need to invest in our economy and to strengthen the foundations of our economy. The Government has done so with the support of Fianna Fáil. </p>
          <p eId="para_866"> Of course, it will take longer than any single budget to undo the work that has been done by Fine Gael and the era of social crises. We need to start and this budget should be the start of that undoing. Instead the Minister has repackaged Fianna Fáil's hand-me-down policy of a rainy day fund. Once again, this so-called rainy day fund is presented and packaged as prudence when it is little more than an excuse that the Minister proposes to enshrine in law not to invest at a time of deep crisis in certain sections of Irish society. Let us be honest about this because the Minister's new narrative is that corporation tax receipts will go into the rainy day fund. His heads of Bill make no mention whatsoever of corporate tax. There is no siphoning off of corporation tax into a rainy day fund. Indeed the heads of Bill say that there will be a legal obligation on this State to put €500 million into the rainy day fund even if there is a reduction in corporation tax. Even if there was a year-on-year reduction in corporation tax, there will be a legal obligation to fill that rainy day fund with €500 million. This is policy on the hoof. It is "making it up as we go along" stuff to try and convince the Irish people that the Minister is all about stability when many people look at the reality of their lives and see anything but stability.</p>
          <p eId="para_867"> In saying that perhaps there is a silver lining. If Fianna Fáil had the chance to introduce a rainy day fund, as outlined in its 2016 manifesto, Deputy Michael McGrath would put €1.8 billion into a rainy day fund next year and I would be asking him what cuts he was going to make and what commitments he would roll back on because unless he is going to row back on his policy, his policy is that every cent above €6.6 billion in corporation tax should be invested in the rainy day fund. Perhaps he will want to tell the public sector workers that this is the commitment he is going to row back on. Perhaps he will not provide for demographics or perhaps Fianna Fáil will return to form in terms of cutting the blind pension or reducing the minimum wage because that is what the policy would have amounted to, leaving aside the fact that he wanted to cut over €3 billion in terms of the USC. </p>
          <p eId="para_868"> These are all old ideas that are part of an old mindset of how the economy should work but we know these tired and failed ideas have been tried and we have had some of the same results. We have results now in terms of underinvestment in public services. We can see this loud and clear. We hear them in the individual stories from those people who come to us. They are the crises in our public services, mass homelessness and the profoundly unfair and unequal nature of the Fine Gael economic plan. They did not happen by accident. The reason we have a homelessness crisis is the Minister's policies when he decided not to invest and because the spokesperson for Fianna Fáil decided to back that budgetary stance. The reason we have 707,000 people on hospital waiting lists and over 400 people on hospital trolleys every day is the Minister's budgetary decisions supported by Fianna Fáil. That is the reality. While Fine Gael is in power, there will always be loopholes for tax avoiders, there will always be poverty and exclusion and there will always be crises in our public services.</p>
          <p eId="para_869"> We say enough is enough. With an international environment that poses threats to our economic stability, we need to act. We need to invest in our public infrastructure to secure long-term, sustainable growth potential. We need to secure our public finances, end the leakages to tax avoiders and strengthen our tax base. By tackling the extortionate costs of childcare, we can boost our economic capacity allowing working women and parents to pursue their ambitions. We need to invest in young people and our public universities so that we can end their slide in world rankings and secure economic potential for the future. These are real socially and economically responsible alternatives that, once again, the Minister has chosen to ignore.</p>
          <p eId="para_870"> This summer statement is the mark of a Government which is out of ideas and which either cannot see or does not care about the problems we face as a society. This statement and this Government show a staggering lack of vision. It offers no ambition and it lacks the confidence to say to ordinary people that we will stand by the people. It is a dusting down of the old broken record which rings in the ears of families and citizens who are struggling. The message the Minister is sending to them is that we will not and cannot invest but there are choices. There is a different path the Minister could go down. We can either endure the policies of Fine Gael supported by Fianna Fáil and see these crises continue or we can stand foursquare with citizens and deal with these issues by using the resources available to us under the fiscal rules to make the necessary investments.</p>

          <from>Deputy Joan Burton<recordedTime time="2018-06-20T19:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_871">I start by referencing the fact that just a couple of hours ago, the courts finally imposed a penalty of six years on David Drumm who was, in many ways, the man who sank Ireland along with the bank that sank Ireland. As we look at the budget figures, we should bear in mind that this man organised a fraud amounting to €7.2 billion. For most people, €7.2 million would sound like a lot of money.</p>
          <p eId="para_872">The particular arrangements he entered into to mislead in regard to the Anglo Irish accounts cost our taxpayers, our citizens, in fact, every man, woman and child in this country much misery that continues to this day, unfortunately, with regard to cleaning up the mess of the banks. It is ten years since all of this happened. It has taken a very long time for justice to be served. Ten years ago the bankers were telling us what to do and that everything was okay, which was wrong. The Minister needs to be careful when simply relying on the advice of bankers. I want the Minister to make a commitment that despite all of the special pleading going on at the moment about the restoration of bankers' bonuses, there should be no consideration of any of that until we have got all of that money back from the bankers, which is what our citizens deserve.</p>
          <p eId="para_873"> The summer economic statement shows there is up to €2.2 billion available in the fiscal space for new measures in budget 2019 before any new revenue raising or saving measures. The Minister for Finance and the Department are misleading the public debate. Political decisions made by the Minister and Fine Gael are limiting this to €800 million, although, obviously, there will be adjustments on budget day. A further €2.6 billion has already been committed. The Minister needs to clarify for us if a 2:1 ratio of expenditure to tax cuts continues to apply to budget measures. I would prefer a 3:1 ratio. We agree with the ESRI that it is not appropriate to talk about income tax cuts but I know that, in the context of a forthcoming election, it is something Fine Gael is wedded to and I am sure we will see some of that.</p>
          <p eId="para_874"> The Minister for Finance has decided to commit €500 million to a rainy day fund and leave a further €900 million unspent. These are policy decisions the Minister is making that are also deliberately misleading the public debate. The Irish people, who have made huge sacrifices over the last decade to correct the public finances, deserve to know the full facts. With €2.6 billion already committed to meeting the costs of policy decisions made last year, as I said, we do not know if the 2:1 ratio Fine Gael ratio is being maintained, or whether Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have agreed budget measures that will encompass the extra capital spending this includes, or if this will just apply to the €800 million the Minister is proposing to allocate in October.</p>
          <p eId="para_875"> I want to ask the Minister about the settlement announced in respect of consultants' pay. As I understand it, that settlement is €200 million in back pay plus €60 million a year. Is that money accounted for in the summer economic statement or is it something which will be pencilled in? This was the subject of a court case but I want to know the position in regard to the section 39 organisations I have raised with the Minister time and again, such as the people who work in our hospices, helping people and families faced with terminal illnesses, those who work in rehab providing vital services to people with different kinds of disabilities and needs, and those who work with the Irish Wheelchair Association, to give just three examples. Is it the Minister's intention to rectify this and offer them compensation for the cuts they took? Is that provided for in this statement? Is it simply going to be ignored or will it be a budget day adjustment? The Minister should come clean with us on whether that issue is going to be rectified?</p>
          <p eId="para_876"> In the midst of a housing crisis and huge capacity issues in our health system with, unbelievably, over 700,000 people on waiting lists, the summer economic statement as structured is ignoring these capacity problems within the health service that the Sláintecare report shows need urgent strategic investment. As yet, as I understand it, we do not even have an executive officer in charge of Sláintecare and its implementation office. That was a product of new politics agreed to by everybody in the Dáil. Is the establishment of Sláintecare in any way assumed in the summer economic statement? That is another question on which we are entitled to an answer. Front-loading investment into public housing would go much further in protecting our society and economy, reducing reliance on the private rented sector and providing security to families across Ireland. This is something the Minister needs to discuss and debate with us.</p>
          <p eId="para_877"> The Minister has used concerns about corporation tax to justify a rainy day fund but if there is fluctuation in the money coming in, we need to take action to make our tax base more secure. Measures to do that could include implementing a minimum effective rate of corporation tax. It would also go some way to start to repair the damage that has been done to our international reputation arising from some of the tax cases currently being pursued, and the spectre of companies which are effectively paying no tax and banks which are being given an opt-out from paying any tax for possibly as long as 20 years. We could also look at the overall composition of tax revenue to see whether it would be resilient if there was a sudden economic downturn, as could be caused by a disorderly Brexit. Ireland already has a rainy day fund in the form of the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund and significant shareholdings in the banks that provide a buffer for future shocks. It is not true that this economy does not have buffers, and the Minister knows this quite well. The fiscal strategy the Government is pursuing is an effort to avoid a repeat of past mistakes but, instead, it is failing to address the crisis people in Ireland are facing today. This crisis feeds into the economy and leads the economy to a situation where it will not achieve its productive capacity.</p>
          <p eId="para_878"> That is why the suggestion by the Minister that a portion of corporation tax revenue should be allocated to the Government's proposed rainy day fund lacks economic coherence. The Minister for Finance is trying to create something that does not exist in Irish law. No distinction is made between money coming from income tax, VAT or corporation tax. As the Minister knows, there is no hypothecation of taxes in Ireland, even when almost everybody agrees that it may be a good idea, for example, in regard to taxes on fizzy drinks and so on. We are talking in a vacuum about something that is a very imperfect idea. All tax revenues go into the Central Fund. The idea that excess corporation tax should go into a rainy day fund is neither sensible nor desirable. The notion of a rainy day fund has not been thought through. State finances do not work like those of a company or a household.</p>

          <p eId="para_886">It is appropriate to start with the fact that it is ten years since the start of the great recession, a crisis of the neoliberal capitalist system which the establishment parties in the House defend. The crisis resulted in tens of trillions in output being lost on a world scale. It is a crisis to which capitalism responded by embedding further the inequality and neoliberal policies which were at least partly responsible for it in the first place. The consequence is weak growth globally of less than half the post-war rate. What growth exists is incredibly and unprecedentedly unequal. I note the striking fact from Oxfam that 82% of the wealth generated in the world last year went to the richest 1% while the bottom 50% got none of it. The same is happening in this country where profits have doubled, the personal wealth of the richest 300 has tripled and wages have remained barely more than stagnant over the course of the crisis. The impact continues to be felt in people's lives. It has been galling for people to hear talk of a rainy day fund. People have the sense that if the Government and Fianna Fáil are talking about a rainy day some day in the future, they must have no idea of what life is like for ordinary people now. It is monsoon season right now for the 10,000 people who are homeless, the 100,000 in at-work poverty, the half of all young women who cannot afford to buy sanitary products as reported in the media this week and the 7% of workers on temporary contracts. We need action.</p>
          <p eId="para_887"> Again and again, the Government statement claims we are nearing full employment. We are quite a distance from that. In any event, what is the nature of the employment being created? It is low-wage and precarious. That there are 100,000 fewer workers in full-time employment now than in 2008 is a striking illustration of the changed nature of the labour market. What is also striking in the Government's discussion of the summer economic statement is the changed rhetoric around the fiscal space. We have always disagreed with the fiscal rules, which is a neoliberal straitjacket out of which we must break. We said there was a primary surplus which could be used to invest in the economy but the Government said we could not use that because we had to stick to the fiscal rules. As such, there was a continuation of austerity. Now that the fiscal rules mean there is more fiscal space than before, the Government says we should forget about the fiscal rules as they are not good for the economy in its current situation. As such, we cannot spend. The conclusion is, therefore, permanent austerity. Whether the fiscal space is there or not, the Government says it cannot spend the money. In reality, the State was shrunk as a percentage of GDP in the course of the crisis and the Government is determined to keep it that way and to leave the public sector on rations.</p>
          <p eId="para_888"> One of the honest and interesting aspects of the document is the quote on page 1 to the effect that studies show aggregate levels of productivity in Ireland are heavily distorted by exceptionally high levels of productivity in a relatively small number of foreign-owned firms. A key policy challenge is therefore stated to be a need to enhance the productivity of indigenous firms. That is a euphemism if ever I heard one. If it is correct, it points to two key weaknesses in the economy. First, multinational firms are exceptionally productive, not because their workers are working 15 times harder than workers in indigenous firms, but because Ireland is a tax-haven conduit and the money is being funnelled through it. Second, it points to the ongoing weakness of the indigenous economy. That was illustrated graphically in the study published a couple of weeks ago, namely "The Missing Profit of Nations", which found that on a profit-per-wage basis, workers in the multinational sector were 16 times more productive than in non-tax havens. It is obvious what is happening. The vulnerability to external shocks which goes with that situation is the result of the development strategy of the Government and Fianna Fáil, which is about Ireland being a tax haven. The answer is to break from that and to use the €13 billion plus interest when it becomes available. The answer is a socialist industrial policy based on massive public investment to resolve social crises, public ownership and planning to build economically sustainable growth and, crucially, a transition to a green economy.</p>

          <p eId="para_891">I thank the Minister. It was telling and will, sadly, be reflected in the media debate in the run-up to the budget. Certain serious debates take place and they are held among the people who accept the fiscal rules, which we alone reject. As such, the debate will be about the different ways we can operate inside the fiscal rules. After the banking crash, Nyberg pointed rightly to the need to challenge the cosy consensus and to listen to contrarians. Of course, we are back to not listening to contrarians and failing to take seriously the points they are making. I issue that as a serious warning. The Minister might not agree with us, but he should listen to some of the points we are making.</p>

          <p eId="para_893">The media should take on board some of the points we are making too because we have led the way on important debates, including, for example, the issue of corporate tax avoidance. Whatever the Minister might think about our policies in that regard, it is a serious problem. Even mainstream economists are saying the distorting effects on our economy of profit shifting by multinationals are obvious to see. Those effects are such that we have had to create a new measure of the economy, namely GNI*, which we have because we cannot trust the GDP or GNP figures. Perhaps the socialist left has a point.</p>
          <p eId="para_894"> I suggest a few other things should be considered. The cosy consensus is to be prudent but, as Deputy Murphy said, "prudence" in that context means another reason to keep public spending to a minimum. If it goes over the top, there might be something called "overheating", which Deputy Michael McGrath says we must watch out for. Where are the signs of overheating? Is there rampant wage inflation? There is not. That is usually a sign of an overheating economy. In fact, even under the unravelling of the austerity cuts, wages will still not have reached the levels they were at before the crash in 2008 by the end of the current wage agreement. There is no sign of rampant wage inflation. Where, then, is this overheating?</p>
          <p eId="para_895"> I do not mean there are no dangers in the economy. Obviously, there are. They are the same dangers to which we have been pointing all along and the same dangers which preceded the last crash. The first is the tax haven model and its distorting effects, which I have already mentioned. It creates a vulnerability in our economy that if even one of these big firms pulled out, there would be serious trouble. That is not a sustainable model. We have to transition away from it quickly and before it backfires very badly.</p>
          <p eId="para_896"> One area in which the economy is overheating is the property sector. Where have we heard that before? The Government is quite happy to be prudent when it comes to the public investment and spending we need in areas like housing, infrastructure and health which would actually create buffers for our economy when the cycle comes around. Any notion, by the way, that there will be no bust in the future is fantasy. It will come and the only question is when it will happen. The place there is evidence of overheating is, of course, the property sector yet there is no talk by the Minister of prudence there. In fact, the Government's policies are actively facilitating speculation by property developers. The Government handed them the property sector via NAMA and is now doing absolutely nothing to stop the rampant and blatant speculation which is driving up the cost of accommodation.</p>
          <p eId="para_897">If anything will create conditions for overheating of wage demands, it is that, but it is also what is driving the necessary labour force out of the country. The young people, who we need to restore the infrastructure, services and housing in the country, are leaving because the Minister has allowed property speculators to become rampant again - the very thing that led to the last crash.</p>

          <from>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan<recordedTime time="2018-06-20T20:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_898">I am grateful for the brief opportunity to comment on the summer economic statement. Last weekend there were reports that Fine Gael was trying out various general election slogans, such as Let Leo Lead On, based on the Seán Lemass slogan of the 1960s, but listening to the bluster and barefaced attempts this morning by the Taoiseach to rewrite history in response to Deputy Pearse Doherty's question on this document, a more appropriate slogan might be You Just Can't Believe Leo, or something more alliterative in that regard. The Taoiseach, of course, ignored his own vote for the blanket bank guarantee which wrecked our State finances and provided continuous support for savage cuts and austerity measures alongside Fianna Fáil since 2008. Shamefully, this included his own disastrous stint in the Department of Health.</p>
          <p eId="para_899"> Elements of this brazen deception are evident in this document. Chapter 4, public expenditure strategy, constantly references rises in State expenditure between 1998 and 2018 as if the failures of the Department of Finance and the Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael parties from 2008 to 2018 had never happened. The outrageous cuts in health, social protection, education, housing, public service pay and other expenditures are glossed over down to 2017 and total emphasis is placed on sustainable expenditure for 2019 and beyond. The innovations mentioned in chapter 4 in regard to public service administration and reforms are, of course, valuable. The Our Public Service 2020 framework and new expenditure invigilation, including performance budgeting, the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service and the spending review process are useful improvements to ensure that budgetary policy is transparent and efficient.</p>
          <p eId="para_900"> The summer economic statement is also important when it focuses on Ireland's productivity potential in chapter 2. It has always been rightly believed in economics, indeed, it was an axiom of economics when we studied it at college, that productivity is everything. The summer economic statement references the work of the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, that Irish-owned firms have reaped only limited spill-over benefits from the activities of foreign multinationals in terms of productivity. The Department of Finance's own study, in collaboration with the OECD, disturbingly found that the productivity gap between high productivity and mainly foreign-owned firms and the rest of the economy has widened over the past decade. There was a similar widening in the services sector. The recent OECD Economic Survey of Ireland provided a menu of policy recommendations to improve productivity growth in domestic firms, including tapering of research and development supports and improving managerial skills. Yesterday, at the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, ISME proposed tax expenditures costing €54 million to improve entrepreneur relief with additional cuts in capital gains tax and increases in the research and development tax credit but the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, in an earlier presentation to the committee, warned that the €1 billion tax expenditure in research and development tax credits is far too large and these credits need to be much more targeted to improve productivity in domestic firms. The Minister, if he is serious about productivity and controlling tax expenditure, must carefully evaluate all these credits and reliefs by early October. That, of course, also creates more fiscal space.</p>
          <p eId="para_901"> The statement seems far too sanguine on risks to the economy and Exchequer. We have witnessed several rate rises by the Federal Reserve and quantitative easing is tapering towards closure. Obviously, the uncertainty for the Irish economy posed by Brexit continues to be destabilising and it is regrettable that we seem to be no further advanced in the key Brexit negotiations this June than we were six months ago at the first negotiation of a backstop. With only nine months to go to the British withdrawal, the Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, cannot give us any credible fiscal roadmap for the next three to five years. With our corporation tax take so heavily dependent on US multinationals, the developing trade wars arising from Trump's America First policy are also potentially disastrous for a small open economy like Ireland's. The President of the EU Commission, Mr. Juncker, will be in this Chamber tomorrow. As its Prime Minister, he famously ran Luxembourg as a haven for tax avoidance and tax evasion. Of course, Ireland has just been referenced in a US study as the world's biggest tax haven with funds passing through our financial system equal to the size of the UK or German economies. The well-known Greek commentator and former Finance Minister, Professor Yanis Varoufakis, repeatedly said that we have behaved like leeches in international taxation policy. These claims were addressed recently by one of the economists of IFAC at the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, but the damage of these claims to our international reputation is serious. The Minister has been noticeably silent in this regard. I have raised the significant debt refinancing issues for 2018 and 2019 with the Taoiseach in this House and with the Minister for Finance. We continue to be the most indebted country per capita in the EU, with our debt at 100% of GNI*. On a positive note, the summer economic statement, SES, report states it will decline relatively to approximately 60% of GDP in 2021.</p>
          <p eId="para_902"> All these risks combine to create a serious backdrop to the summer economic statement but it is the failures of Government policy, in providing essential resources for health, housing, education, disability and other key services, plus the barren eight years in failing to provide key investment in all these national services which provide the biggest risks to our economy and society.</p>
          <p eId="para_903"> The Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance are attempting to adopt the guise of fiscal prudence and responsibility in the run-in to budget 2019. Of course, they and their Fianna Fáil partners took the opposite road when they destroyed our national finances from September 2008 and decimated our key public services. The expenditure benchmark table, on page 18 of the report, shows net fiscal space of only €1.4 billion following the adjustments to the gross fiscal space of €3.9 billion. This, of course, includes provision for a rainy day fund of €500 million. We are also informed that €2.6 billion of the planned budget expenditure of €3.4 billion is already committed to earlier expenditure leaving only €800 million for new measures, given the huge needs of our society. It is incredible that the Minister is considering spending up to €266 million in tax cuts which the ESRI has strongly advised against. Indeed, ESRI, which reported to the Committee on Budgetary Oversight last week, has rightly stated that investment in the new national development plan would be much preferable. However, a striking feature of the summer economic statement report and the Minister's own reflections is that there seems to be no plans to broaden the tax base. The Minister talks about it but there is no action. Such a broadening needs to happen anyway because of the volatility of corporation tax, especially from 2020. Mr. Seamus Coffey of IFAC recently told the Committee on Budgetary Oversight a broadening of the tax base is the only avenue to address our resource and infrastructural deficits and to comply with the EU fiscal rules, if we want to do so. I note officials of the Department are working on whether there will future changes in the commonly agreed methodology, CAM, or other aspects of the expenditure benchmark.</p>
          <p eId="para_904"> Yesterday also, for example, we heard from Ms Patricia King of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, who again urged that the 9% VAT hospitality tax rate be scrapped raising an additional €500 million for the Exchequer. The Think-Tank for Action on Social Change, TASC, while urging increased expenditure of €1.1 billion on social housing, called for boosting tax revenue by €1 billion by reducing pension tax relief to the lower rate. TASC also advocated raising nearly €300 million extra by adding a third rate of income tax for incomes above €120,000. Year after year, many of us on these benches - the reports are in the bottom drawer where the former Minister, Deputy Noonan, left them for the Minister - advocated a higher rate on higher incomes, including the incomes of Deputies. At the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, we have also discussed the potential equalisation of diesel and petrol taxes and the significant additional revenue which might be raised by a gradual equalisation of excise on these key fuels but nowhere in the summer economic statement or the Minister's statement are there any references to truly sustainable budgeting by increasing taxation on those who can afford to pay more. I believe the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, will try to sneak back into Government by blathering about prudence and fiscal responsibility along with the Taoiseach when, in fact, his party and Fianna Fáil devastated our sovereign wealth fund and exploded our national debt over the last decade. Of course, Ireland reached its medium-term budgetary objective, MTO, under the fiscal rules in 2017, which is one of the astonishing items in those figures, and is on schedule to meet the MTO again in 2019, and finally, into the future, based on the figures in this report.</p>
          <p eId="para_905"> Given our strategic investment fund, our bank assets, our share of the Apple tax moneys and the dire needs of our population - many of us would like to see the Minister withdrawing from legal action on the Apple tax matter - I believe it is insulting to the hundreds of thousands of our citizens in grave need of housing or medical treatment to propose a rainy day fund in 2019. At the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, I told the Minister so. In fact, a number of members did. It is raining. In fact, in metaphorical terms, it is pouring for so many of our fellow citizens. It is the wrong time to talk in such terms about a sovereign wealth fund. Indeed, we had a strong sovereign wealth fund but the Minister's party and Fianna Fáil blew it away on us. Of course, some of the decisions the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Noonan, made, even into 2013, ensured that our sovereign wealth fund would still be nobbled well into the future. Additional resources might be used to pay down some national debt but there is no case for borrowing in 2019 to produce a rainy day fund. This proposal seems part of the Taoiseach's hollow efforts to impress EU leaders, who, in reality, often care little about Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_906"> In conclusion, I thank the officials in the Department of Finance who prepared the summer economic statement which, in conjunction with the earlier stability update programme report, gives Deputies and the people we represent good insights into producing a future solid fiscal policy for our nation.</p>
          <p eId="para_907">I hope that in the next three months, in the run up to October, the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, and the Taoiseach come forward with a budget that will, as Deputy Pearse Doherty said this morning, address the needs of our nation in housing, health, disability and all the other areas and stop trying to flimflam the nation.</p>

          <p eId="para_916">The very first line of this statement states that "economic recovery is now firmly established for the future". Yet this stands in direct contradiction to the paper produced by his Department with respect to the exposures related to Brexit. The findings of the Department of Finance’s economic research paper, Brexit: Analysis of Import Exposures in an EU Context, include how Ireland is a substantial outlier among the EU 27 in terms of its import exposure to the UK, at an aggregate level in almost every sector. It also includes Ireland’s goods import exposures to the UK and they are even more pronounced than its export exposures. Food and live animals account for Ireland’s largest share of UK imports, with machinery and transport equipment, chemicals, manufactured goods, miscellaneous manufacturing articles and mineral fuels also significantly exposed. We have many companies in the west that are excellent designers and builders of equipment, much of which is exported to the UK. This compares with the concentration of export exposures in a smaller number of sectors, in particular food, live animals and chemicals.</p>
          <p eId="para_917"> Across the EU 27, 13 of the top 15 sub-sectors most exposed to imports from the UK are Irish. The high import exposures highlight the potential disruption to Irish supply chains, particularly for the retail, agrifood and pharma-chem sectors. What particularly struck me about this departmental report was the finding that the issue of supply chain disruption is particularly pronounced for small and medium enterprises, SMEs. We all know how vital they are to our economy, especially in rural Ireland. They may not be in blessed St. Paschal's constituency in Dublin but they certainly are down in Tiobraid Árann, in Cork West and in Roscommon where a Deputy claimed today that no job had been created or announced by St. Leo. We have all the saints in this building at the moment.</p>
          <p eId="para_918"> The SMEs must be protected and we must deal also with customs and procedures for goods travelling from Great Britain or Northern Ireland. The SME sector represented 93% of the 31,000 firms importing goods to Ireland in 2016, or 62% of €45 billion of the total value of imports. That is massive for a small economy by any scale. Unless the Minister is preparing a significant and robust set of measures to protect SMEs then I genuinely fear we are heading into a deeply damaging economic storm. Does he see it? Is he so blinded by his own figures and spin, as Deputy Broughan and others said? That spin machine must have spread contamination around the other Ministers and the Taoiseach.</p>
          <p eId="para_919"> The following question remains: how on earth does all that square with the very first line of the Minister's economic statement which reads that our economic recovery is now firmly established for the future? Who is he talking to, where is he looking or who is codding him? Is it the same officials in the Department who advised the late Brian Lenihan? Brian Lenihan, God rest him, advised me to vote for the bank guarantee, something I will regret as long as I have a breath in my body. We were conned by them and by the Europeans. Are we meant to believe them now? Questions have been raised about that and about the judgment of these senior mandarins and senior and junior Ministers.</p>
          <p eId="para_920"> The Minister with one of his hats on expects us to believe our economy is on solid foundations while with his other hat on he informs us of the extremely precarious situation we may experience in terms of Brexit. We might be able to put questions to our guest tomorrow but will we get answers? The total unknown in respect of Brexit is very scary and the Minister is well aware of that but he makes these kinds of pronouncements about our economy being firmly established. It may be in Dublin but I remind the Minister of State that Dublin is not Ireland and the Minister does not support the Minister of State's constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny or care about it. Indeed, some of the foundations in Dublin are not so sound either. It is all another bubble that could burst at any time.</p>
          <p eId="para_921"> It is beyond me how he can square those positions but I suppose when one has saintly inspiration, one can do a lot of things. The summer economic statement notes, however, that a notably faster than expected economic recovery has boosted the demand for housing, both public and private. We do not have houses for our people so it is easy to boost it. The private developers in my constituency cannot get planning permission and my colleagues say the same thing.</p>
          <p eId="para_922"> The statement states that to date the supply response has been insufficient to keep pace with demand with adverse economic and social implications. We know that. Our first priority should be to house our citizens. We were crowing earlier about the American immigration policy but we are incarcerating people in our asylum centres, such as the one in Carrick-on-Suir. We have no problem having homeless pregnant women in Dublin. We should look at our own house first before we tell the United States what to do. One of the greatest understatements ever uttered by a Minister has to be that the supply response has been insufficient to keep pace with demand. What supply response? Where are the houses? Where are the new builds? What about the transformation of vacant sites or lots? Where is this mythical supply that the Minister refers to?</p>
          <p eId="para_923"> The Government would not even do a basic thing like changing the planning conditions to allow people with vacant shops to convert those shops without planning fees and charges at punitive rates. These simple things are not being done. The Minister is dealing in myths. It is in his head because it most certainly does not exist in the real world. I live in the real world and I represent it, and so does the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan. It is all imaginary and figments of the imagination. I hope the Minister will not be asked too many hard questions at the quiz tonight because he will not be able to answer them. If he added two and four, would he get eight? If he added seven and nine, he might get 12. God help us in those rounds. Maybe he is good at geography but he is certainly not good at maths.</p>
          <p eId="para_924"> As far as the statement about adverse economic and social implications is concerned, is the Minister referring to the 10,000 homeless, more than 3,000 of whom are children? What about those children considering that we were lecturing about the children in America and what they are doing to them? We will not look after our own children. Mol an óige agus tiocfaidh sí. We just condemn the young here. Is he referring to the catastrophic impact the lack of housing is having on marriages and family breakdown? Is he referring to the bloodthirsty actions of the foreign vulture funds and a court system that seems unwilling and unable to offer adequate protections? We had Ed Honohan in here again today trying to progress his Bill and all he got were rejections. If it is, then why does he not say so instead of hiding behind the bureaucratic language?</p>
          <p eId="para_925"> I wonder if the Minister took the time to read Social Justice Ireland's analysis of budget 2019. It suggested that the Government should empower local authorities to collect a new site value tax on underdeveloped land, such as abandoned urban centre sites and landbanks of zoned land on the edges of urban areas. This tax should be levied at a rate of €2,000 per hectare, or part thereof, and that is its suggestion and not mine. The objective of the tax should be to encourage landowners to utilise the land they possess and prevent speculation and landbanking. In the context of a shortage of housing stock, building new units is not the entire solution, and we all know that. There remains a large number of empty units across the country. Social Justice Ireland goes on to note that policy should be designed to reduce the number of these units and penalise those who own the units and leave them vacant for more than a six-month period. That is a bit short but they certainly cannot be left that way.</p>
          <p eId="para_926">It further proposes that budget 2019 introduces a levy on empty houses of €200 per month, with the revenue from this charge collected and kept by local authorities. Income from both these measures should reduce the Central Fund allocation to local authorities by €75 million per annum.</p>
          <p eId="para_927"> Social Justice Ireland's analysis goes on to acknowledge the recent report from the ESRI which recommended that, for environmental reasons, Government should equalise the excise duty on petrol and diesel, which is something Deputy Danny Healy-Rae raised today. It proposes a decrease of 6 cent per litre for petrol from 59 cent to 53 cent, and a simultaneous increase of 6 cent per litre for diesel. This would yield a total of €88 million and there are many ways we could be creative. As usual, however, it is highly unlikely that any of these measures will be implemented because the Minister and this Government have, at heart, no real social conscience in terms of the impact on the poorest of the poor, or if they have one, it is on the soles of their shoes. To talk about rainy day funds when there is a storm covering every parish in the country in terms of homelessness is appalling nonsense and I call on the Minister to be a bit more imaginative and courageous in his financial wizardry.</p>

          <p eId="para_928">I watched the summer economic statement of the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, with interest yesterday and the soundbites were "prudence" and "realism". We agree that the budgetary process should be both prudent and realistic but when I contrast the priorities outlined in his statement with the Government's approach to a number of pressing issues facing Ireland, talk of prudence rings slightly hollow.</p>
          <p eId="para_929"> The priority for this budget must be to address the crisis in housing, in the rental sector, homelessness, in mental health services, the waiting lists, people on trolleys and the Government's abysmal performance on climate change. If we are to tackle these issues in a prudent manner, the Government needs to accept reality and change course.</p>
          <p eId="para_930"> In housing, how prudent is it to continue to outsource social housing to private landlords instead of implementing a significant public housing programme? It will be €23.8 million more expensive than building houses over 30 years, according to research by Maynooth university released last year. Cost-rental housing would be more affordable for our citizens and could be funded off-balance sheet but the Government continues with an expensive, wasteful, ineffective developer-led housing model and that is not prudent.</p>
          <p eId="para_931"> On the health service or education, how prudent is it to pay for our young people to be trained as nurses, doctors or teachers only for them to emigrate in search of better terms and conditions of work, or for a better quality of life? We then have to spend huge money trying to fill staff positions in the health and education sectors from abroad. That is not prudent. Measures that appear to Government to be prudent in the short term might not be prudent in the long term.</p>
          <p eId="para_932"> On the question of the long term, there is just one mention of climate change in the summer economic statement document. The Government is looking for plaudits for putting €500 million away for a rainy day when our abysmal performance on emissions reductions and climate change means we will be paying that exact same amount in fines for missing our climate change targets, according to a report from Climate Action Network, released earlier this week. That is not prudent. The Government has given up on our 2020 targets but there has been no acceptance of, or planning for, the fact that we are facing enormous fines for non-compliance. Facing up to this fact is a very necessary part of any economic realism and is the prudent thing to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_933"> The Minister needs to provide a comprehensive plan as to how he will account for the money for the significant fines we will face for not meeting these targets. In the report from Climate Action Network, Ireland was ranked second worst in Europe at tackling climate change, ahead only of Poland. Everyone is aware that we are failing in climate change and failing terribly so why will the Government not face up to that reality? We are facing annual non-compliance fines of €500 million if we do not change course. What could we do with that €500 million? We could cut all public transport fares in half for all services on Dublin Bus, Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann. The money could build one new Luas line every year and we could have a Luas in Galway, Cork and Limerick with three years' worth of climate fines. Some 20,000 homes could be retrofitted every year with €500 million, the western rail corridor could be reopened, or 125,000 hectares of our degraded bogs could be restored or rewetted. Those projects are huge but they illustrate the scale of the fines we face unless the Government changes tack on climate.</p>
          <p eId="para_934"> I do not doubt the Minister's commitment to prudence and realistic budgeting but perhaps his Government colleagues have not got the message yet. There is an enormous contrast between his statement yesterday and the actions of the Government. If he is preaching prudence, the Government needs to change tack in a range of areas. I hope to see that change of approach as soon as possible.</p>

        <speech by="#SeamusHealy" eId="spk_402">
          <from>Deputy Seamus Healy<recordedTime time="2018-06-20T20:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_935">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the summer economic statement. The document produced by the Minister is absolutely out of touch with reality. It promises more of the same. It balances the books and promises more crises in the health service, a continuation of the emergency in housing and a continuation of the underfunding and under-resourcing in education. It promises to continue the poverty we have in this country. The document is completely at variance with a document that was published just two weeks ago by an organisation with 11,000 volunteers, which took 230,000 calls last year and spent €27 million supporting poor families. The organisation is really in touch with people and with communities and it is really important to put its views on the record. I speak of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, which works in this area on a daily and hourly basis. Its document said that, with austerity no longer featuring in news bulletins, it is easy to forget that there are still thousands of people who continue to struggle on limited incomes. It is particularly stark that 70,000 more children are growing up in poverty and are missing out on childhood experiences others take for granted than was the case in 2008. It states that, every week, it meets families caught in a poverty trap and struggling to afford the basics. In 2017, one in three of the 130,000 calls to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul for help were related to food poverty. It states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_936">Our experience shows that when times are tough, food is typically what families cut back. Rising housing costs mean this is increasingly the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_937"> The 28-page document is called Paving a Pathway out of Poverty and it indicates the various issues the society comes across, such as lack of housing, with 10,000 people homeless, 100,000 families on local authority waiting lists and inadequate income. It states that 102,000 people are working poor, with 50% of lone parents experiencing deprivation. On educational disadvantage, it states that 61% of people struggle with education costs and 520,000 adults have very poor literacy skills. In the area of health, there are 700,000 on waiting lists.</p>
          <p eId="para_938">It further states that men in disadvantaged areas will die 4.3 years earlier, that poverty increases the risk of depression by three, that 48% went without heating due to cost, and that one in four experience energy poverty. That is the real Ireland, not the Ireland of the summer economic statement, but the Ireland of ordinary families struggling to make ends meet, of the families on the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme who are paying rent to the local authority, paying a top-up to the landlord and not having 2 cent to rub together at the end of the day.</p>
          <p eId="para_939"> This Government is proposing in the summer economic statement to continue the Ireland that is divided between what has been set out in the Society of St. Vincent de Paul's Paving a Pathway out of Poverty and the fact that this country is the fifth wealthiest country in the world, with huge wealth. Its total net financial assets are now €60 billion above peak boom levels. There is a huge amount of money in the country but there is no wealth tax. It is time the very wealthy in this country, and they are hugely wealthy - we are the fifth wealthiest country in the world - pay their fair share of taxation to ensure people who live in poverty, on the poverty line and those who are the working poor and experience the crisis in housing and health have a reasonable living in this country.</p>

          <p eId="para_941">Yes. I wish to share time with Deputy Durkan. The indicators we use to measure our economic growth such as GDP or GNI* are going in the right direction. Crucially, there are more people at work today than ever before. An additional 62,100 jobs have been created this year alone and while full employment has yet to be achieved, we are well on the way to reaching our target. Fine Gael is committed to ensuring the jobs created this year and those that will be created next year will offer job security.</p>
          <p eId="para_942"> The greatest casualty of the crash was the people. The damage of that crash is still felt the length and breadth of our island. I never want our country but, most importantly, the future of the next generation to become a casualty of the previous bad politics we saw in this House. The Minister is clear that the next budget will not be a giveaway budget. We will not be putting the fate of our country at risk for auction politics or political gain.</p>
          <p eId="para_943"> The economic growth we are experiencing, while very much welcomed, has caused some positive issues with respect to our infrastructure, which is not at a rate that can keep up with our economic growth. That is as a result of underinvestment of previous Governments where spending was focused on receiving votes rather than what was in the best interest of a sustainable economy and improving living standards.</p>
          <p eId="para_944"> Housing and planning is an area on which I am focused and about which I am passionate, but housing cannot be looked at in isolation. We all need to plan for the future of our country. The lack of infrastructure is a contributing factor to our current housing crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_945"> The Government has developed Ireland 2040 to ensure the lack of infrastructure is addressed now but also to safeguard infrastructure development into the future and create the environment where opportunity, growth and inclusive communities can flourish. Ireland 2040 is the first national development plan to be put on a statutory footing, giving it the certainty and financial package it justly deserves. Budget 2019 will see the first allocation of funding under Ireland 2040 of €1.5 billion in capital expenditure which has been committed. Ireland 2040 will build on the foundations Rebuilding Ireland has generated; it builds on a recovered residential construction industry that collapsed by 90% during the bust. The Government is committed to addressing the housing crisis. We all have a responsibility as legislators to safeguard the future of our people and to protect the most vulnerable in society.</p>
          <p eId="para_946"> Since 2016 between current and capital spending housing has received an increase in funding of 125%, from just over €800 million to €1.8 billion. Budget 2018 provided €1.06 billion in Exchequer funds for new builds and acquisitions. That represents a 145% increase of capital spending on housing since 2016. I welcome those figures and all indicators that are moving in the right direction. I heard previous speakers say we are in danger of overheating the economy or the construction sector. I remind people that at the height of the boom our GDP with respect to construction was over 20%, well into the mid-20s in percentage terms; it is currently 7% to 8% and it is not expected to go above 9% next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_947"> I would like to address some of the criticisms of the Government which are unwarranted as the alternative suggestions and policies coming forward have not been tested or thought through. The Government will miss its medium-term objectives due to technical reasons and the positive rate of growth in the economy, but it must also be recognised that the total corporation tax intake represents 16.5% of GDP. We are determined to hit that target next year to ensure we avoid the mistakes of previous Governments.</p>
          <p eId="para_948"> An insurance policy against future downturns in the economy is badly needed. The rainy day fund is that insurance policy. There will be an initial €1.5 billion investment and subsequent €500 million investments for the next three years at least. The rainy day fund would be used in the event of a downturn to ensure we can continue to build infrastructure, to prevent a future shortfall and to offset some of the adverse weather conditions that might come our way. Representatives from the ESRI said at a meeting of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight last week that if we had had a rainy day fund in 2008 to 2009 we could have used it to continue to build social housing which would have both prevented the collapse somewhat of the construction industry and have alleviated some of the challenges we face today in our deficit in social housing building from 2008 onwards. I find it bizarre that Members are opposed to the creation of the rainy day fund, a measure that could be used to ease the effects of a possible downturn and prevent the level of harsh cuts of the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_949"> Calls for us both to borrow and spend today are unhelpful. The Government is borrowing a small amount to invest in infrastructure. In essence, we are borrowing to invest in our future. We are not in the business of borrowing for electoral promises today, which would be a mistake. We cannot afford to repeat the mistakes of the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_950"> Fine Gael has historically been elected to government to fix a broken country. Today we have fixed a broken economy. The recovery is structurally under way and more still has to be done. With the looming threat of Brexit and perhaps of an election, we will not go down the historical path of a giveaway budget for political gain. In fact, we will go down the road less travelled and put our country, not our party, first.</p>

          <p eId="para_951">I thank my colleague for sharing time with me. The red light on the microphone has just come on; it is a bit reluctant but it is working. I compliment the Minister and the Government on their economic policy so far. It has been spectacularly successful. That does not mean there are not issues such as the housing issue, which is a major one. I accept fully the point some Members made that it is unacceptable that a great number of people are homeless, technically or otherwise. I do not accept the notion, which is spread by somebody every so often, that people will not take houses. We deal with these people on a daily basis. I can assure Members that whenever they get an opportunity of a house, in any shape or form, they will take it. The possibility of remaining homeless when there is something on offer is not an issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_952"> Deputy Catherine Martin referred to climate change. She was right in saying we need to do more about climate change with respect to striving towards self-sufficiency, reducing our imports, contributing to the environment and avoiding the payment of fines. However, there is also a danger it seems of a tendency that we should go on a splurge, as mentioned by a number of Members.</p>
          <p eId="para_953"> Deputy Seamus Healy is a nice guy, and I am very fond of him, but I can assure the House he is wrong in his calculations and the preparation of those calculations is totally wrong. We should recall that before the bubble burst it was claimed Ireland was one of the wealthiest countries in the world, but that was wrong. Part of that claim was generated by the huge cost of property and houses throughout the country, which was multiples of what they cost elsewhere. It gave us a totally false impression of the factual position in the country.</p>

          <p eId="para_958">-----but he obviously does not accept compliments.</p>
          <p eId="para_959"> Deputy Paul Murphy admitted previously in the House that he was in favour of total unemployment. That is the reverse of Government policy. For the first time in the history of the State we have achieved employment of more than two million people. I remember in the 1980s it was a struggle to get employment past 1 million. The people of the State who made the sacrifices during the down times, and the Government, should take a bow. They have done a great job. It was a difficult job, in difficult circumstances and for which they got little support and recognition in pursuing the reference at that time. During the darkest days of the downturn, when Ministers were going abroad and trying to generate enthusiasm for this economy, there was little solace for them. Everybody was able to point them out personally and demonise them for allowing the country to go down the tubes. The country had been well and truly down the tubes for several years prior to that.</p>
          <p eId="para_960"> Perhaps the Acting Chairman remembers the reference that was made to the soft landings in previous commentary. An airline pilot would not have had problems with the soft landings that were promised during that period. All Members on the opposite side of the House were full of enthusiasm for the soft landings, but we had a major crash landing. The Minister at the time, the late Brian Lenihan, put words to it in the House when he said that the economy came to a juddering halt. It was appalling that it happened, and I do not blame anybody for that, but it happened on the watch of numerous people, including economists who had spread the word of Keynesianism daily. That entails the spending of money when one is broke. I always apologise to economists when I mention this, but I do not know anybody who will give a country money to spend when it is broke. It has never happened anywhere in the world, and I was amazed by it. It did not work anyway.</p>
          <p eId="para_961"> Prudence is important but it is dull in comparison with a splurge. Anyone who goes to the races will know what a splurge is about. If a person has a few bob in the pocket, he or she tends to let it fly, and when it is all gone, unfortunately, the person can be prudent then. It is important, however, to be prudent beforehand and to spend carefully and wisely. It is because of prudence that Ireland is where it is now. It was tough, it is hard going, and it will be tough for some time into the future. A sobering thought for everybody is that while we have achieved great results, we still have a massive national debt of more than €200 billion, with a service cost of €5 billion or €6 billion every year. All the pseudo-economists from whom we hear from time to time should ponder on that point. They should ask themselves if they would lend to somebody who had a massive debt. Admittedly, we are close to 1.5% of GDP currently, but it must be taken into consideration when lending to anybody who is in difficulty. I strongly urge Members to consider this.</p>
          <p eId="para_962"> Between 2011 and 2012 almost 500,000 people were unemployed in Ireland. The figure has reduced dramatically. However, the population has increased as has the number of people in employment. That was not easy to achieve and it was not without effort. It was not an accident; it was due to the huge efforts put in by the Government, by the Minister and by the Irish people. I pay tribute to the Labour Party Ministers who played a part in that in difficult circumstance and who were ridiculed for it. As a result of their efforts and the efforts of the previous Government, we have almost full employment, as opposed to full unemployment, and some structure to our books that had not been pursued in the past. As a result, we have a better future for our people.</p>

        <speech by="#BarryCowen" eId="spk_410">
          <from>Deputy Barry Cowen<recordedTime time="2018-06-20T20:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_963">I welcome the opportunity to respond to the Minister's summer economic statement, which sets in train the process of delivering a budget later this year. It is the third budget of this Government's tenure. Many people had said that it would hardly deliver one. There is, however, a value associated with economic and social stability. This can only be guided by stable governance. We value this stability dearly but it may not be suitable for some political parties. It certainly did not meet with universal support among our own supporters, and nor does it still. We do, however, place great value in stable governance.</p>
          <p eId="para_964"> We have had two budgets and while not spectacular, they have been progressive. There have been increases in pensions, working age payments and the National Treatment Purchase Fund. There has been a reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio and additional funding for higher education and apprenticeships, and increases in personal assistants, home help and home care packages. It has not been as extensive as one would have wished, but it is progress nonetheless. The economy has the ability to grow and to be an obvious facet for the advancement of business and day-to-day living.</p>
          <p eId="para_965"> The Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath and others referred to the advices of IFAC. We may not be bound by history, but we must learn from it. We have to place great store in the advice that emanates from the council when it comments on the general Government deficit and the structural deficit. Those advices must be acknowledged, appraised and adjudicated on. We accept them and we note, for example, that the medium-term objective for this year is not as envisaged. That curtails the Government's ability to spend the additional €900 million that is available. This spend, in addition to the provision of the rainy day fund puts the general deficit at 0.6% and a structural deficit at 0.9%. These are the facts and the realities. Deputy Pearse Doherty failed to take into account the additional €500 million on top of the €900 million, which would bring it to 0.6%. These are the fiscal rules and these are what the people voted for. The people asked that we be bound by these rules and, therefore, we must be responsible in adhering to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_966"> The economy is perceived to be doing reasonably well with 4% or 5% growth, but we still have a deficit. If this is the case, then one must be cognisant of the concentration of our receipts, the impacts of a hard or cruel Brexit, Trump's policies and their effect on Ireland's economy and the pressures being placed on corporate taxation. We must analyse and note what the Minister said in the context of the 2019 budget and not necessarily in the context of the next five or ten years. It is a transparent process, which provides for pre-budget submissions by various interested parties, either to the Government or to the all-party committees. The submissions bring focus and attention to the reality of what is and is not available for the budget, rather than interested parties and others playing to their own audiences.</p>
          <p eId="para_967"> Let us consider the €3.4 billion package put before the House by the Minister, notwithstanding the €500 million rainy day fund. A sum of €1.5 billion is committed to the national development plan, €400 million to national demographics, primarily associated with health and education, €400 million to public pay, with a €300 million carry-over from year to year, which amounts to €2.6 billion.</p>
          <p eId="para_968"> It is not fair, right or appropriate that we brush over this by saying that the commitments in the national development plan account for €1.5 billion without quantifying how that will affect the economy in the forthcoming year. When it was launched, there was considerable fanfare for and advertisement of the plan, Project Ireland 2040 or whatever it is called. That fanfare is ongoing in respect of, for example, a couple of hospitals in Cork, the Luas, the underground and other transport infrastructural gains that will accrue in Dublin and other parts of the country but it is incumbent on the Government to lay out in great detail where the €1.5 billion will be spent in the forthcoming year. As we are debating a budget package, we cannot brush this question aside. The people - those whom we represent among the general public, those in business and so on - need to know exactly how much is being spent, where it is being spent and what impact it will have, not only on the economy but also on the regions where infrastructural gains will accrue.</p>
          <p eId="para_969"> That leaves €800 million. I assume that the pension anomaly identified last year is accounted for in current expenditure and will not impinge upon the €800 million. The €200 million that was committed to consultants recently was the result of the High Court's adjudication on a contractual obligation on the State that was signed prior to the FEMPI legislation. As an historical obligation, it should not impinge on the €800 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_970"> Leaving those matters aside, we believe the next call on this funding should be pay equality for new entrants to the public service. We are glad to see the Government and unions have finally sat down together to conclude a deal on this issue. Whether that will be over one, two or three years remains to be seen but we support the process and encourage agreement between the parties and accommodation for it in this budget package. This is apart from the Public Service Pay Commission, to whose recommendations on resolving recruitment and retention difficulties in the Air Corps, healthcare - nurses, consultants, GPs throughout the regions etc. - and many other areas the Government is obliged to respond.</p>
          <p eId="para_971"> Thereafter lies the potential for this budget to focus on addressing the areas in which there has been little or no success under the two progressive budgets, specifically the issues of housing and health. There was much talk about what would be achieved by Sinn Féin tabling a motion of no confidence in the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government. Motions do not build houses, but a housing-centric budget might just do it. State funding for the provision of social and affordable housing has increased but has failed to deliver. It is more about how the funding is spent and the methods used to achieve the rewards being sought.</p>

          <p eId="para_973">For the Government, the issue is that the means and methods through which it seeks to provide those units are not working and must be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_974"> Despite the commitments to and stated improvements in funding for the health service, the failure has lain in addressing the difficulties with the waiting lists. These may well relate to our difficulties in recruitment and retention, which is the excuse given where the assessment of children with special needs and the availability of GPs throughout the country are concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_975"> These are the two central issues of which one must be mindful. If we acknowledge - we all seem to - that there is a housing emergency, it must be the focus of this budget and funds must be made available to improve the situation. However, we cannot ensure that happens if we are also trying to realise the demands placed on some Deputies by the promises on taxation and other concerns that we would all like to see addressed were it not for budgetary rules and regulations and the question of how the budget is packaged.</p>
          <p eId="para_976"> We must also be mindful of the fact that, although the economy appears to be going well and growing at a rate of between 4% and 5%, we still have a deficit. Any increase in expenditure would fail to recognise the rules to which we and our people committed under the fiscal treaty, and the threat from external factors remains too great to take that risk.</p>
          <p eId="para_977"> The two previous budgets, though progressive, were not spectacular. Modest gains were made in certain areas because of our commitment to them. Fianna Fáil values stability. It might not be the political thing to do, but it is the right thing to do. Ultimately, people will see that for what it is, how it was meant and the good faith into which it was entered. Having assessed the two budgets and identified where opportunities exist, we have a chance at this juncture to address those issues where there have been abject failures. That remains our commitment and is central to our negotiations in order that we can represent and give value to the votes that were cast in our party's favour. We will do that in good faith.</p>

        <speech by="#JonathanOBrien" eId="spk_413">
          <from>Deputy Jonathan O'Brien<recordedTime time="2018-06-20T21:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_978">Politics is about choice. At certain moments, these choices can be limited by the circumstances in which we find ourselves. At other times, the freedom to choose is clear. We are at such a juncture, given the upcoming budget. The Minister for Finance tells us that the public finances have been stabilised, we are the fastest-growing economy in the EU and our economy has recovered from the catastrophe that was wrought upon it by the reckless mismanagement of Fianna Fáil. However, that recovery was shouldered by the weakest and most vulnerable in our society, by those struggling to get by and by working families that pay their bills and are left with little, if anything, afterwards. The Government is now proposing that the very recovery won by these people will not be enjoyed by them. In fact, it is proposing that the recovery will be enjoyed by a minority.</p>
          <p eId="para_979"> Questions need to be asked. At a time when our economy grows, why do we live in a society where homelessness is becoming a fact of life? Why does our housing market continue to fail families and young couples? Why does it continue to force children to spend their childhood years living in hotel rooms? As the economy grows, why does our health service continue to fail our women, our elderly and our communities? Why do we continue to lag behind our EU partners in infrastructural investment, failing to pave the roads that will lead to the dynamic indigenous economy of the future? As the economy grows, why are we failing to address a lost decade of investment?</p>
          <p eId="para_980"> The Government wants us to believe that we cannot address these crises because we need to be prudent but questions must be answered in the coming months. For us, the answers are stark and clear. We can address the crises by broadening our tax base and pivoting our economy away from an over-reliance on corporation tax receipts. Answers can be found in investing in social and affordable housing, banishing the scourge of homelessness from our society and addressing the threat that housing undersupply poses to our economy. They can be found in investing in our infrastructure to address the lost decade of underinvestment, which has seen our capital stock fall far below the levels of the EU and other advanced economies. Answers can be found in investing in infrastructure and broadband, bringing our public capital stock levels from among the lowest in the EU to the highest and connecting our communities. Answers can be found in investing in childcare to ease the unsustainable burden that is placed on young families and deters women from entering the workforce.</p>
          <p eId="para_981">That is the vista that lies before us and the choice that we have to make.</p>
          <p eId="para_982"> We in Sinn Féin choose to seize the opportunity and invest in our economy. We choose to bring a recovery to everyone and to build a sustainable future in the present. We believe it can be achieved by adhering to the fiscal rules. It can be achieved without the reckless policies of the past which were propagated by Fianna Fáil and which this Government proposes to continue. It can be achieved within those fiscal rules and without pursuing unsustainable trends in expenditure. The fiscal rules were designed to prevent the boom and bust policies and practices of the past. In these circumstances, Fine Gael has made its choice and Fianna Fáil has followed suit. Fine Gael, with the support of Fianna Fáil, has chosen to deprive the economy, the public and the very citizens who helped to rebuild this economy of the available €1.4 billion investment which can and should be included as part of the fiscal rules. They are attempting to rewrite the rules which they have preached to us about for the last number of years and to convince the public that it is necessary to under-invest and it is normal to have crisis after crisis. It falls upon us, in the real Opposition, to set the record straight.</p>
          <p eId="para_983"> Fine Gael will claim that spending the money available to the public purse, under the fiscal rules, is both reckless and irresponsible. It will claim it will lead to an increased Government deficit and a structural deficit. It will claim that such deficits are dangerous. Fine Gael will not tell the public that last year, in 2017, it created a deficit of 0.3%. It is not telling the public tonight that this year we will have a structural deficit of 0.6% and we will fail to reach the medium-term budgetary objective which the Minister of State is now declaring as the panacea for all our social ills.</p>
          <p eId="para_984"> The Government is also telling us that to solve our housing crisis and fix our broken health system would lead to economic ruin. That is a dangerous untruth. It is an untruth which ensures that the crises in housing and health remain permanent features of our society. Fianna Fáil has bought into this untruth. The Government now plans to sell that to the public over the coming months but the public will not be fooled. Fianna Fáil had a choice today about what side to stand on and it has decided to stand on the side of the Government which, in our opinion, is the wrong side. In doing so, Fianna Fáil has rendered itself unfit to solve this crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_985"> There has been much talk of the rainy day fund. The Government is failing to tell people that to release funds from the rainy day fund outside the expenditure benchmark would require a change to the fiscal rules. We have had no indication from the Government that it is willing to even negotiate any change in the fiscal rules to allow the money it is now proposing to put into a rainy day fund to be spent in a time of economic downturn.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PeterBurke" eId="spk_414">
          <from>Deputy Peter Burke<recordedTime time="2018-06-20T21:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_986">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the summer economic statement. I welcome the radical change in the budgetary process that has been brought about by Fine Gael. It is good to see that we have moved away from a disconnected annual event where we have seen a rabbit pulled out of the hat and policies being announced on the day without being stress-tested robustly. Fine Gael has adopted a different approach as recommended by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD. If one looks at the process for the budget, there are spring and summer economic statements which set out the parameters of the budget, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, which is an independent commentator on Ireland's fiscal position, the National Economic Dialogue, which engages in debate with sectoral interests, and the Committee on Budgetary Oversight. These are key safeguards that bring the budget to a more holistic approach where people can have their views and engage with the Minister, and key actors of the State can be brought in and have their views heard.</p>
          <p eId="para_987"> I also welcome, with regard to the process that the Minister is embarking on, the establishment of the rainy day fund which will mitigate the harshness of future shocks to our economy. It is important that we have money to put into the economy at a time when some part of the economy falls or contracts. If one looks at the last years, when we hit the financial crisis of 2008, we had broken the golden rule and we were borrowing for current expenditure. We had huge debt levels and we had no money to inject into the economy. If we establish this rainy day fund, that will be a key tool to invest money into the economy. If we reduce our debt, it will leave us less vulnerable to the markets.</p>
          <p eId="para_988"> In 2008, some 3.8% of all revenue was used to service the national debt. Now the debt is around €206 billion. It is €40,000 for every man, woman and child and around 15% of all taxation income is used to service it. That is a key place where the Irish economy is exposed and the Government has to be careful with it. We are now in the 23rd consecutive quarter of employment expansion in this country. The labour force is now at a record level of 2.24 million. We are trying to get to a position by 2021 where 10% of all revenue will be going into capital projects, which is well above the EU average. We have a lost decade to make up for. There was a huge problem with the lack of investment in our infrastructure and it is critical that we do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_989"> I welcome that the Minister has put on record that he will not adopt spending or taxation measures that would result in a deficit larger than 0.1%. This is important for the economy because we need to ensure that we mitigate any risks at that level. When we look back, our economy at one stage in 2011 had a deficit of €22 billion. We were spending 50% more than we were taking in but we have turned a huge corner in that regard. Much has been made of our corporation tax receipts and Ireland being labelled as a tax haven. I am not aware of what metric people use to determine that. They seem to pick various different reports, yet the OECD ranks Ireland as the most transparent country for corporate taxation policy and exchange of information therein.</p>
          <p eId="para_990"> I noted comments made by the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners in a recent article in <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> about the top ten companies that pay 39% of our corporation tax. He made a key point, that the key characters that make up that top ten change year-on-year. In 2013, the top ten took in 36% of our tax take and in 2017, that same top ten were under 25%. It is clear that companies travel in and out of that top ten, which gives some level of hope that it will not collapse. It is important that we monitor that because that is a key risk for our economy and we have to ensure that it is managed appropriately. It is important that the double Irish was ended with the measures taken by this Government to tackle tax evasion, where from January 2015, all companies incorporated in Ireland are now tax resident. The key thing about this country is that when it is noticed or becomes clear that there is an issue with our tax code, it acts promptly. People need to be very careful when throwing loose terminology or loose comments around relating to Ireland's standing internationally. They are putting our country's reputation in jeopardy. As the saying goes, if one gets a name for getting up early in the morning, one can stay in bed all day.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Fitzmaurice<recordedTime time="2018-06-20T21:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_991">I welcome the opportunity to speak. When one looks at the summer economic statement, one would think that everything was rosy in the garden, with the figures that are involved, especially for the next budget. One would imagine it would solve many problems. When one drills down into it and looks at the Ireland of today, we still have a major problem in our health system. I am not just saying that one should keep throwing money at something but that we have a major problem with infrastructure and our health system.</p>
          <p eId="para_992">We also have more than 700,000 people on waiting lists. We have a housing problem that is getting worse. One of the first things I highlighted when the programme for Government was being put together was the need for institutes of technology, ITs, as well as universities, to be able to borrow money. That is important given the significant opportunity for accommodation to be built in various ITs around the country that would help the colleges and students and would also help to alleviate pressure in many areas, but especially in cities around the country. Unfortunately, two years later ITs are not in a situation where they can borrow money and the issue must be addressed as a matter of urgency.</p>
          <p eId="para_993"> Because of what those involved in the banks did, we are still burning €3 billion every year. It would help a lot if the EU were a bit more lenient towards us. This country needs to restructure its debt. We have debt of approximately €204 billion and we need to restructure it at lower rates on a long-term basis. I would structure it on a different scenario from the way it is done at present because it would give us space and money that we could use.</p>
          <p eId="para_994"> There is no denying there are more people at work. The statistics tell us that. The big question is whether they are earning bigger wages. Many people are barely surviving. No reference has been made in the debate thus far to the agricultural community. Once one goes outside Dublin and the larger cities, there is a major reliance on agriculture. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine needs to hammer on the table to ensure we get a payment of €200 per suckler cow because I expect that when the statistics come out in the next few months, we will have lost a massive amount of the suckler herd. I predicted that last Christmas but it was denied. One might ask what difference it makes. It affects exports in terms of weanlings and there will be a knock-on effect in terms of jobs in the haulage sector and the sale of meal in small shops. We must make sure we ring-fence such a provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_995"> There are ups in the economy. I am not here to hammer the Government. It is acknowledged by everyone that rural areas need a lot of infrastructure. I attended a meeting today of the Joint Committee on Rural and Community Development, which heard a presentation by Anne Graham. People talk about the new green, clean economy but each new bus bought from next year on will cost 25% more if it is an electric or diesel vehicle, so for every ten buses we buy today we will only be able to buy eight from the same purse. Those are the things that will come back to bite us.</p>
          <p eId="para_996"> I fear that at the end of 2019 or 2020 a lot of pressure will come on this country to change the corporation tax rate. We must stand up to it. People might say companies get away with this, that and the other but they should look at the statistics on the amount of tax that is taken in. If we get screwed by Europe on this, we will end up with a lot less money to spend. There is a significant infrastructural deficit in the west and the south in terms of roads, buses and rail. The amount of money required to deal with that is massive.</p>
          <p eId="para_997"> While I agree with the approach of always putting a few quid under the mattress for a rainy day, I do not think we are at the stage yet where we are fit to do that, given the number of people, including children, who are homeless, the amount of housing that is needed, and when people are waiting for a hospital appointment - everyone knows somebody in that situation - or in an accident and emergency unit that needs to be refurbished. They are the things we need to prioritise.</p>

          <p eId="para_1000">The sum of €1.4 billion is more than €500 million greater than what will be spent on mental health in the State in 2018, according to the Government, if we can trust that figure, which is questionable. The sum of €1.4 billion could help to do a lot of additional things for mental health this year. It could easily ensure that no mental health beds that are needed are closed, especially in the child and adolescent mental health service, CAMHS. It could easily pay for additional counselling hours for people at primary care level, which would take the pressure off other services. It could help to build a model of perinatal mental health screening and support and open a maternal mental health unit. It could ensure that some staff members in the mental health services are encouraged to stay in Ireland and work in our services without fear of not being able to afford to pay for accommodation or transport or many other things which now are beyond the wage they make. It could fund the establishment of new early intervention programmes, new Jigsaw centres and new CAMHS teams. It could entice the staff needed to fill the vacancies in these services to stay. It could fund a national 24-7 crisis hotline for mental health, with access to trained counsellors and a referral system. It could make some serious progress on delivery of a seven-day week service that is needed as the long-overdue first step in a 24-7 crisis intervention service. It could establish additional crisis houses for people in immediate need of acute supported care in a safe environment. It could pay for respite for families that are at breaking point. The Minister might not currently see this as an investment but it is the best kind of an investment one can make, namely, one in the people of the country and in their well-being and in doing that, it is an investment in all our future. The short-term dividend would be that the people of this nation might actually believe the Government gives a damn about them. I will finish with a quote from a famous Corkman who once said, fail to prepare, prepare to fail.</p>

          <from>Deputy Martin Ferris<recordedTime time="2018-06-20T21:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1001">We will talk to the Corkman on Saturday night. There is much talk about the rainy day fund. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael are on the same page but we have a different view. Our view is that because of the terrible recession and the mismanagement of the country by successive Governments, there is a need to look after those most in need.</p>
          <p eId="para_1002"> We are told we have an education system that is free but the reality is that the cost of educating children is increasing year on year. That is due in the main to the fact that currently the capitation grants awarded to schools do not even cover the day-to-day running costs. Primary schools have seen cuts of nearly €110 million and each year hard-pressed parents are forking out more than €46 million just to keep their local schools ticking over. That is some indictment of the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_1003"> This is taxation by stealth and it is no longer sustainable. These children are expected to meet our future demands in an ever-changing workforce. We can no longer encumber their parents with such fundraising demands where, according to a recent Grant Thornton report, the capitation grant now covers an average of only 52% of the running cost of a school. We are also spending less per primary pupil than the EU or OECD average. I demand that the Government must tackle this area in the forthcoming budget. The capitation grant should be restored to the pre-2011 figure of €200 and that should be the beginning of a phased programme of increases to match the actual running costs of schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_1004"> Grants for special classes should be increased <i>pro rata</i>. Currently, on average, primary schools are being asked to run their schools with 92 cent for each pupil per day. The minor works grant, which is vitally important, should be paid every year as a non-discretionary payment. Principals and boards of management should not be spending their valuable time implementing new fundraising ideas just to run their schools. Parents have no problem fundraising for extracurricular activities but should not be expected to fork out hundreds of euro each year just to keep the school solvent.</p>
          <p eId="para_1005">Many parents are embarrassed on being presented with donation envelopes on a monthly basis that they cannot afford. All children should be treated equally and must have the same opportunity to have a proper, free education. I do not think there is a rural school or parish in this country that is not fundraising several times a year or, in some cases, on a monthly basis in order to keep the school running. It is an awful indictment of this Government, supported by Fianna Fáil, that it has allowed this to happen. The rainy day fund should be used to benefit our young people, our elderly and those most in need and it is up to the Government to that.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Collins<recordedTime time="2018-06-20T21:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1006">I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on the summer economic statement. Here we are again, as Deputy Mattie McGrath said. I am looking at the Minister's statement which refers to jobs and the low unemployment rate but behind the spin, the reality is that people are being forced to work for low wages. More are forced out to Turas Nua to doctor the figures. A recent report indicated that 60,000 people were engaged with Turas Nua over the last 12 months but 40,000 of them will be back on welfare again. All we are doing here is doctoring figures and rolling out loads of spin.</p>
          <p eId="para_1007"> We need to consider those couples who have been forced out to work for low wages. This is where we should be focusing our budgets. These couples do not have enough income to get bank loans but are earning too much to get council loans. We kept calling for a solution to this and eventually we got it in the form of a mighty announcement about a new loan scheme for those who are caught in these traps, the Rebuilding Ireland home loan. However, we have found out that most of those whom we advised to apply were codded by this Government. Over 50% of applicants have been mysteriously refused, leaving more and more to seek social housing. So many young couples are caught in a vicious trap and this Government has failed to get them out of it. The same Government dishes out spin on a daily basis about how well it is doing by the young couples of Ireland. I urge the Minister for Finance to come to my constituency clinics at weekends to see reality on the ground in west Cork.</p>
          <p eId="para_1008"> The Minister said that he plans to run a very small deficit next year because of the political choices the Government has made in Project Ireland 2040 and the National Development Plan. The people of west Cork went through that plan with a fine toothcomb and found not one idea about west Cork therein. It looks like the people of west Cork will have to put the country first and once again west Cork will be coming in second place. The Minister said that there will be a steady and sustainable improvement in living standards but this is complete nonsense. Families are struggling and when they have paid all of their weekly bills, they have nothing left. They have no rainy day funds nor do they have a caring Government that understands the difficulties they experience.</p>
          <p eId="para_1009"> What about the way the State has treated women? It has refused to give those women who stayed at home to rear their families and run their homes a proper pension. Where is care for women, as this State turns its back on these hard working women, budget after budget? How can the Government claim that things are going well in the country when it has failed to provide pay equalisation for new entrant teachers and health workers, leading many of them to leave our country in search of the respect they deserve? Extra funding for education needs further scrutiny because there has been no improvement in the capitation grant for years. How can this Government tell us that our economy is improving when we had farmers on their knees earlier this year because of a major fodder crisis and nothing was done for weeks, despite the outcry from Deputies across this House, until it was too late for many? The Government is telling us now that it will make sure that these farmers, as well as fishermen, will have access to low-interest loans. However, applicants for such loans cannot have any borrowings. Any productive farmer or fisherman will have borrowings already and therefore will not qualify for these new loans. They are being codded with yet more super announcements leading to nothing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1010"> This Government needs to invest properly in health. It needs to open 24-hour accident and emergency units in Bantry and Mallow to alleviate the pressure on Cork University Hospital. There are over 700,000 on waiting lists which is an astonishing figure but this Government has done little to change that. The lack of spending on home help services has left so many elderly people with little or no home-based support. What does the Government intend to do about this? It intends to publish a report, which has yet to happen. The same is true of the so-called fair deal scheme. That scheme is the most unfair deal ever and has robbed elderly hardworking men and women of their savings. Shame on any Government that would do that to the people who built this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1011"> The Government must reduce the excise duty on fuel and give some money back to the people. We are being robbed daily at the pump with the excise duty that the Government has added onto the price of fuel.</p>
          <p eId="para_1012"> We spoke to IT students earlier today who need access to proper accommodation but nothing is being done for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1013"> If we have money to spend, which we have been led to believe is the case, then we must start spending it on the people who deserve it. I urge the Minister to speak to his fellow Ministers and make sure that happens for the people.</p>

          <from>Deputy Danny Healy-Rae<recordedTime time="2018-06-20T21:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1014">I am grateful for the opportunity to speak in this very important debate and will begin by speaking about health. We have five Ministers and Ministers of State in the Department of Health and we have a Government but we do not have a health service that is fair to sick and vulnerable people who need care. As was mentioned already, mental health services and treatment for people with depression and other mental health problems are practically non-existent in Kerry. If such people are unwell on a Friday evening, all they can do is ring SouthDoc or go to the accident and emergency department in University Hospital Kerry, which is already overcrowded. Proper assistance is not being given to people who present with mental health problems and so many are committing suicide. It is such a shame because a life is a life and these people are not getting the attention they deserve. What the Government is proposing with regard to congregated settings is not right because one size does not fit all. We have been asking that the policy in that regard be reviewed and an assessment be done on those who have been moved out from congregated settings to see how they are doing. We have asked for a report on that but nothing has been forthcoming.</p>
          <p eId="para_1015"> On housing, I have said many times that if the Government does not have the money it claims to have it should just come out and say so. I believe that the Government does not have the funding it claims to have for housing. Ten rural cottages will be built in Kerry between 2016 and 2021. People are providing their own sites but there are 37 more people looking for rural cottages. Why does the Government not just give them the money? The Government said three years ago that it was giving €62.5 million to Kerry for housing but that money has not been spent.</p>
          <p eId="para_1016"> IBEC has said, with regard to roads and infrastructure, that Ireland has the lowest amount of capital projects in Europe. I know of one project that must be progressed but which only received €25,000 this year, namely the Killarney bypass. The town is choked with traffic.</p>
          <p eId="para_1017">Approximately 18,600 people travel on the existing bypass every day, which is not fit for purpose. The Government is talking about the climate change effort. It is going to spend money. It is going to tax farmers and people on the road with more carbon tax, even though they are paying enough for petrol and diesel at the pumps at present. It is blaming people who cut turf for climate change. The rumour now is that the Government is going to sacrifice farmers and get them to reduce cow numbers, even though we know they are only barely existing and have to increase their numbers to survive economically and stay on their farms.</p>
          <p eId="para_1018"> We cannot believe what the Government is coming back with from Europe to deal with the challenges of Brexit. Before Christmas, the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste said they had it all sorted and there was going to be a soft border. Now we do not know. There are different viewpoints from across the water every day. I hope the Government asks the UK to have another referendum. That is what should happen. I was the first person to ask for that when the UK decided in the initial referendum to leave the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_1019"> Project 2040 does not give much hope to County Kerry. It is hardly mentioned in the plan at all. The only way in which it will have an effect is that people looking to build one-off houses for themselves will be told they can get planning permission if it does not detract from an urban town or city.</p>
          <p eId="para_1020"> On education, we had a group representing students here today and its members stated that college students are having fierce difficulty sourcing accommodation. They asked for purpose-built accommodation to be provided for students in the cities where colleges are based. Primary schools are under fierce pressure to continue. It is not right that parents and teachers have to raise funds to keep schools going. It is no different from what happened years ago when each child had to bring a sod of turf to school to keep the fire going.</p>

          <p eId="para_1026">The summer economic statement clearly sets out the Government’s determination to ensure our budgetary strategy is based on steady increases in public expenditure underpinned by stable and predictable tax revenue. Rather than a feast-or-famine approach to funding public services, we are committed to providing incremental and sustainable improvements that serve our people. This has not always been the approach taken to expenditure and fiscal policy. Over the past 20 years, average gross voted expenditure on public services increased in line with economic growth. This period was characterised by significant expenditure growth up to 2008 which, ultimately, proved unsustainable and was followed by significant expenditure reductions from 2009 to 2014. The scale of the increases in the pre-crisis period necessitated the scale of the reductions later on. This pattern of unsustainable growth funded by high levels of economic and tax growth, followed by significant expenditure reductions, had an impact on the delivery of services and made long-term planning for expenditure on services and infrastructure difficult for Departments. While protecting the most vulnerable people in our society was a priority in the crisis years, it cannot be denied that the scale of the crisis resulted in hardship for many citizens. The goal of our expenditure policy now, therefore, must be to strive to avoid a return to expenditure shocks in the future. If we are to do this, the increases in expenditure that are provided for in the short term must be sustainable in the long term. Growth in public expenditure has been considerably more modest in more recent years. There has been a key focus on ensuring there are ongoing sustainable improvements in public services and infrastructure. This policy is aimed at ensuring the core functions of the State are sufficiently funded and sustainable improvements to public services are delivered. It also means that Departments can plan for long-term developments in public services and infrastructure. The development and maintenance of high-quality public infrastructure is at the forefront of budgetary policy. There is an increased focus on capital expenditure, particularly through the NDP, which seeks to reform how we plan and deliver capital investment in Ireland. This ambitious strategic plan signals a shift towards greater integration of regional investment plans, stronger co-ordination of sectoral strategies and a more rigorous selection and appraisal process for projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_1027"> Reforming how we provide services has been an important element of the recovery. The fiscal consolidation of the crisis period was accompanied by a programme of public service reform to maintain public service delivery in the face of necessary reductions in staff numbers at a time when demand for public services was increasing. Although we are no longer in that difficult position, the reform of the public service remains a key priority for the Government. The first public service reform plan, which was in place from 2011 to 2013, was primarily driven by the need for fiscal adjustment and had a focus on efficiency and cost containment. The following iteration, which was in place from 2014 to 2016, maintained a focus on efficiency and had an overarching objective of delivering better outcomes for stakeholders. The current framework, Our Public Service 2020, was launched in 2017 and aims to build on the achievements of its predecessors while setting a path for reform beyond 2020. It focuses on supporting sustainable, continuous progress to build a stronger public service and deliver better quality public services to the people of Ireland. I am proud that the framework has been designed to promote and support a citizen-centred approach to public service delivery and has bee developed with input from the public and the public service. Prudent expenditure growth, strategic capital investment and a focus on reform will allow us to stay on a sustainable path and continue to deliver high-quality and effective public services to our citizens.</p>

          <p eId="para_1035">Seanad amendments Nos. 4 and 5 clarify which children are taken into account when determining the multiple child deduction that will apply to an applicant's assessable income. The multiple child deduction is a deduction from income that I intend to provide for families that have more than one child under the age of 15. It is intended to reflect a cumulative impact of childcare costs on families as it is total childcare costs, the combined cost in respect of all their children, that matter to parents when they are making decisions as to whether they can participate in the labour market. More broadly, the deduction is intended to reflect the relationship between larger family size and economic vulnerability.</p>
          <p eId="para_1036"> Section 13(5) sets out the matters which the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs must take into account when making regulations on the methodology for calculating the level of subsidy under the scheme. These matters include the number of children in the family. In other words, this section gives the Minister the power to apply a multiple child deduction to a family's income for the purpose of the scheme's income assessment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1037"> Section 9(3) of the Bill ensures that the scheme administrator is provided with all necessary information on other children in the family in order to allow for the application of this multiple child deduction. In providing for the multiple child deduction, then, it is essential that the Bill is absolutely clear as to which children may count towards it. The two Seanad amendments proposed today intend to clarify that the relevant children are those who first are children in relation to whom either the applicant or the applicant's partner is a parent or acts in a parental role; and second, are children who reside with the applicant or the applicant's partner. The first condition requiring a parental relationship ensures that a child cannot count towards the multiple child deduction if the child happens to live in the same house as the applicant but the applicant or his or her partner does not care for the child. The second condition requiring that they reside together ensures that a child cannot count towards the multiple child deduction if the applicant is a parent of the child but the applicant does not have regular care of the child.</p>
          <p eId="para_1038"> Seanad amendment No. 4 amends section 9(3) to clarify that information, that is, the name, PPS number and date of birth, should be provided in the application form only for children in relation to whom the applicant or the applicant's partner is a parent. Seanad amendment No. 5 amends section 13(5) to clarify that when making regulations on the multiple child deduction, only children who reside with the applicant or the applicant's partner and in relation to whom the applicant or the applicant's partner is a parent should be counted.</p>

          <p eId="para_1039">This is all very nice when it is couched in language such as the Minister has just spoken. There is great room for anomalies, opacity, disengagement and avoidance. The Minister mentioned several times that an administrator may decide under section 13 of the Bill. As a parent of a large family, who has gone past childcare thankfully at this stage, and from the experience I have dealing with other schemes and as a chairperson of a community crèche, a naíonra, this is very unwieldy. It is not going to bring any clarity to the matter of trying to decide if a child is counted if he does not live with the parent or if the parent who is claiming does not give support to the child. Who is going to be the arbiter? The Minister mentioned the administrator of the scheme. Who is going to bring the clarity that is needed? Could this end up in legal challenges? We already have many cases of child custody and child issues that are dealt with in the Family Court. None of us interferes or wants to interfere or to be involved or to go there. The Minister is saying that in section 13(5) of the Bill, the level of subsidy depends on a certain number of children and on who is claiming and who is supporting that child. I think it is quite confusing. Who is going to be the final arbiter? If it ends up that these issues lead to further tensions and trauma, unfortunately maybe, it is the child we want to support and the children might end up the losers in the long term. I have issues about that.</p>

          <p eId="para_1040">These Seanad amendments are intended to and do correct anomalies. They will provide significant support to owners and managers of crèches, especially community crèches, because they are intended to ensure that childcare is affordable for larger families. Finally, Pobal is the scheme administrator.</p>

          <p eId="para_1041">I know Pobal is the overall administrator. That is fine. It is like the grant applications at present. Naíonra Chaisleáin Nua and many others were unsuccessful in their grant applications and ended up phoning or contacting their elected representatives. Pobal is fine but it is not on the ground. Pobal is not managing the day-to-day running of the crèches and does not have to make those hard decisions at the coal face. It is fine to talk about Pobal but in respect of the manager who may be working and a childminder in the scheme who might not be fortunate enough to be big enough to be a manager, who is dealing with the parents? If a person is dealing with two parents who might not be in agreement, the person will be waiting a while before they get somebody in Pobal to come in and adjudicate on that sensitive and delicate issue. It is grand on paper but there are physical mechanics, the working out of it, the human story behind it and difficulties. The primary objective of the childcare provider and the staff is to give proper, nurturing, safe and loving care to the children in their care but there are disputes and issues and there might be other implications relating to taxation and other benefits parents may be claiming. A wider issue can come into play and lead to very bitter disputes. It is fine to talk about Pobal but who are the line managers in Pobal who will be at hand or available to come and assist in arbitrating? We must remember that all of these community childcare facilities are run by voluntary boards. If the manager has an issue like that and it has to come down on one side or the other, the board is ultimately responsible and it is a voluntary board. I found in the past that Pobal is fine from nine to five but it is not there for board meetings late in the evening or for volunteers who cannot meet during the day. The machinations and mechanics of working through the system are not as simple as they appear in the Bill or the amendments.</p>

          <p eId="para_1042">These amendments aim to ensure that childcare is more affordable, particularly for parents with larger families. I believe the Deputy indicated that this is something in his own history. That is a good thing in terms of the amendments. Second, I answered the Deputy's question in terms of Pobal because he asked about the scheme administrator, which is helpful in terms of the scheme's administration. At the same time, there is and will be an appeals process in which appeals officers will be required to make an assessment that is independent of the scheme administrator so I expect that this answers the Deputy's queries.</p>
