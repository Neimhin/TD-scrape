#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	0	Will the Minister introduce measures to ensure traceability to specific projects in respect of funding provided from the proceeds of the national lottery good causes fund? Some Departments such as the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport do it very well, but nobody in the other big Departments knows where the money goes.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	1	Appendix 1 of the Revised Estimates for Public Services which is published each year gives a breakdown, by Department, of all expenditure areas supported by the proceeds of the national lottery. For approximately a decade, the total allocation for the relevant subheads has exceeded the amount available from the national lottery surplus. Therefore, these subheads are now described as being part-funded by the national lottery and the balance of the expenditure in the subheads comes from allocations from normal Exchequer sources. For example, this year overall expenditure under the subheads supported by the national lottery is estimated at €408 million, while the proceeds deliverable from the national lottery are estimated at just over €200 million. The balance comes from the Exchequer as a top-up. Individual Departments with responsibility for expenditure part-funded by the national lottery surplus publish details of their expenditure on their websites, including lists of recipient organisations and the amounts involved.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	2	I appreciate what the Minister has said and it is accurate to a point, but it is not the full story. I fully accept that people can see the exact location of money allocated by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport which made an announcement last week. I draw the attention of the Minister to other areas. He mentioned Appendix 1. The biggest Department receiving funds from the national lottery appears to be the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the biggest area is housing, probably comprising grants for elderly people and what used to be known as disabled person's grants, community facilities in housing projects and support for community and voluntary organisations. In the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht a lot of money goes to An Comhairle Ealaíon. Further amounts go through the HSE. Youth organisations receive approximately €50 million through the Department of Children and Youth Affairs. In these cases what we see are lump sums. The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government cannot state to which housing projects the money was allocated. It can state 20 housing projects were part-funded but not how much went where.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	3	I looked at the subheads on foot of the question asked. The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government includes an allocation of €38.6 million under subhead A.7 - private housing grants. They include the housing adaption grants for people with a disability. This scheme provides grants of up to €30,000 to assist people with a disability in having necessary adaptation and improvement works carried out. Money is provided for the housing aid for older persons scheme, under which grants of up to €8,000 are provided for older people living in poor housing accommodation to have refurbishment or improvement works carried out. The mobility aid grants scheme is also supported from the subhead. It is available to fast-track grants of up to €6,000 to provide for basic works to address mobility problems, including the provision of grips, rails and ramps. I hear what the Deputy is saying about how much of it is lotto money and voted expenditure. I will speak to line Departments to seek greater clarity in the published accounts at the end of the year.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	4	I am pleased that the Minister sees the point I am making. I have been following this matter for some time and raised it at the meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts last week. The Comptroller and Auditor General agreed with my point that there was a lack of traceability and stated he could not trace the money because there was no mechanism in place in some line Departments. Members of the public do not realise that grants for disabled people and the mobility aid grants scheme depend on their playing the lotto. It should not be the case that they are dependent on lottery sales. Now that the Minister has privatised the national lottery, it is important that people know where the proportion of money from the national lottery for good causes is spent. This link has been broken and must be re-established.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	5	We have not privatised the national lottery. After the end of the year it will be run by a consortium which includes An Post, the organisation which has always run it and a prime mover in the consortium. The Deputy is right on the issue of transparency. We need to know where the lotto money is going and this is done. We need to have even more transparency and I am happy to address the issue. We know that all of the money is expended on the right things and we want to generate as big a surplus as we can. This year it will be approximately €200 million, in line with the figure in recent years. We top it up to support specific areas in which very important works are undertaken, particularly in recent years when they were under pressure. Nobody who buys a lotto ticket would begrudge elderly people mobility aid grants, ramps or other aids in being a beneficiary of their taking a punt.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	6	My question relates to the forthcoming budget which is only three months away. We are coming to the end of this Dáil session and I would like the Minister to set out the extent of cuts he envisages in the forthcoming budget. Will he set out where the Department is at in budgetary planning?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	7	The Government's fiscal target for 2015 has been well signalled. It is to bring the general Government deficit below 3% of GDP, in line with the commitments made by the country under the excessive deficit procedure. The budget to which the Government will agree in October will be designed to meet that target and will reflect the up-to-date economic and fiscal outlook. The Deputy will be aware that the most recent official budgetary estimates are contained in the stability programme update published in April. At the time it was estimated that a consolidation package of €2 billion would be necessary next year to deliver a deficit of 2.9% of GDP. There have since been some positive developments which have been welcomed by all. The Exchequer returns for the first half of the year represent a solid performance in terms of tax and expenditure. Tax revenues are growing and, in overall terms, expenditure on public services is within the budget parameters set out last year. Last week the Central Statistics Office announced an upward revision of the level of GDP for last year. This will have a favourable impact on our deficit-to-GDP ratio for this year and next. The GDP growth reported for the first quarter of the year is also encouraging. We expect all of this to ease the level of fiscal adjustment needed to meet our 2015 deficit target. The precise impact is being assessed and will form a critical element of the Government's announcements on budget day.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	8	I am sure the Minister is aware of the impact the recent series of austerity budgets has had on service levels and on people's capacity to spend, plan and budget for their own households and lives. It seems from the soundings from the new Tánaiste and leader of the Labour Party, whom I congratulate on her new positions, that she is also aware of this. While I appreciate that the Minister cannot provide exact figures, I find it hard to believe that a matter of weeks away from the budget, he cannot give us some sense of the magnitude of the cutbacks that are envisaged. I welcome his statement that a €2 billion cutback might not be necessary, but I would like him to go much further than that by providing some specific details and assuring the House that further cutbacks will not be made in areas such as health and education and that people who rely on social welfare payments and have fixed incomes will not lose out.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	9	Every decision that was made in advance of the budgets of the last three years, as delivered by the Minister, Deputy Noonan, and me, was aimed at repairing an economy that was calamitously broken. Objectively, we have done a good job in building a sustainable platform for future expenditure and the future well-being of the Irish people. On each occasion, we made decisions that were the least worst options available and would have the least worst impact on the most vulnerable people. We have done that by protecting core social welfare rates, for example. I am glad that these determined and difficult decisions have led us to have a platform now. As I am not a fortune teller, I do not know what will happen in the next number of months. However, I am confident that we will not require budgetary adjustments of anything like the order specified in the most recent medium-term economic forecast to reach the target of a deficit-to-GDP ratio of less than 3% of GDP. We will spell out the details of that when all the data is available towards the budget day in October.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	10	The Minister is certainly not a fortune teller, but he is the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. His Government colleagues, including the Minister for Finance, might believe him when he says "objectively, we have done a good job" of protecting the most vulnerable people in society, but that is not the experience on the ground. The budgets that have been delivered by this Government so far have impoverished sections of the community. Many people have been left with no option other than to leave by boarding the emigrant planes to Sydney, the United States and further afield. I welcome the Minister's assertion that the overall level of cuts will not be of the order of €2 billion. Reading between the lines, the Minister is insinuating that it will be much less. Does that mean the proposed adjustment will be halved? I would like the Minister to be more specific, because people deserve some level of certainty in their lives as they plan their budgets heading into the autumn. I remind the House that this should not just be a case of scaling back the cutback agenda. An effort has to be made to begin to repair the damage that the Minister and his colleagues have inflicted on families and low-income workers in the succession of budgets over which they have stood.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	11	Rather than responding to the views of the Deputy, who has been far from objective from the beginning, I will leave it to a more objective person to make a determination on whether our budgetary strategy has been successful.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	12	Is the Minister referring to someone like the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	13	If we had followed the path recommended by the Deputy's party leader, which involved defaulting on our debts, we would be in a worse position than Argentina is in 20 years after its default. Our people would be impoverished, we would have no inward investment and it would be impossible for this country to borrow money anywhere at anything like reasonable rates of interest. It is interesting to note that our ten-year bond yield yesterday was 2.3%, which is below the capacity of Britain to borrow money. I think that is a testament to how far we have brought the country in the last three years. The Deputy is right when she says that many people are desperately squeezed. We know that. We want to give as much support, help and money back to people as is possible, consistent with our determination to have a sustainable platform on which this country can thrive into the future.
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	14	This question fits in very well with the conversation we have just had. Last October, I joined members of the equality budgeting campaign in making a submission to the Minister, Deputy Noonan, on whether equality budgeting could be incorporated into this country's budgetary process. He suggested that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is responsible for this area. At its simplest, we are looking for an analysis that would answer the question, which has just been discussed by the Minister and Deputy McDonald, of who gets hit the hardest in any proposed budget. Does the Minister believe any of the components of equality budgeting can be incorporated into this year's budgetary process? If the Dáil were to be given a distributional analysis by income, gender and age on budget day, in addition to the budget proposed by the Cabinet, I think it would be a great success because it would allow us to see who is being asked to carry the burden.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	15	As I indicated in response to the previous question, the primary objective of recent budgets has been to restore stability to the public finances.  In this context, it has been of vital importance to every member of the Government to spread the burden of adjustment in as fair and as equitable a manner as possible to protect the most vulnerable people in society and stimulate economic growth and jobs-rich recovery. As the Deputy knows, expenditure on health, education and social protection accounts for over 80% of gross voted current expenditure. In implementing the budgetary adjustments required to achieve a successful exit from the troika programme, the Government has sought to protect front-line spending in these areas. We have allocated €19.6 billion to the Department of Social Protection in 2014. In allocating this amount, we have maintained the primary weekly rates of social welfare payments since this Government took office. Similarly, in the area of education, the Government has sought to protect funding in respect of DEIS resources. This funding is provided in addition to the normal funds allocated to tackle educational disadvantage by prioritising the educational needs of children and young people from disadvantaged communities from preschool right through second level education. As the Deputy is aware, there have been a number of reforms to the budgetary process at national and EU levels. These reforms can assist the Oireachtas and the Deputy in timely consideration of the Government's expenditure plans. In line with the new budgetary timetable, a Revised Estimates Volume was published on 18 December last. This new timetable allows for earlier consideration of the Estimates by each relevant line committee of the Oireachtas.  The Revised Estimates Volume has been expanded so that each Department and office now reports on key performance indicators that are relevant to its area of operation.  The purpose of this is to show what services are being purchased with voted moneys and the impact of these services on Irish citizens and Irish society in general.
Additional information not given on the floor of the House
 When making Government decisions on budget matters, the Government is aware of gender equality issues, people experiencing or at risk of poverty or social exclusion and people with disabilities. Expenditure measures and policy proposals are being submitted to my Department as part of the second comprehensive review of expenditure.  The final proposals will be carefully considered by the Government in advance of finalising the 2015 Estimates. On budget day, in relation to distributional analysis, the Government will publish illustrative cases showing the effect of major changes in revenue and certain social welfare payments.
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	16	I have to say, with respect to whoever drafted the Minister's response, that it does not address the question I asked in any way. I asked whether a distributional analysis clarifying who is being asked to bear the highest burden will be provided by the Ministers, Deputies Howlin and Noonan, and their Cabinet colleagues when they come in here on budget day to propose a draft budget to the Dáil for its consideration. I am aware that the Labour Party espouses a budgetary approach that asks those who have the least to carry the least burden. The problem is that the latest analysis, which came months after we had to vote on the budget, suggests that the last few budgets have been regressive and those who have the least have been asked to bear the highest burden. The analysis I am calling for is becoming common practice around the world. It has been successfully implemented in Scotland. I propose that a distributional analysis, setting out how each of the income deciles, each of the two genders and each of the age groups would be affected by the budget if it were to be voted through, should be brought to the Dáil for its consideration. That would put the Dáil and the public in a better position to examine and query the budget proposal being made.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	17	I approve, read and alter all answers I deliver here. They are not prepared in some way externally.I am responsible for all answers I give here. To answer this particular question, one cannot take one budget in isolation, particularly in times of crisis; nor can one compare the three budgets we have had, which have been crisis budgets designed to rescue us from disaster, to a normal budgetary cycle. That is why I explained to the Deputy that we have changed the whole mechanism for doing budgets by asking each committee, through the new line Department system, to do the work and to call in the Secretaries General well in advance of the budget. They should do so now, before the budget is announced in October, and look at the comprehensive review of expenditure and at all the options. I suggest that the committees drill down into the options and make recommendations. We will provide as much data to the committee system as Deputies require.
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	18	I acknowledge that the budgetary process has significantly improved, certainly in the three years since I have been in the Dáil. However, I ask that the Minister answer the specific question because it would be incredibly useful both for public consideration and for Dáil Éireann's consideration. Of course crisis budgets are different from steady-state budgets. None the less, it is probably more important in a crisis than at any other time, because very tough decisions are being made, to know if particular groups - whether males, females, different age groups or people along the income spectrum - are being asked to carry a disproportionate share of the pain of the correction. Some of the budgets since the crisis have been unbalanced in asking certain groups, particularly lower-income groups and especially sub-groups such as lone parents, to bear an unreasonable share of the correction. It would be an incredibly healthy thing for parliamentary democracy and for the socioeconomic effects of the budgets if we knew on the day the budget was released the proposed distribution of the pain of the correction.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	19	I have answered the question a couple of times but I will do so again. One cannot look at each budget, particularly a series of crisis budgets, in isolation. One must look at the cumulative effect of budgets. For example, the analysis done by some looks at all taxation increases as being progressive, even if one has reached the very highest marginal rate of taxation in comparison with any other OECD country - in other words, if one increases taxation, that is progress, and if one reduces expenditure, it is regressive. We need to have a realistic model to see what levels of taxation are appropriate and what types of taxation are appropriate. That is the sort of drilling down that is required, rather than a crude graph system about which the Deputy is talking. I would have thought that somebody of the calibre of the Deputy would be developing those systems and making the new committee system work, calling in the key officials in line Departments to test those theories and to ensure, for example, that our progressive taxation system, by comparison with any country in the OECD, is maintained. I disagree with the notion that any category of social welfare recipient was subjected to a disproportionate impact, because we worked with all our might and main to protect social welfare spending, as the Deputy knows. That is a fact. If the Deputy reads any of the commentary from the external overseers in the troika, he will see that they comment on our very high levels of social welfare provision, which we were determined to maintain and which I am proud that we protected.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	20	I wish to ask the Minister what procedures are currently in place to ensure recipients of State contracts abide by all relevant laws and regulations in regard to income tax, social welfare and health and safety rules and to ensure that this applies also to subcontractors on various projects.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	21	Public procurement procedures require all applicants to meet specified standards when applying for public contracts. In this regard, applicants are required to make signed declarations in respect of their financial standing, their legal standing and their payment of taxes and social contributions. The criteria on which contracting authorities may exclude applicants from the award procedure of public contracts are set out in public procurement regulations and directives. Before an applicant is excluded, the applicant may make a case and provide supporting evidence as to why it should not be excluded. The contracting authority must consider this evidence. It is a condition of the award of public contracts above €10,000 that the successful applicant either provide to a contracting authority a current tax clearance certificate or demonstrate a satisfactory level of subcontractor tax compliance in the case of the construction, forestry or meat processing sectors, which are subject to relevant contracts tax. The same tax clearance requirement applies to any non-resident contractor being awarded a public contract.  In regard to public works, there is a substantial body of legislation that directly or indirectly governs construction activities. However, two key pieces of industry-specific legislation - the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Construction) Regulations 2013 and the Building Control Regulations 1997 to 2014 - place considerable responsibility not only on contractors but on all those involved in construction projects. The ultimate sanction for a serious breach of health and safety regulations is a criminal conviction and imprisonment. In regard to the contract documents, clause 2 of the standard form of public works contracts requires the contractor and his personnel to comply with all legal requirements. In addition, the works requirements, which are a key part of the contract documents, set out detailed specifications on how regulatory standards are to be met. The management of the tendering process for a public contract is a matter for each contracting authority. It is the responsibility of each contracting authority to ensure that tenderers comply with all the requirements of the process.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	22	I thank the Minister for his reply. What he said is fine, but it does not address the issue to which I refer. The Minister spoke about people applying for contracts, the conditions for contracts, producing tax clearance certificates and the responsibilities on contractors and the contracting authority to ensure people tender properly. We all take that as read, and everybody agrees with that, but what measures are in place to ensure they actually abide by the above? I listened to the Minister's reply but there was no mention of anybody at public level looking after the taxpayers' interests to ensure the contractors abide by the conditions they are meant to abide by. I will give two examples. Approximately €3 billion is to be spent on capital projects this year. The biggest areas are roads and schools. I have said in the House previously that I know of schools, which I have reported, where subcontractors on-site bus people to sign on every Thursday morning and then bus them back to continue working. I said to the Secretary General of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport at the Committee of Public Accounts last Thursday that, as we speak, some of subcontractors on the largest road projects, contracted by the National Roads Authority under public private partnership, are telling people who want to work that they must be on the dole and that they will not employ them if they are not in receipt of a jobseeker's payment because they do not want to pay them the full rate. If they want a job, those people must sign on. However, they risk prosecution and they cannot make PRSI contributions so their records will be diminished as a result.  The Minister should put measures in place for on-site inspections by the Department of Social Protection, the Revenue Commissioners and the Health and Safety Authority to ensure people on these sites are officially there.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	23	I must say I am taken aback by the charges the Deputy has made. It is a legal responsibility for each contracting authority to comply with the law and to ensure contracts are fully compliant with the law. In the case of roads, it is a matter for the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the National Roads Authority, while in the case of schools it is a matter for the Department of Education and Skills. The Deputy said he raised these matters with the Accounting Officer in each of those Departments. If he sends me the details, I will ensure they are acted on.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	24	I thank the Minister and I accept that. I have been told by workers that they do not want their names mentioned. One can understand that because they appreciate the work when they get it. There should be an inspection mechanism across the public service to ensure on-site inspections of capital projects by the Department of Social Protection. Workers have reported some of these sites and sometimes the contractors have been fined two years after the contract is completed, but a fat lot of good that is as workers have lost their jobs in the meantime for protesting at the gate that they could not get legitimate work. This is an ongoing issue. There should be inspections of the PRSI record of every worker on every major State contract.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	25	It is a matter of legal compliance. Contractors have to sign statutory declarations. There is a legal consequence which would make them subject not only to action but to debarment from public contracts should the matters the Deputy set out be proved to be true. If they Deputy sends me the details, I will ensure the line Departments act on them. I do not think it is up to me to have another set of measures.For example, in the area of health and safety, it is clear there are organisations to carry out site inspections and so on and the same applies in respect of social welfare, where there are social welfare inspectors. However, if the Deputy provides me with details, I will ensure any specific case or suspicion he may have will be investigated fully.
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	26	This question pertains to health care, in which the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has become more involved. It really is an attempt to solve something that has puzzled me for many years. Members are aware there have been significant cuts in health care that have come at great pain to many people. While Ireland's health care expenditure per capita is approximately halfway up the OECD tables, we have one of the youngest populations and research by the National Competitiveness Council shows that when one adjusts for that young population, Ireland has the second-highest health care spend per capita in the OECD, next to the United States. However, as everyone is aware, Ireland's health care outcomes are not second highest. Consequently, in spite of all the pain that has been felt in trying to get on top of the health care budget, Ireland still is spending more per capita, when one adjusts for the young population, than anybody except the United States but is not getting the health care outcomes. There is plenty of external analysis from the OECD and others to suggest that a changed model of health care provision and expenditure could save billions, while improving the level of service delivery. My question is whether the Minister has commissioned an independent report that has gone into the wiring of the Health Service Executive, HSE, to ascertain whether things could be done fundamentally differently.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	27	I have not commissioned any independent analysis on potential savings in the health sector since March 2011. That would be a matter for the Minister for Health, as the Government has line Departments with line Ministers responsible for their own areas. In terms of analysis, a comprehensive review of expenditure was carried out during 2011 and was published in December 2011 in conjunction with the 2012 budget. In my budget speech in October 2013, I announced a second comprehensive review of expenditure, the objective of which will be for each Minister and each Department to examine and propose measures that will contribute to the overall expenditure target set out by the Government for each of the next three years. This review also will expand on the existing analysis carried out by Departments and my Department since 2011. The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform will co-ordinate the review process and will produce the final comprehensive report alongside the budget documents for next year. In addition, a separate review of capital expenditure is under way that will set out the capital envelope for the next five years. In January 2014, I published the Government's second Public Service Reform Plan 2014-2016. This sets out, at a high level, the key priorities and objectives in the main public services, including health. As set out in the reform plan, there are significant and administrative reforms such as usage of additional hours, as well as areas of reform of overtime pay, premium pay and all the rest. On health expenditure, I note that at present there almost is a given that health expenditure is being reduced greatly. Consequently, I should tell the Deputy that in the budgets introduced by the Government since 2011, the money given to the HSE has not fallen. There is a general commentary about expenditure cuts but the facts are different. Net expenditure from 2011 to 2013 for the HSE has increased by €72 million, not reduced. Total non-pay funding given to the HSE has increased by €407 million, not reduced and I can provide the hospital details to the Deputy as well. Consequently, the Deputy is correct that the Government needs to drill down to make sure it gets value for the enormous effort it has made to maintain expenditure in the health area.

I would love to get those figures, as the numbers I received from the Government show a fall from approximately €16 billion to approximately €13 billion for this year but perhaps I can get the numbers at which the Minister was looking. I have looked at the comprehensive review of expenditure, which in the first instance is an internal document, that is, it is the HSE trying to fix itself from a health expenditure perspective, which-----
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	29	It has the knowledge.
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	30	Actually, I do not believe the HSE has the knowledge. I believe that what it has been asked to do and has tried to do is to make incremental savings, namely, to cut a bit here and there and to try to be a bit more efficient here and there. However, I do not believe the HSE has the knowledge to examine the current health care system and conclude that the manner in which health care in Ireland is delivered - which is a hospital-based system rather than a community-based system - is not the best for the patient and costs far more money than it needs to do. The Minister stated that his Department has not commissioned any report. He might know, because it is relevant to public expenditure, whether an external report has been commissioned that examines both health care delivery in Ireland and the HSE and concludes that in fact, a shed load of money can be saved by, for example, moving from acute to community-based care, while at the same time improving health care outcomes for the patient. I believe this would be a great opportunity and even if the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has not done so, is the Minister aware of any report of this kind? If not, does the Minister think there might be a great opportunity to commission one?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	31	Most of these questions would be more appropriately directed to the Minister for Health, because an enormous reform agenda is under way. This is because the structure that was put in place, which basically built the superstructure of the HSE on top of the old health boards, simply has not worked and has been extraordinarily top-heavy and to disentangle it involves a huge body of work. Were the Deputy to ask me for my personal view, there is an enormous amount of focus on structural change and the Deputy has suggested further structural change. However, I believe we must do what we were doing particularly well. There is a move from acute care to a greater focus on primary care and the Government is providing the resources for that. However, I will provide specific figures to the Deputy and might forward them to him in writing, rather than expecting him to take them down now. For clarity, total HSE expenditure fell by €19 million between 2011 and 2013. In 2011, it was €13.903 billion and at the end of 2013, it was €13.884 billion.
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	32	I thank the Minister. As I see it, having worked in health care abroad, there is an opportunity here. I have asked some of the most senior people in the HSE to show me the plan or document that sets out how health care delivery should be with regard to primary care centres, community-based teams, home care, respite care and all that good stuff, that sets out what it looks like today, which is an acute-based model, and which sets out how the transition will be made from the model that obtains today to the model we need. That document and thinking have not been done. While primary care centres are opening, which is welcome, and while some valuable things are being done, I put it to the Minister that there is an enormous opportunity for the country for someone to come along - such as the Minister alone or in conjunction with the Minister for Health because this is both a health care and an expenditure issue - to acknowledge we do not have a whole-Ireland strategic view. This was done in Northern Ireland three or four years ago, which now has a strategy that states this is what its desired health care system looks like and this is how it will get there. We do not have one of those and as a final point, I suggest the Minister might consult with the Minister for Health, because I believe this issue crosses both Departments, to ascertain whether experts should be brought in and whether that sort of strategic planning and thinking should be put together.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	33	All these questions are appropriate for the Minister for Health and not for me. While I obviously must mind the money and make sure the Government gets value for money, specific policy issues regarding the Department of Health come to the Government from the Minister for Health. However, there is a Cabinet sub-committee on health at which these matters are thrashed out clearly. There is a strategic view and plan and the Government is moving from over-dependence on acute hospital provision to the development of effective primary care provision. However, all these matters can be spelt out by the Minister for Health and the best way to so do probably is at a committee, where one has time to interact and bring along officials from both the HSE and the Department of Health for the discussion.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	34	Is the Minister personally involved in the review of the free travel pass scheme, the cost thereof and how it is implemented? Does the Minister support a cutback to that scheme and a reduction in the amount that is provided by the taxpayer, primarily to elderly people to enable them to use their daily bus and train pass?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	35	In March 2012, the Ministers for Social Protection and Transport, Tourism and Sport agreed to establish an interdepartmental working group to examine and report on the operation and future development of the free travel scheme. The review has been led by the Department of Social Protection but also comprised officials from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the National Transport Authority and my Department.The terms of reference included the objectives of the scheme, eligibility, the extent of service provided, data on usage of the scheme, fraud and control measures and the interaction between stakeholders in the scheme. As part of the review, meetings have been held with elderly people, carers, people with disabilities and transport operators. It is expected that the review will be concluded in the coming weeks and considered by the Government in the normal course. The Tánaiste and Minister for Social Protection has indicated her endorsement of the scheme in recent days. Under the terms of the national recovery plan 2011 to 2014, introduced by the previous Government, expenditure on the free travel scheme has been capped at the 2010 allocation of €77 million per annum, reflecting the tight budgetary constraints in which we are operating.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	36	Now that the national recovery plan has concluded and the troika has left, the Minister is not bound by the €77 million cap. Will he give a commitment that the allocation will not be reduced, now that he is actually free to reduce it?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	37	I am free not to reduce it.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	38	The Minister referred to data on usage of the scheme. Payments to the various contractors have been set for several years. Will he take into account the fact that some of them, including the main State provider, Bus Éireann, have cut some of their routes? Bus Éireann’s Expressway routes, for example, in many constituencies, including the Minister’s, now bypass towns and use motorways instead. Several thousand people who had access to these services can no longer avail of them because they are no longer in place. While the operator has cut services, it is still receiving the full payment under the scheme. In recent days some private operators in County Donegal have spoken about not accepting the bus pass on some of their routes and withdrawing from the scheme because of the conditions the Minister has attached to it. Will the Minister ensure services are maintained and that people will have an entitlement to use their bus pass on all bus routes?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	39	The Deputy is making a compelling case for the review under way. We need to examine all of the elements to which he referred. What is provided? Is it value for money for the State? Is there fraud? Is the scheme being availed of by the people who need it? Are they utilising it to the full? These are the questions that will be answered in the review which will be published once it is concluded. We want to maintain services. The Deputy has raised questions about routes which are more appropriate to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport. I have no control over the routes operated by Bus Éireann or any other service provider.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	40	Yes, but the Minister is part of the review which is examining usage data which include information on routes. I know it will be up to the line Department to make these decisions, but the Minister is part of the review. If he allocates €77 million to a scheme each budget day, he is entitled to know what services are being provided. Services have been reduced, but the Minister is still paying the same amount. Service providers need to be spoken to about this, especially in some of the rural areas where there may not be a train service and people rely on the bus system. This is a wider issue because of the problem of rural isolation. The National Transport Authority does not have the funding to provide local subsidised transport routes in areas where there are no major commercial services operating. This needs to be taken into account because the emphasis in the case of some of the bus companies is on moving people from city to city at the expense of those in provincial towns and rural areas.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	41	The Deputy has made some valid points well. I hope all of these issues will be addressed in the review being led by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport. I do not know if the Deputy is involved on the transport committee, but he might well attend it to have a full and robust debate on this issue. Perhaps the individual service providers might be asked to attend the committee once the details are presented.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	42	A new public service sick leave scheme was introduced earlier this year. The Minister had the power to change regulations under that scheme. This question relates specifically to the changes in the treatment of pregnancy-related sick leave which I believe is particularly discriminatory against women because a difficult pregnancy could see a woman eating up her entire allowance and, as a result, not being able to avail of sick leave later on without incurring a significant financial penalty. Will the Minister revise this aspect of the new arrangements?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	43	The legal position on the treatment of pregnancy-related illness, in particular the issue raised in the Deputy's question, is set out in a European Court of Justice ruling in the McKenna case. This case addressed, inter alia, the counting of sick leave for pregnancy-related illness. The court considered it was not discriminatory for pregnancy-related absences to be offset against the maximum number of days of paid sick leave to which a female employee was entitled. However, it also confirmed that, although it was not discriminatory to count the number of pregnancy-related sick leave days, a woman should still have access to the minimum payment she would have received if she had not suffered a pregnancy-related illness. In accordance with this, the new sick leave scheme provides that any pregnancy-related absence for which a female employee has been paid at the half rate will not count towards her paid sick leave limits. Pregnancy-related illnesses are also discounted in consideration for promotion and higher duty allowances. In addition, consistent with the judgment, the new sick leave scheme provides that a female employee who suffers from a pregnancy-related illness will be covered by the same sick leave provisions as other employees and will also have additional protections afforded to her in order that her pay does not fall below a certain level. In these ways, the public service sick leave scheme recognises the distinct position of the pregnant worker and makes provision for the protection of the health and welfare of such workers. The new scheme not only implements the principles of European law in the non-discrimination against pregnant workers, it also provides additional support in the context of the new critical illness protocol. While I am keeping the new sick leave scheme under constant review, I do not intend to revise it at this early stage until I have seen how it works in practice. I have, however, committed to undertaking a formal review of the new scheme after a full year of its operation to ensure any adjustment necessary to enhance the operation of the scheme may be made. I will consider all issues raised in the course of the year as part of that review and any anomaly or unforeseen implication of the scheme will be addressed.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	44	I am glad that there will be a review which I take it will take place in March 2015. I appreciate that there are health and safety implications and that a pregnant woman can avail of extra entitlements. The problem arises in cases in which sick leave eats into a pregnant woman’s entitlements, but later on, when she is not pregnant, she cannot avail of sick leave because her entitlement has been used up. It is precisely the people who may not have a poor record in taking sick leave who may encounter a difficult pregnancy which eats up their sick leave and who are the ones being afflicted. It has caused significant stress across the public sector. For example, I have received correspondence from a young mother in my area who had to go back to work because of the fear that her pay would be docked. Like many young couples, she is in negative equity. She has made the point that in the 12 years of her working life as a teacher she had never missed a day until she experienced a difficult pregnancy. Owing to a virus among pupils in her school, her doctor told her to stay off work for four weeks because it posed a danger to her baby. The virus returned to the school and she missed another two weeks. She also had another difficulty which meant a stay in hospital. Suddenly, one can see how her sick leave entitlement was used up. She was literally crying in writing to me. Another teacher sent me an e-mail from her hospital bed about not being able to avail of sick leave. That is where the problem lies and the issue needs to be addressed.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	45	Pregnancy is not an illness. Obviously, people are entitled to maternity leave. If there are illnesses associated with pregnancy, they are, as I indicated, treated in a special way. The Deputy is saying someone who has a pregnancy-related illness is anxious that she might be ill for another reason later after the pregnancy. We can address when that might happen as opposed to being anxious that they are clocking up days. Pregnancy-related illness was never fully discounted in sick leave arrangements. We have looked carefully at what the European Court of Justice has stated.We are applying best international practice to it. Ours is not only equivalent to but as good as any sick leave arrangement we have studied. We will see how this pans out. I do not think that women who are pregnant and are out of work with pregnancy-related illnesses should be anxious that somehow they might get ill again and that it might impact on them. 
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	46	It is okay to say that but they are very worried because of the reduced sick leave allowance. That example I quoted means that young woman’s entire sick leave has been eaten up through this pregnancy. She will not get that sick leave back because she had not used up her sick leave before that. For the next four years she will not be entitled to paid sick leave. That is the worry. Many public sector workers have taken huge hits in their wages and the prospect of going on to half pay or no pay for a couple of days or a week or two is seriously worrying. People are taking risks, like the woman who was advised for the benefit of her pregnancy not to go to work, which she could have done otherwise. I know of another woman who said she could not afford to go on half pay as she had substantial rent and bills to pay every month. She said she was admitted to hospital with suspected pre-eclampsia and was so angry she was writing the e-mail from her hospital bed. Others have repeated that experience. That is the anomaly that needs to be worked out. It is okay to say people should not stress about it but they are stressed because they are already on the breadline.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	47	I do not understand that particular issues would arise. Although I do not know the details of the case or the particular illnesses of the person the Deputy describes but somebody encompassed by the critical illness process has access to 12 months of paid leave on exactly the same basis as on the previous scheme, that is, 364 days of fully paid leave in a rolling year followed by six months, 182 days, on half pay. I do not know how long somebody might be ill but the notion that someone would be out for more than a year and a half in a four year period and expect to be fully paid does not fit international norms. There is an understanding that if one is ill one cannot work and in a normal employment, in the private sector, one is supported as long as possible but there is an understanding but there is a limit to the time when somebody is out on full pay.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	49	In setting budgetary allocations, the Government balances the requirements of bringing sustainability to the public finances, promoting and supporting economic recovery and protecting the most vulnerable in society.   The Government's overall fiscal target for next year is to reduce the general Government deficit to below 3% of GDP by the end of 2015. The scale of the adjustment required to meet this target will be decided by Government in the context of the budget, based on the most up-to-date economic and fiscal data at that time. In this regard, the most recent economic information is very encouraging. I announced at budget time that our second three-yearly comprehensive review of expenditure would be carried out this year. This review is under way and will be a focused examination of expenditure by all Departments, taking account of Government spending priorities in order to identify areas of potential savings and efficiencies.  In parallel, a separate review of capital expenditure is also being conducted with a view to realigning future investment priorities and to reset the medium-term capital envelopes for the next five years.  Targeting capital investment on projects with a high employment content can benefit local economies throughout the State. To this end, since July 2012, I have made a series of announcements in relation to additional capital investment as part of a stimulus package. These projects are spread around the country in order to create economic activity and jobs on a regional basis. Public service reform has been a key element of the Government's strategic response to the economic crisis and is a central theme in the programme for Government. The Public Service Reform Plan 2014-2016, published in January this year, contains a detailed action plan with clear timelines. Public procurement is a key area of reform. In carrying out reforms in this area, the Government is committed to ensuring that SMEs are encouraged to participate in procurement and to maximising the social benefits, such as employment and training opportunities, that can be delivered under public contracts. The implementation of measures in the public service reform plan relating to SME access to public procurement will, I am determined, facilitate growth.

To what extent is the Minister prepared to consider areas that might show potential for easing the burden on the domestic economy but at the same time maintaining the targets already set and committed to?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	51	The Deputy has quite rightly encapsulated Government policy, which is to ensure we have restored the economic fortunes of the State to have a sustainable platform into the future that will attract inward investment, which we have seen in spades, with more inward investment in the past year than we have seen for a very long time. There is a jobs dividend from that, which will allow the domestic economy to recover. That is one of the most challenging next phases. We have been using whatever resources we can get our hands on, including investment from the European Investment Bank and others to have direct stimulus across the country in specific projects. We now will examine the greatly improved economic platform we have built to ensure that we have a budget introduced next year that will, I hope, not only build on the economic progress we have achieved and maintain it but will also give relief to people who are really pressed by some of the decisions that were necessary through the economic crisis.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	52	This subject has already been discussed. I am surprised the questions were not grouped. The kernel of this problem is that it seems strange to me that if it is not discriminatory to women given that men are not in as vulnerable a position-----
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	53	They do not get pregnant.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	54	The Minister says that if there is a critical illness protocol in place they could be taken care of if they contract a serious illness later. If they get the flu or some other sickness but are not in hospital for two weeks surely they will be in a very difficult position because of this arrangement. Has the Minister considered introducing more flexible work practices which could address part of the problem?
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	55	There is no grouping of questions at the moment. Each Deputy gets a reply from the line Minister.

#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	57	Yes at the moment. The Ceann Comhairle decided on that.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	58	Everybody gets their own outing now, even if it is the same question.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	59	Everybody’s question is replied to by the line Minister.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	60	The need to protect and support women during pregnancy and ensure that they are not discriminated against is a priority strongly reflected in the design of the new public service sick leave scheme.  We brought this to the Labour Court and specifically asked it to consider additional protection for women. The new scheme operates strictly in accordance with the European Court of Justice ruling which establishes what constitutes, and perhaps more specifically what does not constitute, discrimination in relation to the application of any sick leave provision.  Where a female employee goes sick with a pregnancy-related illness she will be treated the same as another employee until such time as she has exhausted her sick leave. At that point she will be given extra protection beyond what other employees would ordinarily get because she will not go below half pay for as long as she has a pregnancy-related illness.Also reflecting the principles of EU law, the new sick leave scheme provides that any pregnancy-related absence for which a female employee has been paid at the half-rate will not count towards her overall sick leave limits - this is the four-year horizon instanced by Deputy Daly earlier - nor are any pregnancy-related illnesses counted in respect of eligibility for promotion and higher duty allowances. I would also draw the Deputy's attention to the extra protections in the critical illness protocol which allow for an increase in access to paid sick leave and, by agreement with the Labour Court, provide specifically for pregnancy-related illnesses. Where a pregnancy-related illness is serious, it will be covered by that protocol.  One of the criteria for awarding the protocol more generally is two consecutive weeks of hospitalisation. However, this requirement is reduced to two days for pregnancy-related illness in accordance with a determination of the Labour Court. I will provide the Deputy with the reference for that judgment.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	61	We are not complaining about the sick leave they get while they are pregnant but about the fact it has the potential to eat into their sick leave over the four-year period ahead. The Minister may be aware that a survey carried out in Norway found that three quarters of pregnant women took sick leave from work but that this can be reduced through flexible work adjustments. Overall, 35% of women cited fatigue and sleep problems as the main reason for taking sick leave, followed closely by pelvic girdle pain and nausea or vomiting, with 32% and 23% of women suffering these symptoms respectively. The study also looked at work adjustments for pregnant women and found 60% of the 2,197 women surveyed reported having adjustments made to their working situation. On average, these women reported taking seven days less sick leave than those who went without job adjustments. Does the Department have the potential to put in place a system where the employer is obliged to be more flexible with regard to pregnant women in order to deal with some of these problems?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	62	The Deputy makes a very valid point and it is something I will re-examine on foot of this discussion. It has always been a point in regard to the delivery of public services that we have the maximum flexibility to allow for normal family pressures, probably better than is done in the private sector. I acknowledge much pressure has been put on that in the past few years because we have asked people to work additional hours and so on because of the financial crisis we have gone through. However, as we work our way out of that, I believe we can look specifically at the point the Deputy makes in regard to pregnant women in the public service. It is something I will look at.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	63	It is not a simple subject. Am I right in suspecting there is a lack of information for people around this whole subject? Is this an area that could be improved?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	64	Again, I believe the Deputy is right. There are new sick leave arrangements which we have spent a year and a half discussing with the unions and bringing through the Labour Court, and it was in the Labour Court right up to the end of last year. We then enacted specific legislation which we brought through the Houses in this regard. However, there are probably many public sector workers who are not as familiar with it as people who have been involved in the legislative process here or who have followed closely the work of the Labour Court. There is probably a job of work for both trade unions and employers in the public sector to better explain entitlements. Again, that is a point I will look at.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	65	This is one of the issues we debated when the Minister was conceiving this scheme. No part of the Minister's answer resolves the issue that a pregnant worker would have, for example, if she falls ill, takes her sick leave and clocks up more or and more of the leave for which she is eligible, with consequences further down the line. It is a genuine concern. I hope the Minister will take account of this in the annual review because it is important to get it right. The Minister referred to the critical illness protocol a number of times as it would relate to a pregnant woman, and he mentioned the issue of two weeks hospitalisation as against two days hospitalisation. In the course of the debate, I specifically raised the issue with the Minister of postnatal depression because that would probably be the significant after-birth illness that would afflict many women, whereas it might not necessarily involve hospitalisation at all, much less for two days. Again in regard to the critical illness protocol, Deputy Daly mentioned somebody being hospitalised for pre-eclampsia. While that would not be regarded as a critical condition, it would be routinely screened for. I can understand how women workers of child bearing age would have real concerns in this area. It is critical it gets a very specific focus when the Minister reviews this in March.

I believe this will work out as a very fair scheme. We have specifically looked at the whole area of pregnancy-related illness as a unique set within the sick leave design generally. As I said in my first answer to Deputy Daly, when we have the review in 12 months time, we will probably have sufficient, if not an awful lot of, practical experience to look at any adjustments that might be necessary at that stage.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	68	Again, this overlaps with a question I answered earlier. Public procurement procedures require all applicants to meet certain standards when applying for public contracts.  In this regard, applicants are required to make declarations in regard to their financial standing, their legal standing and payment of taxes and social contributions.  The criteria upon which contracting authorities may exclude applicants from the award procedure of public contracts are set out in public procurement regulations and directives. Before an applicant is excluded, the applicant may make a case in mitigation and, as I said earlier, this must be considered by the contracting authority. It is a condition of award of all public contracts above €10,000 that the successful applicant provides to a contracting authority either a current tax clearance certificate or demonstrates a satisfactory level of subcontractor tax compliance in the case of the construction, forestry or meat processing sectors, which are subject to relevant contracts tax.  The same tax clearance requirement applies to all non-resident contractors being awarded a public contract.   The management of the tendering process for a public contract is a matter for each contracting authority.  It is the responsibility of each contracting authority to ensure that tenderers comply with all the requirements of the process.
#ThomasPringle	unknown-#ThomasPringle-party	unknown-#ThomasPringle-dob	unknown-#ThomasPringle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	69	It is during the tendering application process that they are required to show these proofs. However, what steps are available to bodies after the contractor has been appointed in terms of monitoring ongoing work, particularly in regard to the subcontracting of elements of the contract? I believe that, to a certain extent, a blind eye is turned to this because the awarding of contracts is generally on the most competitive price. Given the costs of doing business are lower outside this jurisdiction, it is very difficult for tendering companies resident here to be successful on price alone. Will the Minister expand on what role the public body can play after the tender has been awarded and while construction is ongoing in order to police this measure? I believe this needs to be stepped up.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	70	As I indicated earlier to Deputy Fleming, it is the legal responsibility of the contracting authority - if it is a school, the Department of Education and Skills, or if it is a road, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the NRA - to ensure that all legal requirements are complied with. The Deputy raised the case of subcontractors. In any public contract valued at greater than €10,000, inclusive of VAT, which is not a huge contract, it would be a condition of the award of the main contract that all subcontractors employed on the projects must produce a tax reference number where a payment exceeds €650.Records of tax reference numbers must be kept by the contractor and must be available for inspection by the Revenue Commissioners. Where payments exceed €2,600 in any 12-month period, the subcontractor is required to produce a current tax clearance certificate. Payments under a contract are at all times conditional on compliance with all the contract requirements set out.  The management of the tendering process is a matter for each contracting body. The Deputy has again instanced his concerns about some contracts. If he has concerns about non-compliance with normal legal requirements in respect of any contract awarded in this State, I would like to hear from him and I will ensure they are investigated.

For many years, contractors had to be compliant with the construction industry pension scheme. I do not know about national bodies, but local authorities turned a blind eye to it because they were getting the contractors at the most competitive price. I raised it with Donegal County Council a number of years ago. When it started forcing contractors to comply, companies registered one employee and got a letter of compliance from the Construction Industry Federation saying that they were part of a pension scheme, which got over the difficulty for them. It is an ongoing problem that needs to be looked at. For example, if an authority has had a difficulty with a contractor in the past, could it exclude the contractor from future contracts? Could it adopt that position and would it be defensible?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	72	The Deputy raised a number of questions. I will deal with the last one first. There are set criteria for excluding somebody from the tendering process but, obviously, fair procedure must apply, because excluding somebody from being able to apply for a public contract is a significant penalty and the contractor would have recourse to the courts to vindicate its rights to do that. I can forward the criteria for preventing a contractor from applying to the Deputy. In the past two years I have established the Office of Government Procurement because much general procurement in the public service happened in an ad hoc fashion. We now have a much clearer and more transparent procurement mechanism. I do not know which committee the Deputy is a member of, but if it is one that deals with procurement generally, it might be useful to have the new Government procurement officer explain the procedures and possibly answer questions about anything that needs to be tightened either in the contract documentation or in the contract monitoring that might be of use.

While some progress has been made, it has been very limited. One of the key recommendations in that report was that the OPW be given statutory authority to operate as the lead agency on the River Shannon and that all other organisations should directly consult with it in respect of the Shannon and seek its approval before they take any action. Could the Minister update us?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	74	I thank the Deputy for his question. The report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht on Shannon flooding dealt with and included recommendations on a number of issues within the areas of responsibilities of a range of Government Departments and State bodies. The OPW responded to the committee by way of a written reply in September 2012 in respect of the specific matters within the OPW's area of responsibility. The main area addressed in the reply related to the Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management, CFRAM, programme and how the OPW is addressing flood risk on the River Shannon in the context of that programme. The committee report was forwarded to the technical consultants undertaking the Shannon CFRAM study on behalf of the OPW for consideration in the context of the study. The OPW's core strategy for addressing flood risk in the Shannon basin is the River Shannon CFRAM study. I am advised that good progress continues to be made on the project. A total of 66 locations along the Shannon have been identified for further assessment under the study. The output of this important project will be an integrated plan of specific measures to address in a comprehensive and sustainable way the significant flood risk factors in the Shannon basin. Operational control of water flows and levels on the Shannon is the responsibility of both the ESB and Waterways Ireland. In order to address ongoing concerns that the existing water level control regime may be a contributory factor in early summer flooding in the Callows, these bodies have agreed a new interim control regime for the regulation of water levels. Under this interim regime, the ESB agreed to a trial lowering of the spring and early summer target levels in Lough Ree to reduce somewhat the risk of summer flooding, particularly in the Shannon Callows area. This trial commenced in summer 2013 and will remain in place until the publication of the Shannon CFRAM plan. Further information on the Shannon CFRAM study is available on the Shannon CFRAM study website.

My question concerns the Minister's comment about the pilot lowering of water levels on Lough Ree, something for which we have always argued. The fact that this has taken place is a welcome development, and I commend the former Minister of State, Brian Hayes, on taking the initiative in respect of that. However, the results of that investigation have not been published. Why is this the case? Why can we not see the impact this had last summer? Obviously, if it is remaining in place, it means there have been some positive results. Why has this become a further State secret?

#SeanSherlock	Labour	15190	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	81	I am very pleased to have had the opportunity to pilot this Bill through both the Seanad and the Dáil. I thank the Members of this House and the Seanad for their comments and what was a fruitful debate on the Bill during its passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas. The Bill is not designed to solve all the issues affecting the co-operative sector but to address a number of particular issues that have been identified by the sector as being areas of most pressing concern. I thank the co-operative sector, particularly the umbrella bodies - the Irish Co-operative Organisation Society, the National Association of Building Co-operatives and the National Federation of Group Water Schemes - as well as the Centre for Co-operative Studies, University College Cork. I also thank the other groups and individual contributors for their very positive engagement with the consultation process prior to the drafting of the Bill. I am confident that the co-operative sector will warmly welcome the reduction in the administrative burden placed on it and the flexibility offered by the revised arrangements for annual returns. I believe that this Bill, coupled with the very significant reduction in fees charged by the Registrar of Friendly Societies - which was introduced in 2012, the UN International Year of Co-operatives - will assist the development of the co-operative model as a distinct form of organisation, as committed to in the programme for Government. I also thank the officials in my Department who put a lot of work into putting the Bill together.

#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	91	I move amendment No. 3:In page 28, to delete lines 20 to 38, to delete pages 29 and 30, and in page 31, to delete lines 1 to 33.I support the creation of a new scheme, as proposed by Deputy Clare Daly, and the transfer of existing schemes to the new scheme to protect their conditions and standing, including the conditions of deferred members who have not even started to receive a pension. Amendment No. 15 in my name would provide for an appeals mechanism to ensure deferred members would not be impacted on disproportionately as a result of restructuring and to ensure such a mechanism would be established by regulations which would also outline the manner by which representatives of deferred members might be selected. Amendment No. 18 deals with the section describing a healthy company. It is proposed to insert a new section 32A in the Air Navigation and Transport (Amendment) Act 1998 which provides that a healthy company "shall not be allowed to close its pension scheme except where the scheme has reached a minimum 90 per cent funding standard". This would be fair. Section 32A(2) describes a healthy company as having positive net revenues or a parent company with positive net revenues. I support the other amendments also. I have been contacted by constituents and, in particular, one woman about deferred pensions. Her husband is aged 61 years and will draw a pension in four years. He has a pot of €25,000. Under the arrangements proposed, he will be at a disadvantage in a number of years when the pots are put together in the context of how the money will be distributed. Is it clear that deferred members will lose approximately half their pension in four years? If they were to take up their pensions now, they would lose 10%. Will the Minister clarify the position?

#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	94	No doubt, the Minister will move onwards to higher and better things. The legislation has been hugely important and stressful for many airport workers. It must be considered in the context of other issues and the backdrop to it, including the uncertainty and the vulnerability of people in facing their retirement years because of the mess that is the Irish airlines superannuation scheme, IASS. We disagree on the roots of it, but a number of issues must be raised again. If we are discussing what is supposed to be a solution that affects people in their retirement, we first have to identify the problem to establish whether we are dealing with it properly. However, we are looking at it the wrong way round. We appreciate, as do many of the pensioners, that on Committee Stage the Minister amended the provision giving the trustees the power to make decisions without the consent of scheme members. There is a little relief that this provision has been deleted, but it is still necessary to delete the section in its entirety, particularly where it impacts on the IASS. I will briefly recap the reasons.  There is a problem with the funding of the scheme, for which the overwhelming responsibility rests with the employers and their inability to adequately fund the scheme during the years and other managerial decisions they took which impacted and put a strain on the scheme, yet the people who are being asked to pay the price are the pensioners and existing workers in these companies. I am not the only one saying this. There is a great deal of evidence to support this position, not least the judgment of Mr. Justice Murphy in the High Court. He deemed the IASS to be a contingent creditor in Aer Lingus when the company tried to move some moneys. That court ruling states Aer Lingus owes the IASS €500 million, with a contingent liability of €475 million. That is only the Aer Lingus element. The company is delivering a much smaller amount to the scheme. Will the Minister comment on the fact that neither of the companies involved is putting money into the IASS? The scheme, therefore, is only receiving money from the pensioners who have retired. They are doing this while experiencing cuts to their benefits. The employers are not putting money into the scheme. They are putting money aside in a separate contingency fund to benefit deferred and active members in the event of future problems. This will be ring-fenced for them and there will be nothing for the pensioners who have retired.We should consider them because many of them contributed to a pension scheme for 40 years or more and were given a reasonable expectation that they would have a certain standard of living when they retired. The scheme was set by the actuary and the workers' contributions were increased approximately seven times during their working lives, while the employers' contributions were reduced approximately three times during the same period. Notwithstanding this, the proposal is that the pensioners will take a cut of approximately €40 per week initially and again in the new year and there is no fund to mitigate the losses. The money is not being put into the fund but a separate one, despite the fact that the people concerned paid for their full unco-ordinated pensions. The courts have deemed the employer liable to fund the scheme. The workforce had no choice; membership of the scheme was a condition of their employment. It is a bitter irony that those who worked for the Irish national carrier in the United Kingdom will have all if their benefits ring-fenced and secured and that the commitment made to them will be honoured because of how pensions are dealt with in Britain, while the Irish workers of the same airline will face an insecure future. It is galling for them, given that they had no choice but to make the contributions. It is an insult that the amendment proposes to give the trustees even more powers. One of the key reasons there is a problem with funding, for which the pensioners, deferred and active members are being asked to pay, is the appalling investment decisions made by the trustees. Although on Committee Stage the Minister said he was not interested in examining the issue and that it was a matter for the Department of Social Protection, it needs to be examined critically. The trustees made some ill-judged, ill-timed and, to put it mildly, peculiar decisions. Some €1.4 billion in assets were sold off as part of a freeze and de-risk strategy at a time when property portfolios were increasing. Essentially, they gave away a prime site on Molesworth Street which within ten months had increased in value by a further €10 million and generated an annual rental income of €6.5 million. One could not get such a portfolio anywhere in Dublin today, yet the IASS divested itself of it for very little and the pensioners are paying the price. The trustees invested the money from the sale of the assets in an Irish Life fixed income fund. They tied up hundreds of millions of euro with very low yield returns and invested the rest in sovereign bonds also with very low yield returns. There are many questions to be answered about this and if the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport is not interested, the Department of Social Protection should be. Jones Lang LaSalle, property adviser to the IASS, was also the selling agent for the property and the valuation agent for the company which bought it, IPUT. It was also located in one of the buildings of the proposed office redevelopment and, therefore, had a vested interest. Irish Life was the investment adviser to the IASS and one of the trustees was a former long-standing employee of Irish Life, in which the pension scheme invested more than half its funds. There are many questions to be answered. Last year it was reported that the investment adviser, Irish Life, received a weekly management fee of €20,000 which came from airport workers' pension contributions. We must examine this issue because it is a major cause of the problem and it is very risky to include provisions in the legislation linked with it. The deferred members believed they had no voice in the process and mobilised to give themselves one. Although it is welcome that the pot put aside for them has been increased marginally, it does not solve their problem. As Deputy Dessie Ellis said, it is believed long-standing members of the scheme will lose 50% to 60% of their expected pensions based on the fact that they will lose the unco-ordinated element which represents approximately one third of their expected benefits. Given that the average IASS pension was approximately €30,000, there are major implications for living standards. We must put the responsibility where it lies. In 2001 Aer Lingus employed 6,833 people. Some ten years later it had halved its workforce to 3,491. That came at a cost, which Aer Lingus had not calculated. It benefited from a very healthy and buoyant cash reserve financial position as a result of reducing its wage bill, but it has put the cost onto the pensions scheme. One of the reasons workers were enticed to give up their secure, permanent, pensionable jobs was the prospect that they would receive an unco-ordinated pension. While the company benefited from payroll savings, the employees are paying the price. Many of the deferred members were very upset by Minister's comments on Second Stage when he said the workers who had been enticed to retire early had received "generous exit packages" negotiated with their trade unions and that they should be taken into account. Workers believe they absolutely should not be taken into account and I agree with them. A severance payment results from managerial decisions in the company at the time and is irrelevant to a person's prospective pension. Taking it into account would have the effect of introducing means testing, which would be very disingenuous because it was an entitlement of the workers based on their contracts of employment. To include it in that way would be unacceptable. On Committee Stage, the Minister made some comments to justify the inclusion of the new section 34. He said it was necessary to facilitate people who were in the airport companies but not members of a pensions scheme. He also said it was necessary in order to allow people to cease their contributions to the scheme. When I said a rule change could have the same effect, the response was that a rule change would require all 15,000 members to agree and, therefore, would be impractical. However, this does not apply. The trustees and worker groups previously put forward rule changes which were rejected by the employer. Rule changes have happened. In 1975 there was a rule change which resulted in people increasing their contributions.In 1970, the scheme changed in terms of co-ordination with social welfare payments. At that time, workers were given the option of co-ordinating with the State pension. All new employees had to co-ordinate with the State pension, but if a worker was in employment before 1970, he or she had an option. That was a rule change which was capable of being implemented. It is not necessary, therefore, to secure the agreement of everybody. In this case, what is obvious is that the companies have chosen not to allow new employees to join the IAS scheme and have opted instead for new pension schemes with lesser entitlements. That is what the issue is all about. It is about a less beneficial pension scheme which is being set up and the defined contribution schemes that are in existence. The companies do not need this Act to establish pension schemes for their workers as they already have new pension schemes in Aer Lingus and, I believe, the DAA. My second amendment allows the companies to do that also should they so choose. It is based on the model of section 9 of the Aer Lingus Act 2004 which provided for the Aer Lingus IPO. I will deal with that further when I discuss my second amendment. The overwhelming reason people still want section 34 deleted is that it creates a detailed legislative provision which potentially interferes with the pension entitlements of 15,000 very worried people. While they appreciate the improvement that was made on Committee Stage, it is not enough. The feeling is that this should still be removed. The deletion of section 34 in its entirety is people's preferred option. We will push for a division on that. People would feel a great deal more comfortable if it was eliminated. The further amendments in the grouping arise if the proposal to delete section 34 is not accepted and the provision is left as is. There is a concern that the Minister is proposing to delete section 9 from the Aer Lingus Act. While it is true that the provision has never been invoked, it was included at the time of the IPO as a carrot to get the unions and staff to agree to that initiative. Section 9 represented an assurance that their pension scheme would not have lesser benefits. That it never had to be invoked is fine. However, there is no harm in leaving it there. The problem occurred after the IPO when SRT went to the wall. As a consequence of that unanticipated eventuality, hundreds of members of the IAS scheme became unco-ordinated overnight which placed an enormous strain on the pension scheme. It had a major impact. It is not that there is a need for legislation to set up new schemes. What happened subsequent to the IPO was that rather than allow workers to join the IAS scheme, the company opted instead to establish a new defined-contribution schemes with lesser benefits. Keeping section 9 for Aer Lingus is one of the options. What I propose is to rewrite section 9 and to keep it in this Act as an alternative to the Minister's proposal which could be used as a starting point or basis for discussion of the other airport companies. The DAA or the new Shannon company could set up a scheme based on the model that was there. That is the first alternative in the event of the preferred proposal not being agreed. If we are not successful in that alternative, the proposal in the third amendment relates to section 9 itself. Section 9 needs to be maintained in the Aer Lingus Act, notwithstanding that it has not been invoked before. What harm is there in leaving it in place? One of the reasons there is a problem here is that people feel some of the measures the Minister is seeking to put in place could be implemented by way of a rule change or section 50 order, which would take precedence over a rule change. Legislation trumps section 50. People believe that what is really happening is that this is being done to bypass the trust deeds and rules and empower the creation of a de facto scenario. That is not desirable in the circumstances. There are other ways to achieve what the Minister said he wants to achieve. This is not doing it and I will move amendment No. 4 in the event that amendment No. 3 falls. I will maintain the other one also. As there will not be an opportunity to do so while the Minister is still in office, I raise a related but separate issue on the national aviation policy which is under review and causing considerable concern to workers in all the airports. The mechanism and the draft the Minister has on display currently allows for the first time the possibility of airlines based outside the EU and the USA being granted access by the Government to pick up passengers in Irish airports and fly them directly to the USA. This is a significant worry. Currently, US and EU airlines operate on the basis of an open skies agreement with reasonable terms and conditions of employment, including minimum wages and certain standards of regulation. Deregulating the market will most definitely undermine the conditions of Irish workers. Will the Minister comment on that while he is here? We have seen very worrying developments in aviation in this regard. The Minister may have seen the feature in The Economist which referred to one of the Pacific carriers which is operating as a very low-cost carrier and crams 440 people into an aircraft type which only carries 220 people when operated by other airlines. A race to the bottom is very much developing there. Can the Minister confirm whether the US carriers have been in touch with his office to say that if the market is opened to carriers from outside the EU and USA they will pull out of Ireland? That would have a dramatic impact. We have already seen Ethiopian Airlines announce that it will travel to Los Angeles using Dublin as a pick-up point. That would be a major departure in aviation policy. While the policy note set out on the Department's website says the proposal will take into account EU criteria on fair competition, people are very worried that is not going to be enough. In bilateral agreements, Ireland is very well served through connectivity with the USA by Irish and US airlines and it would be a retrograde step if we were to open it up any further. I would appreciate the Minister's comments on that.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	95	The Minister will appreciate from what he has heard on Committee Stage and, so far, Report Stage that there is a general view that the main provisions of the Bill as they relate to the establishment of Shannon Airport as an independent entity and the bringing together of the parts of what was SFADCO are accepted and appropriate. That initiative is receiving almost unanimous support in the House. The issue with which we all seem to have a problem on the Opposition benches, and I suspect among some on the backbenches, is the way the Minister is introducing legislation to deal with the funds of a private pension scheme.It is the first time the Government has sought to legislate to deal with a private pension fund. I appeal on Report Stage, as I have done on Committee Stage, that section 34 be removed, which would take away the difficulties we have talked about and allow it to be addressed in a more comprehensive manner at an appropriate time when agreement is reached between all parties in the pension debacle. With the protracted nature of the discussions on the difficulties in respect of pensions, I find it difficult to understand why it is imperative to put in place at this stage a legislative framework that seeks to second guess the outcome of discussions. The issue has been going on for a long time and I think a little longer could be taken to await an appropriate outcome before dealing with legislative issues that arise. Up to the Social Welfare Act 2009, deferred members had the same protection as pensioners in payment, meaning that they could not have their entitlements varied by a section 50 order. That was reasonable when schemes were all in surplus. The then Minister changed the rule in May 2009 and removed all protection for deferred members. This was legitimately done with a view to active and deferred members sharing the load where deficits were required to be shared between a large group of members. What was not foreseen was that the IASS employers would use the complete absence of any protection for deferred members as a weapon whereby they have all but excluded the deferred members from the funds to be provided to solve this crisis. Putting all the funds outside the IASS was the mechanism by which they could achieve this. We believe it was assumed by the employers that deferred members would not become a political force and that the deal would be done by the time they realised what was happening. The expert panel has exacerbated the situation and now, in the case of Aer Lingus, 2, 570 active members are sharing €147 million while 3,687 deferred members are sharing €34 million. This is the reality despite the spin that the companies are putting on the narrative. It appears, from the DAA and Aer Lingus proposals for deferred members, that using a "set of principles" agreed with the expert panel, much of the additional funds will be paid to deferred members who have lower service as their deferred pensions will fall below €12,000 and the set of principles favours these members. The result is that longer serving members are still losing up to 50% to 60% of their expected pension. By any calculation, that is an enormous burden for any pensioner to have to carry.  They are losing the unco-ordinated provision, which represents approximately one third of the expected benefit for members on an average IASS pension of €30,000 to €40,000. They are also losing revaluation, which accumulates to 25% per ten years of deferment, and a further 20% of the resultant figure. The DAA and Aer Lingus proposals for deferred members, based on the expert panel principles, will only contribute a lump sum to the direct contribution fund, which has the potential to make up 10% of the 20% cut proposed by the IASS trustees. There is no compensation for the loss of revaluation and unco-ordination. When the Minister and others say that it is a 20% cut, this should be corrected as untrue. I ask him to do so when he addresses this. Loss of unco-ordination is a huge issue for deferred members. I have spoken to many of them. Under the rules of the IASS, members who left service as deferred members were unco-ordinated, which meant that they did not suffer a deduction from their IASS pension for the State pension. This is a rule that the trustees or employers could have changed at any time but chose not to for their own reasons. Both Aer Lingus and the DAA used this rule to entice staff to take voluntary redundancy through the 2000s in particular. We are all aware of the various proposals and plans put in place to make Aer Lingus a viable entity towards partial privatisation. People accepted pay restraint during that period and others left the company under various plans, believing there was no future for them in the company. They accepted the proposals in the real expectation that they would have a reasonable pension on reaching retirement age. Sadly, that is now gone, a situation enshrined in the legislation we are enacting. Staff taking voluntary redundancy created huge savings for both companies. Members made life-changing decisions based on this rule and now find themselves in a position that their IASS pensions will be reduced at aged 65 years, even though some of the younger deferred members will not receive the State pension until 66, 67 or 68 years. The Social Welfare Act 2013 removed full protection from pensioners in payment and decreed that their pensions could be cut by 10% over €12,000 and 20% over €60,000. In the case of IASS pensioners, this forced cut equates to them refunding approximately €110 million back into the IASS at a time when the employers have put not one cent into the scheme. I do not intend to revisit the ground covered by Deputy Clare Daly. The deferred members group lobbied hard to have the Social Welfare Act 2013 include some protection for deferred members and suggested the cuts applied to pensioners should also apply to deferred members but, unfortunately, they were unsuccessful, notwithstanding the protestation of the Tánaiste and Minister for Social Protection about her desire to rule with the head and the heart rather than with one separated from the other. With her increased powers, she will have the opportunity of the next social welfare Bill to address the expectation that rested in the minds of the deferred pensioners. The only alternative is to force the employers and the trustees to treat deferred members proportionately. In the case of Aer Lingus, when active members were getting €80 million and deferred members €30 million in the initial proposals of December 2012, Aer Lingus contended that the difference was cost stabilisation but it was never forced to prove this point. Estimates at the time were that active members were getting €27 million in cost stabilisation. The Labour Court recommendations of 13 January and 13 May reduced cost stabilisation by approximately €8 million to approximately €19 million and increased the funds for active members from €80 million to €110 million. These changes blew out of the water the argument that cost stabilisation represented the difference in funds between active members and deferred members but Aer Lingus continues with the same narrative. As the employers had stated at the outset of negotiations that they recognised the trustees must act in the best interest and have regard to all categories, the deferred members group fully believed this discrepancy would be rectified either by the employers allocating more funds to deferred members, as was their due, or the trustees reallocating benefits within the IASS to ensure proportionate benefit with active members. The employers did nothing and neither did the trustees.  I support the call of Deputy Clare Daly for an investigation into the way the fund was managed. Over the past year, we have seen a level of growth in pension funds, particularly Irish managed funds, that is in line with significant increases in commercial property prices in this city, where a considerable amount of the funds were linked. Deputy Clare Daly outlined the sell-off of valuable properties as part of the necessity or desire to turn them into cash at a time when they are growing rapidly. That warrants further investigation but I do not know whether it falls within the remit of the Minister. I assume it does not but it certainly falls within the remit of the Government to address this. Many members are deeply confused about the way in which their pension pot has been managed in recent times. It does not appear that advice is being given independently. There is a perception that there is a connection between advisers and people involved in other activities in respect of the disposal of assets. I do not want to name any particular companies but, going back to the banking crisis, one can see a similarity in auditors, accountants and consultants. They are all part of the same large group, or a small cohort, of advisers. The age-old indication that a Chinese wall has been built between various sections lends a perception in the minds of the people greatly affected by these decisions that the Chinese wall is anything but and that there is a significant breach in the perimeter.For that reason, it is appropriate for the Minister to pass some comment on this debacle. I seek the advice of the Chair on amendment No. 17.

#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	99	Therefore, in the context of this grouping, I will make some comments about the pension entitlements of a number of employees who in the late 1960s transferred from the Civil Service to the companies at Shannon and Cork Airports. They did so on the clear understanding that their terms and conditions, including their pension entitlements, would be no worse as a result of the transfer to the new companies than if they had stayed in the Civil Service. Frankly, that did not happen and legislation to formalise the transfer was not produced until 1998. Notwithstanding the comments that had been made and the assurances that had been given in this House during the 1970s and by successive Governments - Ministers had indicated that the terms, conditions and pension entitlements would be no different - the legislation enshrined in 1998 provided no such legislative basis for the maintenance of these pension entitlements. The employees now find themselves significantly worse off. The assurances they had been given did not materialise in the legislation of 1998, although this should have happened. It was not deemed appropriate to provide for this in legislation at the time because all pension funds were operating from a stronger position. Now, when the employees who transferred retire and will compare their benefits with those of people of the same grade and with the same pay and general conditions who remained in the Civil Service, they will find they only have a pension of approximately €12,000 in comparison to a pension of approximately €24,000 for those who remained in the Civil Service. This is a huge discrepancy. Many of the employees who transferred now find it enormously difficult to read the record of the House and see the assurances given in good faith on behalf of the then Government that their pensions would not be any worse than if they had remained in the Civil Service. I know successive Ministers and departmental officials have looked at this issue. I know, too, that the amendment I have proposed in this regard is not acceptable because it would place a potential charge on the State, but this does not get away from the fact that successive Governments have always acted in good faith on commitments given by previous Administrations. Sadly, Members on this side who were in government in the past failed to do this. I appeal to the Minister, perhaps in his final hours as Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport - I wish him well in what may emerge over the course of the afternoon-----

Other Ministers have sought to address issues before they depart from office. Some have appointed political acquaintances, people of considerable note, to State boards. If these are the Minister's final hours in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, will he look at making a commitment to this small group who accepted in good faith the word of previous holders of his office and previous Ministers of State in response to questions raised at the time? Will he commit to addressing this legacy issue? I understand there are no more than about 50 people to whom this benefit would accrue. While I recognise my amendment will not be accepted and the reason for this, I do not accept that this is an issue that cannot be addressed. I, therefore, appeal to the Minister to address it in the course of his deliberations which may turn out to be longer than I suspect.
#PeterMathews	unknown-#PeterMathews-party	unknown-#PeterMathews-dob	unknown-#PeterMathews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	102	As an Independent Deputy, I endorse the contributions made by Deputies Clare Daly and Timmy Dooley on the two issues that are prominent in correspondence I receive in my office, one of which is the anti-competitive nature of the operations of some non-EU and non-USA carriers which could jeopardise having a fair and level playing field in the conditions that operate and obtain. There is no doubt but that some airlines from outside the European Union and the USA are subvented by extremely wealthy individuals and groups in countries in which there are low wages and the presence of such a competitor would severely undermine the principles of fair competition for existing carriers. I ask the Minister to take this into consideration. The other matter concerns pensions. It is appalling that the people who in good faith took up employment during the years and placed their trust in the term, "trustees of pension funds", now find themselves facing massive differentials between active and deferred pensioners despite having served many years with their employer. It is patently wrong that the law seems to allow for these differentials and the Minister must do whatever it takes to deal with the matter. He should apply the standards of fairness and openness. Otherwise, the area of pensions will becomes like a black whole - a voodoo land. This is not right in a society in which fairness is valued by all citizens.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	103	I thank Deputy Clare Daly for her kind and gracious words regarding my approach as Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport. I know that we do not see eye to eye on much, but I acknowledge that she is sincere in her approach and motivation on this and other transport issues. The 15 amendments in this grouping relate to the superannuation provisions contained in the Bill. Half of them are technical or drafting amendments which I have tabled. I would like to address the more substantial amendments together.  Four of the amendments tabled, amendments Nos. 3, 15, 16 and 18, are similar to amendments tabled on Committee Stage. Amendments Nos. 3 and 16 relate to deleting or partially deleting section 34 from the Bill. The two amendments proposed by Deputy Dessie Ellis, Nos. 15 and 18, concern an appeals mechanism for deferred members of the IAS scheme and a statutory bar on closing pension schemes which have not reached the minimum 90% funding standard. My position on these amendments has not changed and I will not be accepting them. On the proposed appeals mechanism, it remains the position that any provision along these lines is a matter for national pensions policy. It is not appropriate to consider the issue in isolation, purely in the context of the IAS scheme. There are already two independent appeals mechanisms available to members of any pension scheme, namely, the Pensions Ombudsman and the courts.  On the question of statutorily preventing the closure of the IAS scheme, unless and until it reaches a minimum figure of 90% of the minimum funding standard, as I made clear on Committee Stage and in the Seanad, I cannot impose or prescribe solutions to the current difficulties in the scheme. If accepted, the amendment would add another constraint to what is already a highly complex and inflexible pensions scheme. It also carries the implication that the scheme could continue indefinitely, with an unresolved substantial deficit, in a manner that would be inconsistent with the Pensions Act 1990. That is not tenable.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	105	There is an air of disbelief in both the country and the city about the fact what would have been a major economic project in its own right will not be proceeding. I refer to the cancellation of the five Garth Brooks concerts. It is estimated that this will cost the city €50 million at a minimum. However, many people believe that the financial hit to the economy will be far greater. Some 70,000 ticket holders were due to travel here from abroad to attend the concerts. That would have been a huge fillip for the tourism industry. A total of 400,000 fans will be obliged to have their tickets refunded and there is also the question of ancillary booking fees. In addition, some 200,000 hotel bookings will be disrupted. This is an exceptional economic setback by any yardstick. We must also consider the reputational damage that has been done in terms of the capacity of the country and the city to host major events. Part of our tourism strategy has been to make Ireland an attractive location for significant events of this nature. The Taoiseach stated in Berlin last week that he hoped everyone involved could work something out. All three of the One Direction concerts held at Croke Park recently passed without incident. It appears that at no stage were the promoters or the GAA informed that licences would not be granted for all five Garth Brooks concerts. There was talk about major restrictions, hurdles to be traversed and significant issues relating to transportation and security. However, at no stage was a significant indication given that the licences would not be granted. Surely the Government should have intervened at some point in respect of this debacle. Either the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government or the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Sport should have become involved, particularly in light of the enormity of the event and the implications relating to its cancellation. Why did the Government not intervene in a hands-on way? Goodwill alone is not enough. Where there is a will, there is a way out of these situations. Will the Taoiseach examine the possibility of allocating Government time in order that the House might consider the legislation which Deputy Dooley has drafted and which would provide a mechanism to facilitate appeals and to allow for reviews by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government? I am of the view that the Opposition would support the Government were it to facilitate legislation of that kind, particularly in light of the significant economic implications involved. Many hoteliers, restaurant owners and young people seeking work simply cannot believe that the country can almost nonchalantly say "We do not really need that".

Were the Government to have stepped in and said that three One Direction concerts had already been held and that the five involving another artist fell outside the agreed parameters, it would certainly have been accused of coming the heavy. Major acts have been involved in huge outdoor concerts at locations throughout the country, including Páirc Uí Chaoimh, Semple Stadium, Limerick, Kilkenny and the RDS and Croke Park in Dublin, on previous occasions and no difficulties or hitches arose. There is a need to consider how the process operates. I have asked the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to examine the operational regulations. These certainly need to be considered in the context of the timeline requirements for the submission of applications by event organisers, the consideration of such applications by the relevant planning authority in advance of a series of events or concerts taking place and the absence of a specific appeals mechanism regarding decisions made in respect of event licences. Of course, judicial review is an option which can be considered in the latter context. These three issues must be examined in respect of Croke Park. I have seen Deputy Dooley's Bill and I accept that it is genuine in nature. As the Deputy stated yesterday, the Government can consider it and make any changes it considers necessary. I will absolutely examine the legislation which has been brought forward. In the context of the conversation I had with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government about the relevant regulations, let us see if there is something positive Government can do in order that this cannot happen again. The cancellation of this event is a major loss to the country. It will have an impact on the goodwill of all those fans of Garth Brooks, not to mention the hard economic impact it will have on so many others. It is a mess. There is an issue here to which consideration must be given. That is why the Government did not intervene. Dublin City Council made its decision based on the existing planning regulations. I will examine Deputy Dooley's Bill in order to discover whether it might be used in some form or other to allow the Government to consider the three points to which I refer.

It is not beyond the capacity of the Oireachtas to pass emergency legislation, if necessary, and also to give a clear signal that, in view of our current financial circumstances, we need to engage with major economic projects of this kind in a hands-on way. In that context, I understand there were no face-to-face meetings with residents who live near Croke Park. Certain news media outlets have reported that some objections to the concerts were forged. I am not saying that all of them were because people obviously lodged legitimate objections. I understand that some of the negotiations which took place gave rise to the significant concessions of no concerts being held at the venue next year. That would have been a major win for the residents who had objections to this series of concerts. Meaningful efforts were made by some actors in the process in terms of trying to mediate a solution. Ultimately, there is no point in people wringing their hands and saying that what has happened is both terrible and a great embarrassment.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	119	When this problem arose the controversy began and it probably will not end now; there may well be court implications. Several people made valid suggestions from a common-sense point of view on how this might be sorted out - in particular, the chairman of the Labour Relations Commission, Kieran Mulvey, who went to considerable lengths to explain what they could do to make this happen and give the fans the opportunity to see an artist in whom they have a particular interest. Deputy Martin knows the position. Let us suppose the Government decided to intervene with emergency legislation. First of all, we would be accused of doing down the rights of residents, who have rights, of course. Second, we would be accused of interfering with a planning process that the city council has a duty and a responsibility to deal with. That is why it is necessary to look at these issues. Deputy Martin asked whether this was for the immediate term. Even if we took Deputy Dooley's proposition and his Bill, we would still be bound to have a period of public consultation. It is not a case of simply introducing emergency legislation through the Dáil tomorrow. On an issue such as this, in which such large numbers are involved, we need to have a process of public consultation to get it right. I take the Deputy's best effort but in respect of the timeline, the decision on applications by the relevant planning authority and an appeals mechanism, we need to put in place a system that actually works. In this country we have been renowned for the reception and welcome we give to so many major outdoor events. They have been going on for years and have been planned without any great difficulties other than the usual failings whereby people might get into trouble on the fringes of concerts. We have had them in major GAA stadiums and other locations throughout the country. They have all been planned and all have followed a process and were exceptionally successful. In this case, there were three events earlier in the year and planning for three further events was granted. That was unacceptable to the artist, who wanted five. Obviously, the costs involved in these things are enormous. We will give attention to Deputy Dooley's observations and look at the specific issues, but it is not for decision this week.

I am very disappointed that it has not happened and that it will not happen now. It is a bitter economic lesson to have learned. However, there are processes that have to be put in place. They work everywhere else and they should work here as well.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	122	Yesterday, I raised with the Taoiseach serious issues of public interest in respect of the integrity of the planning process and the responsibility of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to uphold the integrity of that process. There are major allegations of planning irregularities in various parts of the State, which the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, is fully aware of but which he has not dealt with. For example, the Minister has been made aware of allegations relating to County Wicklow. These include allegations that An Bord Pleanála upheld objections to a major planning proposal in the county despite the fact that all objections to the development had been withdrawn. The person who authorised this inexplicable-----

Matters of fact are a different thing. This is not a court of law. We must be careful. Please do not mention names or locations that could identify issues.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	124	Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for that advice. They include allegations that An Bord Pleanála upheld objections to a major planning proposal in the county, a matter of fact, despite all objections to the development having been withdrawn, a matter of fact. The person who authorised this inexplicable decision was appointed deputy chairperson of An Bord Pleanála by the Minister, Deputy Hogan, despite obvious and serious conflict of interest issues.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	125	Sorry, Deputy. You cannot make allegations of this type in the House.

You are connecting the appointment of someone to an important position with an allegation of wrongdoing, and we cannot do that in the Chamber. Standing Orders do not allow it.

#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	134	I will bear your advice in mind, a Cheann Comhairle, as I put my question to the Taoiseach. Did officials in the Department of the Taoiseach or the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government question the appointment of the deputy chairperson in the light of the possibility of a conflict of interest due to his former position with RPS, a private consultancy firm? Yesterday, the Taoiseach made reference to positions on State boards having to be publicly advertised. Could the Taoiseach clarify this for the Dáil? Is the Taoiseach not aware that the position of deputy chairperson of An Bord Pleanála was not advertised? That begs a response from the Taoiseach. Does the Taoiseach agree that a situation whereby the deputy chairperson of An Bord Pleanála is overseeing planning applications drawn up by his former employees may represent a conflict of interest? Yesterday I asked the Taoiseach to facilitate the scrutiny by the Dáil of proposed nominees for the post of European Commissioner. The Taoiseach refused to answer the question. It is a perfectly reasonable request. As the Taoiseach famously said, Paddy needs to know. Paddy and Patricia need to know. I believe the Dáil has a responsibility to scrutinise any of these nominees and I call on the Taoiseach to facilitate such a process.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	135	Deputy Adams has come to the House this morning and made specific allegations against someone who does a job for an important independent statutory element of our democracy, An Bord Pleanála. I do not think I have ever been in contact with An Bord Pleanála over the years other than to inquire when a decision might be made, and seldom at that. Deputy Adams is making an allegation against someone who has been appointed to an important position. He doubts whether that person is capable of doing his job objectively. He is insinuating in the Chamber this morning that this person is in some way conflicted by the work that he does. I do not think that is very good from Deputy Adams's point of view. Anyone is entitled to lodge or withdraw an objection. I do not know the details of the case Deputy Adams has raised but I am assured that the Minister of State responsible, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, is dealing with this specific matter. I imagine that if Deputy Adams wishes to put down a question to her, she will answer it for him. It is a fact that when personnel are being appointed to membership of boards, people are entitled to apply or make expressions of interest through the publicjobs.ie website in respect of the experience they might bring to a particular position or otherwise. That does not confine a Minister to choosing from those who apply in that fashion. Ministers can choose membership of boards from outside specific applications that are made. This Government is the first to have introduced a requirement that the chairpersons of State bodies and boards of importance will appear before the relevant Oireachtas committees to explain and answer their questions in regard to the experience or expertise they might bring to any particular board. I imagine if someone from the House were to be nominated for consideration to be appointed as a European Commissioner, that person would have no problem at all in going before the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs to discuss the matter. As I said to Deputy Adams yesterday, if someone from the House were to be nominated for the post of European Commissioner, there is a requirement that such a person would go before the full European Parliament for a three- or four-hour discussion and questioning process about their credentials for the job for which they have been nominated by a particular country. That applies in all cases.I hope that the Deputy understands that the allegations he makes against an individual whom I do not know are very serious. Let me repeat for him again that the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, is dealing with the particular case that the Deputy mentioned in Wicklow.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	136	Of course I am aware that they are serious. That is why I raised them. However, they are not serious enough for the Taoiseach. I asked him to clarify whether he was aware of any possible conflict of interest or whether it had been raised with him, but he did not answer. I asked him to clarify his reference yesterday to positions on State boards needing to be publicly advertised, but he did not answer that. I asked him whether he knew that the position of deputy chairperson of An Bord Pleanála had not been advertised, but he did not answer. The Mahon tribunal unveiled the reality of a decade of planning corruption. The Government has not implemented the recommendations of that tribunal. The Taoiseach cannot, as he does in the House, portray planning corruption as a Fianna Fáil problem when his Government does not act to root it out. I raise these issues not to cast aspersions on anyone, but because it is part of my public duty as a Teachta Dála to raise them in a considered, reasonable and logical way. The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government acted to close down scrutiny of the planning process when he was appointed. One of his first acts was to shut down the inquiry initiated by his predecessor, Mr. John Gormley.

It claimed that there had been no wrongdoing, but that finding had to be set aside when a senior planner, Mr. Gerard Convie, provided evidence to the High Court, which quashed the review's section on Donegal and apologised to Mr. Convie. The Taoiseach claims he is sure-----

#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	140	I will do it now. The Taoiseach claims he is sure that the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, is dealing with this issue. She announced an independent assessment of these practices more than a year ago. I asked the Taoiseach yesterday whether we would have sight of that report before the recess. He stated that he would get back to me, but he did not. Will he tell the Dáil not that he is sure that she is dealing with the assessment, but when the report will be published and will we have sight of it? I will revert to my original question.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	141	Thank you. We are over time.

I hope that answers the Deputy's question - the answer is "No". All of the positions on An Bord Pleanála were publicly advertised. The answer to that is "Yes". That is clear.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	144	This one was not.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	145	The Government will legislate very shortly for NewERA, which is the entity charged with the Government's shareholding in semi-State companies and advising Ministers on appointments to boards of semi-States. In order to encourage public participation here and to have the best talent available, the process of public expressions of interest is available to the public, and many do apply. Obviously, the range of experience they offer is enormous. Ministers do not need to be confined to the applications that are received in that regard. As I said, everybody who is appointed to a chair of a State board has to come before the Oireachtas committee and answer for his or her experience. As I said, if somebody from the House is nominated for consideration for appointment to the European Commission, I am quite sure he or she would have no difficulty in going before the European affairs committee. An allegation was made to me yesterday about a major waste dump outside Derry, which apparently has generated an income of approximately £15 million. An allegation was made as to where that money went. I said: "I do not believe it." Maybe allegations that Deputy Adams makes here or that are made to me or to anybody else sometimes are very far removed from the facts and from the truth.

#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	148	-----but we all know that the changes will mean nothing if they do not make a serious difference in people's lives, not least in terms of health care. The recent focus on failures in that sector has been on the medical card fiasco, but there are other system failures and they do not all have to do with money. I wish to highlight the plight of Shay and Finn Guihen, who were born with the rare Pfeiffer syndrome and whose parents, Denise and Dermot, are in the Gallery. I have given the Taoiseach a background note on the case. One year ago, a 24-seven home care package was agreed that enabled the then 18 month old twins to leave Temple Street hospital for home last October. Their care was outsourced to a nursing agency and, from the first week, there were problems. It was hit or miss and resulted in the twins being admitted to the LauraLynn Children's Hospice for eight weeks until a care package could be provided. Five months later, there is still no sight of a care package and the parents have not been included in the process in any meaningful way. Every day, this couple faces the joy and sorrow of being these two boys' parents. The joy is found in how their parents have been astonished by their progress - they can see and hear, have normal intelligence, clap their hands, wave and pick out their favourite toys. These little guys have between them survived 21 operations to date. They look different, they have shunts in their brains and their breathing is being aided by tracheostomies. The parents' sorrow stems from the fact that their children's lives will be limited. While there is a limit on the time they live, there should not and must not be a limit on the quality of their lives. It is a nightmare for any parent to face the prospect of losing a child, but Denise and Dermot are facing the prospect of losing both of theirs. This is a question of the management and control of the home care package. It cannot be hit or miss. There must be continuity of care. This is not an issue of money, but of how the process is managed for these two little kids. Will the Taoiseach intervene to try to get a solution so that they can go home to where they are happiest? Will he undertake to review home care packages? Flexibility is great in some cases, but in others it is not and continuity of care is required in this case. If necessary, a few people could be recruited to provide that service, which is critical to the lives of a small number.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	150	I thank Deputy Catherine Murphy for giving an indication of this particular case. I would like to say that I think it must be incredibly difficult for Denise and Dermot, the parents of Finn and Shay, to have to live with the stress of what is involved here. I understand that these little boys are two and a half years of age, both have tracheostomies, both have fabulous personalities and both are in a palliative care unit with LauraLynn. It was to be for two months - it has been for five. As the Deputy points out, it is about ensuring that there is a sustainable home care package put together for Shay and for Finn. As she also points out, it is not about money. As I understand it, the care that was being given to Finn and to Shay while at home was done by particular agency workers. The HSE is very familiar with this case. It is the most complex case that it has come across in a very long time. It is a case now of working with a different agency to see if it is possible to put together a proper, sustainable home care package so that the two little boys can have the best of their personalities being expressed, their activity levels can be maintained and also, in respect of Denise and Dermot, the lifestyle around that is not one that has an overbearing stress load on it. I understand that the HSE is willing to meet with Denise and Dermot to discuss this. I would like to see that, while we have Shay and Finn with us, the best possible sustainable home care package can be put in place.I thank the Deputy for bringing this case to my attention. We will keep a close eye on this, together with Denise, Dermot and the HSE, with particular focus on little Shay and little Finn. I hope the outcome can be the very best for two little boys who need nothing but the best.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	151	I have talked to the HSE and the other agencies to see what solutions can be put in place. The big difficulty is that the great strength that is the flexibility of agency provision for some is the greatest weakness in this case. With a tracheotomy, for example, if something goes wrong, one literally has three minutes to change it. It is a life or death situation. We cannot have a situation where it is hit and miss; there must be continuity of care. Denise and Dermot are two people but my concern is that there is a small number of other families who do not want to rock the boat about the care provision and the continuity of care. I reiterate the point that this home care package needs to be reconsidered. I do not believe it is about money, rather it is about how the service is provided. That is the aspect of it that must be examined if we are not to find more families presenting with this type of very complex and difficult situation. I ask the Taoiseach to examine that continuity of care in the context of a review of the home care packages. This cannot be delivered on an agency basis because sometimes outsourcing is also about outsourcing responsibility. It is at that point that the change needs to be made.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	152	The Deputy made the point about the very short timespan that is available if some little incident happens in regard to these two little boys, therefore, 24-hour absolute care and monitoring is required here. That is the nature of the care process that needs to be put in place. I have correspondence from Deputy Lawlor who has been involved in this case as well and if the Deputy wishes, after this engagement I would like to say hello to Denise and Dermot, Deputy Lawlor and Deputy Murphy to see can we assure people that what we want here is the very best level of care for Finn and for Shay. It must be so stressful for parents to have to see two bubbly little boys with fabulous personalities having to face the challenge that they face. I was in a house further west recently where there are three children facing a different challenge which is also very serious and the stress level in that household is very difficult. I agree that it is not just about an agency, that it is about the people who can provide that 24-hour care. That is where the home care package needs to be. I will obviously contact the Minister for Health and the HSE about the general home care packages in this case, and let us say hello after this engagement is over.

We have been waiting three years - six years since the crisis - to have a discussion on a proper stimulus, so we need to get this right. The programme for Government promised a strategic investment bank but this Bill falls far short of that. We have been arguing that the banks, and the State bank, lending to the real economy is an important piece of setting the economy on an upward track. It is not good enough for the Government to try to rush through this important Bill. It is important and crucial for some SMEs and for the economy and it deserves proper time for scrutiny and improvement. It should not be dealt with in a single day. We object to all Stages of the Bill being taken tomorrow.

I am quite sure Deputy Adams is interested in that. Clearly, at the end of any Dáil session, these things tend to become very pressurised. We have had no guillotine so far this year. I appreciate the support of Opposition parties on some of the technical elements of some of the Bills, but this is one that must be got through. The Minister for Finance has to move on with providing opportunities for access to credit for companies, which is all about the creation of jobs, and the Deputy will understand that.

It would be useful to the Dáil if we had some sense of when we can expect that announcement in terms of the scheduling of the Dáil. We just passed the announcement of the Order of Business. Does that indicate that there will not be an announcement today and, if that is the case, I would appreciate if the Taoiseach would let us know that, or will there be an announcement on the Cabinet reshuffle tomorrow? It is important in terms of the orderly business of the House-----

We are entitled to have some sense of what the timeline will be either day or indeed tomorrow. It will involve resolutions being brought before the House, the ordering of the schedule of the House and contributions from the Government and Opposition. The second item I want to raise is a serious one concerning older people in our community, particularly up to 35,000 over 70 year olds who are having their medical cards taken from them. However, the problem for many over 70 year olds who are suffering from a severe illness or who may have particular conditions is that they cannot get a discretionary medical card under the criteria that apply to the over 70 year olds.They are being told they have to apply on the basis of the income thresholds applicable to people under 70 years of age. As a result, some very sick elderly people are losing their medical cards. All of us are receiving representations from the relatives of 80 and 90 year olds who are losing their medical cards because of the cut in the threshold introduced in the last budget. This applies even if they suffer from a severe condition that would in ordinary times merit a medical card. The relevant legislation is the universal primary care Bill which was promised in the programme for Government. It beggars belief that the Government is on the one hand promising the introduction of universal health cover and on the other is withdrawing vital medical cards from elderly people in this country who need them.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	166	The Government is considering a number of options in respect of the roll-out of primary care services for the 0-6 years category and other different categories, including the over 70s.

#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	186	I have a couple of ceisteanna regarding the health information Bill, the sale of alcohol Bill, the children first Bill and the clár an Rialtas. When will the health information Bill and sale of alcohol Bill be published? I recently read a report which revealed that there are 150,000 alcoholics in this State and that 1.35 million people are problem drinkers. Mar atá a fhios againn, ní aithníonn daoine go bhfuil fadhb acu. The issue of binge drinking is on the increase. The sale of alcohol Bill is important legislation which we welcome. However, when will it be published? On the children first Bill, another report, this time from EUROSTAT, revealed that the average monthly crèche fees in this State are among the highest in Europe and that Ireland is one of the two states wherein child care workers are not required to have minimum qualifications. While there are many good child care workers the regulation of child care is, as I am sure the Taoiseach will agree, crucial to protect children and reassure parents. When will the new qualification requirements for the child care sector come into effect and when will the children's first Bill become law?  The clár an Rialtais commits to the promotion of recognition of Irish sign language. The Taoiseach will be aware that deaf citizens are marginalised and socially isolated. They are a minority group within society. The programme for Government commitment is a good one but funding for the national advocacy service for deaf people has been cut. Can this decision be reversed?

It was disappointing to learn last night that the interdepartmental working group on sports sponsorship by the alcohol industry has only met twice, namely, last December and February this year. It would seem that that there is no political leadership in respect of this working group. Can the Taoiseach assure the House that this pressing issue will be taken seriously and will he provide leadership in ensuring that alcohol sponsorship will be addressed in the context of the long promised public health (alcohol) Bill?

I would like to ask about two pieces of promised legislation. Two weeks ago, we were promised legislation on the issuance of medical cards to women on whom the symphysiotomy procedure had been performed. What is the status of that legislation? Has it been shelved? Currently, the Prison Service spends €30,000 per annum on electronic tags, the majority of which are in a cardboard box in Longford. We were promised new legislation that would allow for these electronic tags to be extended to high risk sex offenders post-release from prison. The relevant legislation is the criminal law (sexual offences) (amendment) Bill.When will we see the Bill? In light of the fact that it does not seem to be receiving the priority it deserves, can we ensure amending legislation will be brought forward so we will not be exposing women and children to unacceptable and preventable risks?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	236	The Bill in respect of sexual offences was promised for later this year. There is work being done in the parliamentary counsel's office on that. I will advise the Deputy on the progress being made. I am not aware of the difficulties in regard to the medical cards for those women who endured the cruelty of symphysiotomy but I will consult the Minister for Health to see what the position is.

Given that this is so important and that the Taoiseach signed off on the legislation yesterday, which I welcome, can he commit to the House that it will be published before the end of this term? We have been waiting for it for three years. A large number of industrial relations problems are arising under current conditions. Will the Taoiseach commit to a review of domestic waste collection and waste management services? They are imploding at present because of a race to the bottom with regard to wages.

We are awaiting the Government's official response to the report on Dáil electoral reform. That was due last December. The deadline for the Government's response to the convention's fifth report, on the right to vote of citizens resident outside the State, was 26 March. Therefore, it is three months overdue. The deadline for the Government's response to the convention’s sixth report, on blasphemy, was 27 May. It is now one month overdue. Can the Taoiseach state why there are delays and when we might expect a response? More important, when will there be a debate and consequent action on foot of the reports?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	242	I am sorry that we are well behind time on a number of these. The problem has been with the individual Departments on the basis of the recommendations made by the Constitutional Convention. I understand from the senior people dealing with this that one of the convention reports will be back for consideration by the Government and, therefore, discussion. I cannot give the Deputy the details on the others at the moment. I would have believed that we might have been in a position to have these debated long before now. I apologise for not being able to comply with the dates we had set out. The position is that the Government was to respond within a period. It was to be the case that if the Government were to say it examined report X and agreed that there should be a referendum on the point of points in question, an indicative timeline would be given in that regard. Obviously, one of those points concerns the referendum on marriage equality, to be held next spring. The Government has yet to make a decision on a number of other recommendations in convention reports that we have debated here. They will now be backed up by further convention debates, with other recommendations. Obviously, the Government will not be able to hold all the referendums and must make a decision on what ones it should hold in conjunction with the marriage equality referendum next spring. I will advise the Deputy and the House when the report comes back. The difficulty lay in a number of analyses to be carried out by various Departments of some of the recommendations.

Will the Taoiseach acknowledge that there are significant delays in the courts, which are about to rise in two weeks for the summer? Justice delayed is justice denied.

The convention was launched with great fanfare and the timescales were set by the Government. The citizen members, in particular, made a phenomenal commitment to the whole endeavour, and their sense of pride in their participation was obvious. The problem and what bothers me is that this level of commitment by the citizens is not being reciprocated by the Government. I ask the Taoiseach to impress upon the Departments that have not yet reported to him the vital nature of the work done. The Departments should accord to the endeavour the same priority that the Taoiseach and citizen members accorded to it.

I also thank the Minister, Deputy Reilly, for being present to respond on this important issue. A litany of failures was identified in an internal health and safety audit of the acute psychiatric unit of University Hospital Galway which was carried out on 4 June last. It is clear from reading the report that the unit is an accident waiting to happen. The report points out that one-fifth of the staff are not complying with mandatory training in aggression and violence, and that as a result of recent cost containment, not all staff have attended, or been given the opportunity to attend, the mandatory training. The report also highlights problems with conditions in the facility, including the perennial problem with leaks in the roof which led to a water mark close to electrical connections at one location. It further highlights that a bed has been removed in another part of the unit because of the leaking roof. However, it is not just one bed. A number of beds have been moved over the last six months due to the ongoing problem with the leaking roof. One of these beds is in the women's ward and it is known as the bed with a bucket. Patients use towels and sheets on the floor to soak up the water rather than have to listen to the continuous drip, drip, drip into a bucket. If that were happening in Guantanamo Bay it would not be acceptable, yet it is happening in an acute psychiatric unit in this country. The patients must ask the other patients in the ward for their towels to try to soak up the perennial flood of water coming through the roof. On one occasion, a patient occupying that bed moved it away from the leak, but then it was partially blocking the door into one of the two toilets on the women's ward, which are there to accommodate 16 women. The issue is not only the quality of the facilities but also the lack of facilities, particularly for activities within the unit to help to prevent patient boredom. One patient put it to me that there is nothing to do but sit around waiting for medication. The only two options are to stay in one's bed or go for a cigarette. The staff are run off their feet, particularly dealing with specials - that is, patients who require one-to-one care because they are a risk either to themselves or to others. Due to the lack of staff support in the unit, many patients are being forced into remaining in the unit involuntarily. While the national average for involuntary patients as a proportion of all patients is approximately 11%, in the acute unit in Galway at present it is closer to 50%. That alone should set off alarms. I spoke to a patient who had spent a period of time in the high-risk ward. They told me they spent two to three days without speaking with a nurse. This was in a high-risk ward. The nurses were too busy dealing with patients who required one-to-one care, including one forensic patient in the acute ward who should not have been accommodated in an acute psychiatric ward. Due to the lack of available staff to monitor that patient, the individual was occasionally able to roam freely through the unit. The unit does not have adequate staff. That, combined with a building that is totally inadequate and the reports of boredom among patients, is a recipe for a serious accident in the unit.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	270	I am replying on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, who is indisposed. I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue and giving me the opportunity to update the House on the matter. The Health Service Executive, HSE, is proceeding to modernise and reform mental health services across the HSE West region, including in the Galway-Roscommon area. A key factor in this reform was the recognition that the previous overall stock of 79 psychiatric beds across Galway and Roscommon was too high, based on recommendations in "A Vision for Change'', allied to a corresponding under-development of community-based mental health services, where I believe all of us would wish to see the service. In this context, an implementation plan to reconfigure mental health services across the Galway-Roscommon administrative area was put in place, culminating in the closure of the psychiatric ward in St. Brigid's, Ballinasloe, and the transfer of beds from there, on a phased basis, to the acute psychiatric unit in University Hospital Galway. Since February, a bed capacity level of 45 psychiatric beds has been operational in UHG. The HSE indicates that at no time since February has this bed occupancy level been exceeded and that there is no pressure on physical bed occupancy at present in UHG. Along with the increase in bed capacity, the local HSE has also improved clinical governance, putting in place two assistant directors of nursing and an additional two senior nurse managers. This is in addition to a range of new staff and services, including the redeployment of nurses from Ballinasloe. The HSE points out that the clinical director, together with the nurse managers, conduct daily assessments on staffing requirements to ensure the safest possible service at all times. Staff in the acute unit at University Hospital Galway are confident that they can meet the needs of current inpatients and the needs of those referred for assessments. Following a recent Health and Safety Authority inspection, an action plan has been finalised by the HSE. The majority of the recommendations have already been implemented, and the remainder are being completed. For example, the safety statement has been reviewed and updated and improvements are under way in respect of relevant aspects of staff training. I assure the House that the Department of Health and the HSE are fully committed to improving quality and safety throughout all mental health services and that this goal will remain the highest priority as regards both patients and staff. This objective is reflected in the major reconfiguration of mental health services in Galway-Roscommon, with approval for an additional 44 permanent staff at a cost of approximately €2.6 million and the coming on stream of a new 50-bed acute unit in Galway towards the end of next year. As was clearly demonstrated in the debate on the Private Members' motion held in the Dáil last week, which was unopposed by the Government, we all agree with the fundamentals of "A Vision for Change" and wish to see services brought into the 21st century. In this context, the HSE addresses all genuine concerns, particularly quality and safety, while taking account of recommendations arising out of reviews of mental health services at local level. We will continue with this approach so that all involved have an appropriate and meaningful say in modernising services across all regions of the country. Indeed, it is now a feature that we have client engagement in respect of the new units being built around the country. Finally, patient safety was the priority in the HSE service plan for 2014, and that applies in our mental health services as well as everywhere else.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	271	I thank the Minister for his reply. He said there was no pressure in the unit at present. The difficulty is that beds are moved out of the ward when there is serious rain and are moved back in at other times due to pressures on the physical space to provide for the 45-bed capacity of the unit. On one occasion in the last number of months, men had to be accommodated in part of the women's ward because of pressure on bed numbers. The Minister said the clinical director and the nurse managers conducted a daily assessment of the staffing requirements.I am told by the nursing union there that, on one particular shift three weeks ago, of the eight staff on that floor, two were pregnant and the other six had no restraint training. Does the Minister believe that is a safe situation? Two weeks ago, there were two female staff managing the men's ward, one of whom was pregnant. There was a serious incident and the alarm had to be pressed. Patients who were "specials" had to be abandoned to respond to that emergency, and these specials require one-to-one support because they are either a risk to themselves or a risk to other patients in that unit. We were told that most of the actions in the health and safety audit had been completed. Clearly, that is not the case in regard to the incidents I have raised. The leak problem in that facility is still there. Last year, we were promised that home-based treatment teams would be put in place, but that has not happened, and we need them immediately in Roscommon and Galway city. The 50-bed unit will take another 18 months to put in place. As an interim measure, will the Minister open the state-of-the-art St. Luke's unit in Ballinasloe to take pressure off University Hospital Galway pending the completion of that new 50-bed unit?
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	272	I again thank the Deputy for raising the matter. There is no question or doubt that, historically, the mental health services in this country have been the Cinderella of the health services. I had the pleasure of opening a new acute psychiatric unit in Beaumont Hospital last Friday, something we have waited over 25 years for. When St. Ita's was built, it was a state-of-the-art engineering feat that appeared on the front of the international engineering magazine in 1902 or thereabouts. However, I know from information gleaned from working in that institution over many years as a visiting GP that the original intention was to build the hospital on Lambay Island - out of sight, out of mind, and the further away the better. The next furthest point was the peninsula at Portrane. Thankfully, we live in much more enlightened times. The Government's policy is to remove the stigma from health care relating to mental health, and all new primary care centres now have mental health facilities associated with them. Indeed, the new unit in Beaumont is a joy and a delight for the patients, and the unit is, in fact, named after a Mr. Sheehan, who was one of the service's long-standing clients. The whole approach has become much more client-oriented. The Deputy raised some points that he believes still apply. That being the case, I will certainly come back to him in regard to their status. It would not be acceptable that a leak was not fixed and that patients were in that scenario. It takes time to build new facilities. We are moving to a new model of care and, as I am sure the Deputy agrees, we want people kept in the community in so far as is possible, and we need to transfer staff to the community in order to do that. Community facilities are more appropriate and, although they are not necessarily more cost-effective, it is best outcomes for patients that we want. That is our focus. A lot of extra money has gone into our mental health service in this regard - rightly so - and that continues to be the case. I will certainly undertake to check the areas about which the Deputy has concerns and I will revert to him in writing. At Beaumont I made the point that in the past we had had a terrible situation in which patients were in large rooms with paint peeling off the walls, but they were getting excellent care, and when they moved to the palatial surroundings of the likes of Leas Cross, the care was not good at all. We need to do both. I congratulate, commend and thank the staff who do such a great job looking after some of the most vulnerable people in our society.
#MichaelLowry	unknown-#MichaelLowry-party	unknown-#MichaelLowry-dob	unknown-#MichaelLowry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	273	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for affording me the opportunity to raise an issue that is of serious concern to more than 5,000 people across the country who live with reduced mobility. Citizens with reduced mobility were dealt a devastating blow on 26 February 2013, when it was announced by the Department of Health that two vital lifelines, the mobility allowance scheme and the motorised transport grant, were to be discontinued and closed to new applicants. To add further insult to those affected, no reasonable or realistic alternative to the scheme was put forward by the Department; nor was any guidance offered to those people who, 17 months later, are still struggling to deal with what was a unilateral and life-changing decision by the Government. On 11 June last year, the Department of Health stated that the mobility allowance would continue to be paid to those already in receipt of it until the scheme was replaced. Later that month, it was announced that an interdepartmental group was to report to the Government on the establishment and operation of a new scheme by the end of October 2013. Now, almost a year and a half since the closure of these schemes and without any recent update on the long overdue interdepartmental group report, this distressing issue is still no closer to a resolution, and people with mobility challenges remain completely in the dark. At the time of the cessation announcement by the Department of Health, over 5,000 people nationally were adversely affected by the closure of the schemes. A total of 487 people in Tipperary were in receipt of mobility allowance, while 33 others received the motorised transport grant. These precious schemes accounted on average for 20% of the total income of the recipients. Essentially, these payments are vital to recipients and their closure has had a dual negative impact. First, untold worry and stress continues to be visited upon those who rely on the mobility allowance. Recipients simply do not know what the future holds or what supports, if any, they will receive in the future. Second, no new applications for assistance can be made to the scheme, leaving hundreds of people with reduced mobility isolated and excluded from wider society. A person with a physical disability simply cannot live life without the comfort and security of financial and practical supports, without the support of the State and its agencies and without up-to-date information as to the availability, quantity and quality of assistance. Access to a car or other appropriate and affordable mode of transport is an essential component in the life of a person with a severe physical disability. For such an individual, getting out of the house, going to town, attending a medical appointment or simply meeting up with family or friends can be a major logistical challenge. The removal of these meagre but invaluable payments has been a shameful and reprehensible act and a move I believe to be nothing short of a travesty. The Government has had over three years to formulate an alternative to the mobility allowance, yet nothing has been done. We were advised by the Taoiseach that over €10 million was being ring-fenced for a new mobility scheme to replace those that had been deemed illegal. It is now clear that those affected by this disgraceful lack of action have been cast aside and forgotten by those in positions of power. Promises made at the last general election to retain vital mobility assistance for people affected by disability were empty and meaningless. There has been no forward thinking, no planning and a deplorable lack of respect for those people whose lives have been crushed by this short-sighted decision. The Government must stop procrastinating on this issue and put forward a fully reasoned, logical and fair alternative. No further delays can be tolerated on the issue. The Government must establish a permanent alternative to these disbanded lifelines with immediate effect.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	274	I regret the rather pejorative tone of the Deputy's speech and, of course, much of it is inaccurate. However, I am pleased to take this opportunity to outline the current position in regard to a new transport support scheme for people who face significant challenges in addressing their transport needs arising from mobility issues. As Members of the House will be aware, in 2012 the then Ombudsman recommended that both the mobility allowance and the motorised transport grant be revised to make them compliant with the Equal Status Acts. The Ombudsman made particular reference to the definition of disability and the age cohort eligible to apply for support. The mobility allowance was never designed or intended to cover the entire costs of an individual's transport needs. This administrative scheme was designed to help eligible people to benefit from a change in surroundings from time to time - for example, by financing the occasional taxi journey or transport to a hospital. It is important to emphasise that the Government accepts the position taken by the Ombudsman and acknowledges that schemes under the auspices of my Department must comply with the Equal Status Acts. However, the Ombudsman's recommendations raised significant issues of a legal, financial and practical nature, particularly as regards extending eligibility to a wider cohort. In February 2013, the Government decided to close both schemes. At that time, the mobility allowance scheme involved some 4,700 recipients at an annual cost of €9.3 million. The Government has committed to continued payment to these recipients pending the establishment of a new scheme. Therefore, the HSE has continued to pay these 4,700 individuals at the applicable rate in each case.Since the schemes were closed, a considerable amount of work has been undertaken. A review group on transport supports for people with disabilities was established, which involved a range of representatives of people with disabilities, which I very much welcomed, and relevant Departments and agencies. There needs to be and has in more recent times been greater involvement of the clients of these services in their planning. The Government established an interdepartmental group chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach to further consider the complex issues involved in developing an appropriate scheme, including how it should be administered. In November 2013 the Government decided that the detailed preparatory work required on a new travel subsidy scheme and associated statutory provisions should be progressed by the Minister for Health in consultation with other relevant Ministers, as required. In line with the Government's decision, my Department is working to develop policy proposals for a new scheme. When we have progressed these proposals, in conjunction with other Departments, as necessary, to the point where we are satisfied that they represent workable and appropriate solutions, proposals for legislation will be brought to the Government. Subject to the pre-legislative scrutiny process for draft heads of a Bill, work will take place on the formal drafting of a Bill for publication, debate and enactment. The Government's objective is to develop an affordable solution which will contribute towards meeting the transport or mobility needs of those who most need transport services. Issues to be considered include people's ability to access and use public transport, the extent to which individual means might be taken into account and the cost implications of different options for a revised scheme. This is a challenging task, given that the issues involved are complex and that there are serious cost pressures on the health system. We will continue the work of developing an alternative to the schemes which have been closed with a view to meeting people's needs in the most appropriate way.
#MichaelLowry	unknown-#MichaelLowry-party	unknown-#MichaelLowry-dob	unknown-#MichaelLowry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	275	My mood and tone are a mild reflection of the disillusionment and anger felt by those affected by the inaction of the Government on this scheme. I urge the Minister to stand over the repeated promises and guarantees made on this matter and to be cognisant of the importance of the scheme for those who simply cannot avail of public transport. I am asking him to give a categoric guarantee that a replacement scheme will be put in place without further delay and provide a timeline. This issue has been dragging on for approximately 18 months. The commitments have been given but not honoured and I am told today that the matter will again be kicked to touch. I, therefore, ask the Minister to give us a timeline for the introduction of the new scheme. The form of the new scheme is also very important. Any new scheme must be in the form of a personal payment to the individual. A group transport scheme will not be sufficient to meet the variety of needs of those who previously received grants. I ask the Minister to consider the fact that, with each day that passes, unfortunately, more and more people are left challenged by reduced mobility as a result of accident or by birth. It is unacceptable that we are leaving them with no supports during a very difficult period in their lives.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	276	I have outlined the background, the work being undertaken and the current position in regard to replacing the mobility allowance and reiterate my point on the challenge of developing a new individual cash payment scheme on a statutory basis with a limited budget while continuing to cater for the 4,700 people already in receipt of a monthly payment with the aim of supporting people with severe disabilities who require additional income and satisfying all legal and equality concerns. That work continues in order that they will not be disadvantaged. I must point out to the Deputy that this was a legal issue before the Government came to power. The Government the Deputy supported presided over it. There was also a lack of action on the issue of symphysiotomy, for those excluded from the Neary redress scheme and in the case of the Magdalen laundries and many other things. Like all Deputies, I have grave concerns regarding all those who suffer from a disability and have issues with transport. The Government is working hard to address yet another issue left behind by the Government supported by the Deputy and which wrecked the country.
#RayButler	unknown-#RayButler-party	unknown-#RayButler-dob	unknown-#RayButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	277	I would have liked to have spoken a couple of weeks ago during the debate on the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill, but my mother passed away that week and I was not able to do so. I am very grateful to have the opportunity today to speak about the provision of social protection measures for the self-employed, a matter I have continued to raise at meetings of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection. When I was canvassing during the recent local elections, this was raised as a serious issue for those whom I met who were self-employed and feared they would have no protection in the event that their business collapsed or they suddenly became ill. Other Deputies have also raised this matter and I thank them for keeping it on the agenda for discussion. The self-employed pay a stamp at 4% and it is proposed to increase this rate to 4.25% and maintain it for an approximate two or three year period. Depending on the level of economic growth, the rate would continue to increase incrementally by 0.25% every second year or so to eventually reach a maximum rate of 5.5%. Progress has been made in recent months in resolving this matter for the self-employed. ISME, the Self Employed Alliance and some unions have spoken at length at Oireachtas meetings in giving their points of view on introducing a new stamp rate for the self-employed to offer security at vulnerable times. The introduction of a new stamp rate would provide the self-employed with social welfare payments on the closing of a business, in times of illness and disability, while all other welfare payments would be means-tested. After much discussion at several meetings, I am encouraged and heartened by the positive responses from the Self Employed Alliance which represents smaller sized employers and is wholeheartedly in favour of the introduction of the new stamp rate.  While the other representatives of the self-employed are also in favour, the elephant in the room is making it a mandatory payment, as opposed to a voluntary contribution. However, I argue that voluntary participation cannot correlate with social protection measures. Making it a voluntary payment would only serve to negate the possibility of having sufficient social welfare funding available to cover the needs of the self-employed. Therefore, a mandatory payment is required in order for this to work. As the seeds of small business start to show signs of taking root again nationally, this appears to be the most opportune time to formally introduce this stamp rate and in doing so provide social welfare cover for those who would ordinarily have no security if the situation remained the same. Furthermore, I have spoken at length to the Ministers for Social Protection, Finance and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation about the introduction of a new stamp rate and they have all reacted positively to this becoming a real option for the self-employed. I also welcome news that ISME is preparing to undertake a survey of all its members on the subject. I am hopeful the self-employed will recognise the absolute benefits of such a move. There are approximately 340,000 self-employed persons in the country, all of whom may need access to social welfare protection at times of vulnerability. Therefore, we cannot allow the current system to remain in place. The glaring gap must be bridged to provide them with security when they need it most and I hope all sides involved will accept this finding.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	278	I thank the Deputy for raising this issue, which I am taking on behalf of the Tánaiste and Minister for Social Protection. Self-employed persons pay PRSI at the class S rate of 4%, subject to a minimum annual payment of €500. This entitles them to access long-term benefits such as State pension (contributory) and widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner's pension (contributory). Ordinary employees who have access to the full range of social insurance benefits pay class A PRSI at the rate of 4%. In addition, their employers make a PRSI contribution of 10.75% in respect of their employees, resulting in the payment of a combined 14.75% rate per employee under full-rate PRSI class A. For employees earning less than €356 per week, the rate of employer's PRSI is 8.5%. Self-employed workers may access social welfare supports by establishing eligibility to assistance-based payments such as jobseeker's allowance and disability allowance. In the case of jobseeker's allowance, they can apply for the means-tested jobseeker's allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services. In assessing means from self-employment, income from the previous 12 months is used as an indicator of likely future earnings. Given the variety of self-employment situations, the means assessment procedures are applied in a flexible manner to ensure that circumstances that would be likely to lead to a significant variation, either upward or downward, in the level of a person's income from one year to the next are taken into consideration. It is recognised that the downturn in the economy had an impact on many self-employed persons and the consequent reduction in their income and activity levels. This may be reflected in any assessment of their means from self-employment for jobseeker's allowance purposes. As in the case of a non-self-employed claimant for jobseeker's allowance or disability allowance, the means of husband, wife, civil partner or cohabitant will be taken into account in deciding on entitlement to a payment. In September 2013, I published the report of the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare on extending social insurance coverage for the self-employed. The group was asked to examine and report on issues involved in extending social insurance coverage for self-employed people in order to establish whether such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable, with the requirement that any proposals for change must be cost neutral. The group found that the current system of means tested jobseeker's allowance payments adequately provides cover to self-employed people for the risks associated with unemployment. In this context, the group noted that almost nine out of every ten self-employed people who claimed the means tested jobseeker's allowance during the three-year period from 2009 to 2011 received payment. Consequently, the group was not convinced that there was a need for the extension of social insurance for the self-employed to provide cover for jobseeker's benefit. The group found, however, that extending social insurance for the self-employed was warranted in cases related to long-term sickness or injuries. To this end, the group recommended that class S benefits should be extended to provide cover for people who are permanently incapable of work because of a long-term illness or incapacity through the invalidity pension and the partial capacity benefit schemes. The group further recommended that the extension of social insurance in this regard should be on a compulsory basis and that the rate of contribution for class S should be increased by at least 1.5 percentage points. This recommendation will require further consideration in conjunction with the findings of the most recent actuarial review of the Social Insurance Fund, which indicated that the self-employed achieve better value for money compared to the employed when the comparison includes both employer and employee contributions in respect of the employed person. My colleagues in government and I will reflect on the findings of the advisory group on this issue and will further consider the recommendations contained in the report and that will take account of future developments in the budgetary and fiscal position.
#RayButler	unknown-#RayButler-party	unknown-#RayButler-dob	unknown-#RayButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	279	I thank the Minister for his positive response. I thank the outgoing Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, for all the help she has given the self-employed through her Department. Hopefully, the new Minister will finally put the new stamp in place. We are the only country in industrialised Europe that does not offer social protection for the self-employed. We have come a long way since I entered the House three years ago and raised this issue at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection. I was told the rate would be at least 30% but it is now down to 4.25%. This will give recognition to self-employed people. Recently, a lady rang a local radio station to describe how her husband who was self-employed got sick. She earns €440 a week. They have two children and a mortgage repayment of €1,600 per month. Her husband was assessed for social welfare benefits and a payment of €1.80 per week was approved. That has to stop and we must put a system in place. Everybody gets sick and sometimes people suffer a disability. In England, welfare payments for the self-employed are based on their profits. If people generate between zero and £7,000 in profits annually, they fill out an exclusion form. They pay £3.30 a week in national insurance if they generate between £7,000 and £12,000 in profits annually and they pay 9% in the higher bands. The Sunday Business Post ran an article under the headline, "No Country for Sick and Self-Employed". However, we are relying on the self-employed to get this country up and running. We cannot leave the system the way it is. We have to put a new system in place. I want the unions to come down off their high horses to put this new stamp in place - at the end of the day, are they acting for the self-employed or who are they acting for? We must put a stamp in place for the self-employed.
#AnneFerris	unknown-#AnneFerris-party	unknown-#AnneFerris-dob	unknown-#AnneFerris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	280	I raise this issue as as a Wicklow Deputy and as a member of the Oireachtas consultation group on centenary commemorations and I ask the Minister to restore the essential local history service to Ballywaltrim Library in Bray, County Wicklow. Historical research is the cornerstone of everything the country wishes to portray during the centenary commemorations, which have started and which will continue until 2022. Local historical research is the aspect of historical study that links today's communities with the lives of their ancestors. Validating those links is the work of professional historians, genealogists and librarians. The work of such professionals underpinned the impressive tourism drive the country witnessed during the successful project, The Gathering, last year. The images of US First Lady, Michelle Obama, and her daughters visiting beautiful Glendalough were beamed across continents and deemed to be a tourism success. Let us not forget that their visit began in the world famous Trinity College library at the end of this street where they were guided through their Irish heritage by historians, genealogists and librarians. We are surrounded by fine libraries. Members not only have access to a world class research service within the well-stocked Oireachtas Library but the library also has strong links with the National Library next door and Trinity College library up the street. The people of County Wicklow and people worldwide who proudly claim links to the county also deserve access to their history and heritage through their local library service. In a week Dublin City Council drew a firm dividing line between the people of Dublin and people from mainly outside Dublin who had bought tickets to a concert in Croke Park, let us be careful about creating a wider cultural divide between Dublin and the rest of the country. Let us face it. The Obamas were lucky to have access to a Dublin library. On 28 June 2014, the world's media reported on the events that started the First World War, one hundred years previously. A day later, 29 June, the only public historical research service in County Wicklow closed its doors to the public because Ballywaltrim library, where it is based, no longer has available library staff. Researchers engaged in valuable First World War local studies during a globally important centenary year have been told to go away. The publicly owned material they need is no longer available for public consumption. Are Wicklow's First World War dead to wait another hundred years? Will Wicklow have a local studies service in time to enable historians to complete work on important 1916 and 1922 research? What of the hotels and restaurants and visitor destinations that will lose out from the wider tourism impact of the closure of Wicklow's local studies service at this critical time? Librarian skills are needed to curate the valuable collection of books, journals, newspapers, maps and other materials that are essential to the research work of academics, historians, genealogists, local people and visitors who rely on the services in Ballywaltrim library. These professionals are a valued source of expert advice for researchers. Will the Minister support the application by Wicklow County Council to recruit librarian staff to enable the local studies service to be restored without delay?
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	281	I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue. Wicklow County Council operates 13 public libraries across the county, plus its mobile library and library headquarters. In 2012, there were 489,669 visits to the library service. Local authorities have seen a significant reduction in staffing numbers over the last few years, and while this has assisted in the re-balancing of public service costs, it has brought challenges in service delivery for local authorities, including the library service. Decisions on the delivery of library services are matters for local authorities and my Department has no direct role in the delivery or prioritisation of those services. Wicklow County Council has responded flexibly to staff shortages in its libraries so as to maintain the fullest possible level of service. This has included libraries in some cases having fewer staff on duty, but continuing to operate. In the case of Greystones Library, a recent staff retirement caused management to examine all options to sustain a strong level of service, including weekend and evening opening. To deliver this, the local authority made the decision to relocate a staff member from the Ballywaltrim local history studies service to Greystones Library to sustain the core number of staff required to operate the library. This was a decision of the local authority and took into account the fact that Greystones Library has a membership of 25,709 and issues more than 500,000 items per annum. The local studies section at Ballywaltrim Library in Bray was staffed by one person and was open 24 hours per week until the council's decision on its temporary closure on 1 July. The other action taken by the county council in respect of dealing with staffing numbers and the delivery of services is the recent submission to my Department, on 24 June, of staff sanction requests for the filling of a number of vacancies in Wicklow County Council's library service. I was surprised these requests were not made earlier. The requests are being considered by my Department and I will ask if we can expedite the decisions. Pending the outcome of the sanction requests, the county council will continue to make decisions on where and how to deploy its resources. I hope my Department can deal quickly with the recent staffing request which could help Wicklow County Council to reopen the Ballywaltrim local history studies service and provide the service that existed up to 1 July.
#AnneFerris	unknown-#AnneFerris-party	unknown-#AnneFerris-dob	unknown-#AnneFerris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	282	I thank the Minister and agree it is surprising that Wicklow County Council did not apply earlier for staff funding, as the retirement of the person in Greystones would not have happened overnight and must have come as no surprise. There are questions to be raised in this regard. As Members of this House, we have a responsibility to Ireland's future, present and proud past. Local communities are the true custodians of their local history, and the library service is an essential support to communities. Without professional recording and curating of history, inaccuracies creep in and question marks begin to hang over the authenticity of heritage. Ireland and Wicklow have proud heritages, and the caretaking of that heritage must be supported. The public library service in Bray is a year older than the Labour Party. The first free library opened its doors to the public in Bray in 1911. That library, on Eglinton Road, still provides a vital service and was joined in the millennium year by the new building in Ballywaltrim, which I was very proud to open as then cathaoirleach of Bray Town Council. In 2000, the library service in Wicklow was preparing for a bright future. Like all public services, it has suffered significantly from the effects of economic mismanagement by the previous Government. Wicklow has already sacrificed 11 library staff to local authority cost saving measures. The service has reached an unacceptable limit. For Wicklow to protect its heritage,
librarians must be hired again. Again, I welcome the Minister's positive response and I am sure he will see what he can do to ensure funding is available. The council has applied for four additional staff for County Wicklow. It is outrageous that somebody was moved from Bray to Greystones because of a retirement. There seemed to be no planning there. In this centenary year the service must be reopened.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	283	I assure the Deputy that the closure of Ballywaltrim local history service is regretted. It was done to minimise the impact on Greystones. As part of the staff sanction application process, the Department must consult with the libraries development section at the Local Government Management Agency, and this is under way. The agency provides oversight for all library services and will have regard to the historical context of which the Deputy spoke and her personal interest in this facility for the people of County Wicklow. On the conclusion of this debate I will make inquiries to ensure no time is lost in getting Wicklow County Council the necessary approval to restore the Ballywaltrim local history studies service as soon as possible.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	284	Amendment No. 4, from Deputy Clare Daly, is new and I will not accept it. The amendment seeks to delete section 34 from the Bill and substitute it with a new section under which the airport authorities could establish new pension schemes only if they replicated the benefits under the existing IASS. We have been over this ground a number of times. If the amendment were to prove acceptable to the House, there would be no need to accept the original section 32 of the 1998 Act, which the amendment replicates. As I said before, the provisions of section 34 do not anticipate or pre-empt whatever solution the parties may come up with. This could even include a continuation of the current IASS if, somehow, the deficit in the scheme could be made to disappear. The Bill does not preclude this outcome no matter how unlikely it is. It does, however, allow for other possible outcomes to the discussions which, if we are being realistic and honest, are more probable than a continuation of the current scheme. The amendment would facilitate none of these more probable and realistic outcomes and would in all likelihood represent an insurmountable barrier to the parties' wish to implement any solution agreed by them. Among the amendments I have tabled today, only amendments Nos. 10 and 13 are substantive. Amendment No. 10 provides that under section 32B(1) the trustees would have the power to amend the provisions of the IASS scheme to cease any further accrual of benefits under the scheme and simultaneously to cease the contribution liability of both members and employers. They will also have the power to make any other changes that are consequential upon any amendment they make in this regard. The exercise of these powers is subject to a commencement order, which I introduced on Committee Stage last week. As I have already explained in detail the background and rationale for the decision, I will not repeat it. The trustees requested that in association with these powers provision should be included in the Bill for making it clear that if and when these powers are exercised, the trustees in the scheme will have no obligation to provide benefits under the scheme in respect of future service. While this is self-evident within subsection (1), I have no difficulty providing the further clarification contained in the amendment, which also requires that the trustees act honestly and reasonably when exercising their powers under the subsection. Amendment No. 13 applies to statutory revaluation as provided for in section 33 of the Pensions Act 1990. On the IASS in the context of the particular proposals which are the subject of current discussions among the parties to resolve the difficulties of the scheme I have been at pains to express, here and in the Seanad, that the provisions in section 34 do not anticipate or pre-empt whatever solution the parties agree to the problems of the scheme.This amendment is, however, designed to facilitate the implementation of a particular aspect of the potential solution which is currently under discussion by the parties on foot of the recommendations of the expert panel. Those discussions are centred on the expert panel's recommendations of mid-June which are in turn linked to the trustees' proposal of last February and the Labour Court's recommendation of May 2013. These proposals are referred to as "freeze and de-risk". The freeze element of the proposals refers to freezing the benefits accrued to the members while the de-risk aspect relates to the adoption of an investment strategy which seeks to minimize investment risks. An aspect of the freeze element of the proposals is the removal of the impact of statutory revaluation on preserved benefits so that future liabilities of the scheme can be locked down. This requires the disapplication of statutory revaluation as currently provided for under section 33 of the Pensions Act 1990. The amendment will give effect to such disapplication. However, under the amendment, revaluation cannot be disapplied in isolation from a decision by the trustees to cease contributions and benefit accruals under subsection (1)(a). This is a prerequisite for the disapplication of revaluation. In addition, I am making the operation of the amendment subject to a separate commencement order which is catered for in amendment No. 14. These safeguards will ensure that revaluation under the Pensions Act will continue as normal unless its disapplication forms part of an overall solution to the problems of the IAS scheme. It will also ensure that active and deferred members of the scheme are treated on an equal basis at all times by the trustees, which is a measure requested by Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas. The provision is being introduced to facilitate the implementation of a particular element of the overall proposal currently under discussion by the parties. This relates to neutralising the impact of future statutory revaluation. If for any reason it does not ultimately materialise as part of the final agreed solution, the provision will not be commenced. On the other hand, I want to ensure that there is no legislative barrier to any resolution of the IAS scheme's difficulties agreed among the parties. All of my remaining proposed amendments to section 34 are technical or represent drafting improvements. These amendments include amendments Nos. 5 to 9, inclusive, and 11 and 12. To clarify matters raised during our earlier discussion on the expert panel's proposal, I note that Deputy Daly is correct to say the €200 million being offered by Aer Lingus and the DAA will go into a new scheme for active and deferred members not the IAS scheme, which will be frozen and de-risked. Pensioners who may face a cutback in their benefits will also not put money into the scheme. They will simply be taking less out of the scheme. Deputy Daly questioned some of the investment decisions of the trustee. As I explained on Committee Stage, my Department has neither the authority nor the competencies to second guess investment decisions made by a pension fund. Pensions policy is a matter for the Department of Social Protection and we have the Pensions Ombudsman and the Pensions Authority. It is not for us to argue about the rights and wrongs of investment decisions made. In any case, such decisions are not reversible. Many people would like to have made different decisions. There are many who would have liked to have bought their homes at a different time or who would have liked to have bought different shares or none at all. Once those decisions are made, however, they are not reversible and we must deal with the situation as we find it rather than as we might wish it to be. It is indeed the case that Aer Lingus has reduced its staff numbers by half in recent years. As a result of that and other reasons, the company has become very profitable. The converse is true that for a long period it was very unprofitable in part because it was heavily overstaffed. Had it not been a State-owned enterprise or had it been another airline, there would have been compulsory redundancies rather than generous exit packages for those who decided to leave. To reply to Deputy Ellis, what is proposed is to eliminate the deficit. That involves reductions in benefits for all concerned. This means reductions in payments in line with the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2013, a 20% cut, a removal of unco-ordination for those who did not pay for it, and the removal of the effect of statutory revaluation for active and deferred members. The companies have made a significant contribution for active members and propose to do the same for the deferred members. On the specific issue of revaluation, the amendment is being included in legislation as it is an important component in the overall freeze and de-risk proposal from the trustees to solve these difficulties. It means that if the expert panel's proposals are accepted, it will be possible to inform the deferred members as to what pension they will get when they start to draw down rather than making it subject to revaluation. It gives those members who are currently deferred members a clear statement of what pension they will receive. Deputy Daly raised the issue of a rule change to the pension scheme. I have checked up on that since we discussed the matter on Committee Stage and confirmed that in order to make a rule change to the pension scheme, the agreement of the trustees, employers and a majority of the members would be required. While I do not think it would be practical in this case to get an agreement to cease payments, I agree that it is not impossible. Certainly, it would be very difficult to achieve what we are trying to achieve in that way, however. We can achieve it through legislation while allowing those who currently pay into the scheme to cease to do so if they so wish, which is what airport workers have balloted heavily to do. There were some questions from Deputy Mathews, Daly and others on fifth freedoms. Fifth freedoms are rights conferred on carriers to fly beyond Ireland to pick up and drop off passengers between Ireland and a third country in which the carrier is registered or established. The draft policy proposes that Ireland's objective in bi-lateral negotiations would be to reach an agreement on the basis of fifth freedom rights on a reciprocal basis taking into account EU criteria on fair competition. Aviation policy is a national policy and proposals in respect of granting fifth freedom rights envisage that a liberal approach will be taken using a case-by-case assessment applying equally to all international airports in the State. I am not aware of any threat by any US carrier to pull out of Ireland. US carriers are very welcome here and do very well on their Irish routes. I am sure they will continue to remain on those routes as long as they are profitable. This is not the major departure in policy that people think. We already have existing fifth freedom agreements with non-EU, non-US countries including Singapore and Qatar. Airlines flying from those countries can already avail of fifth freedom rights. What is intended here is to grant fifth freedom rights on a case-by-case basis. If a carrier wanted to pick up passengers in Dublin and fly them to New York, Chicago or San Francisco, we would not be particularly interested. Those routes already exist and are served by US carriers and Aer Lingus. However, should an airline seek to establish a new route which does not already exist, providing us with new connectivity, we would look at that very favourably. I understand that Aer Lingus and US carriers want to protect their position. It is entirely understandable. They do not want to face more competition. However, it is not my role as the Minister responsible for tourism and transport to represent only the interests of Irish or US airlines or a pilots' or other union. My job as Minister responsible for aviation and tourism is to promote the public interest and what is best for Ireland. If that means new routes and new connectivity, we should welcome those. We have already benefited from Emirates and Etihad coming to Ireland. People have seen that. Deputy Daly referred to Ethiopian Airlines which has announced an intention to run a route from Dublin to Addis Ababa and from there to LA. Currently, we do not have a direct route to Africa at all nor do we have one to LA. It would be in the greater business and tourism interests of Ireland as a whole to have direct routes to Africa and LA. I do not want to refuse an airline offering to open new routes on the basis that Irish or American airlines operating other routes believe it would somehow damage their interests.
#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	285	For the Government to take these amendments together and not accept any Opposition amendments is disappointing. It is one of the reasons I am opposing section 34. I support Deputy Clare Daly in respect of amendment No. 4. In the interest of pensioners and deferred pensioners, I ask that a scheme with no negative impact on the pensioners be put in place. Pensions have already been cut severely, some by €40, and we reckon another €40 will be cut. The future of these people's pensions is crucial because some have been contributing for ten, 20, 30 or 40 years. Deferred members seem to suffer disproportionately and the contributions from the DAA and Aer Lingus do not seem enough. The Minister said that this is all that is on offer, but it is not enough. There is great uncertainty for many people. I am still waiting for answers from the Minister. A deferred member's pension could be cut by 50%. Can the Minister clarify whether this could happen? Some people are in receipt of a pension and many others will come into that position. People in this situation come to my constituency office. The Minister listened to me outlining one case and said such a scenario could happen. If it could happen, it would be a terrible blow to anyone. They could lose €25,000, or half of their pension pot. Some of these people have mortgages and others have bills to pay. They are in receipt of a very small pension. A woman who came in to talk to me about her husband was roaring crying. Members are in receipt of pensions and we know we will receive a certain amount for each term of office. If that were to be reduced, there would be uproar. It is unacceptable that Aer Lingus workers must face this.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	286	I appreciate the Minister's dealing with the draft national aviation policy, which is not on the agenda. I appreciate that he referred to it and is saying that where a route is in existence, that will not be open to non-EU or non-US carriers. Aer Lingus traditionally dealt with the Los Angeles route, so the Ethiopian development is worrying. The Minister said that the appeal mechanism involved the option of the Pensions Ombudsman or the High Court and that the amendment proposed by Deputy Dessie Ellis was unnecessary. I do not accept that. The Pensions Ombudsman has told the deferred members group that it is nothing to do with that office. In the past couple of weeks, a ruling in Britain in the case of a British Airways pilot showed how difficult it is to get an adjudication on workers' interests from a pensions ombudsman. Is the Minister suggesting we will have 15,000 people taking a High Court case as a remedy to this when we could open the State's industrial relations machinery to retired workers? If we can let Kieran Mulvey adjudicate on Garth Brooks concerts, presumably pensioners and former employees should have the right to the State's labour relations mechanisms. The approach of the Minister seems to be to shrug his shoulders at the unfortunate consequences of the mess that is the IAS scheme, as if it were something beyond anyone's control. The reason we are in this situation is down to the employers in the scheme and poor decisions made by the trustees. The Minister is preparing to give the trustees more power but we need an investigation into what went on. I do not accept the point that the pensioners are not contributing money but are just taking out less. Inevitably, that means they are leaving €110 million in the kitty, and existing pensioners, through the cuts being imposed on them, are the only group that have contributed cash to the scheme. The Minister has confirmed that the employers are keeping their money in a separate scheme to offset liabilities. I reject the Minister's point that Aer Lingus was heavily overstaffed. Many of the functions traditionally undertaken by Aer Lingus staff were outsourced to third parties, many of which were without unions and had poor terms and conditions. This is not the way forward and has served to undermine the scheme. The freeze and de-risk strategy has undermined the asset base of the company because of the way the trustees made their decisions and there is irrefutable evidence that some of the decisions were at best questionable. There are severe connections, and if it is not the call of the Minister, the Department of Social Protection should investigate what went on.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	287	In conclusion, to respond to the comments of the Minister as Deputy Clare Daly did, historically the DAA and Aer Lingus, when it was a State entity, employed people to particular staff levels, often at the discretion and direction of the Government, because at times of high unemployment they were often seen as a way of dealing with a lack of economic activity in north County Dublin, parts of Cork and areas of Limerick and Clare. The Minister is right to say they were overstaffed, but that came as a result of State action. It was a legitimate expectation on the part of many of the workers. It is easy to talk about the companies as if they are separate entities and private companies. That is where they are going, particularly in the case of Aer Lingus, but much of the pension liability was built up when the State was the only shareholder, and it is still a significant shareholder. The State is the only shareholder in DAA. It is incumbent on the Government to address the legitimate expectation of the employees concerned. The appropriate course of action is to withdraw section 34 and allow other elements of legislation to establish an independent entity in Shannon before returning to deal with the pensions crisis in a comprehensive way in conjunction with the overall agreement put in place through the expert review group.We must try to find an appropriate mechanism that will not overburden any group of pensioners in this regard. I do not want to rehash what we have said, but people are under severe financial strain and will remain so as a result of the decisions taken. It is incumbent on us to deal with the matter in a more careful way and I hope, even at this late stage, the Minister will consider withdrawing section 34.

On a number of occasions Deputy Dessie Ellis raised a question about a particular constituent, but it is impossible for me to comment on an individual case without knowing all the details. I am not in a position to do so. From what I have seen of the proposals put together over time, whether by the expert panel, the Labour Court or the trustees, somebody who worked for 40 years at the airports or Aer Lingus will recieve a pension in the region of 40% or half of his or her end salary. Even after the cuts being proposed, people will still receive a pension of roughly half their end salary, provided they worked a full 40 years with the company. Therefore, even with the cuts, the pension is approximately the same as what a public servant will receive. People may have had higher expectations and may have expected to receive a pension of 80% or 90% of their end salary, but people here do not receive such pensions . What they get, if they are lucky, is a pension roughly half of their end salary. That is what public servants receive and when this pension fund issue is resolved, the pension benefits will be in that ball park. Obviously, if a person only worked for ten or 15 years, he or she will not receive the same pension as someone who worked for the full 40 years. Deputy Clare Daly has suggested today and previously that deferred members should have access to the industrial relations machinery of the State and the Labour Relations Commission. I understand they did have this access, but that it was removed at some point by legislation. I have not studied the issue of deferred pensions in detail and I am not the Minister responsible for labour affairs or enterprise matters, but on the face of it I believe the Deputy is probably correct that members of the scheme with deferred pensions should have access to these mechanisms. There is an opportunity to restore them through the just published Workplace Relations Bill which will bring together the Labour Relations Commission, the Rights Commissioners Service and the NERA. Perhaps this might be the appropriate mechanism to restore access. It cannot be done under the State airports Bill.
#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	289	From day one, I was very unhappy about how the Bill was being brought through the Houses. As it is a Bill dealing with the Shannon Group merger, the pensions issue should have been dealt with separately in a separate Bill. We should have been able to deal with it on its own because it has such far-reaching consequences for many people, many of whom invested heavily during the years. The Minister has mentioned that many people do not realise they will not receive a full pension and, in many cases, will end up with a figure of only 50% or 60%. Anyone who invests in a pension scheme believes he or she will receive exactly what he or she is told he or she will get. In his response the Minister answered the question I put about a person with a deferred pension after three or four years or even sooner. He indicated he or she could end up losing half of his or her pension pot. People have been hard done by and many good amendments have been brought forward. I am opposed to section 34 and believe we need to look at this issue more comprehensively and separately to dealing with a merger. We need to debate it more thoroughly. It was wrong to include it in the Bill.

They are generally aimed. We have been at pains to highlight several issues at Shannon in recent years and we have been rather disappointed at the Government's inaction despite the glaringly obvious when it comes to the Americans' use of Shannon for purposes that do not always meet international law obligations. The Bill going through the House, soon to be passed, does not really address the problem of the US military use of Shannon. We are concerned that it is more designed to making it easier to curtail protests at the airport rather than ensure that the country fulfils its international obligations. These include the need to check the aeroplanes coming through Shannon because we are facilitating some very poor practice on behalf of the Americans. It has reached a stage where Shannon is practically an outpost for US military activity in the Middle East and beyond. I will read an extract from a pamphlet by Shannonwatch produced by Mr. John Lannon. He addressed the issue of international and humanitarian law in respect of Shannon. He states:The protection of civilians from the effects of armed conflict is a long-standing and important branch of international law, known as international humanitarian law (IHL). IHL is best known through the Geneva Conventions. These comprise four treaties and three additional protocols, and they set the standards in international law for humanitarian treatment of the victims of war. In addition, the Hague Convention (IV) 1907 represents commonly accepted rules of engagement that outline the means and methods of warfare. These conventions are binding on all states as international customary law. The 1907 Hague Regulations and the Fourth Geneva Convention, plus certain provisions of Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions, spell out the duties of an occupying power. The Fourth Geneva Convention sets rules intended to protect civilians in times of war and to minimize the harm inflicted by armed conflict, including harm to internees and the population in occupied territories. According to many scholars, the Fourth Geneva Convention is considered to be international customary law, which all states should abide by regardless of their status as a State party to the convention. The killing and harming of innocent civilians by the US forces in Iraq and Afghanistan are in violation of the Fourth and Third Geneva Conventions. Furthermore Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention prohibits forcible transfer of protected civilians from occupied territory, and as a result extraordinary renditions from Afghanistan and Iraq are grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions. Shannon Airport has played a part in these violations for many years. International humanitarian law also contains basic principles and rules governing the weapons used in war. It prohibits or restricts the employment of certain weapons, means and methods of warfare. Combatants are prohibited from using weapons that are inherently indiscriminate or are of a nature to inflict suffering greater than that required to take combatants “out of action”. The use of weapons that cause widespread, long term and severe damage to the natural environment is also prohibited. Specific treaties prohibit or restrict the use of certain weapons. These include biological, chemical, blinding laser or incendiary weapons or bullets which explode or flatten easily in the human body. There are reasonable grounds for believing that some of these may pass through Shannon Airport. The Minister probably does not need me to tell him that most of the people who have died in Iraq in the past 25 years did not die of bombs landing on their heads but of the after-effects of the bombing of their areas. More than 500,000 innocent people who played no act or part in any aggression towards America have died because of the types of weapon used by it in Iraq. War crimes are serious violations by a country, its civilians or its military personnel of international humanitarian law. The idea is that an individual can be held responsible for the actions of a country or that nation's soldiers. War crimes are divided into two broad categories. First, crimes against peace, which include the planning, preparation and initiation of a war of aggression. Second, crimes against humanity are violations of the rules covering the means and manner by which war is to be conducted once begun and include the killing of civilians, indiscriminate bombing, the use of certain types of weapon, the killing of defenceless soldiers, ill treatment of prisoners of war and attacks on non-military targets. Under the principle of universal jurisdiction, Ireland may investigate and prosecute foreign nationals when, for one reason or another, their countries of residence or origin will not, cannot or have not. As many of the people suspected of perpetrating war crimes in Iraq, Afghanistan and the occupied Palestinian territories use Shannon Airport, they could and should be arrested by the Irish authorities. Ireland has given the Americans carte blanche to use Shannon as they see fit. We do not seem to care about the end result or how many people, including civilians, die in the name of the American mission to bring democracy to the world, stability to the Middle East, or whatever they call it. All we know is that the effects have been detrimental to world peace. For a country like Ireland to take a position of neutrality would be a step towards that world peace. This week, the living daylights have been bombed out of the Gaza Strip again, because Israel can do that. I beg to differ with anyone who believes that these actions are measured and fair. A spokesman for the Israeli authorities appeared on RTE's "Morning Ireland" today and told us that there was no blockade of Gaza. We all know there is. What happens in the name of policing the world, which the US likes to do, is unfortunate. That we are complicit is also unfortunate. We are not innocent bystanders. We facilitate mass murder by the American war machine. The US does that for different reasons. Running for President of the US costs at least €1 billion. If most of that money comes from the arms and oil industries, one cannot possibly expect him or her to cut back on defence spending or adopt a serious approach to tackling international environmental problems. This is unfortunate. We cannot control what America does, but we can speak out against it, call a spade a spade and address the fact that its behaviour is often disappointing. The favourite method under President Obama is the use of drones. Countless women and children have been killed by drones that are being used to take out someone in a village. The US seems to believe this is okay. The person being taken out does not even get the chance of a trial. Often, we do not even know what he or she is guilty of doing. Given the Americans' financial power, their foreign direct investment in Ireland and their creation of jobs, we seem to believe that we cannot hold them to account for their military use of Shannon. That is not right. The companies investing in Ireland are making good money and we charge them very little tax for doing so. They would not up and leave if we started to take a responsible position on Shannon. This morning, Margaretta D'Arcy returned to Limerick Prison in a Garda car. She will be there for two weeks because she had the courage to highlight how all is not well in how we behave in respect of Shannon. The judges at Nuremburg were direct and accurate when they stated: "Therefore [individual citizens] have the duty to violate domestic laws to prevent crimes against peace and humanity from occurring." This is what Ms D'Arcy did. One might say that she is not allowed on the runway and should not be out there, but it is sad that it takes a 79 year old woman in poor health to draw attention to the fact that the Government does not take responsibility for Shannon. We are allowing the airport to be used by the US military for poor reasons. For the life of me, I do not understand why any of our recent Governments, including the current one, did not have the courage to check the aeroplanes to verify they were in compliance with international law. We would not be shooting Americans or calling them liars. They might say we can take their word that there is no need to check the aeroplanes and that everything is grand, but we would not apply that rule to anyone else. If a garda at a checkpoint stops a car and suspects there may be drugs in the boot, he or she would not just accept the driver's word that there was nothing there and wave him or her on, but that is what we are doing at Shannon Airport.It would improve Ireland's standing in international terms if we had the courage to say that from now on we will check the planes to make sure that everything is being done properly and that international law is being complied with. That is not such a bad thing to do. If the Americans say that everything is fine and that they are not breaking the law, that is fine too and they will not be guilty of anything if everything is grand. I do not know why the Americans would be worried about it. Why would we be worried about checking them?  WikiLeaks exposed the fact that a Fianna Fáil Government was complicit a number of years ago in this whole affair and it was pretty obvious that neither the Army nor the Garda was allowed to check the planes because they did not want to see what they might find. They were being informed that there was a very good chance that extraordinary renditions, which are illegal, were happening. They could have checked the planes to see if this was happening but, no, they did not want the answers. Since then, the Garda has always refused, despite the evidence at the time, to check the planes. It appears as if an instruction was given, even though it will not be confirmed. Despite asking the former Minister for Justice and Equality and the Minister for Foreign Affairs on numerous occasions, was an instruction given at any stage to our police authorities not to inspect planes that land in Shannon that could be used for illegal US military purposes that contravened international law, we were never given an answer to that. It is very disappointing that no progress has been made on it. Different people in opposition, including the former Tánaiste, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, were very adamant that the planes should be checked and that this was not good enough, but when he went into power his view was that the Americans say that everything is grand so everything is grand. Everything was not grand when he was in opposition but it was grand when he was in power. That is one of the reason politicians in this country are lowest of the lowest in terms of public perception. We are probably lower than the failed builders and developers and that is saying something.

Given that new arrangements are being made for Shannon Airport, it is a good time for us to take a good look at the use of Shannon and at ourselves in terms of the role we play in international politics and how we deal with international and humanitarian law. It is about time that we took responsibility for the land that we have. At present we are allowing Shannon to be used as a US satellite to carry out things that contravene international law. I have read many of the statistics about Shannon and with regard to the amendments, I highlight again that we are conscious of the fact that some of the measures being introduced may make it a bit more difficult for peaceful protest and that they still do not address the possible illegal use of the airport. One would like to think that Shannon Airport would be a public space. I would also be a bit wary that some law, rules and regulations are being introduced which are a little different from what applies in other airports and I wonder is Shannon being treated as different and, if so, is it because of the US military use of same. I appeal to the Minister in that respect.  I did not hear it said but I heard that my good friend, Deputy Daly, passed on some compliments to the Minister on his role as Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport. Despite some differences I have had with him, especially his decision to use my former company's tax problems to defend the former Minister for Justice and Equality, I too would be an admirer of him. He is one of the more capable fellows on the Government side and if he ends up in the Department of Health or in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, I hope he will make a better fist of it than some of those who have been there before him.

#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	331	This is a hugely important aspect of the Bill. Like Deputy Wallace, I previously had the privilege of being a witness on behalf of Margaretta D'Arcy and Niall Farrell in their court cases when they were brought before the courts for allegedly interfering with the proper use of Shannon Airport. This goes to the heart of what we are discussing here. It would be completely wrong to ignore the giant elephant in the room, that is, the fact that Shannon Airport operates, in essence, as an ancillary or key part of the US war machine and without that business and that volume of traffic it would be a very different place. Are some of the measures being introduced in this part of the Bill being done to curtail the protesters who have inevitably gathered there as a result of it being an appendage of the US military and are we enshrining sufficiently the State's necessity to fulfil our international obligations under human rights law to protect our neutrality and ensure that we as a country are not engaged in activities which undermine citizens in other parts of the globe? That is the purpose of the amendments we have put forward. Deputy Wallace has obviously forgotten that since the last occasion Margaretta D'Arcy has had a birthday and an 80 year old woman was transited to Limerick Prison earlier today for a two-week custodial sentence because she would not sign a bond and give an undertaking that she would not interfere or go on to the runway at Shannon Airport again and as a result of that she has begun today again serving a sentence in Limerick Prison. I salute her and stand in her shadow because she is absolutely magnificent. About four weeks ago she and her colleagues in Shannonwatch gave a presentation to the petitions committee on how during the past decade and more they have consistently protested at that facility because of the ongoing use of Shannon to facilitate the US war machine. During that presentation, Margaretta D'Arcy highlighted the fact that the runway will be given over to allow a short sponsored run on it for a suicide charity and that she felt it was an appalling affront to the victims of suicide that the airport would be given over for such a measure when in the normal course of events the runway was being used to facilitate the slaughter of innocents. She said she would prefer to go on to that runway and blow herself up than be part of a state that would condone or turn a blind eye to our participation in what is going on.  It is in that same vein that we put forward these amendments because Shannon Airport is not a proper airport. I made the point on Second Stage that during the course of the trial of Margaretta D'Arcy and Niall Farrell two weeks ago Tom Clonan, the defence correspondent with The Irish Times, made the point that he had been engaged in discussions with the leadership of Hezbollah.It pointed out that it was disappointed with the State for facilitating this not at Shannon Airport but at the airport in County Clare. The journalist made the point, probably not inaccurately, that many people in Ireland did not know that Shannon Airport was located in County Clare. Clearly, the leadership of Hezbollah knows exactly where it is located. It was disappointed that a neutral country would facilitate the American war machine in the manner in which Ireland was doing. What does this do? It exposes Irish peacekeeping troops in Syria and other areas of the Middle East to unwanted attention and Ireland as a potential target, of which people in Ireland do not take sufficient account. Also critical is the role we are playing in the slaughter of hundreds of thousands in Iraq and Afghanistan. I put it to the Minister that, without access to Shannon Airport, much of this activity could not continue. We need to take another look at this issue. There is a precedent in this regard. For example, in Horgan v. An Taoiseach it was deemed that the use of Shannon Airport was in breach of Ireland's neutrality. However, the view of the Judiciary at the time was that while it was not permissible for Ireland to allow troops engaged in belligerent activity and so on to move across it, it was beyond its remit to make a point on this and, that it was, in fact, a matter for the Legislature.  At every turn, every relevant Minister from whom we have tried to get answers on this issue has failed to respond. As legislators, we have not been able to address this issue, which is hugely frustrating. Earlier this month I tabled a question about the countries of origin of the aircraft that landed at Shannon Airport. When I had tabled the same question previously to the Minister for Defence, his response was that he did not have the information and that I should seek it from the Minister for Foreign Affairs. When I did so, the reply included a list of 35 countries which had had aircraft land at Shannon Airport in the previous 12 months. It was a lengthy list and contained the names of countries of which I had never even heard. However, what was omitted was the number of occasions on which aircraft from each of these countries had landed at Shannon Airport. I tabled another question last week about the number of times aircraft from these countries had landed at the airport, the reply to which was a little peculiar in that the list supplied on the day, 8 July, contained 24 fewer countries than the list provided with the reply on 1 July. However, the information provided on the countries that had sought permission to land at Shannon Airport during the previous 12 months was illuminating. Eleven countries had sought permission to land as follows: Bahrain, one; Belgium, two; Canada, five; Croatia, three; Egypt four, which is a little worrying as I do not why Egyptian aircraft would have had to land four times at the airport. One wonders if it is a case of my friend's friend can land here and so on. The list continues as follows: France, seven; Germany, four; Italy, eight; Malaysia, one; Mexico, one; and the USA, 630. In response to our consistent questions on why hugely expensive wide-bodied US aircraft carrying military personnel were toing and froing twice a day across our airspace and had landed here 630 times in the previous 12 months the Government's response was that they were not carrying arms or involved in any military activity.

#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	357	I am focusing on the amendments which deal with the requirement to search aircraft. The section deals with the power of authorised officers at the airport. The amendments specifically seek to include in the section that authorised officers be required to conduct searches of such aircraft. I was trying to explain why this was necessary and detail all of the channels we had gone through to have the issue dealt with, only to be ignored at every turn; how protestors at Shannon Airport had done everything in their power to highlight the issue and how the Judiciary had responded by saying it was one for the Legislature. In addition, more than 100 requests to search aircraft have been lodged with An Garda Síochána, but this has not happened. The purpose of the key amendment is to require the authorised officer whose powers the Minister is changing to address the issue of the searching of aircraft. There are a couple of reasons it needs to be addressed on a legislative basis. As the Minister will be aware, the Air Navigation and Transport (Amendment) Act 1998 is the domestic legislation that gives effect to the Chicago Convention. The convention monitors how civil aircraft and so on are dealt with. It is deemed that every country has autonomy over its airspace and in this regard, can lay down its own rules. The Air Navigation Foreign Military Aircraft Order 1952 provides, "Every foreign military aircraft flying over or landing in the State on the express invitation or with the express permission of the Minister shall comply with such stipulations as the Minister may make in relation to such aircraft". When we previously raised this issue, we were given assurances that all 630 US aircraft that had landed during the previous 12 months at Shannon Airport had been carrying no arms, ammunition or explosives; that they were not engaging in intelligence gathering and were not part of military exercises or operations. However, the legislation does not stipulate this. Has this been decided in a subsequent ministerial order and, if so, when was it put in place? I put it to the Minister that that criteria are not being adhered to in that no searches have been carried out by the Defence Forces, members of whom have been present for more than 300 landings during the past year, or An Garda Síochána. We know from Dr. Tom Clonan who has been on board some of the aircraft that weapons were being carried. We know from the error which occurred last year when weaponry was carried outside the aircraft that many do carry weapons. We know from US military policy that soldiers are not allowed to travel without their weapons which are not brought to them on a later Ryanair flight: they must carry their weapons with them. It will not be known if weapons are being carried until the aircraft are searched. I echo Deputy Mick Wallace's point that the onus is on us in this regard.We would be doing a good thing and fulfilling our international obligations if we paid attention in that regard. I wish to deal briefly with the amendments as they stand. The first-----

#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	375	The first amendment in the group seeks to amend the Minister's proposal and substitute "stop a person at the airport for the exercise of any of his or her powers under this section". This amendment is based on certain fears I have. In the air traffic and navigation legislation, the wording is quite specific. People are concerned that stopping a person in this context gives one a total carte blanche to stop anybody anywhere for any reason whatsoever. Our amendment stipulates that a person can be stopped only for the exercise of powers under the relevant section. The Minister may feel that is implied in any case. Perhaps it is - I do not know - but the fact that we are specifying it is helpful. The second amendment is to delete a section that refers specifically to the inclusion of part of the by-laws that are already in existence. One could say we know the by-law exists in any case, but my point concerns why a bit of it is being brought into the main body of the legislation. That has caused extreme concern. Is Shannon Airport to be singled out for special treatment? Is the measure being introduced to enhance the powers of the State or authorised officers, which this section deals with, in order to deal with the legitimate community protests in the area in question? The next two amendments, Nos. 21 and 22, are linked and deal with "human trafficking, smuggling, kidnapping or other illegal transportation of persons". As Deputy Wallace mentioned, the amendments deal specifically with rendition and other unlawful activities which, it has been established without question or doubt, have been facilitated through allowing the use of Shannon Airport. To confirm this, we have only to read the editorial in The Irish Times from April of last year that deals with the research that was carried out on rendition flights from the United States. It made the point that much of the practice was facilitated by Ireland. Under human rights and civil legislation, we have a responsibility to incorporate what I propose in this body of legislation that is dealing with Shannon Airport. If we do not do so, it will be a little remiss of us. The next amendment, No. 23, implies that if an authorised officer encounters any activity he believes to be facilitating human trafficking, rendition or another such activity, he has a responsibility to intervene immediately and seek assistance for those concerned. The most important amendment in the group is to include in the legislation the power of an unauthorised officer to search. In the context of all the points I made and the fact that Irish people have spoken out time and again about their desire for Ireland to adhere to its policy of neutrality, there is an onus on us to carry out searches. There is no way the aircraft, which travel around the world, land in Ireland twice a day for nothing or that they are not carrying arms and are not involved in anything. Given the volume of traffic, one might believe those in the US military have a large number of holidays. Clearly, that is not the case. The dogs in the street know the military personnel are carrying weapons and that Irish neutrality is being breached. In much the same way as Deputy Dooley put it to the Minister, I put it to him, in the remaining hours of his brief, that we are not looking for anything extra. Under the Chicago Convention and the Air Navigation and Transport Act, we have the right to control our own airspace and establish our own conditions. We want the Minister to include the condition I propose, which is lawful in any case. He should do so in the body of the legislation on Shannon Airport, because one cannot talk about Shannon without talking about the US military.
#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	376	If the Minister changes post, I wish him well. Everyone else has wished him luck and I would not like to be the one left out. The Minister has always been very straight with me in answering questions. In debates on this Bill, we have dealt with Shannon and pensions. However, there is an issue associated with Shannon Airport that most people find morally unacceptable, including me and my party. There are flights to Shannon that are not properly checked. People have actually been taken from their countries in other parts of the world and brought to certain locations via our airports. This is just unacceptable, and it is a breach of international law and our neutrality. No matter how one dresses it up, that is how it appears. Amendments Nos. 19 to 23 would strengthen how Shannon Airport is monitored, how aeroplanes are examined and how people are authorised to do their work. It is very important that there be proper procedures for ensuring there is no human trafficking, smuggling, kidnapping or illegal transportation of people. The amendments provide supports for victims of breaches. It is not appropriate that Shannon Airport receives revenue from allowing rendition flights. The Minister mentioned before that we honestly do not know what is on the aeroplanes. Obviously, members of the Garda and the airport police cannot gain access to the aeroplanes. We can only go by what people are telling us, which is that not only civilians are being transported but also weapons and troops. By any stretch of the imagination, one would be considered an ally of a country, be it at war or otherwise, if one were assisting it in this regard by allowing its personnel on one's soil to transport people from another state through one's airports. The Minister stated there are already checks and balances at Shannon Airport, but the only reason we do not check the flights is that the United States is an ally. That is not a sufficiently good reason for not checking the flights and adhering to proper international best practice. Whether the Minister likes it or not, the vast majority of people in Ireland have serious concerns and are pretty angry.They might not be out on the streets or going to jail like the 80 year old woman, Margaretta D'Arcy, but I am convinced that the vast majority of people in this country are quite angry that we allow this to happen. Whatever arrangement or deal the Government has made, I do not believe it is acceptable and I do not believe Members accept it. We have an opportunity in this Bill, through these amendments, to insert some extra rules and provide some type of regulation to deal with what and who is on these aeroplanes. Many of these people have been taken away from their families in other countries, moved from one country to another, landed on our soil and then taken to what are effectively internment camps. Whether they are guilty or not is not the issue. The issue is that we are accepting them on our soil, so therefore we are as guilty as those who are landing them on our soil. That is how I and many other people view it. It is a breach of our neutrality and nobody can tell me otherwise. I cannot imagine anybody believing it is not a breach of our neutrality. We constantly say we are a neutral country, yet we allow this to happen. The amendments are quite reasonable and strengthen the system for how the Garda and the airport police deal with people in our airports. It is good that we should do that. It is time we revisited the issue of these rendition flights. It is no good telling me that there are fewer such flights. The reality is that if there is only one, it is a shame on us.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	377	I will not accept these amendments, on the basis that there are already sufficient powers in existing legislation. While I appreciate the intent of the Deputies in wishing to restate the powers of authorised officers to search aircraft and conduct interviews, there has not been sufficient time to discuss them with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Department of Justice and Equality and the Garda Síochána. Separately, I wish to point out that section 48 applies to all of the airports, not just Shannon Airports. This is not a special provision for Shannon Airport but is simply a restatement of existing law and it applies to all of the airports. I am advised that An Garda Síochána has extensive powers of entry, search and seizure available to it as part of its duty to prevent and detect crime in order to protect the constitutional rights of individuals where there are reasonable grounds to suspect that an offence is being committed. In addition to these powers, under section 18 of the Air Navigation and Transport Act 1988, as amended by the Air Navigation and Transport (Amendment) Act 1998, to satisfy the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport that the necessary security and safety standards are being complied with, an authorised person or a member of an Garda Síochána has the power to first, enter any airport and inspect the airport and any apparatus, equipment or other thing therein; second, to enter any aircraft at any airport and inspect any apparatus, equipment or other thing therein or thereon; third, to require the operator of the airport or, as the case may be, of the aircraft concerned to furnish within such time as the authorised person may specify such information as he considers necessary for the purposes of the inspection referred to in paragraphs (i) and (ii); and, fourth, to restrict the operation of the airport or detain any aircraft during such time as is required for the exercise of his powers under the section. It is reasonable to point out that sufficient powers already exist in law for the Garda or authorised persons to inspect aircraft, question people or inspect an airport. The point perhaps being made by Deputies is that while the law might be in place, it is not being enforced. I will return to that later. There are also specific arrangements in place governing military aircraft and commercial aircraft carrying munitions of war. By law, foreign military aircraft may not overfly or land in the State without the express permission of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, as set out in the Air Navigation (Foreign Military Aircraft) Order 1952. As a matter of policy, Ireland does not allow foreign military aircraft overflying or landing in the State to be armed, to carry arms, munitions or explosives or to engage in intelligence gathering; nor may they engage in military exercises or operations. Requests for diplomatic clearance of overflights and landings of foreign military aircraft are sent from the embassy of the country concerned directly to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. After consulting with relevant stakeholders, the Department makes the final decision on whether to permit the overflight or landing. Diplomatic clearance is generally granted subject to assurances from the embassy that the conditions outlined are being met. In accordance with international practice, foreign military aircraft passing through Ireland with the permission of the Government are not subject to routine searches or inspections. The principle of sovereign immunity applies automatically to foreign state or military aircraft, as it applies to Irish State or military aircraft abroad. The Government will continue to follow the practice of previous Governments whereby, in accordance with international practice, details to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade by diplomatic missions are accepted in good faith as being accurate. Based on this practice, information provided to other states by Irish diplomatic missions seeking diplomatic clearance for flights undertaken by the Irish Air Corps is similarly accepted by those countries to be accurate. The carriage of weapons and munitions on commercial or civilian aircraft is prohibited under the Air Navigation (Carriage of Munitions of War, Weapons and Dangerous Goods) Order 1973, as amended, unless an exemption has been obtained from the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport. My Department operates a procedure under which airlines wishing to carry weapons or munitions through Irish airspace or airports apply on a standard form. My Department seeks the views of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade with regard to foreign policy issues, the Department of Justice and Equality on security issues and the Irish Aviation Authority on aviation safety issues. A copy of the application is also sent to the Department of Defence. If any of these bodies objects, the Minister does not grant an exemption. On occasion, exemptions have not been granted. The majority of exemptions granted relate to aircraft carrying military personnel accompanied by their personal weapons, but the exemptions issued under this legislation may also cover some flights carrying arms, ammunition and explosives. Munitions which are indiscriminate in nature are generally refused. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will object to an exemption being issued if there are foreign policy concerns about the type of cargo on board or the intended recipients. Any person with credible information that Irish airports have been used for any alleged unlawful purpose, including human trafficking, smuggling, kidnapping or other illegal transportation of persons, should immediately report their concerns to An Garda Síochána, which has the responsibility for investigating such matters. On the basis of such reporting or any other information, where the Garda reasonably suspects that an offence is being committed, statutory powers of entry and arrest are available, as I have outlined. It is considered that all reasonable, appropriate and sufficient measures have been, and are being, taken to ensure that Irish airports are not being used for unlawful activity. With regard to so-called extraordinary rendition, the Government has on several occasions made it clear to the US authorities that it would be illegal to transit prisoners for rendition purposes through Irish territory without the express permission of Irish authorities, acting in accordance with Irish and international law. The US authorities, for their part, have confirmed that they have not done so, and would not do so without seeking the permission of Irish authorities. The assurances Ireland has received in respect of such allegations are clear and categorical relating to the facts and circumstances within the full control of the US Government and were made at the highest level. The Government will continue to follow the long-standing practice whereby assurances given to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in this area are accepted in good faith as being accurate. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has clearly stated that Ireland does not and will not permit the use of Irish airspace and Irish airports for flights associated with so-called extraordinary rendition, a practice to which the Government is firmly opposed. Certainly, I am not aware of any instruction given to the Garda not to search aeroplanes. Having been in office for just over three years, I am not aware of there being any unlawful rendition through Irish airports. I did ask. I have not adopted a "don't ask, don't tell" approach to this. On taking office, I asked if there was anything I needed to know about Shannon and unlawful rendition and I was assured by my senior officials that there was not. The number of military transits is falling. The number of troops going through the airport has been falling recent years. Most of the troops travelling through Shannon are travelling to and from bases in other European countries or in countries where the bases are in those countries at the request and invitation of the governments of those countries. The vision for Shannon which is laid out in this Bill is not as a military airport. The vision for Shannon of the future is of a very busy civilian airport, transiting civilian passengers and cargo to and from Ireland and surrounded by an aviation industry hub.That is very much the vision that is enshrined in this Bill for the future of Shannon. It is not designed to be an airport that is kept open as a result of military flights and the contents of the Bill demonstrate that.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	378	The Minister began by saying there are sufficient rules and regulations in place. Nonetheless, there is no oversight or scrutiny and no independent assessment. It reminds me of the situation with Priory Hall. People were hopping up and down, giving out that the building regulations are terrible in Ireland. The building regulations are not terrible in Ireland; they are powerful. The problem was we were not implementing them because there were no independent inspections and rogue builders could build badly and get away with it. It is all very well to say sufficient rules and regulations are in place in Shannon and that we have nothing about which to worry. Unless there are inspections, however, we do not know the truth. While the Minister says it is not his area of responsibility, I would say we should make the inspections obligatory and there would then be no grey area. The Minister said the airport is not being used for the transportation of arms or for military exercises in any form. Again, unless we have obligatory inspections, we will not know whether that is true. The Minister said we take their word in good faith. I am sure Angela Merkel feels a little different about that now she has found out the NSA was bugging her telephone, even though she thought they were on her side. These are people who I do not believe have proved worthy of their word and I do not think their word is worth tuppence. The Minister said the rules are geared towards developing the airport as a civilian airport. I certainly hope Shannon grows as a civilian airport. It would be great if it were to develop in a serious way and became an even more powerful civilian facility than it is at the moment. However, that does not change the fact we should not turn a blind eye to any power, the US or otherwise, breaking international humanitarian law when using our airspace. The only way we can address that issue is through obligatory scrutiny and independent assessment.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	379	The Minister made the point that there are already sufficient powers on the Statute Book to deal with these issues. However, I put it to him that this point applies to all of the component parts of the amendment that he put forward on Committee Stage in that all of those powers were also there sporadically, dished out around the place, but the Minister chose to bring them into this Bill. To do that without bringing in the other powers, which he acknowledges are there in terms of the State having the ability to search, is a serious mistake. It is like the former Minister for Justice and Equality asking the Garda Commissioner, "Any problems with the operation of the guards?", and being told, "No, there aren't, Alan. Move along", and then saying that everything was fine. We all know where that ended up. This is very similar. An Garda Síochána does have powers but it does not exercise them, and there has to be a reason for that. There is a double standard at play here. The Minister is probably aware the US authorities chose to search the Irish Government jet on a trip Bertie Ahern took a number of years ago. There was no Third World War and the Irish State did not go crying, roaring and screaming. It accepted it, sucked it up, the aeroplane was searched and that was that - move on. It is not a big deal. It is normal international protocol for an independent state that has control and sovereignty over its airspace, and there is nothing unreasonable about that. Deputy Wallace is correct that we cannot trust a single word coming from the American authorities. I am not saying that flippantly. We know it because of the practices that have taken place, which are beyond dispute. The United Nations and others have spoken about the use of rendition, including the use of rendition through Shannon. It is widely speculated that Chelsea Manning was trafficked back through Shannon and there is evidence that the Gulfstream jet which is often in Shannon and which was sent to pick up Edward Snowden, although they did not get him, had landed in Shannon that night also. I want to echo the points made. We are complicit in torture and murder unless we exercise our neutrality, our sovereignty and the powers that exist at the moment. Assurances are not nearly good enough. It is in the interests of all citizens that these amendments are accepted in order to enhance the powers that are already there. Maybe, for once, we might carry them out and get the information I am under no illusion does exist.
#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	380	I find it difficult to understand when the Minister says he accepts the word of the American officials or the Embassy when representations are made in regard to different flights. It has been proven time and again that they have been economical with the truth. What is wrong with having the flights searched? What is wrong with having a situation where gardaí or the airport police would have the opportunity to examine any aeroplane at random, if they so choose? I do not see anything wrong with that. I have had the experience of talking with people from Arab countries. They view us as not being neutral. They view us as part of the problem because they see themselves as under siege from America, Israel and so on. They view it differently, whether we like it or not. Therefore, we are putting our people at risk at Shannon Airport - that is the reality. There is a risk to people at Shannon because we do this, whether we like it or not. I do not understand this. I experienced being extradited to England by aeroplane so I know the way the system works as I have seen it first-hand. I can tell the Minister it is far worse and far different to the image that is portrayed. The same thing happens in America, where I met Palestinians who ended up in jail there. I heard of the way they were treated and the way they were brought on aeroplanes from other countries to America. That is the reality. I do not see any reason that we should not have a situation where we can inspect these aeroplanes and not be confined to taking the word of a Government, an Ambassador or otherwise. I believe it is wrong.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	381	I do not have much to add. I reiterate that this section applies to all of the airports, not just to Shannon. What we are doing here is updating and restating the existing powers of authorised officers at the airports. The powers of officers are set out in several different Acts dating from 1973 to 2004. Some of the language used in those earlier Acts does not reflect modern usage and needs to be updated, but no additional powers are being provided here for authorised personnel. In the short time that was available, it was not possible to ascertain the validity or otherwise of including the Deputies' amendments in a Shannon Bill as such amendments would have required consideration and proper engagement with the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Garda Síochána. I should also point out that the amendments as proposed do not provide for obligatory inspections or even random inspections and that we continue to accept diplomatic assurances from the United States in regard to military and Government aircraft as it and other countries accept ours. As an aside, I was not aware the US had searched the Government jet during the then Taoiseach, Mr. Ahern's period in office. I was interested to hear that. I am not sure whether they were acting on a complaint or evidence, or whether it was a random search.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	382	Maybe he was smuggling. To sum up, we have made our points and the Minister has made his. I would encourage him to encourage gardaí at Shannon to carry out their duties of care, duties of crime prevention and duty to comply with Irish and international law and conventions. They can do that only by checking the aeroplanes but it seems the Minister is not prepared to make that obligatory.We have heard that gardaí are not allowed to check. It would be great if someone in the Government recommended that they do check, even if it is only sporadic. Mr. Colm O'Gorman of Amnesty International which, God knows, is not a radical organisation asked: How we can speak out about human rights if we do not apply them ourselves? Ireland is not an innocent bystander. We have been complicit in kidnapping and torture by allowing Shannon Airport to be used as a stopover for rendition flights. In a Red C poll last year 78% of the people of Ireland said they would be in favour of the State taking a position of neutrality and enshrining it in the Constitution. This is something the Government should consider. Taking a position of neutrality is about promoting peace in the world and it would be brilliant if we were to take a strong stand on the issue.  We know that Mr. Julian Assange has been in the Ecuadorian embassy in London for almost two years. Despite the fact that he was granted asylum by Ecuador, he is not allowed to travel there. The United Kingdom is in breach of international law and has breached the rules on asylum, which is very disappointing. I would like the Government to express its concern that international law is being breached in not allowing Mr. Assange the asylum he was granted by Ecuador. He is in the Ecuadorian embassy and has not been out in the fresh air for over two years. This is a guy who exposed a lot of wrongdoing around the world and is paying the price for it. It would be great if Ireland was to take a neutral stand and highlight the unfairness of his plight and treatment.

I am in broad agreement with the provisions of the Bill, the importance attached to the establishment of Shannon Airport as an independent body, the bringing together of the assets of Shannon Development, notwithstanding my reservations about the viability of the combined entity. I hope, as a result of the decisions taken here, that we are on a path towards a viable future for Shannon Airport as an independent entity. On behalf of my party, I hope we can reach a time when a business plan for Cork Airport can be achieved that allows it, too, to operate independently. The only obvious point raised by a number of us through the Stages was our concern at how the pension provisions are included in the Bill. We have had that discussion, and it rests. In welcoming the overall provisions of the Bill I wish the Minister well in the deliberations at Cabinet and Government level over the coming days. While I would not want to pre-empt the outcome of the discussions, if this is the Minister's last act as Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I would want to pay my respects to him as somebody who has discharged his duties in a most effective, fair and honourable manner. He has shown his capacity to deal with complex legislation and political issues appropriately at all times in a way which seeks to include the views and concerns of all Members of the House regardless of their political hue or origins. That was not the case among people who occupied his position in the past, or many others at Cabinet of any political party.For many, Deputy Varadkar has stood out as a Minister who has taken a fresh approach to involving Parliament. In dealing with legislation, he has sought to break down party political barriers. When ideas have come forward from any side of the House, he has sought to include them. Many of his colleagues and others who might occupy high office in future could learn from the example the Minister has set in his short time in Cabinet. I wish him well in his future career. He has set a standard for others to follow.

The viability of Shannon Airport and the merger that is taking place is very important. I am disappointed that we did not have a separate Bill to deal with pensions, as that issue is far too important and extensive and has huge implications not just now but into the future for many families who are in receipt of pensions and whose pensions are deferred. Overall, there are some good aspects of the Bill and I wish the Minister all the best in case he is not around to see it through to the end.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	394	I thank all Members who contributed to the debate for their kind words and candour as well as for doing the important job of parliamentarians, which is to hold Government to account, point out flaws in Bills and propose improvements to them. I am genuinely grateful for that. The journey with Shannon began some three years ago when the initial decision was taken to separate it from the other State airports. While there is another session in the Seanad after this, a great deal of important work has been done in the last three years. The Bill provides the legislative framework for a new Shannon group and a successful airport situated amid a successful aviation hub. It preserves the possibility of separating Cork Airport in future and provides a legislative framework for what I hope will be a resolution to the problems in the IAS pension scheme, allowing pensioners and future pensioners to have some security about their pensions. This has been an ongoing problem. I hope an agreement can be reached and that the legislative tools being put in place in the Bill will facilitate people in coming to a satisfactory agreement. The Bill further provides for us to adopt the alternative of the Cape Town Convention, which is designed to hold and advance our global position in aircraft leasing, which is particularly important to our economy. I extend my thanks in particular to the officials in my Department who have been working on the Bill night and day for a very long time. They include Mary Dunning, Paddy Campbell, Matt Benville and, from the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Stephen Curran. I also thank my special advisor, Brian Murphy, for whom this has been a special project. I extend my thanks to Rose Hynes and Neil Pakey, the chairman and CEO of Shannon Airport Authority, respectively, as well as to the board and staff at Shannon, Shannon Development and the board and staff of the DAA.

I said yesterday that it was amazing to anyone outside the House that such a thing would be excluded from a list of strategic investment projects. The most strategic need in the country is social and affordable housing for the 100,000 families on the housing list. Just before I came to the Chamber, I was contacted yet again by another family whose members have been sleeping in their car for the last couple of nights. This is not the first case of which we have heard. I could cite a whole number of other cases I have on my books. My cases must be very different from those of the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, given that he has seen fit to leave this strategic need out of the legislation. I am amazed that the Tánaiste is not sitting beside the Minister of State, as she suddenly discovered over the weekend and talked loudly to the media about social and affordable housing and a low pay commission. She must be Rip Van Winkle and have been asleep for the last number of years. It is blatantly obvious that there is a crying need for housing to be built. We need to include social and affordable housing because there are 100,000 families on the housing waiting lists of local authorities. There are also 100,000 families in mortgage arrears or distress. We have seen an increasing number of repossession attempts in the last number of weeks, yet the only plan the State currently has for the building of social housing units is for 449 units to be built. I have searched high and low and that is the entire number of social housing units, as far as I can see, that the State plans to build. By way of contrast, an average of 3,300 social housing units was built in every year between the 1890s and the 1990s. Now that we have a housing emergency and it is obvious that there is a need for public housing, the State talks about providing 449 units in the next couple of years. There have been two major occasions in the history of the State on which a serious attempt was made to provide social and affordable housing. From 1932 to 1948, 53,000 local authority homes were built. We had a smaller population of 3 million people at that time. The per capita equivalent for today's population would mean the building of 79,500 units over a similar timeframe, or 4,500 per annum. In the 1930s and 1940s, ten times more housing was built than the current Government is planning in a country that was impoverished and in the grip of a recession. The 1970s was the second period during which the State intervened to take action. From 1971 to 1980, 64,170 council homes were built, again against the backdrop of a much smaller population of 3 million to 3.5 million.In today's population figures, it would amount to 8,500 to 9,600 houses built each year if we use the 1970s as our model. One third of housing was social housing. We see the ideological aversion to social housing by Governments, including this one, in the past number of years. It started with Fianna Fáil and is continuing with Fine Gael and the Labour Party given that the latter holds that ministerial position. In the 1970s, 15% of all households lived in a council or local authority house, a figure that decreased in the 1990s to 8%. In the boom, significant house building took place but much of it was outside of people's price range and was overpriced. Only 10% was social housing and we have a serious crisis on our hands because Governments failed to listen to advisory groups. The National Economic Social Council, NESC, advised in 2004, when there was so much money in the country that 73,000 new social housing units should be built in the following six to seven years, amounting to 9,000 houses per year. That was completely ignored. The Government is introducing significant legislation that involves up to €6 billion being used for strategic projects. The building of homes can be commercially viable. We need affordable homes for the working poor who are priced out of buying houses and who cannot get mortgages. This is a major blockage in the banking system. Cheap rates could be provided for working people. We also need social housing for people with no prospect of buying a house. The Government has the power to include the building of social and affordable houses and apartments in these projects and it is absolutely essential to do so. It is also essential councils discuss the matter and arrangements are made to allow councils to undertake house building. It should not just involve housing agencies as local authorities have a track record of building houses. I call on the Minister of State to accept the amendment if he wants to be taken seriously by the electorate, who have clearly identified housing as a key issue in the recent elections.

The Secretary General of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government appeared and I asked him about the financing of social housing. His response was that the Department is actively utilising the strategic investment fund to seek private equity and private investors in social housing. This was the response and I think there is no exclusion in doing so. It is actively operating on this basis.

The Ireland strategic investment fund, ISIF, is money spent on joint ventures. A number of criteria apply to it, one of which is that the majority holding cannot be in the hands of the State. There must be a public private partnership, which is not something new for the National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, which is part of the NTMA. The NDFA has been working with bundles with an accumulated cost of over €20 million and has built many schools and other facilities for the State through public private partnerships. On Second Stage, Deputy Higgins was present when I spoke in response to Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett about this point. The money can be used to build social housing. However, it can only be used in such a way that it is a public private partnership or if the State is not the main investor. If it were, it would be on the Government balance sheet. Deputy Coppinger is incorrect in saying her constituents are different from mine. In different local authorities, we know about the housing needs, all of which must be met. This is a clear way in which funding can be used and I understand proposals are being examined. It would be a productive use of the funds if it meets the criteria. On the Government and Opposition sides, there are no differences in what we want. We want social housing, job creation and the rules of the funding mean the criteria to which I referred apply. A public private partnership will work and if people can be found to co-invest, it makes a significant difference. I remember Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett making a proposal on this issue on Second Stage. We agreed that the points made by the Deputy made sense in the context of the rules of engagement for this fund. There is no issue.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	401	There is a huge difference of approach between our view of how the disastrous crisis of housing need is to be resolved. The Minister of State keeps repeating that his party and the Government are well aware of the extent of the crisis, which raises the question of why the Government has let it get to this extreme. I listened with some incredulity to the Tánaiste and Minister for Social Protection expressing her heartfelt urgency to construct social housing. She must have fallen off a horse on her way to see the Taoiseach to be nominated as Tánaiste and had a sudden revelation after three and a half years apparently unaware of the extent of the suffering of ordinary people. How seriously can we take the Government in this regard? The Minister of State sits there as part of a supposedly sovereign Government and tells us that the Government will allow itself to be constrained from putting money from the National Pensions Reserve Fund into the construction of public housing as a Government and as a public authority. Why does the Government have to go scouring the highways looking for private contractors when there was, traditionally such as in the 1970s, social housing in the State? There were problems in the 1970s but in 1975 8,700 homes were built by local authorities in one year. The Government is submitting to the right-wing neoliberal agenda dictated by the European Commission and its bureaucracy. If that is not the case, what is the problem? In the 1970s, up to 8,000 houses a year were produced by local authorities. What does our amendment, which is one of a series, suggest?First, we want to ensure that the agency may, in consultation with Ministers, develop proposals for public investment in those sectors, including social and affordable housing, in order to support economic activity and employment and provide urgently needed infrastructure at the same time - in other words, social housing. We have included all of this here - necessary infrastructure for people who are suffering and in need of a home and a kick-start for economic activity, which will rebound with more employment in communities and more resources to go around, which will help turn around some of the disasters of austerity. Our fourth amendment in this group makes a proposal regarding the functions of the agency, providing that it can enter into an arrangement with the Minister for Education and Skills in regard to the provision of school structures. We want this to say that it can "... enter into any arrangement or contract with a Local Authority or a public housing agency to finance the construction of social and affordable accommodation projects and the provision of the necessary social infrastructure necessary for such projects." By any moral standard, does it not make eminent sense that this should be the policy? Therefore, I defy the Minister of State to explain what is wrong with the idea that the State and the National Treasury Management Agency, or whatever name the Government wants to call it when it is performing this function, should go in with local authorities and finance the construction of social and affordable housing projects for people to rent and affordable homes for people to buy, when they could in this way resolve the housing crisis? If, for example, we accept that eight good-quality social houses could be built at a cost of approximately €1 million, then €1 billion could give us 8,000 houses. If we invested €3 billion or €4 billion over a period of years, we would have approximately 30,000 homes, which would begin to address the disaster and quickly deal with the excess numbers on housing lists by providing homes for people. This would also free up thousands of spaces in private accommodation which could be used as transitional accommodation for people in desperate need. Will the Minister of State explain in language we can all understand what is wrong with this? If local authorities could do this in the 1970s and deliver at a rate of 4,000 to 8,000 units year after year, why in 2014, when these funds become available, can the Government not undertake this major project for this huge social need?
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	402	On the same theme, we discussed this on Committee Stage and we have been trying to inject a sense of urgency in the Dáil on this issue over the past three years, because this crisis is getting worse. Finally, we have an opportunity to do something about it. When this issue was first raised and when we said the solution was to build council houses rather than rely on the private sector, the response of various Ministers was to throw up their hands and ask where we were to get the money to build council houses, because the Government did not have it. We do have the money. We have €6 billion. If we spent this money, or a significant portion of it, it would be money well spent, no matter what way we look at it. Spending it would have multiple benefits. First, it would benefit the 100,000 families on council housing waiting lists, some of whom have been waiting for ten to fifteen years for a council house. These people would benefit enormously by finally getting a secure roof over their heads and security for their children, with all the enormous benefits for the cohesion of society and the creation of a stable environment for children who lack that currently and are pushed from pillar to post in a private rental sector which is out of control and where rents are unaffordable for huge numbers of people. The other enormous benefit would be in terms of the revenue or finances of the State. Why do private developers get involved in housing and why was housing at the centre of the boom, not just in this country but internationally? Simply, the reason private investors are interested in this area is that they know everybody needs a house. People will always require a roof over their heads. Therefore, from the point of view of investors, housing was a sure-fire way of making money. Developers were not interested in housing people, but they knew people needed to be housed and knew they could make money. Of course, that profit-first approach to housing, regardless of the impact on the economy or housing provision based on need, had disastrous consequences for this economy and the global economy. The value for the State in taking this on would be that it could regulate a housing market that has gone out of control. That chaos in the housing market, driven by its almost complete privatisation, was what led to the collapse of our economy and the global recession. This issue was at the heart of the international crisis. This occurred because people interested in housing purely for profit completely dominated the market. If, instead, a significant proportion of housing is provided by the State on a not-for-profit basis, we can regulate the market and stop prices and rents getting out of control. Not only this; the State would save significantly in regard to all the money we are currently pouring into the pockets of private landlords. Between leasing schemes, rent allowance and so on, this probably amounts to €750 million. This is money out the door, lost for ever and of no benefit to the State. The State spends all that money but gets nothing in return. It has no assets at the end of the process. If the State built houses, it would get a return on that revenue. The private sector understands it can get such revenue, but why can the State not see that building council houses would be a secure source of revenue for it? It would save on rent allowance payments and have a regular stream of money coming into its coffers. The Minister of State has said that in so far as the State is considering using the fund in this way - I am glad it is considering this - this housing must be co-funded with the private sector. Why is this necessary? The private sector already has enough of the housing market without letting it into this area, which the Government seems to acknowledge we must return to. Why, however, must this return be dependent on the private market? Presumably, the Minister of State will have several answers to this question.I assume one of them involves a reference to EU state aid rules. If that is the case and the rules require that we cannot provide housing for our citizens unless some gombeen in the private sector can make money out of it, that is a terrible indictment of us for signing up to them in the first instance. What sort of rules are these? Let us consider to where they led in the context of the public private partnerships, PPPs, that were the flagship projects in housing provision in Dublin. I refer to the regeneration projects at O'Devaney Gardens, Dominick Street and St. Michael's Estate. What happened at these locations was an absolute bloody disaster and it has had devastating consequences for communities that invested a great deal in trying to make the projects work. However, I think they were always sceptical about the PPPs involving Mr. McNamara. A great deal of energy, resources and work were invested over many years in trying to achieve some balance in respect of these PPPs in order to ensure people would be provided with proper housing, but what happened? All of the resources allocated were absolutely wasted, although many consultants made a hell of a lot of money out of the entire process. The process in question has been ongoing for ten or 15 years and the most recent indications are that we are going to return to the PPP model. What Mr. McNamara and the other guys involved in the PPPs to which I refer wanted was to grab some of the land attached to O'Devaney Gardens. As part of their agreement to co-invest in the regeneration project, they insisted on being allowed to grab approximately one third of the land involved when the flats were knocked down in order that they could make a pile of money. If the project had proceeded, the community at O'Devaney Gardens would have lost some of the space available for the building of council houses as a result of the condition in question. However, nothing happened and no houses were delivered. Would it not have been more sensible to do it the old-fashioned way and just build the houses ourselves? It goes on and on. There are similar examples of the same carry-on in Dún Laoghaire, including at a little Ballymun flats-style complex in a place called Mounttown. It took approximately 15 years from the time the flats were condemned as being uninhabitable for a new estate to be built due to the fact that the project was completely dependent on private developers, three of whom went bust. It was an unbelievable shambles.

#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	404	I am discussing them. I am highlighting from the point of view of the stability of the economy, providing housing for those who need it and improving the public finances and creating a revenue stream for the State which it could use in providing public services, housing, etc. why we need to use the relevant funds to invest directly in fully public housing. That is what has been repeatedly sought from the Government. If we are hamstrung in this regard by EU rules on state aid, that is a disgrace. We should be kicking up absolute murder and refusing to comply with them. To be honest, I sometimes think what I am referring to is used as an excuse. There appears to be an almost ideological predilection to involve the private sector in these projects, even when it is self-evident that this approach has failed. I love the phrase "market failure". There has never been a more spectacular example of market failure that in this matter. That is precisely why we need a strategic investment on the part of the State to fill the gap left by the absolutely disastrous market failure we have witnessed. However, the Minister of State has indicated we can only do this on condition that we get the market on board. That is just laughable. We must do something rather than submit to this nonsense. Where there is a will, there is a way. I honestly believe a way could be found to circumvent EU state aid rules, particularly if there was a commitment on the part of the Government to do so. It would be money in the bank from the point of view of the State. I have not even mentioned the employment that would be created for building workers and the savings to which this would give rise within the social welfare system and so on. It would be a win-win if we were to decide to do as I suggest. That is what amendment No. 11 is about and some of us on this side of the House have been screaming for the Government to do it. Let us accept the amendment, establish what is suggested as a strategic priority for the State, its citizens and the economy and begin the process of investing the money directly without having to depend on cowboy private developers.

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	416	In such circumstances, I ask the Minister of State to take a precise note of the points we are making and respond to them in the language used by ordinary people.  This is a very simple matter. There is €6.9 billion which is owned by the working people and pensioners of the State and which is currently invested in commercial enterprises and corporate entities across the globe. The idea is to bring it back to Ireland and invest it here in order to create economic activity and jobs. I agree with this. However, it is clear that this project is being refracted through the ideological prism that is the current Fine Gael-Labour Party Government. There is the potential to utilise the funds to which I refer in housing provision and put together State-wide projects that would meet one of the most critical human and social needs in the country and alleviate some of the worst suffering being experienced by individuals and families who do not have homes. All we are seeking is that we follow, to some extent, the example of what was done in the 1970s in terms of the numbers of houses local authorities can construct to meet existing need. Many local authorities did not build houses last year and that will be the case again this year. In that context, the amendment suggests the agency have the power to enter into arrangements with local authorities or a housing authority established by the Government in order to facilitate the provision of social and affordable housing. Why is it necessary to opt for privatisation and funnel substantial funds into the pockets of builders and developers, many of whom wrecked the country and its economy through their profiteering in the past and who one can now meet on their way out of NAMA? As what we are suggesting is the moral and sensible thing to do, let us hear the Minister of State's argument against it.
#RuthCoppinger	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-party	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-dob	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	417	What we are seeking is the inclusion of social and affordable housing in these projects. The Minister of State has assured us that they will be included, but they are not even listed. That is the point. If they are going to be front and centre in the context of this fund, they should appear on the list of projects. I am amazed - I am not really - that the Minister of State referred to PPPs. The legacy of public private partnerships in the area of housing is disastrous. As previous speakers indicated, people in the inner city have been left looking at empty buildings as a result of the use of such partnerships. I know that the Minister of State has an ideological aversion to anything to do with public investment or funding.The private sector, however, has no interest in building anything. I have just come off Fingal County Council but recently I attended a presentation there. There are 13,000 planning permission applications in the council area but not one of them is being taken up in any serious way because of the logjam in the banks and because developers do not believe that they will get a return. The Government is looking to those in the private sector at a time when they have no interest. By the way, there is nothing socialist about this; this is Keynesianism. This is what was done by the State in the 1930s and the 1970s in particular when the State had to step in. Socialism involves taking the wealth out of the hands of the tiny private elite and using it completely to solve the ills in society. I suggested that the constituents of the Minister of State must be different from mine because I do not know how the Minister of State can leave his office and not have the issue of this fund front and centre of the agenda. By the way, this is taxpayers' money, not the Minister of State's money. This money was put in by workers for the pension timebomb etc. and now it is being used. The Government lost most of it in the bailout but there is a little left. The Government should at least try to solve the problems for the people who did not cause the crisis in the first place and who have been left without homes.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	418	I would like to hear from the Minister of State about the problem the Government has with taking on board what we are asking for. I have never heard a convincing argument from that side of the House about why we should not and cannot do that. It is not that we want to take political potshots and accuse the Minister of State of ideological this, that or the other. I simply cannot get my head around how the Government does not see this. We had denial for two and half years. Then, in recent months, finally, there has been an acknowledgement that we have a major problem. Of course the problem has been absolutely staring us in the face. It is spilling out onto the streets and it is a disaster. There are 50 families in south Dublin in cars; they do not even have emergency accommodation. It is an absolute disaster. Finally there is an awareness that we must do something. Is the Minister of State seriously telling us that we simply have to wait for the market, private investors and hedge funds? That simply will not happen. The idea is that by putting the money into big public building programmes of local authority housing now we would see multiple benefits. Can the Minister of State explain why the Government has set its face against that? What is the problem? It was done before and it can be done again. No one else is going to do it.

There is one consideration foremost in the mind of anyone looking to buy a commercial property or a residential property as an investment, that is, whether the owner will have tenants. There would be guaranteed tenants because there are 100,000 people on the social housing list. This means a guaranteed rental income yield from an investment in social housing. Can the Minister of State explain why there is a need to involve the private sector as a third party? Is it not possible to construct an arrangement on commercial terms between this fund and local authorities or housing agencies for the construction of social housing, using the resulting rental income to deliver a return? When I was young we lived-----

The reality is that the opportunity we had then is denied to many people nowadays. At the time my parents used a scheme to move on to private ownership and avail of a grant of £5,000. This was approximately 30 years ago. For them and for many others social housing became a steppingstone to private ownership. For other people this will not be the case but there is nothing wrong with that. Social housing can be an end in itself for many people. Anyway, the opportunity is simply being denied to thousands of families because social houses are not being built, the sector has ground to a halt and there is a major deficit at the moment. Will the Minister of State explain why it is impossible to construct a commercial arrangement whereby some of the funds could be used to construct social housing to meet the crisis need that exists?
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	422	This issue was hammered out well in committee. The members of the Government are talking the talk in terms of the crisis in social housing and we are supposed to give the Government a bualadh bos because three years into its term of office it is recognising that it is a bad thing to keep social housing boarded up, rather than released in towns and villages throughout the State, and that we need to start constructing social housing to meet the demands of the citizens, particularly in our capital and other cities throughout the State. Amendment No. 10 adds a clause to the effect that the agency would be required to bring forward proposals in respect of investment in those sectors to support economic activity and employment. It does not commit the agency to invest any money. No money would be committed by the agency to any area. It is a question of the agency bringing its expertise to bear on proposals for investment. I would rather see social housing included in the directed investment part of this legislation such that the Government could direct investment into social housing to address the crisis. We should spend some of the €6.9 billion on social housing. However, this is a more modest amendment which allows for the agency to bring forward proposals for investment in the sector to support economic activity and employment. Any investment in social housing supports economic activity because economic activity would flow from it naturally. The construction of social housing would bring employment as well. It is a question of how the agency would consider investment proposals. I support amendment number 11. It goes further in respect of real investment in this area. Anyway, there is no reason whatsoever for the Government to dismiss amendment No. 10 since it only calls for proposals to be examined by the agency. The Minister of State may argue that the agency does not have the necessary expertise but we are creating the NewERA agency on a statutory footing. The Government should let the agency acquire the expertise. One of the things inherited by this Government is a long social housing waiting list. The Government has exacerbated the problem by deciding not to construct social housing over its term of office, but this is not unique to the post-Celtic tiger period. The lack of social housing in this State has been a recurring theme throughout successive Governments and over many decades and generations. Let us develop the expertise whereby the agency can come forward with proposals for investment in the social housing sector, as it would in the forestry, telecommunications, water or energy sectors.

I understand I have a time limit and I will be as clear and simple as possible in my communications. What is this legislation doing? I hope the Deputies will vote for it because it will allow €6.9 billion of capital which is invested outside the State to come back into the country to work to create jobs. Furthermore, it will create, in the investment protocols therein, a return to the agreed public private partnership. Deputy McGrath made an important point about commercial investment. These have to be commercial investments. A question was asked about State investment and commercial investment. Deputy McGrath can explain to Deputy Higgins that if it is done by the State only, then it goes on the Government balance sheet. However, if the State is not the majority participant, then it is off the Government balance sheet. Let us suppose a given amount of money can be used to build 100 houses. If we get an equal amount of public private partnership funding we can build not 100 but 200 houses. This legislation does not include housing per se, but the conditions will allow for public private partnerships that existed under the National Development Finance Agency, NDFA. For example, as part of the €110 million allocated to building bundle 3 schools in recent years, 7,500 school places were provided for students around the country. The quality of the build was such that those schools won the world finance best European education project of the year award in 2013, Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland awards and so on.

Both sides of the House want this to happen and agree that the more money that is invested the better. I have no problem with doubling the money.

The law the House is passing tonight and that I hope the Opposition will support does exactly what the Deputies and the people want. Public housing or other projects can be built if a project meets the criteria and is not on the State's balance sheet.

I submitted a written question last week. Six families have been helped by the Tánaiste's much publicised initiative with Threshold. Something is wrong somewhere. Obviously, the Government has no interest because it did not fund the initiative properly, not enough people were available to answer telephones, it was not well advertised etc. According to Focus Ireland, one family per day loses a home in Dublin because of rent increases. I estimate that the number must be higher. The Government's feedback does not indicate any urgency in this regard. The private sector has no interest in engaging in the building of social housing. Landlords have no interest in accommodating social housing tenants, are getting rid of them and will not accept rent allowance. This is why the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme will fail. Despite this, the Government expects private sector developers, who are not capable of building houses on their own, to begin building them for social and affordable housing purposes. It will not work. It is a law of capitalist economics that the State must intervene when the private sector has no interest, but the Government will not do so. Families will continue to suffer without social or affordable housing because of an ideological aversion imposed by Fine Gael and the troika. The troika's insistence that the Government cannot add to the State's balance sheet makes for depressing news for the hundreds of thousands people who cannot get houses. While I was a councillor, I asked the council manager to request a loan to build social housing. I was given the same reply, that the Government did not allow it. What happened to fair competition? The Government is excluding councils that would like to build houses from doing so while it looks to the private sector to do the work. Everything that the Deputies across the way represent is abhorrent. They will allow this problem to fester instead of acting decisively and building houses for people who need them. Government Deputies will look to the same people who crashed the economy in the first place and have not got their acts together since the recession. It will not work. Knowing this, why does the Government continue bowing to the tenets of the troika and claiming that nothing can be added to the balance sheet even when there is a dire social need? This is disappointing for people, but it must be well publicised. The Government is talking the talk about social housing and the Tánaiste has been rabbiting on about it for the past week, but there is no path towards providing that housing for those who need it.

Strictly, that is correct, but it is fair to state the Government has redrafted some of the amendments I proposed in a Government amendment, amendment No. 23, the one to which I will be speaking. When the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund was announced, I felt there was a major shortcoming in the plan for it. The fund has the potential to amount to €15 billion, but no effort or thought was put into where the money might end up. It is important because the section dealing with the fund is about commercial investment in parts of the country that have been subject to no foreign direct investment in the past 30 years. Some 80% to 85% of foreign direct investment in the recent past has been in Cork, Dublin and Galway. IDA Ireland's efforts to attract a certain percentage of foreign direct investment to parts outside these urban areas have failed badly. It is clear and is now being admitted by IDA Ireland that regional aid incentives have also failed. The Ireland Strategic Investment Fund is probably the only stimulus package the country will see for years and the way it has been put together is such that potentially 90% of the money could end up going to Dublin. The fund was formerly called the National Pensions Reserve Fund. When one considers that ownership of the pensions reserve fund was intended to be held for the entire country, what has been happening seems unwise and unfair. We could have circumstances in which 90% of Ireland Strategic Investment Fund moneys could end up in Dublin. There is some evidence to suggest this might be the case because of investment trends in the past 30 years. The Government's amendment involves a reporting requirement which is necessary to remind the administrators of the fund and relevant Ministers that an account of where the money ends up is as important as the investment. There is no earmarking of specific amounts for Waterford, in my case, or County Donegal. At the very least, the question of where the money does not go needs to be a policy consideration. That is what the reporting requirement will achieve. It is the first time that an assessment of regional investment, or the lack thereof, has been required in law in a major financial measure. That is very important. If one were coming at this legislation cold or reading the reporting provision for the first time, one might say the amendment, as drafted, was fairly standard. It is not. If one examines fairly major financial measures, one will find that there is no similar provision. This is extraordinary in itself when one considers what has happened in the past 20 or 30 years in respect of investment. It actually amounts to a tacit acknowledgement by the Government that there is a regional imbalance. In fairness, there is a certain honesty associated with the amendment. The critical point is that the Department of Finance has actually put it in black and white. That was the point of it. I appreciate the meetings and time made available, but, more than anything else, I appreciate the acknowledgement that there is an issue. When I spoke to others, including Ministers and secretaries general, they all agreed with me, but the reality was that nothing ever happened. For this to be put in writing is the significant point. Perhaps this is down to the way the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, operates. It probably has something to do with the fact that he is from Limerick also. I believe he agrees with the points I have been making in recent months on what has been occurring economically in a few urban areas and what has not been occurring almost everywhere else. The significant parts of amendment No. 23 are paragraphs (f) and (g). Paragraph (a) refers to “an assessment on a regional basis of the impact of the Fund’s investments on economic activity and employment”, while paragraph (g) refers to “an assessment on a regional basis of the distribution of the investments made by the Fund”. These two measures should probably be standard in every significant expenditure measure from now on. With every big ticket measure, we need to consider where the money is and is not being invested. At the very least, there should be a requirement for an assessment of where money ends up being allocated to and the impact it has, or otherwise. The Government needs to compensate across the board for the fact that there has been no appreciable recovery in parts of the country. I hear about national recovery, but there has been no recovery in some parts. There has been a general improvement across the country, but certain local economies are still stagnating, at best. That is why amendment No. 23 is significant. It acknowledges that there is a regional imbalance and that more attention needs to be paid to efforts to track and spread investment around the country.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	448	I certainly agree with Deputy John Deasy on the need for balanced regional development, about which there is no question and for which I have always fought. As a member of Dublin County Council, for example, I noted the problems faced in Dublin involving too much pressure on services, including transport services, and inadequate infrastructure which did not benefit from proper investment. It has been clear for decades that development is considerably imbalanced, as is evident from the fact that virtually one third of the population of the State is in the greater Dublin area. It would certainly be to the benefit of society and communities nationally to have balanced investment. The great difference between Deputy John Deasy and me is that he believes this will come from private capitalists and I do not. Experience in the past five or six years shows that it will not come from private capitalists. What private capitalists have done to the people of Waterford, in particular, in recent years is an outrage on many fronts. The dissolution of Waterford Glass, for example, was an economic crime against the entire society but particularly against the people of Waterford. In a part of the country that desperately needed industry there was an A1 industry of worldwide renown. It is not gone entirely because there are some small developments involving craftsmen and craftswomen, but in reality the industry could have been developed as a national resource had it been taken into public ownership when the private capitalists were walking away. What was done to the workers in Bausch + Lomb was breathtaking. Again, a private multinational is involved. I certainly agree, therefore, on the issue of agency funding. Social housing, an issue we have discussed, is one phenomenon that would ensure balanced development because it is needed in every part of the country. Finally, amendment No. 15 seeks to insert the phrase “with emphasis on the provision of necessary, publicly owned infrastructure”. Publicly owned infrastructure is the key point. We have heard about the disaster of trying to rely on a private sector in which the developers and big builders are driven purely by profit. When that goes awry, as it has, communities are left high and dry. We have seen that to be the case all over Dublin, with community redevelopment projects that are simply stranded because a private developer has gone bust.

The Government's amendment is welcome. I would have liked the Government to go further with regard to what Deputy Deasy suggested. It is one thing to report but another to act. However, at least it gives those who wish to see balanced regional development the tools to argue the case. Investment in the Border, midland and west, BMW, region is a case in point. There were commitments by the previous Government to invest a certain amount in greenfield sites outside Dublin and Cork, and that was reported on an annual basis in the annual report, as is suggested under this amendment. Time and again one saw that the commitments or targets laid down were never reached. It was great to have the report so one could be informed that the Government was failing to reach the targets for foreign direct investment in greenfield sites. What would have been better - in this regard, it is a pity that it appears the earlier amendments will not be accepted - is a commitment to balanced regional development, not just a report on it. However, I welcome the fact that in the annual report we will be told how well or how unsuccessfully, as the case may be, balanced regional development is affected by this fund. There is another welcome aspect to this. "Balanced regional development" has disappeared from the dictionary, in my view. I see that time and again in Donegal. We see increases in job numbers but that does not filter through to counties such as Donegal. Much of the focus is on getting the State going, but not on looking at the impact and whether it is flowing to the regions. That is important. While we must get the country going again, and it is important that an overall net number of jobs is created and that there is investment and so forth, it is equally important that there is a balance between the regions. The Government must refocus its energy on that. For that reason, I welcome the Government's amendment. However, talk is cheap. We must walk the walk, not just talk the talk. Amendment No. 19 seeks to delete a number of provisions in the Bill. Section 42 deals with directions to make certain investments. This is one of the most worrying areas in this legislation. The Government is providing itself with the ability to use the moneys in the National Pensions Reserve Fund which will be available to the agency and to direct the agency to invest those funds in two situations. This is where the earlier discussion on the amendments tabled by Deputies Coppinger and Higgins comes into play. There is no clear ability within the legislation for the Minister to say, with regard to the environment, housing, water or any such important issue, that he or she wishes to use the State's resources in the National Pensions Reserve Fund to invest in these vital areas. The only areas in which that is allowed are as a remedy to a serious disturbance in the economy of the State - while we would argue that social housing is a disturbance in the economy, I do not imagine that is the intention of the Government - or to prevent serious damage to a financial institution in the State and to ensure the continued stability of that system. It goes on to provide that for either or both of those purposes, the Minister may give directions to the agency to invest assets of the fund in specified securities of a credit institution or to underwrite or otherwise support the issue of any kind of securities of a credit institution. The provision is very clear. They are the two things that can happen for either of the above occurrences. When we refer to a serious disturbance in the economy, I do not think it is a reference to 100,000 families on the housing lists, people having to live in their cars on the streets or, indeed, the growing number of people who are homeless. It is more than likely referring to credit institutions again. This is what scares the bejesus out of me - that this Government will do exactly what the previous Government did in-----

It scares me that the Government would do what the previous Government did in 2009, which is to deplete the resources in the National Pensions Reserve Fund and invest them in broken banks. If one looks at the percentage returns the National Pensions Reserve Fund was securing for its investments, they were quite healthy at 6%, if memory serves. However, that €21 billion was whittled down to today's figure of €6.9 billion, because the Minister decided to direct investments into broken banks. While this started with the Fianna Fáil Government, this Government finished the job and finished it spectacularly by using most of those resources to pump into AIB and Bank of Ireland. Why would we put a provision like this in legislation? There is money available to the fund and it is clear that this is about trying to refocus that money on investments in Ireland that will get the country's economy back up and running, but the only way a Minister can interfere with the running of that fund or direct where that fund should be spent is in respect of broken banks or some other type of financial institution. That is simply wrong. This refers back to what I said earlier and yesterday. By using that mechanism in this legislation and because it is a direction and not an order, it does not necessarily mean that it must be approved by the Houses of the Oireachtas. This is one of the reasons that this legislation is deeply flawed. Nobody in this House, although other Members might challenge this, has demanded that this legislation be brought before the House as many times as I have demanded it. This legislation was originally announced in August 2011 in respect of the ability to refocus the National Pensions Reserve Fund on investments in our economy instead of in economies across the globe. Time and again we have asked about the legislation. However, what the Government has decided to do - with a number of good legislative measures, it must be said - is to include other provisions with it. It includes this provision, originally introduced by Fianna Fáil, which allows it to whittle away this resource if a banker comes knocking at the Government's door again, saying, "We are in trouble. We messed up again. We need your resources, or the ATMs will not work," whereupon the Minister will sign the order or direction and tell the agency to put all its plans on hold as €2 billion or €3 billion must be put into the institution.That is simply bad policy and bad politics. It is what got us into this mess in the first place, and we should not be looking at it again. The Minister of State has also attached other sections to the Bill which have damaged it, particularly the whole issue of NewERA and the mechanism that allows for easier privatisation of State assets. This section of the Bill is simply not on and it should be deleted. While the provision may exist in statute already as a result of the 2009 amendment by the then Government, that does not mean it should be continued. It should be discontinued. The money Irish citizens put into the National Pensions Reserve Fund should be invested for the good of the Irish economy, not for any other reason. The Government should be big enough and bold enough to do this. We were told three years ago that there was a revolution and that there was a new way of doing politics. The Government should stand up today and say that the old way is finished and that it will not allow itself in legislation the ability to whittle away people's hard-earned money that rests in the National Pensions Reserve Fund and put it into broken banks. It should say that it will end that provision in the law introduced by Fianna Fáil because it wants to make sure the people's money is invested to build our country again, not invested in broken banks and in bailing out the bankers and developers of the future.

I totally oppose this section and believe it should be deleted. This is meant to be a stimulus package for investment in projects, yet a provision is being written in for another bailout if it is ever needed. Already, €21 billion has been put into two banks from the National Pensions Reserve Fund, and it is now down to €13 billion, so €8 billion of pensioners' money has been lost. There should be no provision written into this Bill to lose more money if the call is made. Some €64 billion has already been poured into the banks and the bailout of the bondholders and the developers who crashed this economy, as has been well recorded. We need funds for investment to create jobs for the almost 400,000 people who are unemployed, the people who are emigrating every day of the week and those who need a roof over their heads, not to step in and bail out another credit institution. It is ironic that it is written into section 42 that the money can be called on in the public interest. In the last debate we had, the Minister of State told us that nothing could be done unless it involved the private sector, but when the public interest is at stake, he is providing in the Bill that we can use public money to bail out these private institutions, which, obviously, they would be. I am totally opposed to this. We need schools in my constituency and in many others, we need homes and we need job creation. We do not need a charter for another bailout with taxpayers' money.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	467	First, on the regional development amendments which I believe were championed by Deputy Deasy, and which the Government appears to have taken on board, I believe he is absolutely right. Far too often in Irish politics, in my observation, there has been a city against country, or rural against urban, fake war or fake debate which is sometimes used cynically by politicians on either side of the supposed rural-urban divide to play people off against one another. Sadly, some politicians on the left - not our bit of the left but other bits - have gone along with that, rather pathetically in my opinion, in a cheap effort to buy votes in urban areas. They will point the finger at the people in the rural areas and say they are getting everything, while politicians in the rural areas point the finger point back and say they are getting it all in the cities. It is a cheap political game, but when one actually looks at the issue seriously, one can see we need balanced regional development. I have no doubt Deputy Deasy's motives are honourable ones and involve looking at the issue seriously. As a Dublin Deputy, I am deeply worried about the over-centralisation of everything in Dublin, which is not good. It is not just bad for the countryside; it is bad for Dublin. It produces a whole series of ills and evils, one of which is the craziness we are seeing in the property market again, which produces issues like the housing crisis because everything gets centralised in one place. Of course, this is the way the market works. The people with the big money, like lemmings, chase each other to where they think they can make the most money, regardless of the wider interests of society, the economy and balanced development - not just at a regional level but balanced development in every sense of the word - and regardless of the need to make sure that investment is directed and planned in such a way as to have a sustainable, cohesive and balanced economy and society. Of course, the big difference between the big money people and the lemming is that when the lemming charges over the cliff, it is the lemming that goes over the cliff, but with the big money people, it is we who go over the cliff, and the big money people win every time. I believe, therefore, that these amendments point towards the need not to have profit and the bottom line as the main, or only, criteria in deciding where investment goes. The starting point of the strategic investment fund should be a recognition of market failure and of the market's lack of concern with balanced development and with strategic priorities from the point of view of society and the economy as a whole. Whether it is in ensuring we have balanced regional development or the necessary infrastructure we need to make a society work properly, such as social housing, that is what the strategic investment fund should be about. That emphasis on regional development is critically important. It is good that the Government has acknowledged that point and added an amendment to that effect. However, what I do not understand is why, if the Government sees a need for that, it does not wish to spell out the need for balance in other areas, such as housing and critical infrastructure. I just do not understand it. Is it because the Government is sensitive to the accusation that it is deserting its rural base and, therefore, it feels it has to include this, but there is less concern when it comes to other areas where balance and planning, to use an old-fashioned word, are needed? We need planning in investment because the market is not interested in rational planning; it is only interested in charging after the dollar, with the consequence of over-investment in one area, whether geographic or sectoral, and under-investment in other areas, whether geographic or sectoral. That is the problem. I fear that while the idea behind this Bill is a very good one, and one that is to be welcomed-----

#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	469	It is. We are 150% in favour of strategic investment. Indeed, it was part of our policy platform before the last election, and we were very glad when the Government talked about it. However, the difficulty is that there seems to be a whole series of caveats and qualifications about the need, essentially, to bring in the private sector and to make its investments conditional on getting the private sector on board. I believe the Government will face two problems in that regard. First, the private sector companies do not want to get on board in regard to things that are not sure-fire profit winners for them.This will cause real difficulty in actually getting projects going or finishing them, as we have seen with public private partnerships, or where the deal we must do involves the public giving away way too much. We take all the risk and they take all the profit, as often happens with these PPPs. We do not know anything about it anyway because it is all surrounded by commercial secrecy. We cannot find any information until the whole thing goes belly-up. Those are real and serious problems and flaws at the heart of this legislation.  The section that allows the Minister to use this fund to bail out the banks is extraordinary. What was the ESM for? It is bad enough that we cannot get retrospective bank recapitalisation, but I thought the whole idea of the ESM was that we would never have to do this again because there would now be a fund across Europe that would ensure this did not have to happen. Actually, we discover that the Government is preparing again for massive bailouts. One of the things that is worth underlining when we are looking at all of this and when people mention the collapse of the National Pensions Reserve Fund from €24 billion to €6.9 billion, or whatever it is now, is that when the Government says, as it does with regard to social housing, that we cannot take on a project on a 100% basis because we can get double the amount if we get co-funding from the private sector, and that this is critical because otherwise it would be put on our balance sheet, is that the debt is the reason we are prohibited from borrowing more money to do this ourselves. We could use our money to leverage money and we would not need the private sector. The reason we cannot do it is the massive debt and the fact that we have a 120% debt-to-GDP ratio and a big deficit. We have all those things because we bailed out the banks. Otherwise, there would not be a problem. A country that does not have a massive debt on its back and a deficit, all of which were incurred because of the bank bailout, does not have those restrictions on it in terms of public investment. We have them, so we are required essentially to privatise or semi-privatise our investment programme because we bailed out the banks, incurred massive debts because of it and ran down our National Pensions Reserve Fund. That is the sort of vicious circle and vice grip the troika have got us in, which the previous and current Government have allowed them to do, such that we cannot engage in the public investment we really need in infrastructure, housing or balanced regional development. The idea that we would allow ourselves to do all that again is just crazy.

A number of Deputies on the opposite side of the House have acknowledged the principle that if we have money to put into developing our economy, it is a big plus. This is money that is not in the country at the moment but will be brought back here and used in the way the legislation allows. The key point is that if it is €6.8 billion, and if by involving partners in PPPs we can leverage that fund to get double the money, it will double the impact. Some of the money has already been used in just that way. We have already put in €1.2 billion, and matching funds have been found to support SMEs. Funds to support SMEs are very welcome indeed, so it is working. It is also true that the economy is definitely improving significantly. I do not have the unemployment figures for Deputy Pearse Doherty's constituency - I have no doubt that he does - but I do know that unemployment nationally has decreased from a high of 15% three years ago to about 11.6% now, which is below the European average. It is still exceptionally high and there are significant issues relating to youth unemployment and so on, but the trend is in the right direction. Unemployment is falling and more jobs are being created. When we got into power, we were losing something like 7,000 jobs per month - 7,000 people were losing their jobs every month. Now, approximately 5,000 people are becoming gainfully employed in our economy. These are the significant areas that have improved.  Deputy Deasy's point is very important. His amendment clearly directs our attention to the issue of balanced regional development. He is absolutely right about the unemployment situation in Waterford. We have read about and seen what happened down there. Clearly it happened in other parts of the country as well. The regions need more investment. The Minister for Finance is very conscious of the need to ensure that economic development is not concentrated in a few areas. Therefore, the Minister proposes to insert the new section 49 into the Bill, which will require the agency in its national report to provide an assessment of the regional distribution of the investments of the strategic investment fund and the economic and employment impact of these investments. This will enable the Government and the Oireachtas to understand the overall impact of reorienting the National Pensions Reserve Fund into the Ireland strategic investment fund. The fund is intended to benefit the entire country and to boost economic development and employment. It will be important to have data on the fund's investments in order to measure that impact. Deputy Deasy has submitted an amendment to the same effect. As the Government is proposing a different wording, I hope Deputy Deasy can support it in terms of what we are doing.  The legislation as currently drafted provides that the NTMA must consult with the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform and have regard to the views expressed by them. The Minister may consider regional views without the need to prescribe this in legislation. This provides the maximum level of flexibility. Our approach is to be less prescriptive in legislation in order to have flexibility in the strategic investment fund. If the strategic investment fund looks like a public policy tool, it may compromise its ability to attract private sector co-investment. By leveraging the funds, the strategic investment fund will be able to make a bigger impact on economic activity and employment in Ireland. The Deputy said earlier that he wanted schools in his constituency. This is already happening under the schools bundle 3 PPP. Over €110 million has been invested into a project with a vision of more than 7,500 school places in eight schools around the country. This means that the funds that can be used productively with PPP investment produce a very positive result in terms of facilities in schools. There was a large conference recently in Dublin which was addressed by the Minister for Finance and people from the Ireland strategic investment fund. The conference was extremely well attended by businesspeople, be they from Waterford, Drogheda, Cork or Dublin, and looked at methods and packages of proposals for business. We are actively seeking partners out there. The fact that the State is prepared to play a core role in that investment strategy will strengthen the deal we are asking private enterprise to get involved in.Many of the arguments the Deputies made will produce half the benefit of what we propose. What we propose via the fund will double what the Opposition proposes, which is the key issue. It is not possible in advance to assess the level of commercial opportunities that will present on a regional basis, but we want them to happen. We are actively pushing for them and meeting people who are interested and who have proposals. Changing the name of the ISIF is not realistic. I refer to the question of the directions to invest in banks. As I said previously in the debate, acceptance of amendment No. 19, tabled by Deputy Doherty, would involve the deletion of section 42. I can only repeat that the section has been included as a precautionary measure. There is no wish ever to see it used. The section makes it clear that it can be used only in exceptional circumstances. That goes to the heart of the matter. While I welcome the recognition of Deputies opposite of the principle underpinning the fund, I ask them, notwithstanding the ideological problems they have with it, if the fund can be doubled, why not do it? Why not have private enterprise come along in partnership with the State to provide social housing and so on? If a voluntary housing agency such as Respond! can go to the market to raise funds, theoretically, if it meets all the requirements and all the detail is signed off, that does not have to be, from the point of the view of the Deputies opposite, commercial in that context if it a registered voluntary agency. If it could raise funds, the State could work with the agency. Deputy Coppinger and others are correct that there is a deficit in investment, but if the State steps up to the mark and puts forward its tranche of cash, then private enterprise will be more likely to get involved. Companies obviously need a commercial return. This is probably the best news we have had in this country for many years because all this money up to now has been invested in other countries. It is now coming home to create jobs and infrastructure on a commercial basis. On that basis, I hope Deputy Deasy accepts the explanation I have given. I acknowledge the issues he has raised and this is an attempt to acknowledge and address them and the issues raised by Opposition Members. Notwithstanding their arguments, the welcome they have given to the principle underpinning the fund is welcome. If we can go forward together and build on this, we can help to transform our economy in these difficult times.

Deputy Doherty said regional development was not in the dictionary. I might not disagree with that but, at the very least, the people running this fund will have to give it consideration now. It is better being in than not. There is an issue for Ministers and senior civil servants who make the macro financial decisions. In the public and private conversations I have had, the conclusion that everybody understands is that even though they say there has been an inordinately uneven spread of investment in the country over the past 20 years, nobody has an idea what to do about it. However, the way to start is by admitting the problem exists, and that is what the reporting requirement achieves to a certain extent. I am not alone in this view, as Deputy Michael McGrath tabled a similar amendment on Committee Stage. All we need to do is examine what has happened in Dublin. Deputy Boyd Barrett is correct regarding property prices. Outside Dublin, Cork and Galway, they have stagnated and they are not increasing. It is a different world compared to Dublin. The attitude that a recovery will eventually trickle down to the provinces is pretty lazy. It is an idea that from what I have seen has not materialised to any great extent. I am glad this attitude does not inhabit the Department of Finance but, as a start, this fund is considerable, significant and important.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	474	This country has had an unhappy experience with so-called public private partnership. Deputy Boyd Barrett outlined the experience of communities in Dublin which were left high and dry by developers who were supposed to redevelop their areas with the councils. When I was a member of the Committee of Public Accounts some years ago, the Comptroller and Auditor General was highly critical of one bundle of schools built via a PPP where value for money did not materialise. In PPPs, the taxpayer takes the risk while the partner takes the profit. With regard to amendment No. 19, the Minister of State spent the past hour, up to this tranche of amendments, telling us why State aid and direct investment in public housing via a public agency was a no-no, but now there is no problem with State aid when it comes to making a provision for money to be ploughed into the banks. This is the double standard and the neoliberal philosophy of the troika - the EU, the IMF and the ECB - which are making all these rules to hamstring public authorities for the benefit of private entities, big capitalists, etc., by pushing privatisation and so on. However, they insisted that the people take a hit of €64 billion to rescue private bankers and bondholders. It is a complete contradiction, and that is why our amendment should be supported.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	475	We agree on the need for strategic investment, but there are serious questions about whether this fund can deliver such investment. Even if the Minister of State says he wants that to happen and acknowledges the need for regional development and the need to invest in areas such as social housing or vital infrastructure, the money people want to know the bottom line and what they will get out of the arrangement. This is also the problem with Deputy Deasy's proposal. While the Government and the Department of Finance might hopefully, because of this, say they must consider regional development in the allocation of investments and so on, the same private sector that has over-centralised in Dublin and a few urban centres will say, "Sorry, we are not interested," and the Government will be hamstrung because it has to have co-financing. That is the problem. We will still be hostages to what the private sector wants. One of the issues on which I cut my political teeth was the Dún Laoghaire baths. We had what was supposedly an ideological argument about public private partnerships. Most people just wanted something done on the site. They did not care whether the money came from private or public sources. The council at the time said it had to be done through a PPP because it was Government policy. We said that if it was a PPP, the private operator would insist on making so much money as a condition of its investment that the public would get nothing out of it, and that was exactly what happened.The private company proposed a 19-storey office block when the people wanted a swimming pool. That is the problem, and it will be the problem with this fund. Even if there are good intentions, if projects are conditional on co-financing with the private sector, nothing may happen, or what happens may not be of any use to society.

Others have mentioned the M50 toll road and how much taxpayers paid for it. The Minister of State mentioned Respond! and other housing agencies. While I have no specific problem with any particular housing agency, I have a major problem if the Minister of State is directing that all house building is to come from housing agencies. These agencies are not accountable to the councillors elected by the people. We can challenge local authorities and work with their housing departments on issues affecting people, including council tenants. It is a further privatisation of the house building programme. The Minister of State may be unaware of another difficulty with the housing agencies, including Respond! and NABCO. Once they have built estates, housing agencies do not have funds to carry out repairs, and sometimes they do not have funds to finish the estates. Why will the Minister of State not allow councils to apply for funds in the same way as the housing agencies?

No matter what I or any other member of the Opposition say, it will have no effect. Fine Gael is ideologically wedded to supporting capital above citizens. We have seen what Fine Gael has done during the past three years. It has followed the same banking policies as the previous Government, using State resources to pump up and bail out the banks and allowing them to continue with the same type of people in them. On numerous occasions I have stood in this same spot asking the Government why we are continuing to pay senior officials in Anglo Irish Bank obscene amounts of money. I specifically mentioned John Bowe as an example of somebody who should not have been paid by the State to remain in his position because of the dealings he was involved in at the time in Anglo Irish Bank, which are public knowledge. When we heard his voice on the Anglo Irish Bank tapes, everybody was appalled. However, when sensible voices had said he should not be there and asked the Government to do something about it, the Government was hands-off. It treats bankers with kid gloves and does anything they wish. I will press amendment No. 19. Regarding the Government's amendment No. 23, which refers to assessment "on a regional basis", what is the definition of "regional" in the Bill? Does it refer to the BMW region, the provinces, or everywhere outside Dublin?

One of the key features of NewERA is that, in consultation with various Government Ministers, it can develop proposals for investment in sectors to support economic activity and employment, specifically energy, water, telecommunications and forestry. The legislation could create a very positive, constructive fund which is available to promote balanced regional development, create jobs and meet the needs of our economy. This is a key point in our development and I urge Deputies to support and vote for it. We are at a turning point at which the economy is improving, jobs are being created and there is a commitment, acknowledged by the Minister for Finance, in the point Deputy Deasy wanted to be accepted and understood. Once the legislation has been passed we will be able to engage in very significant development. I ask Deputies to reconsider their total opposition to matching funds. Matching funds means there will be double the money, and the projects can be doubled. If one has a plan that fits the template for the Ireland strategic investment fund, one can build double the number of houses and invest twice the amount that one could otherwise. It is a no-brainer.

On page 41 of the Bill we see the effects of successive EU regulations which prohibit the Government from allowing such investments. It specifies that investments cannot have a negative impact on the net borrowing of the general Government of the State for any year. It allows rules from the EU, the troika and the IMF to prevent the Government from taking investment decisions as it sees fit to provide socially necessary infrastructure. It is also a recipe for the continuation of austerity, because there is no way austerity can end without borrowing in the public interest. Fine Gael and the Labour Party took a hammering in the local and European elections on this issue because, after six years, the country has had enough. The only way we can escape the unemployment and emigration crisis is by borrowing at times to make necessary investment. This very damaging provision would prevent, for example, councils from borrowing to build vital houses.

When we heard that there was to be a review of the travel pass scheme for those over 66 years, we, Age Action Ireland and many organisations representing our elderly, went quite rightly on the offensive. We have seen the record of the Government on other services which have been cut. For example, five years ago, the Labour Party was with Age Action Ireland to support thousands of elderly people protesting against the medical card cut for the over 70s. However, the party has introduced in the past three years a cut by stealth whereby a single person's maximum gross income in respect of medical card eligibility is €500. We find many old age pensioners on a State pension and a small private work pension are now having their over 70s medical card cut off by stealth where they are €10, €20 or €30 over the threshold. Age Action Ireland and other groups have quite rightly gone on the offensive. Last night, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, said she wanted to say loudly and clearly that the Government has protected the free travel scheme for beneficiaries in all of its budgets to date and will continue to do so. I want some definite responses for those in receipt of the travel pass and those who will be in receipt of it in future to confirm that there will be no restrictions on the hours during which the pass may be used, no subscription charges, no restriction to a particular mode of transport and that the travel pass will continue as is. I want to hear that from the Government tonight so that Age Action Ireland and our elderly can feel confident they will have the travel pass into the future.

#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	493	Operators in Cavan, Longford and other areas have stated recently that they cannot afford to run the free travel pass scheme and have withdrawn from it. The Government is planning to outsource 10% of the orbital routes in Dublin. It is already clear from the evidence coming in from private operators who were able to provide a free travel scheme that they cannot now afford to do it. This is exactly what will happen when the orbital routes are implemented. My area will be particularly badly hit with the outsourcing of the 59, 65, 75 and 111 routes to private companies which will not be able to afford to run the free travel pass scheme unless the Government gives a commitment. Such a commitment has clearly not been given to date as some of the private operators are already pulling out of the scheme. They say a cast-iron condition for the outsourcing of routes will be a requirement that tenderers operate the free travel pass scheme. I bet the Government will not demand that. If it does not, it is the stealth removal of the free travel scheme.

She stated that she had no plans to limit the use of passes, which is welcome. However, she also stated that a funding cap has been in place now for several years, which means that no new routes and no new private companies are being admitted to the scheme. She referred to the financial strain on the scheme and indicated that an interdepartmental group had been set up to review its future operation. For many pensioners across the country and certainly for pensioners in Wicklow, the pass is essential for many services, in particular access to health care. Last year, Bus Éireann changed the No. 2 bus route, reducing its frequency and removing some of the stops. Critically, the route no longer included St. Vincent's Hospital. To the credit of Bus Éireann, it reinstated much though not all of the scheme following the making of representations. However, Bus Éireann told us the reason it made the changes was because the scheme needed to be stand-alone profitable. Here is the danger. As has already been said in the debate, as more and more routes are privatised there is a real risk that the company will be told the fund no longer extends to it or it will determine that the scheme is not financially viable. We are likely to be faced with a situation in which pensioners all over the country do not have access to essential services like health care because new routes and new operators are not allowed or decide not to operate the free travel scheme. We all know that money is tight, but can the Minister of State revert to whomever will be the relevant line Minister after tomorrow to ask that Government provide an absolute guarantee that when it comes to access to services like health care the scheme will apply no matter what changes are made to routes or who operates them?
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	495	I am aware that the Minister for Social Protection insisted last night that there is no threat to the free travel pass. Similar promises have been made in the past so she will forgive us for being a little sceptical. I am sure she remembers her colleague, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, signing a pre-election pledge not to increase third level fees. We know what happened to that. The Minister herself made a commitment in the House not to cut the one-parent family payment until a proper system of child care was put in place. In April 2012, she told us she would only proceed with measures to reduce the upper age limit to seven years in the event that she received a credible and bankable commitment on the delivery of a Scandinavian-style system of child care by the time of that year's budget. That also fell through. I hope the review of the scheme is not a distraction created by Government to cover for planned cuts in other areas such as the electricity allowance. This is certainly a fear shared by many older people. Like other vulnerable groups, elderly people have not been protected from austerity by the Government. The increase in prescription charges and cuts to the fuel allowance, telephone allowance, respite care grant, invalidity pension and the bereavement grant have all hit the elderly. Like everyone else, their incomes had been further reduced by the property tax and, soon, water charges. As Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan pointed out last night, many are supporting their adult children or grandchildren who may be unemployed or in negative equity. I was struck by a phrase used by the CEO of Alone after the 2014 budget. He said the cuts undermined the dignity of older people. It is a powerful phrase and gets to the heart of the matter. Elderly people, like everyone else in society, have a right to live with dignity. The charity has seen a 50% increase in calls in the past two years. Many older people depend on State supports to keep out of poverty and the free travel pass is part of that. It is also crucial to prevent isolation and loneliness among older citizens. For those who are single or widowed, the ability to get out and simply interact with others on a day-to-day basis is vital. It is something the rest of us may take for granted, but the Government should not.

We must all stand up for our senior citizens and their valuable contribution over the past 50 or 60 years. Independent Deputies in this House will always do so and I reject the recent attacks on our elderly. They built up this country and should always be shown respect, dignity and support in their daily lives. It is important to ensure the elderly are fully empowered to engage with society and able to continue as active members of their communities in all aspects. We must recognise the vital role of the free travel pass in supporting elderly people and reducing isolation since it was introduced in 1967. Almost 80% of older people used the free travel pass at least once a week, while 30% use it daily in order to attend medical appointments and other personal journeys and social activities. There is also broader economic benefit to many cities and towns. I reject the series of cuts that have hit our elderly, such as the hike in prescription charges, the abolition of the telephone allowance, the reduction in the fuel allowance and the erosion of housing aid support. I call on the Government to fully support and retain the free travel scheme in its current form as a universal benefit to all people aged 66 years and over. We should work towards progressing the national positive ageing strategy. I urge all Deputies to put their money where their mouths are and to vote in support of our senior citizens. I put strong emphasis on the senior citizens of the north side of Dublin.
#TonyMcLoughlin	unknown-#TonyMcLoughlin-party	unknown-#TonyMcLoughlin-dob	unknown-#TonyMcLoughlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	497	I propose to share time with Deputies James Bannon, Mary Mitchell O'Connor, Joe McHugh, Eamonn Maloney, Joanna Tuffy, John O'Mahony, Catherine Byrne and Paul Connaughton. More than 1.1 million people avail of a free travel pass in this country. The majority are over 66 years of age and, in many cases, hold companion passes to enable a partner, carer or relative to travel free with that person if it is deemed necessary based on a health certificate. Over the past three budgets, the Government has protected the free travel scheme despite the need to reduce welfare spending. That is the case because the Tánaiste and Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, and her Government understand and recognise the hugely important role the free travel scheme plays in allowing older people to live their lives to the full. Older people, like most sectors over recent years, have had to endure significant cuts such as the abolition of the telephone allowance. However, when we consider what they had to suffer under the previous Fianna Fáil-led Government, then it does not compare. For example, the main pension payments, including the blind pension, were reduced. This motion is in response to a review of the free travel pass system as currently structured, which is only right and correct. There is huge potential for fraud and, to give the taxpayer better value for the €70 million the free travel costs, the Government should examine all options. It is time that any person with free travel pass entitlements should have it included on the new public service card that has fraud prevention capabilities, including facial imaging detection. This will reduce the risk of fraud and of people allowing other people to use the card. I am glad that Ministers have clarified that the free travel scheme is not at risk and I hope all Members listen clearly to the message. However, we are fooling ourselves if we think all users are legitimate so I encourage the Departments of Transport, Tourism and Sport and Social Protection to ensure adequate fraud detection within the system. The Tánaiste and Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, outlined that there will be no changes.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	498	I am delighted to speak on this motion. The free travel pass scheme is valued by everyone and I appreciate its importance and value to the 780,000 people, mostly elderly, who use it. Fianna Fáil is blatantly trying to scare older people by issuing completely inaccurate statements about the threat to the free travel pass. Despite assurances and confirmation from the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste that the Government taking away the free travel pass scheme is not on the agenda, Members opposite are determined to whip up fear on this issue. The scheme is important to our senior citizens so that they are fully empowered to engage with society. I agree with Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett that we must examine the subventions given to private operators in rural areas. The free travel scheme, along with the rural transport scheme project, has proved to be a wonderful success story. It has created a lifeline to many in addressing social exclusion in rural areas. The value of the free travel pass in rural areas is one of the issues highlighted by my constituents. The issue has emerged not because of any suggested change in Government policy but as a result of a pre-budget submission released by the lobby group Age Action Ireland explaining the impact of cuts by the previous Fianna Fáil-led Government on the lives of older Irish people. A Fianna Fáil-led Government cut the universal entitlements enjoyed by many older people, such as free medical cards, age-related tax credits and other key support and services to older people. A Fianna Fáil-led Government cut the energy schemes that left many older people with fuel poverty problems. In budget 2010, Fianna Fáil cut the widows, blind and invalidity pensions, as well as the disability allowance by over €8 per week. It also cut the rate of carers allowance in budget 2010 by €8.50 per week. Fine Gael has protected older people in crisis and will continue to do so.

I strongly object to the fact that Fianna Fáil is trying to get attention by scaring older people by pretending there is a threat to the free travel scheme. There is no threat to the travel pass. This has been stated categorically by a number of senior Ministers. Fianna Fáil appears to have missed that. Fianna Fáil has been no friend to the elderly and when Fianna Fáil was in power it cut pensions and carers and disability allowances. Fianna Fáil did a lot more damage that affected all of us, not just the elderly. I have worked with older people in my constituency and I understand their needs. What they do not need is Fianna Fáil scaremongering about travel passes being taken away. I agree with the UN principle for older people, which states that older people should have access to a full range of services for their basic needs, to work and study as long as they can and to be able to live active lives, to live in their homes safely as long as they can. Older people should remain integrated and participate in society and continue to develop themselves through education and training. Older people should be able to live in dignity and security. Older people need their dignity and independence and the travel pass is very important to help maintain this. I support this and Fine Gael supports this. Older people use their travel passes to visit family and friends, local shops and to attend medical appointments. Many of them use the travel pass to go on a day out or for a short break and to visit relatives. Some of them use it to go to work. Fine Gael understands this and will maintain the travel pass. I hope the Fianna Fáil Members are listening. I want to reassure people that the travel pass is not under threat and I ask them to forgive Fianna Fáil for trying to use this issue to get some attention. Fianna Fáil is a disgrace.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	500	I will not go over ground the previous speaker debated so eloquently. In a nutshell, there is unnecessary uncertainty around this motion, but we should examine the issue constructively. A review is ongoing and there are issues in regard to the challenges. One of the challenges concerns rural areas, where private operators are under considerable economic and financial pressure as a result of minimum subventions. We must ensure we address the rural challenges and that opportunities for bringing people into more urban areas are addressed. Another issue is disability access. There is still no disability access on Bus Éireann services from Letterkenny to Dublin. We must ensure this happens sooner rather than later. I call on the Minister of State to intervene and to assist in regard to an issue relating to the Buncrana-Derry route. A private operator has taken over the Lough Swilly route and, because of the review, the fact existing contractors or operators get subvention does not mean the new operator will automatically get subvention or that it will recognise travel passes. We have a situation now where elderly people who want to travel between Derry and Buncrana, people with disabilities and people with invalidity passes are not recognised for free transport. The Minister of State may be heading for a higher position in the next 48 hours or less, but before then will he intervene in this regard and call on the Minister for Social Protection to examine the number of people on invalidity passes on the Derry to Buncrana route? Anecdotally, I believe there is a large number of people on invalidity or disability passes on this route and this should be acknowledged. It is not acknowledged currently as the review does not allow the new operator coming in to have the same dispensation as the previous operator. It should be acknowledged that this is wrong. I will not go into the legacy issues in terms of transportation in the north west. Those issues are there to be seen. People, be they the elderly, people with invalidity passes or people on disability, who are trying to get from Buncrana to Derry do not have the option of rail or of using Iarnród Éireann or inter-urban routes. The only choice they have is this private operator, who although he is providing an excellent service cannot provide this free service because he gets no subvention. I ask for the Minister of State's indulgence on this and call on him to intervene directly to try to find a way around this issue.

If some of the Opposition are not here to frighten the kids of the nation, they are here to frighten senior citizens. This is what we have here tonight. This motion is an exercise to spook people into believing their travel passes are under threat. They are not under threat and the Opposition knows that. Charles Dickens described his father as a "jovial opportunist". In other words, he was like those here who take opportunities such as this to engage in eager opportunism, which is essentially what this debate is. We will be back next Wednesday night and the Opposition will have found some other group of citizens they will try to spook. That is what happens here, despite the promise made three years ago there would be no "Punch and Judy" debating here. That was quickly forgotten. I never use the term "free travel pass". Nobody has ever explained to me how it could be free. Is it not being paid for? Taxpayers pay for it. I wish people would drop the idea that as part of the services provided by the State it is free. It is not free. Those of us who work pay taxes and those who have paid taxes and are now retired fund it. This is one of the few jurisdictions where this term "free" is used, as if it came out of air or as if the previous empire was sending us a cheque that funded it. That is now how it is. I listened to some people speak about travel passes being available to all citizens of a particular age. Members are entitled to their opinion, but this is not an opinion I share. I was surprised to hear what some of the Opposition had to say on this. Have we not learned anything? Will any of them argue that a retired politician who left this House three years ago, who is on a pension of €1,000 a week, should have a travel pass? They might support that, but I do not. It is not so long ago since there was a discussion in this House on a retired judge. Retired judges do not come cheap, but this judge had a travel pass. Some Members might agree with that, but I do not understand how they can in the context of services under a welfare state which all of us should be prepared to defend. The welfare state exists to look after those who have the least. Providing travel passes to overpaid retired politicians or judges is wrong and should be stopped. I commend the Minister on deciding to review the situation. If the principle aim of the review is to deal with these issues, I am all for it. If the Minister comes in and says all retired well paid people should forfeit their travel passes, I will put my finger on the voting buzzer to support that, because these passes should be taken from them. We should not subsidise people who are well off. Another class of people who should not have travel passes are wealthy landlords. I am aware of a landlord who owns 17 properties in this city and who has a travel pass. Will anybody stand up and defend that? I hope not. Deputy Mac Lochlainn referred to us shutting our eyes to certain issues and we have done so since this scheme was initiated. I support the Government, so I take my share of the blame in that regard. The issue to which he referred was the issue of fraud. Any of us who use public transport will know that if they ask any bus drivers, Luas drivers or drivers of the Expressway service, they will get the truth on this. I commend the Deputy on raising the issue of fraud. It alone is a good enough reason to carry out this review. We should face up to these issues. I welcome any review of services that come under the heading of the welfare state. We must step up to the plate in terms of services and the provision of services to those with the least. If we are to do that, we must face the problem of the issues I have raised and ensure that people who can well afford to pay for their travel do so, rather than hard pressed taxpayers.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	502	This issue was put to bed by the Minister last night, last week, last year and the two previous years and when she was speaking last night, she supported the free travel scheme as a universal scheme. In the past few budgets, the Government had to make serious cutbacks in spending, but it protected the travel pass scheme consistently. Why, therefore, should there be any threat to it in a time of recovery? People are concerned the scheme is being reviewed, but there have been reviews previously. There was a review last year and the previous year. We have discussed these reviews in the Oireachtas committee. Deputy O'Dea is on the Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection with me and is aware of reviews that have taken place. The issue of fraud has been considered as part of those reviews. With any scheme where there is expenditure as high as on this scheme, there must be continual review and monitoring.  Age Action has been mentioned in our debate. I believe Age Action was wrongfooted in this regard as there is so much else on which it should campaign.There is no need for it to campaign negatively about things which are perceived to be under threat. All it is doing is feeding in to the need for perpetual outrage, negativity and fear. Many lobby groups do not acknowledge or give credit for much that is good these days. I wonder why that is the case, particularly as it is in no way helpful in the context of political discourse or our democracy. The free travel scheme is a good news story and everyone is in favour of it, particularly as it gives rise to very positive outcomes. There are also other good news stories. For example, Dublin Bus e-mailed all Deputies to inform them that it intends to recruit 100 additional drivers. That is a sign of the company's recovery. Everyone is aware of the works being done to extend the Luas and consultations are taking place in respect of the new Swiftway service. Many good developments are happening. If anything, we should be discussing the progress we need to make now that things are looking up for the economy. The Minister referred to the positive elements of the social welfare system which are designed to alleviate poverty. She gave credit where credit is due and complimented the previous Government - of which Deputy O'Dea was a member - in the context of its protection of the free travel scheme and other actions it took in the area of social welfare. I often acknowledge the fact that in the closing years of its term of office, the said Administration tried - out of necessity - to make the tax system more progressive. According to the OECD, we now have the third most progressive income tax system in the world as a result. I am completely in favour of this scheme being universal and in my opinion a retired judge should be able to benefit from it. The important thing is that said retired judge should be obliged to pay his taxes to pay for the scheme. There are other universal schemes in place, such as free primary education. The idea is that we pay our taxes and then everybody buys into the fact that there is universal provision in respect of certain services. This is one of those services. Now that we are in the midst of a recovery, we should consider building on universality. Where we have rowed back in respect of the universal provision of public services in recent years, we should, where possible, restore what previously obtained. It is extremely important that we have in place universal provision in respect of services, etc., that are good for our society as a whole and that we do not discriminate with regard to who can avail of these.

I also welcome the fact that this matter is being discussed and that a review is taking place in the context of ensuring that the free travel scheme - which is paid for by means of a subsidy from the Government - will be protected for those who really deserve it. The scheme provides a huge boost to business and tourism throughout the country and it is extremely important that it be continued. I welcome the fact that the Tánaiste and Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, have absolutely confirmed that the scheme is to be retained. I am not sure from where - I have an idea - the motivation for this motion came.

The previous Administration froze the subsidy relating to the scheme in 2010. In the context of protecting the scheme for those who are entitled to avail of it, I received anecdotal evidence from pensioners I have met who, while travelling to Galway, Wexford or wherever, saw young people in their 20s on public transport who were in possession of free travel passes and who had slabs of beer with them. Obviously, the suggestion in this regard is that the scheme is being abused.

It has achieved nothing other than scaring vulnerable individuals, the elderly and those with disabilities.

It is a lifeline for elderly people and is of great value to them. If nothing else, it is part of the legacy of Charles Haughey.

If Fianna Fáil had, when it was in government, taken the time to review some of the many policies it had in place, then perhaps we would not be in the mess in which we find ourselves. I am of the opinion that everything should be reviewed. That reviews have not been carried out in certain areas has led to major problems. We have all been approached in our clinics and informed about people who were not entitled to them using companion passes to travel on trains. This matter has been brought to my attention on many occasions and I have raised it previously in the House. It is extremely important that the free travel arrangement is retained for the benefit of people throughout the country because it serves them in the best way possible. I am of the view that the motion before the House is a charade and I am sorry that our colleagues on the Opposition benches saw fit to introduce it.

A great deal has been said already on this matter and I will try not to revisit any of the ground that has been covered. Instead of just discussing the free travel scheme, like Deputy McHugh I am of the opinion that we should seek to focus more on rural transport and opening up further access routes to rural areas. Not all areas are covered by public transport and while the free travel pass is of huge benefit to some people, they do not always have the opportunity to use it. A much wider and more substantial debate must take place in respect of that matter. I understand that when the issue to which the motion relates was first raised, two senior Cabinet Ministers stated in very clear terms that there will be no changes whatsoever to the scheme. As a result, I have come to the conclusion there is a certain element of scaremongering going on.Many people were frightened by this. Like the previous Government we certainly have not always got it right in previous budgets when dealing with those over 70 years. Certain mistakes were made and they need to be learned from. One point I often hear from people over 70 years is that they have worked all their lives and the free travel pass is one of the few benefits they can look forward to. It is the one thing they would hate to have taken away. Another issue that has come up often in recent years is the change in the telephone allowance and I am keen for us to re-examine that. There is no point in believing we have got it right all the time. That issue caused a great deal of concern, particularly for those who suffer from rural isolation and who live in fear of crime. The allowance was one of the things that kept them in contact with people at all times. I do not intend going over what has already been said. I am disappointed in the Private Members' motion, it is simply scaremongering for people. I am unsure where Fianna Fáil came up with the motion or the thought process after the brains trust came together. Sometimes I wonder whether Fianna Fáil are a little like Brazil last night in that perhaps their best days are behind them even if they were a big deal once. I am unsure where this motion has come from. A change has been ruled out completely. There will be no changes to the free travel scheme in next year's budget.

#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	529	I commend Deputy O'Dea on the motion. I am pleased to discuss the proposal this evening and I fully support the protection of the free travel pass scheme introduced by Fianna Fáil in 1967. I was a teenager at the time. This means that I should be looking forward to my free travel pass if it is still available - I hope it is. There was a good deal of opposition in 1967 from the Civil Service but it is great that we held onto it and we won the day. The scheme has ensured that generations of elderly people in Ireland have been able to stay connected to their communities. It has helped isolated individuals play an active role in their areas. Combined with the rural transport scheme, services for people with disabilities and essential services it is a welcome measure. In particular, it helps people to attend medical and other personal appointments and, for this reason, it should be user-friendly. I have always fought for suitable timetables for people who use the travel pass. I have in mind Woodlawn station, near where I live. People there have seen services cut, including the services to Dublin and Galway. We have to get the timetable and the cost right. Parking is an issue that has reared its head again in some of the small stations. We have to get all these things together. Helping the elderly travel around the country has been the greatest benefit of the scheme. When I hear the word "review" I think of cutbacks, like the cutbacks to the household benefit package. Furthermore, the telephone allowance went, there was a reduction in free electricity units and the respite care grant, while the bereavement grant is gone. There has been an increase in prescription charges and reductions in the fuel allowance and housing aid supports. I have heard people refer to a small charge for the free travel scheme. Of course if we bring in a small charge it will soon become a big charge. We need only think of the prescription charges going from 50 cent to €2.50. This is something I am not keen to see, nor am I keen to see restrictions on the use of the travel pass at peak travel time. Deputy Sean Fleming received an interesting reply on the criteria and terms of reference during Question Time today. The first issue was eligibility. Government Deputies seem to have a difference of opinion tonight about who should be eligible. The reply also referred to an examination of the extent of the service provided, data on the usage of the scheme, fraud and control measures and the interaction between stakeholders and the scheme. All these issues are being examined. Age Action Ireland is right to say that any attempt to meddle with the scheme or water it down would create a whole new set of problems for Ireland's ageing population. The group is right to warn of any negative changes to the scheme. Any changes will be vehemently opposed by older people. If there is an effort to limit the times when the pass can be used, introduce an annual charge or restrict the forms of transport that it can be used on, there will be strong opposition. Age Action Ireland produced a survey highlighting the importance of travel passes to elderly people for carrying out everyday tasks. We do not want a repeat of last year's budget when the Government abolished the telephone allowance for older people without realising that many older people use the telephone as part of a pendant alarm service. There is always the danger of knock-on issues which perhaps we have not considered. The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, said that taking away the free travel pass is simply not on the agenda. Certainly there are issues surrounding the travel pass that must be addressed. Reference was made to fraud and identification but we can examine fraud without a major review of eligibility. Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív raised the issue of online booking. Elderly people are used to simply getting on the train at their local station and therefore if we are going to bring in online booking then we are going down the wrong road. There should be a way of getting on the train in the traditional way, as it were. There are other changes, including direct debit payments for all elderly people, whether they are paying an ESB or gas bill through the post office or the credit union. Nowadays, it appears the utility companies seek deposits from anyone who chooses to pay by cash. It is the same as online booking; obstacles are being placed in people's way. Not every county has a railway service although those of us in Galway are fortunate to have one. Naturally, it should be improved. Anyway, one of the greatest benefits in rural areas is the rural transport scheme. If we had a good timetable for buses in places where we do not have trains then we would be in a better position in the west of Ireland. I hope that the House can accept the motion so ably proposed by Deputy O'Dea.
#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	530	I thank the Acting Chairman for the opportunity to speak to this important issue. We have listened to Government Deputies criticising this side of the House for bringing forward and advocating the genuine fears of people. It is not only Fianna Fáil as a political party which is advocating these fears. The largest advocacy group in the sector, Age Action Ireland, has been highlighting its concerns about this issue, not for weeks but for months. It was amazing to listen to Deputy John O'Mahony referring to people carrying slabs of beer on the trains. Does he honesty believe our senior citizens are going around with six-packs under their coats, travelling up and down? If it were not so serious it would be laughable. The previous speakers were falling over each other referring to what a fabulous scheme it is. If it is that good and working that well, then why the need to review it? The Minister of State and his colleagues have lost sight of one simple thing. When they advocate a review and follow up by saying that nothing will change, the people do not believe them. The Government has lost the trust of the people because they have seen what the review of the medical card situation has done and the pain, hardship and anxiety it has brought on so many people. The Government amendment refers to the previous Government making cuts and reducing expenditure. That is true and no one can argue with it. However, what the previous Government did was done in a fair and equitable manner. It is not a matter of Fianna Fáil saying that, the ESRI has said it. The institute has said the previous budgets were progressive, unlike the three budgets that the Minister of State has so faithfully and loyally supported, all of which were regressive.

#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	559	-----"the Government has supported and protected the core weekly social protection payments". That might be true to a certain extent, but not for those under 25 or 22 years of age whose weekly jobseeker's allowance payments have been cut, those who have seen their weekly maternity benefit reduced by including it in tax calculations, those whose jobseeker's benefit payments have been cut by three months to nine months in respect of full PRSI contributions or those whose fuel allowance payments have been cut by six weeks. Last week, we saw the unprecedented targeting of people in receipt of the single parent allowance. It was not reduced. Instead, when their children turn seven years of age, their weekly allowance will be gone. While the Government may have protected the old age pension rate, what is being taken from recipients' pockets has increased significantly through, for example, prescription charges, which the Government was going to reduce upon entering office, increased fuel prices due to carbon taxes and three increases in electricity bills sanctioned by the Government in recent years. According to the Government's amendment, it has "prioritised the concerns of older people across the whole of Government in a new way". I could not agree more, but the new way is a negative one that has terrorised every senior citizen like never before. If the Government wants to protect senior citizens, why have home help hours been reduced by 1 million in the past two years? In County Westmeath, there was a 60% reduction - more than 160,000 hours - in 2013 compared with 2012. Consider the medical card fiasco. Every week, people on all sides of the House have been visited in their constituency offices by senior citizens in floods of tears and unable to control their anxieties about their medical card reviews. Medical cards have been removed from the sickest and most vulnerable in society. A Deputy referred to the telephone allowance. In abolishing it, the Government took away what was a lifeline for many. When a person went to bed at night, he or she could press the panic button hanging around his or her neck upon becoming sick or someone breaking into the house. People no longer have that service thanks to this Government. Charlie Haughey introduced free transport, an innovative creation at the time. As reported in the national media this year, some people are using their free transport because they cannot afford to heat their homes thanks to the Government's policy decisions. Not only has the Government discussed changing eligibility criteria, but it has cut the number of routes. A bus that used to go through my village is gone now. It transported senior citizens to the local town. A bus used to go through Multyfarnham in my constituency twice per day. Senior citizens had the opportunity to travel to Dublin or Mullingar for doctors' appointments. That bus route is gone. In Moyne in County Longford, 150 senior citizens-----

During that 18 months, unbelievable and unfair distress was caused not just to senior citizens, but to people generally. This concern and stress fell on deaf ears until people turned out on 23 May, but I am not convinced that they are even being heard now. People are still attending our offices because their cards have been withdrawn. There is still a great deal of distress. There is no mention of new legislation to alleviate the problem. This is the background to the situation. When people hear the word "review", they think about their medical cards and telephone allowances being removed, their prescription charges trebling and no allowance being provided to older people on fixed incomes in respect of their property taxes or water charges.That is the background and the reason we are raising this issue. For Fine Gael Deputies, in particular, who were Members of the last Dáil to come into the House and give out because we are raising it and talk about us scaremongering takes the biscuit, to be polite. From 2007 to 2011 Fine Gael traded on scaremongering. Every night was Hallowe'en. The Minister of State's new party Leader engaged in a fair bit of it herself in her day and Thursday at Question Time and during Leaders' Questions used to be scare Thursday. We will now see the colour of her money.  The review needs to focus on a number of things. The travel pass, particularly in rural areas, is important for social purposes but also medical purposes. It provides many people with the ability to attend a medical appointment in regional and Dublin hospitals where they have to attend at 8 a.m. or 9 a.m. The notion of a time limit on usage of the pass is unfair and will restrict people's ability to use it for medical purposes.  As we are rolling out the new picture ID card, fraud can be controlled better. Surely, if the Department has a reduction of fraud as an ambition in rolling out the ID card, with which we all agree, we should roll it out to those who use the services most. This should feature in the plan for rolling out the card and if the free travel pass is in the Government's sights in terms of fraud control, those who have it should be the first to get the ID card. That would make sense and cut down on fraud. CIE and the companies that make the most money from the travel pass should be told to get their act together in terms of fraud control. They have a role in that respect; it is not only the Department's job. Any company that is using and making money out of the system cannot wash its hands of responsibility in tackling fraud and should be given the powers and resources it requires to do so. We need to examine the rural transport scheme. The wonder Minister of State, Deputy Alan Kelly, has done a good deal of work around the scheme, but I am not convinced by it for many reasons. Unfortunately, it will be the winter before we see it being rolled out. He has been so busy in the past few weeks launching canal passes in every part of the country where there is a Labour Part member that we have not had a chance to see how effective the scheme will be.

#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	628	The rural transport scheme is essential and has evolved to fill the gap in local services, about which Deputy Robert Troy spoke, to transport people to bigger towns to access basic services, including medical services, go shopping or simply get out of the house and meet friends. It has been adopted wonderfully in many rural areas and I am sure the Minister of State has had a chance to see this in recent years, with people being brought to community centres to have their lunch and some social interaction. That is what it is about; it is about giving people in rural areas the ability to make the most of their community, not to be prisoners is their own home. We must make sure the roll-out of the new Kelly bus dovetails with the travel pass scheme. We must make sure it does not undermine the scheme and that when the review is published, the new so-called transport initiative is put in place and that the travel pass is not restricted as a result of their having access to the new rural transport scheme. I have no doubt some civil servant has thought of this already and that it is be done to save costs. Many media organisations have been working on this issue in recent weeks and Age Action has taken it up as its main campaigning issue. It wants to have it nailed down before the summer recess, bearing in mind that it will be too late to tackle it in September when many of the budget decisions are taken. This is the time to do it. I am sorry if we are inconveniencing Government backbenchers by forcing them to come here. The Minister of State was not here to listen to a lot of what we had to put up with. His colleagues are very distressed about having to come here and have accused us of scaremongering, which is a bit rich, particularly coming from those who were on this side of the House in the last Dáil. We are not scaremongering, rather we are seeking to defend the scheme which has inestimable value. Admittedly, it has a monetary cost, but in terms of the monetary return and, most importantly, its inestimable social value, it needs to be defended. We are seeking to defend it and send a message to those who abuse it. If people are abusing it, they are ruining it for everyone else and it is their fault that it is under review. If they are abusing it in terms of their right to use it, they should cop on because their abuse of it and such fraud are costing those who want and need the scheme. It will eventually cost them some day. That message must go out in terms of the review if it is to be serious. As I said before the Minister of State came into the Chamber, it is difficult for us to accept assurances about the scheme from a Government that has destroyed the household benefits package, the lineage of which probably dates back as far as the travel pass, that has acted in the way it has in respect of prescription charges and that stood by while various taxes were imposed on older people. Furthermore, in her first budget the Minister of State's new party leader told women who had left work to rear their family and then returned that they had lost pension entitlements which they otherwise would have had. That is the currency in which the Tánaiste has traded and the reason people are sceptical about her assurances that this is only a review and that there will not be a change. She has sold them a pup far too often and they are not going to buy another one from her.

We all know why there should be genuine concern about Government's review of the free travel scheme. It is based on our experience of what it has done to date, particularly the recent experience of its review of medical cards, on foot of which thousands of discretionary medical cards were removed, yet we saw members of the Government day in, day out try to deny that people were losing their medical cards. On the back of this, it is only reasonable and appropriate that we ensure the Minister of State is given the strong message - "hands off the free travel scheme". We have seen the impact of the the policies of the Government in the past three years as they affected older people, in particular, who use the free travel pass more than anyone else. We have seen the period during the fuel allowance is paid reduced from 32 weeks to 26 and the free electricity allowance reduced to such an extent that for many, it is worth only one fifth of what it was. The Government abolished the free telephone allowance, while there was an increase in prescriptions charges, with which many older people are hit every month when they go to obtain essential medications. I point for the Minister of State to the impact of the Government's decision on the free travel scheme in County Donegal. On many of the routes operated by the Lough Swilly Bus Company there was approval of the use of the free travel pass, but that company went out of business and the routes were operated by other bus companies. Up to now the Government has refused to extend the free travel scheme to these companies. That means that a pensioner who used to be able to use his or her free travel pass to travel from Buncrana to Derry would be faced with paying the full fare of €8.75 return were it not for the fact that the new bus company, McGonagle buses, which has taken over the route is charging half fare of its own accord. Why should the free travel pass held by pensioners, mainly based on the Inishowen Peninsula in this instance, be worthless, while pensioners in other parts of the country can rightly use their pass to get around? I have tabled parliamentary questions to the Minister on this issue, but she has refused to relent and extend the free travel pass scheme to these new routes. It is unacceptable. When the Government is taking this approach to use of the pass on routes such as the Buncrana-Derry service, removing the eligiblity of pensioners and others to use the pass, is it not right that we should be concerned about its plans for the departmental review of the scheme?It is right that we would be concerned about the Government's plans in regard to the departmental review of the free travel scheme. If Government was genuinely committed to ensuring that people will continue to be able to avail of that scheme, it would not be restricting access to it in a number of situations. I call on the Minister of State, Deputy White, to discuss with the Tánaiste and Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, the extension of the free travel scheme to people in Donegal previously serviced by the Lough Swilly Bus Company in order that, like other people throughout the country who have access to the scheme, they are enabled to get around to do their daily business. It is unacceptable that these people would be left in a situation in which their passes are worthless. We all know - it has been mentioned several times already tonight - the value of the free travel pass to people over 66 years of age. The evidence suggests that 80% of people over 66 years of age rely solely on the their old age pension. These people require the free travel pass to enable them to get about. One often hears people say on turning 66 that it is great that they now have access to the free travel scheme. It means a great deal to them. I remind the Minister of State, Deputy White, that the free travel scheme was first introduced by Fianna Fáil. Regardless of the attempts to have a go at Fianna Fáil, its track record in relation to caring for older people and ensuring they have the services they need in order to have a decent quality of life is second to none. I ask that the Minister of State ensure that there is a change of approach in terms of how these issues are dealt with. The free travel scheme must be maintained as is and extended to those in County Donegal who are currently being refused access to it.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	630	I welcome this opportunity to respond to this debate on behalf of the Government. The Government is conscious of the needs of older people. It also fully understands that a wide range of other groups, including unemployed people, parents, carers and people with disabilities, depend on the welfare budget for vital support. We know that social protection schemes, from pensions to child benefit and from free travel to rent supplement, play a pivotal role in alleviating poverty and cushioning people from the worst effects of rising unemployment and falling incomes. In doing so, they help to promote social solidarity. A recent report indicates that social transfers helped to lift almost nine out of ten older people out of poverty. I want to respond to some of the commentary from across the floor during the course of the debate. It was said that recommendations had been leaked and that the Government is considering a number of specific changes. The review is not yet completed. The Tánaiste and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport have received no such recommendations and the Government is not considering any specific changes to the free travel scheme. I will repeat what the Tánaiste said last night. We make no apology for reviewing a scheme that is almost 50 years old. Every scheme must be open to review, improvement, better management and more effective delivery. The free travel scheme has been remarkably robust since its inception in 1967. The fact that a quarter of the population has some access to free travel is unusual in international terms and it must be paid for. The freeze on funding for the scheme introduced by the previous Government in 2010 has placed pressure on its operation as eligible passenger numbers have continued to rise. Deputy O'Dea said the freeze was a once-off budgetary measure. It was in fact part of the previous Government's four-year plan, the programme for national recovery. Deputy Ó Cuív said last night that the freeze on funding imposed by the last Government had no impact on customers. He implied that transport operators should be happy to carry passengers without adequate and fair recompense. Operators must, of course, continue to be paid for carriage. Owing to the freeze introduced in 2010, new routes or operators have not been admitted to the scheme and the funding that operators have received has been frozen, even though fares may have increased. This is the issue that Deputy McConalogue needs to address in relation to the matters in Donegal to which he referred. The effect of the freeze has been that in a small number of cases, where an operator has withdrawn from a particular route and been replaced by another operator, the new operator is not admitted to the scheme. Although I am not well versed about the situation in Donegal, it would appear to me that this is what occurred in that regard.

#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	634	It was not a once-off budgetary measure but was part of the National Recovery Plan 2011-2014, from which I can quote if I have time. That is undeniably the case. It is true, as stated by Deputy McConalogue, that Fianna Fáil was in government in 1967 when the free travel scheme was introduced. Fianna Fáil was also in government when the freeze was introduced in 2010. It was also mentioned that the interdepartmental group comprised no representatives of the elderly. This is true. That is the nature of an interdepartmental group. However, the terms of reference were public and the people carrying out the review met a large range of representative groups, including the elderly, the disabled and carers. They also met representatives of the transport operators. Everyone had the opportunity to present their views. This Government entered office at a time of unprecedented economic challenge. Our public finances are now performing well. Our projected deficit is in line with the targets to be achieved. We have shown that stable public finances are an essential prerequisite to long-term economic growth and job creation. We are only able to successfully access the markets in the long term if the markets believe we have a credible fiscal strategy and agree that our debt is sustainable. I want to assure the House that the Government, in the context of a very tough budgetary environment, will continue to do its utmost to protect the most vulnerable people in Irish society. This includes maintaining the free travel scheme, which has been protected in successive budgets and will continue to be protected. The free travel pass is safe for beneficiaries. I commend the Government amendment to the House.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	635	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. I thank my colleague, Deputy O'Dea, for tabling the motion. One would be forgiven for believing that this crisis situation was created by Fianna Fáil, but the opposite is the case. It is a fact that the Government, including the new Labour Party leader and Tánaiste and Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, initiated a review of this scheme. Stakeholders were contacted. Together with her colleagues of both Government parties, the Tánaiste has over the past couple of days suggested that this crisis was created by Fianna Fáil and one of the advocacy groups. A Labour Party colleague of the Minister of State, Deputy White, had the audacity to say on the floor of this House last night that this was a criminal endeavour between Age Action Ireland and Fianna Fáil. That was not retracted. The Deputy concerned used the phrase "Age Action Ireland and its partners in crime, Fianna Fáil". I reject out of hand the accusation that there is any effort to misguide or mislead anyone. Deputy O'Dea and I had an opportunity to meet this evening with members of Age Action Ireland, who needless to say were appalled on behalf of the people that they represent that a member of the Labour Party or any Member of this House would take such a low swipe at a time when people are under pressure. The fact is that the Department of Social Protection engaged with stakeholders on a review basis and set out the criteria and areas for consideration, including the possible introduction of a charge for access to the free travel scheme, the possibility of restricting the hours during which the service would be used and the possibility of the service not being the same for a future cohort of pensioners. The Minister of State said at the end of his contribution that beneficiaries would not be affected. However, he was speaking in that regard of current beneficiaries. Perhaps the Minister of State will confirm before the conclusion of this debate that the Tánaiste has no intention of changing the scheme in any way as it applies to people who are current or future users of it. The Government is playing with words. It should clarify where it stands on this scheme into the future. Fianna Fáil did not create the storm around this issue. We are addressing not only a palpable fear in the minds of those currently accessing the scheme but also the fears of people now in their late 50s and early 60s who know the benefits of this scheme when they reach a particular age and the importance of it in terms of their being about to get about in their daily lives. It is important that we address the issue of charges, including the manner in which they are transferred to the State companies.If the review ultimately states CIE and other operators are expected to do the same volume of work for less money, it will have an impact in the longer term on those who avail of the scheme. I want the Minister of State to clarify in the clearest possible terms before the end of this debate why he keeps suggesting there is no basis whatsoever to the charges we are putting forward, and why his colleagues are attempting to detract from the core issue? Will he make it clear to the House that there will be no charges introduced to the scheme, no limitation on the time for which the scheme will be available and applicable, and no future changes for those about to reach the threshold age, including those who are about to reach it in the not-too-distant future? If he does so, he will confirm to the House that the review is a waste of time and that there was no need for it in the first instance. The Minister referred to the fact that the proposals have something to do with eliminating fraud. The introduction of the new card deals with that. If there was a desire only to eliminate fraud, why, at the initial stakeholders' presentation, were issues such as charges, limitations on usage and the characteristics of the future package introduced? Let us have a bit of fairness and straight talking from the Government side.
#ColmKeaveney	unknown-#ColmKeaveney-party	unknown-#ColmKeaveney-dob	unknown-#ColmKeaveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	636	I acknowledge the commitment of Deputy O'Dea in tabling this motion. We face a problem over the use of language, namely in respect of the word "review". For many concerned people, a review means a cut by stealth. We know this from the medical card debacle, which caused considerable distress among the elderly and those with chronic illnesses, all of whom come under incredible pressure following a review. The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, stated the review concerns only the modernisation of the scheme. The language used is the same language that was used to order a review into maternity services in the west and north-west regions. There was a proposal to rip out maternity services across hospitals in rural areas. That report or review was shelved only when we established that there was a significant conflict of interest between the connections of those people central to the commissioning of the report and the review itself. Another so-called review, where the conclusions were predetermined by political necessity, was used to close, or never open, a state-of-the-art facility in Ballinasloe. It was a €3.2 million facility, the only ligature-free mental health facility in the country. It was never opened to ensure a Government backbencher would benefit from the proposal for a development in Galway city. That involved a review. The Minister for Social Protection, now the new Tánaiste, has asked us to take her at her word that there will be no cuts to the free travel scheme but she will have to forgive us if we fail to do so because we know the Government's modus operandi with regard to the word "review". The Minister made much of her protection of so-called core welfare payments. She has conveniently brushed over the fact that she disgracefully broke the commitment to young people under the age of 26 and the faithful commitment to the people, including women, that she would not cut child benefit. That commitment was part of a review under the programme for Government. The Government has stood over cuts that have disproportionately targeted the elderly, carers, mentally ill and people under 26. It is not as if what we are saying is isolated from what is being said by the advocacy groups. Age Action Ireland has clearly expressed its concern about the review currently being undertaken by the Minister. The objective of this motion is to put a marker down on behalf of those who believe they are being let down by the Government with respect to how it approaches reviews. Elderly people cannot be comforted by the Minister's assurances having witnessed the withdrawal of medical cards. Those over 70 have witnessed over 30,000 medical cards being taken from them. They have been subject to cuts to the tax relief on health insurance, the removal of the telephone allowance, cuts to the home help package and fuel allowance, the abolition of the bereavement grant and an increase in the pension levy. Therefore, elderly people know the Government is not on their side. The welfare of elderly people is in grave doubt with respect to the political commitment on the free travel scheme. I ask the Minister of State to pay particular attention to comments already made tonight on private operators. Contributors have stated the scheme in this regard is under threat and not viable as a consequence of the number of private operators who have grave doubts about their capacity to continue to operate under the scheme. I am sure the Minister of State will agree that the scheme has been of great significance in enhancing the quality of life of senior citizens. Some 70% of them rely on the scheme to gain access to medical care, do shopping and maintain social contact where rural isolation is a feature of life. I appeal to the Minister of State to advise the Tánaiste to enhance the assurances that have been given with respect to the ability of transport companies to provide services to the elderly. It is important that we examine the capacity to increase funding to ensure the private operators will have such scope. I appreciate that the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, have spent a lot of energy over recent weeks on the internal affairs of their party. It is an indulgence that has lasted over seven weeks. I ask the Minister of State to spend the same amount of energy spent over the past seven weeks on the elderly by making a commitment to defend the welfare of vulnerable people, who simply do not trust the Government with respect to how it approaches reviews.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	637	I thank everybody who contributed to the debate. The Government's main line of defence was attack. We have been accused consistently by Government backbenchers of trying to scare those eligible for free travel, as if they had suddenly become scared last night when the motion was tabled. For months we have been receiving representations, not only from individuals but also from relevant organisations, including Age Action Ireland, the Irish Senior Citizens' Parliament and a plethora of local organisations representing the elderly from one end of the country to the other. All their fear is based on a decision by the Government to conduct a review of the scheme, which review is now coming to an end. As my colleagues stated, the last review people saw was that of the medical card system. People are aware of the fiasco resulting from that. Naturally, if they are anxious about a review of the free travel scheme, they can hardly be blamed in view of what has happened. I was prevailed upon by several of the Minister of State's backbench colleagues last night to withdraw my motion. I was told to do so because they had got last night a categoric assurance from the Government, specifically from the Tánaiste, that everything would be satisfactory, leaving aside the fact that we got categoric assurances that there would be no reduction in child benefit and no increase in registration fees, in addition to assurances that prescription charges would be abolished and that the changes implemented regarding the lone parent allowance a fortnight ago would not be introduced until we had a Scandinavian-type child care system in the country. All of these categoric assurances were equally valueless. On the basis of yet another categoric assurance, from the same bottomless pit of categoric assurances, we were supposed to withdraw our motion, which could affect over 1 million people in a country of this size. If one considers what the Minister said and the speech made tonight by the Minister of State, one will see it is clear that the Government is not giving the required assurance in any case. What the Minister said last night was that the free travel pass is safe. The Minister of State more or less repeated that tonight. I accept that, if only because it is politically impossible for the Government to abolish the free travel pass in view of the kicking it got in the recent elections. Therefore, the travel pass is safe.What we sought from the Government was a commitment that the free travel scheme in its present form will not be restricted, reduced, diminished or eroded in any respect. Deputy Dooley mentioned the specific proposals that are under consideration, such as an extra charge or restricting free travel to certain hours or to certain modes of transport. We wanted specific commitments on those issues and we did not get them. In response to the Members who invited or entreated me to withdraw the motion, I probably would not have insisted on having a vote on the matter if I had received the categorical assurances I sought. Being an optimistic type of chap, I realise that if one gets enough categorical assurances, one of them will eventually be honoured. The serious point is that we have received many representations about this, and we had a meeting with representatives of Age Action Ireland this evening. The Government's attitude and responses to this motion will ensure that people who are elderly and in the twilight of their lives, the ill and disabled, the blind and people for whom the free travel pass is their only link to the outside world will continue to suffer anxiety, distress and worry because the sword of Damocles still hangs over the free travel scheme. That is the reality and the way the Government is acting. I note what the Tánaiste said on her assumption of the leadership of the Labour Party, that she wanted to govern more with the heart and the head, rather than just with the head. This is a very peculiar way to go about it.

What is wrong with borrowing money to build homes for people who desperately need them? In particular, what is wrong with that when it provides a stream of income from rent and, in the case of affordable homes being built by the State or by public authorities and sold to workers on ordinary wages, their mortgage payments? It is a stream of income that would actually meet whatever was borrowed so what is the issue here? Why does the Government stricture itself in this regard? What is wrong with borrowing money to build social or affordable homes, particularly when there would be a stream of income coming back from them? Why should any Irish Government limit itself because of ideological input from the European Union, the whole thrust of whose policy is to try to get housing provision totally in the grips of the privatised sector?Could the Minister of State answer that specific question?

If the money is used to pay for what one might call normal Government expenditure, however worthy that might be, the fund is simply another source of funding for the Exchequer and one must borrow it and pay interest on it, which means that Government expenditure elsewhere must be cut back so that we do not exceed our deficit targets. Section 40(2)(b) puts the agency on notice that it must seek to ensure its investments are made in such a way that they do not count as Government expenditure. That is the option we have. We could also use the €6.8 billion to pay off Government debt and, therefore, pay less interest on that amount from then on. The alternative, which is favoured by Deputy Higgins, is to spend the money on Government debt. In other words, it would go into Government expenditure. What we are saying is that if we get matching funds from the private sector, we will double the amount of money and get double the benefit for it. We can create jobs and have investment plans for water, telecommunications, energy infrastructure and so on. Very positive and constructive jobs that need to be done in our economy can and will be done with this money and they will be done through matching funds. We are doubling the impact it will have, as opposed to Deputy Higgins's proposals.

What is wrong with the pension fund being used for desperately needed social housing when it would produce a stream of income? If one wants to use the Minister of State's term, it is a commercial employment of the fund. Rents would come back from the part of it that was rented and mortgages would come back from the affordable homes sector. It is so obvious. Why should the Government be forced to go out to the capitalist bondholders to borrow money when it already has it in taxpayers' funds? Not only will it get that back, it will get extra back as well.

#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	649	I move amendment No. 1:In page 6, between lines 1 and 2, to insert the following:“ “ancient woodlands” means those woodlands which have had continuous tree cover since 1650 or before and which are most likely to have arisen naturally and to be descended from Ireland’s original forests;”.Some 80 to 90 amendments to this Bill have been tabled, many of which I submitted. I acknowledge the work of the Woodland League and the Environmental Pillar, whose greater knowledge and expertise than mine has informed the majority of my amendments. Amendment No. 1 is one of the most important of the amendments and seeks to include a definition of "ancient woodlands" in the definitions section and spell out what protection of the ancient woodlands as a key objective of the Bill would entail. The objectives of the Bill are set out on page 8. It is important to protect our ancient woodlands for many reasons. The thrust of many of my amendments is that we need substantially to change our forestry model away from a purely industrial, commercially focused model to one that emphasises the importance of our native species and the need to expand and regenerate our native woodlands. The importance the public places on this was evident in the movement that developed around the campaign against the planned sell-off of the harvesting rights of Coillte. People came out, marched and protested to indicate their opposition to that plan for many reasons. When people became aware of the possibility of the sale of the harvesting rights to our public forests, they were concerned because they saw forestry and our native woodlands as tied up with our identity and as a symbol of our culture. They felt it had to be protected and that failure to do so would be a terrible dereliction of our duty to defend what is unique, important and special about our culture. They felt our native forests were critical to this. We were a forest nation, as one of my environmental friends always tells me. The country was almost completely covered with oak and other native species. When the British came they destroyed our ancient woodlands. The amendment mentions the year 1650 as a benchmark date to identify the ancient woodlands because that is the year William Petty produced maps, which are the earliest recorded maps of what little was left of our ancient woodlands after their destruction by Oliver Cromwell. When this was explained to me, I did not know that William Petty gave us the word "petty". It is an interesting historical fact.

#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	651	It is another contribution we have made to the global lexicon. It also demonstrates the historical, heritage and cultural importance of the matter and how it intersects with a defining moment in our history. Oliver Cromwell understood that as part of destroying resistance to the plantations, he had to fell the forests. This was to give the lands to the soldiers who fought with him but also as part of quelling resistance to his agenda. The imperative to protect our ancient woodlands is part of protecting what we were and are and what we hope to protect and maintain in terms of our culture and heritage. This is not just a nostalgic aspiration, although culture and heritage is not just about nostalgia but is critical. It is also very important in terms of the project of protecting, developing and improving sustainable forestry. The ancient woodlands are the seed banks of native Irish forestry species. If we do not protect these, we will lose the genetic foundations of Irish forestry. One illustration of the consequences of disease is what happened in Gougane Barra recently, where a shocking decision was taken to cut down huge numbers of trees on the grounds that it was required to protect the trees from disease. We can discuss this later when we deal with the public consultation aspects of the Bill and the lack of sufficiently robust public consultation requirements regarding felling. I am informed by people who know more about these matters than I that there was no hard scientific proof of the existence of the disease. We can discuss it later. In so far as there has been some speculation as to how these diseases reach our trees and forests, a considerable belief exists that it is due to the fact that we are planting foreign, alien species that are not appropriate and make our forests more vulnerable to disease than they would be if we concentrated on native species that are perfectly suited to our climate and environment and that were, historically the trees of this country.They are more resistant to disease and more resilient in the face of disease threats. If we fail to protect adequately the remnants and pockets of ancient woodlands, we threaten the genetic storehouse of the native species that are appropriate to Ireland and which we will need to expand if we are to move in a more sustainable direction in forestry should we become more vulnerable to diseases associated with imported species. That is another important reason we need a specific acknowledgement of the importance of ancient woodlands and specific management plans for those ancient woodlands that still exist. They exist in most other countries in Europe where there are specific management plans for them. Such plans do not exist here. We do not have specific plans to ensure the protection of our ancient woodlands. That is what these amendments call for. I do not see why it poses any problem for the Government to accept these amendments. To do so would be in line with the priorities of many people in the country on the importance of our ancient woodlands. It would be in the interests of good and sustainable forest management as we move into the future. Those are the arguments. I hope the Minister of State will consider accepting the group of amendments.
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	652	It is important to point out in relation to Gougane Barra that the decision was based on positive findings of disease. The decision was based on scientific advice and helped to prevent the spread of the disease. That was the reason the trees were taken down. The importance of ancient woodlands was raised by Deputies on Committee Stage. These sites contribute to biodiversity and are important aspects of the historic and cultural landscape. The primary responsibility for the management of Ireland's nature conservation under national and European law is vested in the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, including the designation and protection of special areas of conservation, SACs, and natural heritage areas, NHAs. Many ancient woodlands are already designated as SACs or NHAs, including the magnificent oak woodlands in Killarney. If woodlands require additional statutory protection, they may be proposed for formal designation as an SAC or NHA. There is also a statutory provision under the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011 which allows the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht to enter into a management agreement with any owner, lessee, or occupier of a European site or other land of major importance to wild flora and fauna, which can include ancient woodlands. As stated on Committee Stage, my Department actively encourages the creation of new native woodlands through the native woodland scheme. It has also provided significant funding in the past for the conservation of native woodlands. The Bill strengthens the basis for these actions and supports into the future. Section 5 lists the promotion and development of forests for the purposes of biodiversity, public amenity and recreation as one of the general functions of the Minister. Section 11(c)(ii) also requires the Minister, in performing his functions, to take further account of natural and semi-natural woodland. I take the view that the concerns raised are sufficiently addressed in the Bill. As such, I do not propose to accept amendments Nos. 1 and 12.

This was not ancient woodland per se although it was an ancient woodland site. I have heard an argument from an international tree pathologist who has looked at the site and had been at it before the felling. She said there was no sign of this die-back at all. Some of the questions I have asked about this have been answered with references to things like aerial flights having seen from the air scorching which was indicative of the presence of this disease. I am not a scientist or sufficiently expert to know if these are signs. However, I have reported this to people who know more than I do and they said that is not conclusive evidence of anything. I have made further inquiries about precisely what the scientific evidence and adjudication was and how it would compare with other places where the disease has been found. I asked if the extent to which it was found here justified the huge felling we saw. Before we get to discuss it in more detail as we go along, I will brief myself fully. I was not sure the issue would come up tonight. I am open minded about it. I am not an expert, but I have to take seriously concerns raised by people who are quite knowledgeable in the area and ensure we have proper justification for a very significant and, at one level, shocking act. I have been to Gougane Barra many times. It is a beautiful forest park and the fact that so much of it was cut down and is closed to the public is a very serious matter. On the more substantial matter, while all of the things the Minister of State has said are true, this is about specifically including in a Bill on forestry an acknowledgement of the critical importance of ancient woodlands and putting in place specific management plans, which we do not have at present, directed toward their protection. It is not just a general conservation Bill but a specific forestry Bill.
