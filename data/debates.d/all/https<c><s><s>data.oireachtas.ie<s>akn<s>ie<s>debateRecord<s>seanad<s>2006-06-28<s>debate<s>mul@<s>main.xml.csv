Some Senators remain anxious to convey notice over the telephone but, in future, they will be refused.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	2	I appeal to the Government to do everything in its power to support the Housing (Stage Payments) Bill 2006. In recent years, stage payments have become a particular problem in the Munster area. I ask the Government to accept the Order for Second Stage, so that we can consider improvements to the Bill on Committee Stage in the autumn. For a number of years, Senator Coghlan has been consistent in raising this matter and now is the time for action rather than voting the Bill down.A very important issue was raised by Senator Feeney on yesterday's Order of Business. I join her in calling for a debate on sudden cardiac death syndrome. I am aware of a case involving a young man in his 20s who died last year. For the past ten months, his family has been unable to make contact with medical professionals, the Coroner's Court, the hospital or the people responsible for the autopsy, despite repeated attempts to do so. There is no information as yet on the cause of the man's death.We need to investigate the functions of coroners' offices because, however bad it may be that someone of an older age should die of natural causes, it is particularly difficult when a young person in the prime of his or her health dies in these circumstances. It is utterly wrong that the family still has not been given any information ten months after the man's death, despite the efforts made by gardaí to have the details of the case provided. This House has a role to play in highlighting cases such as this.I am aware of other cases in the Dublin area in which autopsies were considered after the death of an older person. Information on such cases is sent to the coroner but many months can pass before the latter allows death certificates to be issued. Not only does this cause trauma for the family but the estate of the deceased person cannot be put in order until a death certificate is issued. I am aware of terrible problems in the Dublin area in this respect, although I am uncertain as to whether similar issues arise elsewhere. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform should investigate the practices of coroners' offices, so that finality can be brought to this issue as soon as possible for the sake of the bereaved. I ask that we take statements on the matter in the autumn.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	3	I support the points made by Senator Brian Hayes regarding the Private Members' Housing (Stage Payments) Bill. I have heard that many people in the building industry have put pressure on the party leader to oppose this Bill. I do not know if that is true.I am sure the House will join with me to show approval for the Government's decision to refer to this country as Éire Ireland in Europe. This open-minded approach to bilingualism will be supported by the people in my home town. I ask that the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs be made aware of the Government's view on bilingualism and that the people of Dingle, who would like to have their town renamed Dingle Daingean Uí Chúis, can expect active support from those in senior positions in Government. This is a clear step forward by Government and we should formally rename my town Dingle Daingean Uí Chúis. This would be in line with Government policy and is supported by activists in the Government parties in Chorca Dhuibhne.

#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	15	The situation in the illegally occupied Israeli territories is about to become a major human tragedy. Despite the crowded schedule, I ask the Leader for statements, if not a debate, on the issue. This country is in danger of being besmirched by the EU position, which is effectively an assault on the people of Palestine because they voted for the wrong party. The Government of Palestine has moved dramatically in recent days. Carefully chosen language that means something slightly different to different people was the source of the caeasefire in 1994. Language of late has been carefully chosen but last night the Israeli army invaded Gaza. When a territory is illegally occupied and the occupants resist by armed force, even though I may find it morally wrong or politically inept, I will not accept that it constitutes terrorism. The attack on two Israeli soldiers by people resisting Israeli occupation is not terrorism. It may be politically inept but this country has long recognised the right of oppressed people, who have no other route, to resist.

#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	17	I believe in non-violence but when one refuses to accept the elected Government, refuses to accept UN resolutions and declares that 15 year old girls are unfortunate collateral damage when leaders of a movement are targeted, one puts oneself outside international law. This country must restore its reputation as an unequivocal champion of human rights. It is time to move beyond so-called even-handedness. The oppressors are the Israelis and their allies, the victims are the people of Palestine. What the victims have done is often awful but it is a product of being victims. I ask the Leader to consider allowing some of us to state Ireland's moral position before the summer recess, namely, that the abuse of human rights and the deliberate or indifferent killing of civilians is always wrong and cannot be excused whether perpetrated by a movement like Hamas or by the Israeli Government, which claims to be democratic.
#MaryMWhite	unknown-#MaryMWhite-party	unknown-#MaryMWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryMWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	18	I ask the Leader to call on the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children to address the House to explain why Dr. Patricia Comer, a Dublin general practitioner, will not be allowed to treat her 500 medical card patients when she turns 70 in August. How will the Minister rectify this appalling situation? There should be no age barriers to doctors treating patients. Dr. Comer can continue treating her private patients, a stark contrast with the fact that she cannot treat public patients. This is nothing but ageism. Almost all of Dr. Comer's medical card patients are older people who have built up great relationships with her over the years. She has treated their children and grandchildren. Older people are distressed at the prospect of changing doctors, having been served by Dr. Comer over the past 40 years.Last week I launched my document A New Approach to Ageing and Ageism.

#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	26	I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to the House for a debate on water quality. A recent global report showed that 40 million citizens in Europe do not have access to safe drinking water. Some 85 million people lack basic sanitation. The infrastructure in this country is deteriorating. Water supplies in many rural areas are the product of group water schemes and the systems are now ageing. Grants should be allocated to upgrade these water systems. Many small villages do not have sewage treatment plants. I am aware of at least seven villages in the midlands that are trying to develop but which do not have treatment plants. Development is taking place in those areas and we cannot slow it down. Documentation from these areas has been with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government for many years but it is not receiving attention. It is no support to those organisations or communities to hear the Minister say on the airwaves that the country is awash with money when he cannot provide funding for basic infrastructure. I seek a debate on this important issue because it is urgent that it be addressed.
#BrendanDaly	unknown-#BrendanDaly-party	unknown-#BrendanDaly-dob	unknown-#BrendanDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	27	I support Senator Bannon with regard to small village and rural water and sewerage schemes. Obviously there is a large backlog but it is not a question of money. The allocations provided by the Minister for Finance have not been drawn down over the last number of years. It is important that the Minister, and perhaps the Minister for Finance, indicate how these schemes can be kick-started. There is a large number of these schemes, several of them in west Clare, so it is an important issue.There are media reports of a proposal being put to Aer Lingus staff in anticipation of the selling of part of Aer Lingus later this year. There is widespread concern in Shannon about job security in the event of these changes taking place, while there is a widespread national concern that the future of the national airline be secured in any new arrangement. Perhaps the Minister for Transport could come to the House to indicate what stage the negotiations are at. He has been involved in negotiations with the unions and the unions have been in discussions with Aer Lingus. At this stage the matter is coming to a head and it is urgent that the Seanad have a debate on it.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	28	I wish to endorse the calls made by several Senators in recent weeks that the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children come to the House to discuss a variety of issues. I particularly seek a debate on the Adelaide Hospital. The leaders of the Adelaide Hospital are meeting the Taoiseach today about what they regard as a highly critical situation for the hospital. Their problem is that a hospital in the fastest growing population area in the country is now being run down. The Adelaide Hospital feels seriously let down by the Government, not just by the decision to establish a national children's hospital in the Mater Hospital but also by the fact that the under-investment in the Adelaide contradicts all the promises that were made by the Government to that hospital in 1996.A hospital which deals with 30,000 children in the accident and emergency department every year will, apparently, see its children's facility moved. The maternity facilities are also being run down and as a result of under-investment there are probably about 200 too few beds. I do not know if the Tánaiste is aware of this but the hospital is close to her constituency. It is a critical matter that must be debated urgently before something dramatic happens.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	29	I welcome the name change to Éire Ireland, which was announced by the Government. We are following in the footsteps of Finland and Belgium. I also believe the Seanad played a role by holding a good debate on securing recognition for Irish as a working language in the EU. Having our MEPs present for debates was helpful in that regard.I have previously raised the issue of how the Irish version of the names of towns and villages has been changed. While I do not wish to get involved in discussing whether Dingle is An Daingean or Daingean Uí Chúis, the name of Gort in Irish is, and always will be, Gort Inse Guaire, although it could be Gort Inse Brazil at present. However, it is now being given the placename of An Gort but An Gort has nothing whatever to do with Gort Inse Guaire. These names should be examined in the same way an Coimisiún Logainmneacha is examining the history of the names. I hope this will be considered by the Government.
#PaulCoghlan	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-party	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-dob	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	30	Like Senator O'Toole, I agree with Senator Brian Hayes regarding the Housing (Stage Payments) Bill. Only a week ago I received a letter from the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, in which he admitted the unsustainability and difficulty with his practice in many instances. It is not a uniform practice throughout the country; in fact, it is quite isolated. Perhaps a measure of agreement could be reached on this Bill this evening because there is a shared view in the House on the issue.I also welcome the Government decision that Ireland should be known henceforth as Éire Ireland. Long live Dingle, Daingean Uí Chúis, and we will leave An Daingean safely where it is, a lovely place in County Offaly.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	31	Yesterday I received the annual report of Enterprise Ireland, entitled Transforming Irish Industry. It would be worthwhile having a debate on it. It is clear there is a shortage of students and graduates in science and mathematics. Apparently, one of the reasons is that the class sizes for leaving certificate mathematics teachers are too large. Since there are a number of mathematics teachers available, it should be possible for the Department of Education and Science to invest in the future by encouraging more students to consider mathematics as a subject. That will require more mathematics teachers and smaller classes but individual attention being given to the students. That would be worthwhile.Senator Hanafin yesterday raised the issue of our future as an IT nation. The same approach applies with regard to leaving certificate students. Many schools have only one computer class per week. If we are to achieve success in that sector, we must invest in computer and IT training.I was disappointed to hear Senator Ryan, in calling for a debate on Palestine, almost support the killing and kidnapping of Israeli soldiers.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	32	I did not.

If we are to be level handed on this issue, we must include a condemnation of kidnapping and killing. I support his call for a debate on Palestine.
#FrankFeighan	unknown-#FrankFeighan-party	unknown-#FrankFeighan-dob	unknown-#FrankFeighan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	34	Will the Leader invite the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the House to address the serious situation regarding family law courts, or the lack thereof? This problem has been raised with my office in the past three months. Unfortunately, divorce and separation occur and the incidence is increasing. However, people have had to travel from all over Ireland, the UK and the United States on numerous occasions for such cases only to find that the cases are adjourned or there is no judge available. People have been obliged to take weeks holidays from work. It is also giving rise to costs, inconvenience and anxiety.People in the legal profession are aware of the situation. The Circuit Court might be sitting for four days but only one day might be scheduled for the ever increasing number of family law cases. People are powerless to do anything about it. Are the courts or the judges listening? People are being caused serious distress and the House must try to address the situation. I am aware of one person who has come from the United States on three occasions for a family law case. It is a separation case and such cases can sometimes be better dealt with outside the court. However, this case has been adjourned on three occasions and the person cannot believe it. When they see the legislation in place in the UK and the United States, they consider Ireland to be in the Dark Ages when it comes to family law. The Minister should come to the House to address this outrageous situation.
#TerryLeyden	unknown-#TerryLeyden-party	unknown-#TerryLeyden-dob	unknown-#TerryLeyden-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	35	I support the call for a debate on the grave situation in Palestine and Israel. Not only has an Israeli soldier been kidnapped by a group called the Popular Resistance Committee but it has also kidnapped an Israeli settler. This was reported by Reuters yesterday. The agreement between Hamas and President Abbas is welcome, although it is ambiguous about recognising the right of Israel to exist. It is vital that we have a debate and I hope the issue is raised today at the meeting between the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Pope Benedict. The Pope should intervene in this regard, welcome or not in that region. He has great influence.The attack by the Israelis was predicted, they took out bridges and a power station in the most deprived area in the world. By destroying the Gaza Strip's infrastructure, it will be uninhabitable. The electricity was turned off last night and troops moved in. The other side, however, must recognise Israel's right to exist or it will not work. Both sides must sit down and learn from our experience North and South. We should express our abhorrence of violence on both sides.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	36	I support my colleagues in calling for a debate on the Middle East, particularly the situation in Israel-Palestine. In this instance one's heart goes out to the parents of Corporal Gilad Shalit who was kidnapped, one understands their human feelings. There is, however, rarely parallel concern for the human rights of the many children who have been killed by Israeli forces in that area. The electricity was cut off and one wonders what happens to the hospitals as a result.I welcome, however, the remarkable agreement between Hamas and Fatah. An 18-point plan has been agreed that gives de facto recognition to the state of Israel with Jerusalem as its capital. This is astonishing news and it appears that forces on both sides are attempting to subvert it. That is why this kidnapping took place and why the Israelis have massively over-reacted, because there are those on both sides who are committed in their opposition to peace.I am glad the visit of the Minister for Foreign Affairs to Pope Benedict was raised, I intended to raise it myself. The visit to the Vatican is not just ceremonial. The Minister stated on the radio this morning that political matters are on the agenda. In such circumstances it is legitimate to raise questions because the Pope is unusual in being not only the spiritual leader of one of the world's great religions, he is also a political Head of State, albeit an unusual one. As such, and as Cardinal Ratzinger, he presumed to give instructions to democratically-elected politicians in other countries, including Ireland, as to how they should vote on certain political matters. This is extraordinary behaviour on the part of a Head of State and it is important this is questioned in a courteous manner. It would not be accepted as appropriate behaviour from any other Head of State.On the controversy about Éire Ireland, I am delighted. The enrichment of language is always a joy but I remember when if anyone on the BBC said "Éire", he was jumped on for being patronising. As for the associated difficulty of Dingly Dangly Douche, I will not get involved but it sounds like a Turkish bath for ageing Senators.

The waste of Garda time in courts is unacceptable, with cases not being heard for weeks or even months when gardaí are called to the courthouse. Juries can also be called into courts to wait for up to three days and the court might never be called again. Something must be done to streamline this process. People are doing their civic duty and should at least know when and if the case will be heard so they do not have to waste their precious time.

It will be decided in July and it will be vital that the Minister gives us her views and hears what we have to say so a good decision can be reached.
#DonLydon	unknown-#DonLydon-party	unknown-#DonLydon-dob	unknown-#DonLydon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	39	I also support Senator Ryan's call for a debate on the Palestinian problem. I spoke to the Prime Minister of Palestine at the weekend and I can assure the House that the Palestinians want peace and would support a two state settlement. The situation, however, is complex and, from an Israeli point of view, if the people next door want to destroy the state, there are no easy solutions. It would do no harm to debate this matter.Before we rise for the summer, would it be possible to debate the Genealogy and Heraldry Bill 2006? This Bill has little appeal but is very important. The House would be more than willing to sit an extra few days to deal with it.

It is gratifying to see that the average cost of motor insurance has declined substantially for the second year running.

#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	43	The Senator is very sexist. Senator Brian Hayes, whom I would not have thought would be sexist, asked that the Government would not oppose Second Stage of the Housing (Stage Payments) Bill tonight. I intended to seek that because Senator Coghlan had spoken to me about this. Senator Coghlan has a letter from the Minister which would be of assistance in the debate. Perhaps we can agree on Second Stage and then go on from there. I hope I can persuade the Government to agree to Second Stage and to deal with Committee Stage later where the issue can be teased out.Senator Brian Hayes also referred to sudden cardiac death syndrome, raised by Senator Feeney yesterday, and asked about the coroners Bill. Before Christmas, Deputy Rabbitte tabled an urgent amendment in the Dáil, which we took quickly here, that addressed a particularly sad situation. That was helpful but the much larger Bill to provide for reform of the coroners' service and replace the Coroners Act 1962 will be published later this year. The delay between an autopsy and the coroner's verdict leads to delays in the finalisation of financial affairs, adding to grief for families. This is a matter of concern and we await the Bill.

He stated we have a deteriorating water supply and an aging system of water provision. He referred to the group water systems. I remember when group water systems were the way to go and one would be invited to meetings calling for group water systems all over one's area. These systems in small villages have aged, as Senator Bannon stated, and are deteriorating. We missed Senator Bannon at a recent meeting in a small village quite near him.

He also raised the particular position of Shannon and the great disquiet and widespread concern about the lack of employment stability in the area, and asked if the Minister for Transport could come to the House.Senator Ross referred to the Adelaide Hospital and a meeting today with the Taoiseach about the matter. He asked the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children to look at this carefully because the proposals which have come forward for the new children's hospital are affecting the Adelaide Hospital in many ways.Senator Kitt stated he was delighted with proposal regarding Éire Ireland.

I am aware from speaking to parents that there is great disquiet about honours mathematics.Senator Quinn cavilled at Senator Ryan for what he saw as his one-sided view of the Palestine-Israel matter.

That was Senator Ryan's point.

There is a need for more such sitting days for such courts. That is a point which he could raise when we come to the Criminal Law Bill 2004.Senator Leyden also called for a debate on Palestine-Israel, as did Senator Norris who has been consistently calling for it.

It is astonishing that amending legislation dealing with members of the Defence Forces operating abroad includes the provision in section 3(1), "with the prior approval of, and on the authority of the Government." I am not opposed to such approval but I am surprised it is necessary to provide for it in this legislation. I assumed that such decisions were provided for in primary legislation.Am I to take it that if this phrase was not inserted, the Chief of Staff could dispatch members all over the world on his own initiative? Is this phrase necessary in the legislation or is it contained in primary legislation, such as the 1960 Act? This is not a major issue but when I read the Bill, I wondered whether the Defence Forces Chief of Staff would need to obtain Government approval before he deployed personnel if this phrase was not included. Perhaps because the Minister is an eminent lawyer, I will ask questions that I might otherwise not. He deserves congratulations because he is the only Minister whose photograph appears on the departmental website.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	76	I did not realise that and I thank the Senator for bringing it to my attention. Since Ireland began to participate in overseas missions in the 1950s, the general authority to send troops was always assumed. For example, a number of observers were dispatched to the Middle East in 1958. No legislation was in place and they were dispatched on the basis that everybody assumed it was legal to do so.When the first armed overseas mission was undertaken as part of a peacekeeping operation in the Congo in the early 1960s, the Government decided to pass legislation to set out the circumstances and procedures for sending troops abroad on armed peacekeeping missions. The legislation did not cover other personnel such as observers or those attending seminars, undergoing training or participating in ceremonial duties. I suspect the reason the legislation did not deal with them specifically is it was assumed all activities were legal. There is a danger it could be argued that because the 1960s legislation laid down the procedures for sending troops overseas, it could not be applied to all personnel overseas and, therefore, there was no authority to send troops overseas other than on an armed mission. The Attorney General thinks the argument would not succeed but that does not prevent it from being raised. The provision is being included for the avoidance of doubt and to head off anybody who may make that argument in court.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	77	When the UN makes a request for support for a mission, the Government asks the Defence Forces to carry out an assessment. This is forwarded to the Minister who then brings it to Cabinet. Has the verdict of the military on a mission been different from the position adopted by the Government? If such a scenario arose, the public would not be aware of it. How many UN requests does the Minister receive annually? What is the parliamentary involvement in the current procedures? Where the decision is taken, the Dáil is involved and, therefore, an absolute parliamentary role is in built. Will the Minister outline what happens when the military makes a recommendation and the politicians make another?
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	78	The UN receives a request, which is then transmitted to us. If the UN decides to embark on a peacekeeping operation, Ireland is usually contacted and the Government then makes a decision. Before the Government makes a decision, an assessment, as the Senator correctly stated, is carried out. A number of factors determine whether Ireland participates in a mission. For example, the Defence Forces has a threshold of 800 troops who can be deployed abroad at any time. Participation in new missions depends on how near the limit they are. One of the most important factors is the risk element and we rely exclusively on the military assessment for this. I cannot envisage a scenario where a Minister or a parliamentary delegation would undertake its own investigations to second guess the military, which makes the risk assessment. Sometimes the military outlines a substantial risk attaching to a mission but, nevertheless, because of its importance, the Government decides to go in anyway.While the military would not necessary advise against doing so, senior personnel would say it is probably okay but certain factors need to be borne in mind. The current mission in Afghanistan, which involves only seven troops, is an example. The situation is volatile and that is why the mandate for the mission is renewed on a four monthly rather than an annual basis. For example, I obtained Government agreement yesterday to extend the mission by another four months from July. However, I am keeping it under review and I am in regular contact with the military about the risk element in Afghanistan. Generally, we rely on the military to carry out the risk assessment and we go on its advice.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	79	I am glad risk assessments are undertaken continually because while I supported the mission to Liberia, it was probably one of the riskiest the Defence Forces ever undertook. Fortunately, they have been extremely successful considering their role was as close to peace enforcement as a Defence Forces mission has ever come in that they were dealing with irresponsible and unpredictable armed factions. While the State should not only support risk-free missions, there is a need for a review of risk taking and whether the risks are proportionate to the outcomes, as they were in Liberia. It was a sad and tragic country in a state of permanent civil war. Similar requests, however, may be made in the next six months regarding Somalia.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	80	I thank the Senator for his remarks. The Liberian mission has been very successful. The mission was due to discontinue this month but the Government decided, at the request of the UN Secretary General, to extend it for 12 months. The mission will be gradually scaled down during that time. Since 1993 overseas missions have become riskier because chapter 7 or peace enforcement missions were added to the Petersberg Tasks.I refer to peace enforcement missions, in which peacekeepers may be obliged to use force to make a peace settlement stick. Hence, in addition to the level of risk, the terms of reference which we are now entitled to use under the Petersberg Tasks must be taken into account.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	81	I move amendment No. 1:
In page 4, to delete lines 34 to 46, and in page 5, lines 1 to 4, to delete subsections (2) and (3).This comes to the nub of a disagreement between the Labour Party and the Government on the definition of what constitutes an international force. My understanding is that the previous position stated it was necessary for a force to be established by the Security Council. The Minister's amendment proposes a force which is established, mandated, authorised, endorsed or supported. The Labour Party does not share the Government's view in this regard and the amendment is an attempt to return to the status quo in terms of the definition of an international United Nations force.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	82	There may be some confusion in this regard. If I am correct, Senator Ryan's amendment reads, "in page 4 to delete lines 34 to 46, and in page 5, lines 1 to 4, to delete subsections (2) and (3)". Is this the amendment to which the Senator is speaking?
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	83	Yes.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	84	Section 4(2), which the Senator proposes to delete, provides for a saver in respect of personnel who enlisted before the enactment of the Defence (Amendment) Act 1993. The effect of the amendment would be to delete this saver. As stated, the 1993 Act extended the involvement of the Defence Forces in UN-mandated peace support operations to include peace enforcement missions. I refer to chapter 7 missions. At the time, the view taken was that personnel who had enlisted before the enactment of that Act would not have envisaged service on such missions as part of their terms of enlistment and that consequently, it should not be made mandatory for them. With the repeal of the 1993 Act, the section is being re-enacted in the present Bill. As it would be a breach of faith to use the legislation under discussion to remove the saver in respect of the pre-1993 personnel, I cannot accept the amendment.To put it in simpler language, in 1993 the type of peacekeeping mission in which Irish troops could engage changed fundamentally. Chapter 7, or peace enforcement missions were added to the pre-existing simple peacekeeping missions. The Government's view at the time was that people who had enlisted before 1993, when chapter 7 missions became a feature of foreign peacekeeping operations, had not done so on that basis. They had enlisted on the basis that when the Defence Forces went overseas, they could only carry out ordinary, non-chapter 7 peacekeeping missions. Hence, it was considered to be fair and proper to exempt such personnel from the requirements of going on chapter 7 missions.There are some exceptions in this regard. First, a police-type mission, which is not regarded as being dangerous, is all right. The second exception concerns someone who enlisted before 1993 and who signs up for a chapter 7 mission. This scenario is also all right. However, the Department did not consider it to be right and proper to force such people to engage in such missions because at the time they joined the Army, they did not exist.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	85	I refer to members of the Defence Forces who signed up before 1993 and who did not sign up under the post-1993 conditions.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	93	The Minister is aware that the last time he came before this House, it passed legislation to put in place an ombudsman who would take responsibility for investigating claims of bullying or harassment within the Defence Forces. In the context of this section, I wish to raise a point, given that the Ombudsman (Defence Forces) Act 2004 predated the Government's decision to amend this Act in principle to allow personnel to travel to other parts of the world for all kinds of reasons. I presume it is legally possible that, under the aforementioned Act, a complaint made overseas concerning an action by one member of the Defence Forces against another could be fully investigated and a determination made. I raise the point because the Ombudsman (Defence Forces) Act predated the Bill under discussion at present. Will the Minister clarify whether the situation I have outlined is applicable?
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	94	As personnel deployed abroad are deemed to be on active service, the ombudsman's remit does not cover that scenario.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	98	I move amendment No. 2:
In page 5, between lines 6 and 7, to insert the following:"(a) by inserting “or International Peace Mission” after “International United Nations Force” in each place where those words occur.”.The House had a preliminary discussion on this issue during the Second Stage debate last night. Undoubtedly, the Government's position differs from that of the Fine Gael Party in respect of the triple lock. However, the Minister will understand that I have taken the opportunity afforded by this Bill to have a debate on this issue. Fine Gael's amendments Nos. 2 to 7, inclusive, with No. 6 being the most important, would attempt to change policy on the triple lock. It will be useful to have a debate on this matter because differing views exist on all sides of the House. The Fine Gael Party has chosen to do so by way of its amendments, in order that the debate will be on the public record.As the Minister is aware, from 2003 Fine Gael has consistently argued for a change in the policy of triple lock. The current policy concerning the commitment by Irish troops abroad is based on three simple and straightforward resolutions, namely, a resolution of the Government, a resolution of the Dáil and a resolution of the UN Security Council. Fine Gael believes that this policy requires amendment, in order that the people themselves would decide on the operations in which they would become involved through the Defence Forces.The Minister is well aware of the difficulties which exist at the UN, particularly as far as the Security Council is concerned. The latter has five permanent members and ten rotating members. Some years ago, Ireland was one such rotating member. Each permanent member has a veto in respect of any resolution put before the Security Council.Last night during the Second Stage debate, Senator Minihan raised the case of Macedonia, where it was absolutely clear a contingent of troops was required for peace enforcement. As I understand it, 13 EU states and 14 non-EU states were involved. We committed to send troops to that region, which is within our sphere of Europe. The Chinese vetoed a resolution at Security Council level because the Macedonians had supported the Taiwanese. The Chinese retaliated against this small emerging democracy and for their own selfish political ends vetoed a perfectly sensible and rational UN Security Council resolution which would have better protected the region.I know not many such cases exist, but this is a clear irrefutable example of where Ireland's national interests were put to one side as power play in New York determined whether we could commit troops in the field, and as such, it must be debated. There may well have been a time when the triple lock was necessary, in the context of the Cold War and the two power blocs which existed for so many years after the Second World War. However, we must question it in today's much more fluid and complex situation.The Minister gave a straight-up explanation of the new EU battle groups last night. He described them as comprising approximately 3,000 troops. We will be part of the Nordic battle group. At six-monthly intervals these battle groups from various parts of the EU will be on standby. In the Minister's words not a huge number of Irish personnel will be committed. However, where we are part of that 3,000 contingent under the new arrangement we will be dependent on having a UN Security Council resolution before we can commit members of the Defence Forces. That is a loss or diminution of sovereignty. Others now decide how exactly we should fulfil our role in the international community. It is the considered view of my party that this issue must be debated.The recent controversy in Shannon and the use of Irish airspace and airports by the United States was the most clear example of public outrage and expression of how people felt, one way or the other. The triple lock made no difference as to whether the United States was given permission to use our airspace. It is put up by the Government as a sacred cow and part of our traditional policy of neutrality. I believe we live in a much more complicated world, in which Kofi Annan asked for regional autonomy and capability. I refer to Chapter VIII, Article 52 of the United Nations Charter, which states:Nothing in the present Charter precludes the existence of regional arrangements or agencies for dealing with such matters relating to the maintenance of international peace and security as are appropriate for regional action provided that such arrangements or agencies and their activities are consistent with the Purposes and Principles of the United Nations.We suggest exactly that. We believe that if the Government and Dáil Éireann decide to commit troops in the context of the purposes and principles of the United Nations, we should be entitled to do so and we should not be stopped by petty squabbles at UN Security Council level. That is the position of my party and of many people who consider this matter in a rational way.The Minister referred to the Petersberg Tasks, which were endorsed by the Irish people in the Maastricht treaty and subsequent treaties, a much greater test of sovereignty than any resolution to which the Dáil can come. How can we possibly rapidly respond to humanitarian or environmental issues under the Petersberg Tasks if we are stymied by power play in the United Nations? We believe we should amend our law in this area and provide for this much more transparent and exacting policy which would allow us to fulfil our international obligations.We ask the Minister to consider these amendments in the spirit they are tabled. We understand this debate is ongoing but we will use the Bill as an opportunity to debate this important matter.

I am free to speak, as is Senator Ryan. He makes political points and I am entitled to make a political point.To return to the triple lock argument, I heard Javier Solana speak on this matter at the Forum on Europe. I also heard a leading United States expert on foreign policy speaking on it. I cannot remember his name, he may a Congressman. Javier Solana made the point that the example mentioned by Senator Brian Hayes was isolated. It only happened on one occasion. The United States spokesperson pointed out every country must have a framework of rules and conventions for its foreign policy. When it is self-imposed it does not involve any loss of sovereignty whatsoever. It is a sovereign decision and, in principle, it could be changed down the line.One must understand the reason and rationale for the triple lock system. As Senator Brian Hayes knows, most people in this country are attached to the tradition of military neutrality. Alongside that, and this is part of the de Valera tradition of foreign policy going back to 1946, is a desire to contribute to international collective security. There is no conflict between neutrality in the sense of not belonging to partial military alliances and supporting international collective security. The reality is one would not have sufficient consensus in public opinion in this country unless fairly clear guarantees were given. We have a long tradition of support for the United Nations and, taking that by and large as a rule of thumb, one isolated example is not sufficient to depart from it.If one was to get rid of the triple lock system, it would not merely apply in cases where China used its veto for an arbitrary reason not connected with the situation in which we were interested in participating. It would leave us wide open to involvement in many situations without a United Nations sanction. That would not be acceptable to public opinion. The certain uneasiness and the fact we have not rushed into it is because of terms such as "battle groups", which the Government and the Minister agree are unfortunate. We have a duty, particularly as a prosperous and well regarded nation to play our full part in international collective security and to do so reasonably pragmatically.I have no hang-ups about our having engaged in peace-enforcement missions since about 1993. I have no problem with such missions if they have UN backing. Senator Brian Hayes is right in that the UN has moved in recent years towards delegating responsibility in this regard to regional organisations and this means we could find ourselves engaged in peacekeeping missions co-ordinated by NATO. This does not alter the fact that the missions would be UN-backed but, none the less, the logistics would be organised by NATO. As we know, there is opposition to such proposals from groups such as PANA, one of the leading lights of which is a member of the Labour Party although he does not necessarily express Labour Party policy.Public consensus in this matter is very important. There is great support for our Defence Forces — I would never wish this to be otherwise — and I therefore believe the triple lock mechanism is an essential reassurance. One would need to realise that an isolated problem would have to recur regularly to warrant change and I fully support the Government's position in this regard. The triple lock mechanism needs to be maintained but I also support the view that we need to make the largest possible contribution, within our capacity, to international peacekeeping operations. This requires some pragmatism and that is why I am opposed to these amendments.

However, I will try to confine my remarks to the Bill.The triple lock does not represent an inhibition of the scale some of my friends in Fine Gael believe it to be, yet I would not rely too much on Javier Solana as an authority. When Mr. Solana first came to Ireland, he wanted to talk about the new security role in the European Union but we discovered that he had slipped through a clause in the European Parliament late in the session, effectively creating a carte blanche for himself to do all his business in secret. This was at a time when we were told the Union was to be a model of transparency. Second, when he came to talk to the joint committees on European affairs and foreign affairs, he insisted that the meetings be in private. This is not the way to win favour. The Joint Committee on European Affairs refused to meet him on his grounds and the meeting never took place.The problem with security, particularly within the European Union, is that there are people at the highest level in the Union who deeply resent not having a big stick to accompany their economic power. If one goes to Brussels for one of their fairly honest briefing sessions, they will tell one that Europe is an economic superpower and a military mouse and that they wish to change this. I do not have any great ambition to have a third military superpower on the planet to compete with the existing one and the developing one, China, which will probably not become a full military superpower in my lifetime but which will inevitably become one. If India's economy continues to develop as it is at present, it will also become a military superpower. I am not sure the necessary consequence of this is that the European Union should become one also, nor am I sure this is the way to achieve collective international security. The way to achieve it is through the strengthening and enforcement of international law.I disagree with my friends in Fine Gael on the limitations of the existing UN system although I do not believe this issue is one that would lead to our having difficulties in forming a Government. We are well able to work these matters through and have found capacity to agree on more difficult issues. It is always easier to agree with Fianna Fáil than Fine Gael for the reasons I have already stated and which I will not repeat. I am very glad we are debating this issue because I remember Senator Mansergh saying foreign affairs constituted a matter for the Government and that the Oireachtas should, by and large, stay out of them. In doing so, he enthusiastically quoted Éamon de Valera.
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	126	We were talking about a different matter.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	127	I am glad we are making progress on this issue. At least the entanglement of the Oireachtas in foreign affairs is now accepted.I do not agree with Senator Brian Hayes on this issue although there is much merit to his argument. The solution is to create a UN structure whereby we can assume that we will only rarely have to draw on superpower status. Chances are that, within ten years, there may well be a couple of other permanent members with vetoes, and there may be all sorts of other changes. This issue could be revisited if there were a succession of circumstances regarding which the Irish people felt we should be involved and that the aforementioned mechanism was the only reason preventing us from becoming involved.I have no objection in principle to a legitimate, valid method of despatching Irish troops into potentially dangerous situations but I am very sceptical about the something-must-be-done school of thought which espoused, during the horrors of the Yugoslavian civil war, that we should have sent an army to the region. The leader of a particular NGO which deals with development issues responds to every difficult set of circumstances in the developing world by suggesting we should send in an army. If we had sent in as many armies as that individual saw fit, thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of the world's defence forces would probably be tied up in all sorts of difficult circumstances. We therefore need to avoid the something-should-be-done school of military intervention. The triple lock mechanism puts the something-should-be-done mentality through a good, efficient filter such that only conflicts in respect of which military intervention is regarded as both valid and potentially successful can be considered.The idea of sending an intervention force into horrors such as those that obtained in Bosnia and Croatia at the height of their civil war is hair-raising when one considers the amount of death and slaughter that might result to no great purpose. I have never been persuaded that large-scale military intervention ever stabilises any conflict and it always postpones rather than creates a resolution. In this regard, consider the conflict in Afghanistan.What looked like a decisive end to a particular system of government may not have been nearly as decisive or as final as people thought at the time. I am still waiting to see what will happen in Kosovo where again there appeared to be a military intervention to stop the Serbian attack. I am not sure what the outcome will be there because I am sceptical about the use of overwhelming military force of the kind that, incidentally, may be used in Gaza in the next few days, to achieve anything other than a good feeling among the supporters on one side. The whole triple lock mechanism is cumbersome, slow and, I agree, occasionally embarrassing but I would be prepared to revisit it if we had a succession of these kinds of situations. The only problem we have had so far is with Macedonia. If it becomes a regular feature and if the United Nations became permanently divided, it would be valid but at this stage it is neither necessary nor essential.

#JohnMinihan	unknown-#JohnMinihan-party	unknown-#JohnMinihan-dob	unknown-#JohnMinihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	131	I raised this issue last night as I did three years ago. The triple lock is a necessary mechanism to deal with our own insecurities about neutrality. Let us call a spade a spade. That is the reason we had to do that. It is a question of having a more mature debate about what our neutrality means and the real crux of the issue for me is the power of veto. We are not in a position to change the UN Security Council. I am aware that Kofi Annan has stated over the past 24 months or so that there must be an examination of the reorganisation of the UN and the way it does its business but I doubt if people will give way on the power of veto. The power of veto is the key.The Minister might avail of the opportunity to clarify some concerns I have about this whole area. I am inclined to agree with Senator Ryan that as of now there is no evidence that we should amend or change our stated policy on the triple lock mechanism. In the case of Macedonia, however, my understanding is that we already had troops there in some capacity, albeit a handful of troops — I stand corrected if I am wrong — and when the UN resolution failed, we had to withdraw them. Perhaps they were seconded to NGOs or used by way of some other mechanism.We will have a problem if a clear humanitarian crisis arises and a request is made for Irish troops to assist, be it logistically, engineering wise or in whatever speciality the troops are required, in an unarmed mission with no conflict and which is clearly of a humanitarian nature. How do we get over that problem? Do we get over it by seconding troops to an NGO? A crisis developed in Nicaragua or somewhere after a hurricane and a platoon or a company of engineers assisted by way of logistical support. Perhaps that situation could be clarified.If we have a mechanism to allow us respond to situations similar to what happened in Nicaragua, where a UN mandate is not required but we were in a position from a humanitarian basis to allow military personnel with their expertise contribute to an international aid effort, that would be appropriate. Do we have a mechanism to reflect the will of the Irish people in such disasters? Unfortunately, we sometimes look at the military purely from a perspective of guns. There is much more expertise within the military to allow its personnel move into a situation logistically in terms of engineering or whatever. All I am saying is that if such a situation were to arise, it would be unfortunate if we as a people were unable to contribute to it because of the vested interests of one of the five permanent members of the Security Council. It is not that I want to abolish or change the triple lock mechanism in any way. I want a mechanism that reflects the will of the people in such a scenario and on such a request. I support the requirement for the triple lock mechanism. It is what the Irish people demand in their understanding of our neutrality.
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	132	I essentially agree with the substance of what was said by the two previous speakers. I support the triple lock mechanism but if a case arose where there was an arbitrary veto and it was clear nonetheless that there was overwhelming public support for the operation to go ahead, it would always be open to the Government to introduce emergency or fast-track legislation to suspend it in that specific instance. I agree that if this turned out to be a recurring rather than a once-off problem, we might need to do something more fundamental. However, if we get rid of the triple lock mechanism, we are leaving it wide open for a variety of situations.Senator Ryan is right in saying that the triple lock mechanism would not prove an insuperable difficulty in coalition negotiations. I am sure that is correct. If one studies the track record of the past 25 years, one will see that Fine Gael is always more forward on defence policy and at times outright sceptical if not hostile to Irish neutrality. Fine Gael defers to the strong convictions of its partners. I remember when the Fine Gael spokesman——

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	140	Senator Brian Hayes referred to what I said last night about the battle groups and the figure of 3,000. I reiterate that a battle group will consist of only 1,500 troops but the ambition of the European Union, which it has now achieved, is that from next year it can have two battle groups standing by to be deployed simultaneously.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	141	Is that 1,500 each?
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	142	Yes, 1,500 each. One might be deployed to Africa and the other to Asia but they will be deployed simultaneously should that be necessary.I wish to clarify another point on which there appears to be some confusion. The United Nations does not decide to deploy a battle group. The United Nations will ask the EU to intervene and the method of intervention by the EU, as a regional agency, will depend on what the EU decides. It might decide, for example, to send a traditional type of peace enforcement mission or a battle group, depending on the circumstances.Senator Hayes also mentioned the necessity of rapid deployment in a humanitarian crisis. In section 3(1)(f) we are providing for troops to be deployed by the Government on humanitarian missions in the absence of a UN resolution. In other words, the resolution will not be necessary to deploy troops. Until now, the Government did not have the power to deploy troops on humanitarian missions. There will be no United Nations resolution because there is no threat to international peace and security. Until now, troops could volunteer and they would be seconded to an NGO and go in as part of an NGO operation. We are now giving ourselves the power to deploy troops if necessary in a humanitarian situation but there will not be a UN resolution. That will not arise.Regarding Senator Minihan's question about Macedonia, we did not have any troops there that had to be withdrawn. My advice is that there was a United Nations mission in Macedonia, which was vetoed by the Security Council and had to be discontinued. Subsequent to that, an EU mission was sent there by virtue of a UN Security Council resolution but I do not believe we were participants in either.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	143	It was UN Resolution 1371.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	144	I thank the Senator. There were no Irish troops there in either case. They were not part of the UN mission. They were part of a subsequent EU operation. The core of this amendment lies in the definition of international peace mission and the provisions under which a contingent could be despatched on such a mission. The rest of the amendments are consequential to the acceptance of the definition of international peace mission. What the amendment proposes is, effectively, the elimination of any requirement of a UN Security Council mandate, including any requirement for such a mandate even for a peace enforcement mission. It is proposed that a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force could be despatched on a peace support mission, once Dáil Éireann is satisfied that it accords with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and has approved the despatch of the contingent. From the outset of this process I have stated that a triple lock of UN resolution, Dáil and Government approval would remain. That has been the consistent policy position of this Government and I do not intend to depart from it.It is also a position which I know is understood and appreciated by the Irish people. The effect of the amendment would be to make the existing provisions as regards an international United Nations force moribund. I cannot and will not do that. I am well aware that it has been a consistent policy of Fine Gael, and I respect that, to remove the requirement for UN authorisation. However, the United Nations Charter is clear. In Article 24 it provides that, "Members confer on the Security Council primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security, and agree that in carrying out its duties under this responsibility the Security Council acts on their behalf". In addition, in Article 53 as regards regional organisations, the charter states, "...no enforcement action shall be taken under regional arrangements or by regional agencies without the authorisation of the Security Council...".The effect of the amendment would be to undermine the authority of the United Nations Security Council. As strong supporters of the United Nations and the primacy of the Security Council in relation to the maintenance of international peace and security, we take our authority for participation in international peace support operations from the Security Council, and we do not need to apologise for that. The existence of such mandates confers a legitimacy on an acceptance of particular peace support operations by groups engaged in conflict. This is an important force protection issue also. In addition, to take on board what is now being proposed would open us to the possibility, as Senator Mansergh said, of military adventurism. While I understand the position and the thinking behind the amendment, I cannot accept it.I want to make a couple of general points. As regards whether the necessity for a United Nations resolution will prevent us from deploying rapidly, I do not accept that it will. We intend, when we have successfully negotiated membership of the Nordic battle group, to have an administration arrangement to deal with those matters as quickly as possible. We have no control over how quickly the United Nations resolution will be forthcoming, but will have an arrangement in place to call the Dáil together quickly, to have a Government meeting, etc.The framework nation for the Nordic battle group will be Sweden. We have had detailed discussions with the Swedish Defence Forces and the Swedish Ministries of Defence and Foreign Affairs. They do not foresee the United Nations resolution creating any impediment. None of the other members of the particular multinational group of which we hope to be a part, the Nordic battle group, has a legal requirement for a United Nations resolution before it deploys. It is fair to say, however, that there is an overwhelming requirement. People are extremely reluctant to deploy troops in the absence of a United Nations resolution. In addition, the Nordic battle group is not the only one in which Ireland will be involved. Perhaps it will be in the short-term, but we are exploring other possibilities. Some members of other multinational battle groups have a legal requirement. I also understand there is a possibility that at least one member of the Nordic battle group which does not have a legal requirement for a UN resolution may be changing its law to provide for that.I can envisage situations in which Ireland could be part of a multinational battle group where other members might not want to deploy because they are carrying some historical baggage that would not allow them to become involved in a certain part of the world, not because of the absence of a UN resolution. Conscious of that, the multinational battle groups will have a built-in redundancy provision to provide for a situation where one or more constituents cannot deploy as required. In other words they will have a fall-back position to provide for such contingencies. We need not be too worried about that.It has been a very good debate. I take on board everything that has been said about the triple lock. I take on board the possibility that we might be faced with a succession of situations. That is a fairly remote possibility but there is the chance that some future Government might be faced with a succession of situations where the overwhelming view of the Irish people is that we should be deployed some place, but we cannot because one member of the Security Council vetoes it. That is the position if, indeed, the United Nations decision making process remains at it is, which it probably will.In the short term we are discussing with our potential partners, and with other European countries such as Austria, the possibility of participation in multinational battle groups. Nowhere in the course of these discussions has the possibility even been mooted that the necessity for a United Nations resolution, which everybody understands we have, will hinder or hamper us or stand in our way.

However, it is not a question for other people to decide whether they are satisfied with out position, but rather a matter for us. I suspect the other countries involved in the Nordic battle group would not raise the issue because it has nothing to do with them. It is a matter for us and that is why we need to debate it.Senator Mansergh spoke about the whole question of public support and consensus and he is right about that. We cannot do this without the full support of the Irish people. However, I will be clear about one thing. His party promised before 1997 as regards involvement in Partnership for Peace that there would be a specific commitment in the Fianna Fáil manifesto on a referendum to get the support of the Irish people. This was a guaranteed commitment, promised by the Taoiseach. What happened to that?

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	151	I would take that with a very large dollop of salt. He is absolutely right, however, in saying we need a national framework. We have one, namely, the right of any political party to question that national framework in the light of the circumstances we find ourselves in. There is absolutely no suggestion in our position since 2002, and in the series of amendments we have tabled, that we would depart from the principles and the purpose of the United Nations Charter. To use the Minister's phrase, no military adventurism is being proposed in this. It is simply a restatement in a much more modern context of existing policy, because we could not take part in any adventure, to use the Minister's words, unless it was absolutely rooted in the consent and the principles that apply from the United Nations.Let us understand who are the countries that possess the power of veto, to which Senator Minihan referred. They are the United States of America, China, France, the United Kingdom and Russia. These are the countries which can decide at any stage, for their own selfish ends, to veto policy in this area. With the greatest respect to colleagues, we are abdicating our sovereignty to the United Kingdom, to the United States of America and to other countries should this situation arise. The point has been made that there has been one case — the celebrated case of Macedonia — and the law should not be changed on the basis of one case. If it happened once, it can happen again. We are now moving into a much more fluid situation, given the establishment of these new battle groups, and hopefully Ireland's participation therein. We must adapt our policy as a consequence of that.Senator Mansergh referred to de Valera, someone I greatly admire, as I have recently told him, and the traditional policy of neutrality he developed. I am more with Lemass on this, however. Lemass was much clearer about Ireland's obligations in terms of the then embryonic European Community, now the European Union, when he said that if we are part of it we have got to defend it. The case of Macedonia was within the sphere of European influence. Resolution 1371 was passed for Macedonia and was enforced by NATO. It was clear that there was an obligation on the part of NATO, which wanted to hand the duty over to the Europeans. A total of 27 European countries were prepared to commit personnel to Macedonia, but Ireland was not.Senator Ryan asked what can be done. There are legitimate things that we can do and which we have done so well in the past. The Irish come with considerable historical and current knowledge of peacekeeping. We are world renowned for it and we should make no apologies for it. In these amendments, we are trying to create a new policy which would ensure that other countries cannot get in the way of doing something that most Irish people want to support. There is no question of military adventures in these amendments. They are consistent with EU principles and EU consent. I am glad the amendments have provoked this debate, but it is a debate which needs to take place across the country. That debate will ultimately be decided by the country.I respect the position of the Labour Party on this and I know the party respects our position. It is better to be up-front and honest with all parties about where one stands rather than having to change position after the election.

He did not just articulate the traditional policy of neutrality. He mainly articulated Ireland's obligation to take part in international collective security, which could have involved the use of force on certain occasions. People should have no bones about that. When Lemass suggested a willingness to engage in territorial defence of the European Union, he went considerably further than any subsequent Government on this issue.We are discussing law in this House. When enacting law, we may all have the best possible intentions. Law can last a very long time, sometimes it can last for centuries. People may have different attitudes and intentions. We cannot take for granted the idea that there is overwhelming support for removing the triple lock. The point of law is to have precautions written in so that the law cannot be broken until a decision is made to introduce new legislation. That is why the weakest part of Senator Hayes's argument is that this is some kind of abdication of sovereignty. The adoption of the triple lock is an act of sovereignty and not an abdication. In principle, we could change it in the future, which simply underlines the point that it is a sovereign decision.I would like to set the record straight on Partnership for Peace. Senator Hayes is correct to state that there was a promise to hold a referendum.

There were people who were anxious to see a majority of MEPs elected who would be opposed to Partnership for Peace. As it happens, we did fairly well in that election. The Fine Gael Party and even the Labour Party did not have a problem with Partnership for Peace. We gained an electoral mandate after the European Parliament elections. That may not make everything right and we are open to some criticism on the subject. However, the Irish people were at least consulted before it actually happened.
#TerryLeyden	unknown-#TerryLeyden-party	unknown-#TerryLeyden-dob	unknown-#TerryLeyden-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	162	That is most enlightening.

Section 3(1)(f) had not slipped past me. I clearly see that we have the ability to deploy, which means that we would not have to succumb to NGOs. However, someone will have to make a decision on what is humanitarian and what is not. I presume that it will be made by the Government and by the Department of Defence.If we decide to deploy in a given scenario and the UN resolution is vetoed for some particular reason, we will be in a scenario where we decided to put troops into a humanitarian situation but we had to withdraw. There is no definitive answer to that and it is one of the problems that may come down the tracks. It is useful that we have highlighted these problems in this debate. It is not that we are not aware of them. The necessity for the triple lock mechanism is a clear reflection of the Irish people's view on deploying troops abroad. It is due our historical view of the definition of neutrality.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	164	This has been an interesting use of our time. By definition, all law can throw up anomalies. One only needs to recall recent events. When the Supreme Court ruled that Mr. A would be returned to prison, it declared that it would publish its reasons the following Thursday, but we are still waiting. That shows how complicated law is as the eminent judges of the Supreme Court are trying to find a consistent position on how a man could be locked up again, having being convicted of an offence on unconstitutional grounds. Their lordships will have to choose their words very carefully.

When I say at public meetings that we cannot discuss the Judiciary, the judges always ask why not and who said so. We cannot libel judges and we cannot attribute evil motives to them, but we are perfectly entitled to speak about their rulings. I have been involved in debates in which I was very restrained, but Supreme Court judges told me that I was perfectly entitled to criticise any decision they make, provided evil motives are not attributed to them.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	171	Senator Minihan asked about troops being deployed. I envisage a very remote possibility of a humanitarian mission established under section 3(1)(f) subsequently becoming the subject of a United Nations resolution. A humanitarian mission follows an event such as a tsunami or an earthquake and we have given ourselves the right to deploy troops rapidly to help the unfortunate people affected. A peace support mission is entirely different. Could a mission that starts as a humanitarian mission subsequently become a peace support mission if the political circumstances changed?
#JohnMinihan	unknown-#JohnMinihan-party	unknown-#JohnMinihan-dob	unknown-#JohnMinihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	172	There could be civil unrest.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	173	I suppose it would be possible. In such circumstances, I imagine the troops who had been deployed in accordance with section 3(1)(f) would still be validly there. Obviously, if it became too dangerous we would need to take that into account and might need to withdraw them. The question of their safety would be a matter of agreement between the Government and the host state. If we were satisfied that the host state could make proper provision for their safety we might decide to leave them there. We would need to deal with that situation if it arose.Subsequent to the United Nations mission to Macedonia that needed to be withdrawn, an EU mission was sent. We did not participate in that mission because of the wording of the resolution. Owing to the way the UN resolution was drafted, the wording of the Defence Act 1954, as amended, did not allow us to participate. We have therefore changed the definition of "international United Nations force" in section 1 of the Bill. The original legislation provides that we can only participate in missions "established" by the United Nations. We have legal advice that "established" includes authorised by regional agencies such as the European Union, the African Union, etc. However, when drafting a resolution, as officials of the United Nations do not have the Irish defence legislation before them, they tend to use terms such as "supports", "endorses", "sanctions" etc., which is why we are now inserting such terms provided a resolution has been passed.I agree with Senator Mansergh. The decision for Ireland not to participate in a foreign peace support mission without prior sanction of the United Nations is a deliberate sovereign decision of the Government. Other governments have decided otherwise. It is a decision on which they can change their minds and we can also change our minds. It is an exercise of our sovereignty and not an abdication of it.I will not get into the debate about election promises, the PfP, etc. If I had an afternoon in a library with access to the Internet to research the election promises of all parties, I could come up with many promises from various parties when in opposition that were broken when in government.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	177	I move amendment No. 3
In page 5, before section 6, to insert the following new section:"6.—Section 70 (as amended by section 4 of the Act of 1960) of the Principal Act is amended by—(a) inserting “or for any purpose specified in section 3 of the Defence (Amendment) Act 2006” after “International United Nations Force” in each place where those words occur, and(b) by inserting “or International Peace Mission” after “International United Nations Force” in each place where those words occur.”.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	178	This section describes the way in which a contingent would be despatched following approval of the Dáil. I am referring to the insertion of a new section 2(3) in the 1960 Act. Last night Senator Moylan asked why the Seanad is not included. I accept the version as outlined by the Government. Constitutionally the Government is not even obliged to be in this House. I understand the Dáil approves the nominations of the Taoiseach to the various Cabinet posts. The Government makes up its mind and the Dáil approves the decision on the despatch of troops. It is correct that the Dáil and not the Seanad should make the decision. However, there is merit in Senator Moylan's suggestion that the Seanad, as it did in the case of the mission to Liberia, would have either a resolution or a debate which would allow both Houses of the Oireachtas to debate the matter. Often this House has a greater opportunity to have such a debate than the other House does, owing to the theatrics and the bearpit atmosphere in that House. We had a very good debate on the mission to Liberia the day after the resolution was passed in the other House. What is the view of the Government on the Seanad having the opportunity to debate the issue without giving formal approval to it? I understand why and agree that it should not approve such missions. However, the Seanad should be involved in some way.
#PatMoylan	unknown-#PatMoylan-party	unknown-#PatMoylan-dob	unknown-#PatMoylan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	179	I accept what the Minister said last night on this matter. However, when the Seanad and Dáil are involved in enacting legislation, I believe that perhaps in the event of something going wrong with the forces deployed, someone could subsequently take a court case claiming that because both the Seanad and Dáil approved the legislation, both Houses should have a say in the decision, which should not lie solely with the Dáil. Those were my grounds for having raised the matter. I accept what the Minister has said. I hope nothing occurs later that would prove the Bill wrong.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	180	I do not believe the Senator's fear is well founded. I agree with Senator Brian Hayes that the Seanad should have an input. In my term as Minister, if a further deployment of troops abroad takes place, I will organise that it be formally reported to the Seanad, which can then make its own arrangements for a debate.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	181	That is very useful. I thank the Minister. I have one other point on this section. The troops may only be sent "but only if, the contingent or member is not so deployed until a resolution under subsection (1) of this section has been passed by Dáil Éireann approving of their despatch for such service". It is absolutely clear. If the Government needed to take a decision in July, August or September on the despatch of a number of troops to an emergency situation, the Minister appears to suggest that the Dáil would need to be recalled to give its approval.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	182	Yes.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	183	I move amendment No. 8:
In page 6, lines 26 and 27, to delete "and Dáil Éireann may by resolution approve of the report".I know the Minister will claim this is a direct transposition from the previous legislation. However, I believe it is a peculiar phrase. Section 13 states, "The Minister shall, as soon as practicable after 1st day of January in each year beginning with 1st day of January 2007 make a report to Dáil Éireann on the operation in the preceding year of section 2 of the Act of 1960." Who could object to that part of the section? However, the phrase "and Dáil Éireann may by resolution approve of the report" is a very peculiar choice of words. Dáil Éireann may by resolution also disapprove of the report. There can be no legal reason to have a form of words that suggests that the Dáil has some obligation. I know that cannot be the case as the Dáil is sovereign. I have no idea why that was inserted in the first place because it seems an anomalous collection of words. A report is put before the Dáil and it is up to that House to decide whether to approve it. This matter is not the end of the world but the wording may be superfluous. The Minister will say it is traditional to insert such a phrase but we sometimes end up with legislation which perpetuates superfluity to the enrichment of those in the Minister's former profession.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	184	The effect of this amendment would be to delete the requirement for the Minister to have the annual report on participation by the Defence Forces in UN missions endorsed by Dáil Éireann.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	185	It would not have that effect.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	186	This provision was introduced in the 1993 Act by the coalition Government of the time. It is good that the Dáil reviews in some detail and on an annual basis the missions undertaken by the Defence Forces, which for the most part have been approved by the Dáil in accordance with the requirements of the Defence Act.Section 13 states, "Dáil Éireann may by resolution". That is a permissive provision which also allows for disapproval by the Dáil. The real reason for the phrase is that it enables the Dáil to debate the report. The technical opinion is that, if the phrase is excluded, the Dáil will not be able to debate the reports laid before it. An Opposition amendment was accepted on this issue by the Government in 1993.

A sober appraisal of the facts demonstrates the clear desirability of participation in various international tasks, including peacekeeping. Opportunities should be provided to debate any controversies that arise because an attitude of wilful paranoia is far too widely held. The Minister has to continuously battle against misrepresentations of this country's policies, which are laudable and overwhelmingly supported by the public.

It might not be a bad idea to lay the report before both Houses so that a debate could be held in the Seanad. I ask the Minister to consider this proposal while the Bill progresses through the other House. There is a real chance that the reports will be debated in this House but the chance of a debate being held in an already overcrowded Dáil is remote.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	193	I claim vindication for the Labour Party, which for many years has pointed out the existence of a legal anomaly. It is good that the Attorney General finally recognised the truth of my party's claim. Fianna Fáil is adept at belated conversions, as was revealed by Senator Mansergh during this debate.

Given the fact that the Dáil would have to make a resolution on these matters, I suggested to the Minister that the advice of the Attorney General might be put into the public domain. The precedent should be broken in this regard because every Deputy will be involved in deciding on whether to commit troops to other parts of the world.It is proper that changes were brought to allow for the consideration of activities additional to international peacekeeping, so that the Defence Forces can continue to bring great honour to this country. We have had an interesting and useful debate, although some issues will have to be considered on another day.

I wish our Defence Forces well. They have served us well in the past and will continue to do so in new areas in the future.As regards keeping the Seanad abreast of developments under sections 8 and 13, reports often get a good airing in this House and, wherever possible, we should be given the opportunity to debate whatever is put before the Dáil.

It is unfortunate that more debates on defence matters are not held. The role of the Defence Forces is widely acknowledged as a source of pride among the public.The Defence Forces have undergone a significant transformation over the past number of years and I commend the Minister on the leadership he has given in terms of embracing change. Our troops are taking on greater international duties and are being better equipped, which allows them to respond to their changing role.However, it has been a difficult time for the Defence Forces. As one who left the Defence Forces when the transformation was beginning, it would be remiss of me not to acknowledge the role of the Minister and his Department in embracing the changes proposed in the White Paper. The product of that transformation is a very professional force. It is only when tragedies occur overseas that we focus on the Defence Forces but we should express interest in the tremendous work they do, not only after tragedy but all the time, so as to ensure they are protected by legislation and adequate equipment.

We have deployed our troops abroad since 1958 when no legislation governed this issue. Several Governments have done so since, some of which included members of the Labour Party. If it was necessary to do so then, the Labour Party could have changed the law. This Government considered it necessary to include an avoidance of doubt provision. Senator Ryan claimed that Fianna Fáil was a party of late conversions. I will not entertain the House with the history of the Labour Party and late conversions. I could provide examples of conversions that changed again once the election was over.

Cancer is a major challenge to our health services. It is a major cause of morbidity in Ireland, with 20,000 people diagnosed each year. Effectively, tackling the problem of cancer means providing specialist services of a consistently high quality with sufficient capacity as well as appropriate support services for patients, their carers and their families.Improving cancer care is a major priority of this Government. We have invested over €900 million in the development of cancer services since 1997. We have appointed over 100 additional consultants specialising in cancer. About 34,000 more people were treated for cancer in public hospitals in 2004 compared with 1998. That is a very significant increase of nearly 60%. The key goal of the 1996 national cancer strategy, which was to achieve a 15% decrease in mortality from cancer in the under 65 year age group in the ten-year period from 1994, was achieved in 2001, three years ahead of target.Despite continuing improvement in mortality rates, the burden of cancer continues to rise mainly as a result of our growing and ageing population. The number of patients with cancer to be treated in 2020 is expected to be nearly 29,000, almost double the number in 2000, which stood at approximately 14,000 patients. A further significant issue is the variation in survival rates within Ireland and our relatively poorer cancer survival rates for many common cancers when compared with other European countries. In part, this is a result of our fragmented cancer services.The central message of the new national strategy for cancer control is that the reorganisation of cancer care delivery is essential. There is clear evidence that people who have surgical treatment for many common cancers in centres with higher throughput experience better quality of care and better survival rates. The Tánaiste is especially concerned that many hospitals currently performing small volumes of cancer surgery do not meet international best practice. To ensure that patients receive the highest possible quality of care, we must develop a small number of cancer centres, which can pool together knowledge, expertise, experience, skills and the latest technology.The development of managed networks around these cancer centres will allow for cancer care to be delivered in other hospitals within the network, with diagnosis and treatment planning directed and managed by multidisciplinary teams based at the centre. In such circumstances it is possible for much of the treatment to be delivered in local hospitals. It will be necessary to ensure that all cancer care is quality assured by the relevant cancer centre. This is the model which is operating successfully in paediatric oncology. Every child in Ireland who develops cancer has his or her diagnosis established and treatment planned at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children in Crumlin. For many children, significant components of their treatment are delivered in one of the networked hospitals under the supervision of and in accordance with the protocols of Crumlin.As many as one third of cancers could be prevented by public policy initiatives and the promotion of healthy lifestyles. Cutting down on tobacco consumption and improving diet could help to save many lives. The adverse impact of tobacco consumption on human health is well documented. Over 7,000 deaths in Ireland each year are attributable to tobacco-related illness. Tobacco is a significant burden on individuals, family and society through death, illness and medical costs. Even a modest reduction in the huge burden of disease caused by tobacco consumption will result in significant health gains.There have already been a number of positive steps to reduce the consumption of tobacco such as Ireland being smoke-free at work since 29 March 2004 and the availability of nicotine replacement therapy to medical card holders. The Tánaiste will explore with the Minister for Finance the scope for further fiscal measures to reduce the consumption of tobacco.The Tánaiste is especially concerned that children are using sunbeds. This is a totally unacceptable practice which greatly increases the risk of melanoma cancer later in life. The Government has approved the Tanaiste's proposal to regulate the use of sunbeds, including prohibiting their use by those under 16 years and the placing of warning notices in sunbed salons and other places where sunbeds are available for use by the public.Screening for certain types of cancer plays a crucial role in early detection, saving lives and reducing morbidity. BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme, is available to approximately 160,000 women in the 50 to 64 year age group in the former eastern, north-eastern, south-eastern and midland health board areas. Since the commencement of the programme in 2000, approximately 245,000 screening visits have taken place which is a massive endorsement of the programme by the women invited to attend.The Tánaiste is most anxious that BreastCheck be rolled out to the remaining regions as quickly as possible. Revenue funding of €2.3 million has been made available to BreastCheck to meet the additional costs involved and an additional 69 posts have also been approved for this purpose. BreastCheck has selected two clinical directors to lead the roll-out and they are currently undergoing additional training for their new roles. BreastCheck will shortly begin recruiting consultant radiologists, consultant surgeons and consultant histopathologists.An additional €21 million capital funding has been made available to BreastCheck for the construction of two new clinical units and the provision of five additional mobile units and state-of-the-art digital equipment. BreastCheck is confident that the target date of next year for the commencement of roll-out to the rest of the country will be achieved. A pilot cervical screening programme commenced in the mid-west region in 2000. Screening is offered free of charge to approximately 74,000 women in counties Limerick, Clare and north Tipperary.The Tánaiste wishes to see cervical screening rolled out nationally by 2008. Up to 200 lives a year could be saved by such a programme in Ireland. To progress this initiative, the Tánaiste has announced her intention to establish a national cancer screening board to manage both the BreastCheck and the cervical screening programmes. This will maximise the expertise in both programmes, ensure improved efficiency and develop a single governance model for cancer screening.The new board will also advise on the implementation of a national colorectal cancer screening programme, specifically on the population to be screened, at what intervals screening should take place, the type of test required and the requirements for a quality assured, well organised and cost-effective symptomatic service.The Department of Health and Children is working closely with the HSE and the National Development Finance Agency in implementing the national plan for radiation oncology. The plan consists of four large radiation oncology centres in Dublin, Cork and Galway, and two integrated satellite radiation oncology units in Limerick Regional Hospital and Waterford Regional Hospital. In addition arrangements for access for patients in Donegal to radiotherapy services at Belfast City Hospital are being progressed as part of North-South co-operation in the health sector. These developments will result in a significant increase in the numbers of patients receiving radiation oncology treatment throughout the country over the coming years.I have already outlined the substantial investment that has taken place in cancer services since the publication of the first national cancer strategy, as well as the additional appointments and increased cancer services activity. We will continue to invest significant additional resources in cancer control. The Tánaiste asked the HSE to prepare a robust needs assessment for cancer control for the next five years that reflects the projected increase in cancer cases.We need to make our health care system more accountable, more focused on outcome and more committed to quality care. Many of the services available for patients with cancer in this country are on a par with, if not better than, services in many other countries, but we need to tackle the problems identified by the National Cancer Forum in fragmentation of services and the variations in outcome experienced by those who use them.We will address this by developing a framework for quality in cancer control. Through this framework we will be able to ensure that services perform to the highest standards in all parts of the country and that the interests of patients are protected. It will help to show where this is room for improvement so that we can ensure that people with cancer get a consistently high quality of service irrespective of where they are treated.The work of the quality assurance group on symptomatic breast cancer services under the expert chairmanship of Professor Niall O'Higgins will point the way forward for quality assurance. This group is currently at an advanced stage of developing guidelines for the interdisciplinary management of breast cancer. On completion, the Tánaiste will ask the HSE to apply these guidelines in hospitals it funds and to monitor adherence to the guidelines as part of its performance management system.An information model and infrastructure to address the information needs of patients, professionals, managers and policy makers is also essential. One of the functions of the Health Information and Quality Authority will be to evaluate and provide advice on the clinical effectiveness of health technologies, including drugs. The Tánaiste will be asking HIQA to establish a cancer health technology assessment process to facilitate speedy introduction of proven health technologies in the field of cancer.Cancer research stands on the threshold of unprecedented opportunity. Recent developments in science and research hold out the potential for more effective, safer targeted treatments tailored to the specific characteristics of each individual patient's cancer. The Tánaiste considers that it is timely to ensure that cancer control research is better planned and integrated to ensure that Ireland can develop as a centre of excellence. Significant opportunities exist in cancer research given the commitment and investment of the Department, the HSE, the Health Research Board, Science Foundation Ireland and the Irish Cancer Society.The Tánaiste is convinced that there is a need for a more identifiable national focus on research to harness the disparate financial and intellectual capital and thereby achieve a better return nationally. The aim is to ensure that current and future resources are invested to support an overarching national cancer control research plan. The Tánaiste will arrange for this to be scoped in consultation with the various stakeholders. We will seek to ensure that priority areas in cancer research are identified, that current gaps in cancer research are effectively addressed and that duplication of effort is reduced.The developments which I outlined here today in cancer services are a clear indication of the considerable progress that has been made in addressing the burden of cancer in Ireland. I ask the House to commend the Government on its positive and demonstrable commitment to cancer services.
#FeargalBrowne	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-party	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-dob	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	205	I welcome the Minister of State to the House. His speech was good but it reminded me of someone about to paint a room, it filled a lot of cracks.The opening paragraph of the report states that 20,000 Irish people develop cancer every year and 7,500 die from the disease. One in four people will die from cancer and 60% of cancer patients die within five years of diagnosis. Cancer incidence appears to be falling but because we are aging and living longer, the chances of developing the disease are expected to increase. The number of new cases by 2020 will have increased by almost 107% of the number dealt with in 2007. There are now 120,000 cancer survivors. Such figures are startling and give an outline of the work ahead for any future Government in the area.Much work is being done. Fine Gael welcomes the report and acknowledges the huge amount of work put into it by those involved. We are concerned, however, that a person's address can have a major impact on his or her treatment and survival rate. That should not be the case for a small country. We are told every day that we are one of the richest countries in the world but this stark fact confronts us.We welcome the national cancer strategy but are disappointed that the Tánaiste did not publish an implementation plan outlining where cancer services will be located, the funding that will be given to the strategy and the timeframe for implementation, although the HSE is due to announce such a plan in seven weeks. We admire the research and work the National Cancer Forum put into the strategy and we hope its work is not let down by the Government, which has not yet published its policy.The Government's record is worrying. In 2001, the national health strategy promised a revised implementation plan for the 1996 national cancer strategy by the end of 2002. Here we are four years later and the Government is late publishing the strategy, never mind implementing it. The HSE will be obviously responsible for implementing the strategy and will devise an action plan within the next few weeks. It will decide which hospitals retain services and will appoint a national director to oversee implementation of the plan. Cancer care will be delivered at eight centres across the State, in four regional networks each serving a population of approximately 1 million. The Government has launched the strategy, yet has not told us where these cancer centres will be based or what areas will be covered by the four networks. If the Minister had done so, perhaps the strategy would have had more credence.The Minister of State in his speech spoke about key areas, which to my mind are the easy topics. Immediate action was taken on sun beds, for example. While the Minister of State also mentioned tobacco control, as far as I recall in the two most recent budgets the Government did not increase VAT or excise duty on tobacco, which seems to send out the wrong signal. While the Minister of State stated in his speech that the Tánaiste would consult with the Minister for Finance on this issue in the run-up to the next budget which indicates there will be an increase in tax, we must do everything in our power to deter people from smoking. Certainly, it is quite worrying to see young women smoking now. Whereas it does not seem to be as big a problem among young men, for some reason young women seem to think it is fashionable and "cool" to smoke when the opposite is the case.As I stated earlier, there is a significant variation in the level of service meted out around the country. For example, Professor Paul Redmond, who is chairman of the National Cancer Forum, told us that there are major variations in treatment of cancer between the regions; there is inconsistency in treatment of cancers at the same stage; there are major variations in survival rates between the regions in Ireland; and our pattern of care and survival are generally poorer than those of the other EU countries.Prostate cancer is the most common cancer, after skin cancer, among men in the Republic yet there is no mention of a national screening programme for prostate cancer in this strategy. I accept that the best international medical advice is that there should not be one, although I am totally baffled by it. In every debate on health, Senators, in particular Senator Glynn, correctly point out that we should be doing everything in our power to encourage citizens, in particular men, to get regular health screenings. I cannot understand why one cannot get one's blood tested for PSA. I availed of such a test myself recently in the Houses under a health screening programme. My father had prostate cancer and my uncle died from it. Lately, the former Taoiseach, Charles J. Haughey, died from prostate cancer and the cancer was much publicised as a result. I do not understand why we cannot put in place a scheme that would raise awareness of prostate cancer or even an advertising campaign to encourage men to go to their doctor to be tested. I am totally baffled by this. I accept that the Department is being told it is not best international practice, but Ireland could take a lead on this. If the Department does not implement a strategy on it, perhaps they should at least undertake an aggressive advertising campaign or take some initiative on the issue.Despite nine years of reports and promises, a nationwide free cervical screening programme has not yet been rolled out. Only 30% to 40% of the population is being screened opportunistically and only 9% of the population is covered by the pilot national cervical screening programme, whereas a screening programme would cover between 80% and 90% of the population. Approximately 150,000 smear tests are being done each year and this number could double under a screening programme. It is worth noting that such a programme would only cost an additional €10 million, which is a drop in the ocean. A while ago when the PPARS system failure came to light the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources described €150 million as a small amount of money. It is a pity that for want of such a small amount of money the Department cannot implement a full national screening programme for cervical cancer. The Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley, in his speech accepted that there are considerable economic and social implications for the family of a person dying from cancer.The number of women diagnosed with breast cancer has increased by 25% since 1994 and a comprehensive national screening programme is still not available to facilitate prevention and early detection. Next year Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats will have been in power for almost ten years but there is still no nationwide breast cancer screening programme. It is six years since phase 1 of the service commenced in the eastern region and five years since publication of the national health strategy, which promised that breast and cervical cancer screening would be extended nationwide. In the intervening period there has been a litany of announcements that have come to nothing and women must wait until 2007 or 2008, according to the latest announcement. It is particularly upsetting for people in the south and west who were led to believe in 2003 that a service would be rolled out nationally in 2005.I was shocked to learn lately that in 2008, women in Northern Ireland will be celebrating 15 years of breast cancer screening and a reduction of one fifth in deaths from the disease. By that time in the Republic of Ireland hundreds of women will have lost their battle with breast cancer and hundreds more will have endured devastating radical surgery. I accept that much good work has been done but, on behalf of the Opposition and of many people in Ireland, I must express frustration that the national screening programmes have not been rolled out as promised and ask why this is so.The Minister of State spoke about the radiation unit for Waterford Regional Hospital and I hope that will be announced in six or seven weeks time. It is vital that the south east would have a centre in which people could receive radiation therapy as part of their cancer treatment. On the last occasion the Minister of State was in the Seanad, he raised the issue of people in Donegal receiving radiotherapy services in Belfast. I was not familiar with the case and thought that was quite good news until I checked it out. What appears to be happening is far different from the picture he painted on that occasion. I noted he referred to it in his speech again today. Although I am open to correction, the service is only available to people in Donegal if there are treatment spaces available which is not as satisfactory as we would wish. Senator McHugh spoke on the matter on the day in question. The Minister of State, in his concluding comments, might outline exactly what is the position on the treatment of people in Donegal through the services in Belfast.While I have no difficulty with the report, it is a question of implementation and setting deadlines. I hope that the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children, in conjunction with the HSE when it announces the next phase of centres in eight weeks time, will clearly indicate achievable targets. It should not be the case in 2006 that where one lives could have a major impact on one's survival rate and treatment rate.
#CamillusGlynn	unknown-#CamillusGlynn-party	unknown-#CamillusGlynn-dob	unknown-#CamillusGlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	206	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley, to the House. I compliment him and the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, on the strides that have been made in the area of cancer control. Certainly, I am not for one moment saying that we are enjoying a utopia but many significant steps forward have been taken in addressing this serious matter.I thank Deputy Tim O'Malley, in his capacity as Minister of State with special responsibility for the psychiatric services, for his hospitable and proactive response to me and a number of organisations which sought his assistance recently.Turning to A Strategy for Cancer Control in Ireland, cancer is the one word in the English language that strikes so much fear and desperation into the hearts and minds of people that there is a reticence among most people to refer to it as cancer and they refer to it in terms of "the bug", "the boy", "the lad" or whatever. They have this innate fear of saying the word "cancer". No doubt the incidence of cancer has been noted as having increased over the past number of years but there has been a decrease in the recent past which must be recognised and appreciated.At the outset, it is important to remember that everybody has a responsibility for his or her own health. In terms of what we are doing to control cancer, we must remember that in the main we are providing reactive services rather than proactive services and this debate is so important because it addresses control and diagnosis.The proposal to limit the number of centres might strike a note of disharmony in the minds of those who have such a facility close to them but it has been proven that the more procedures carried out at a centre, the more efficient is the service. If fewer procedures are carried out at a centre, the results are not what we would wish.A number of positive steps have been taken on cancer control. I have been a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children since 1997 and when representatives of tobacco companies appeared at committee hearings, they denied all the way to hell and back that tobacco was injurious to a person's health. However, the world and his wife knew it was and even if the reality jumped up and bit them on the nose, they would still make the same claim.The onus is on everybody, but especially men, to be responsible for their own health. Women are more inclined to have themselves checked out. When we buy a car, we make sure it is serviced regularly but men are not as inclined as women to consult their general practitioner or consultant. In many cases, when men seek a medical opinion, it is at the prompting of a female.I worked in psychiatric services and many psychiatric patients smoked. I often walked through the door on to a long-stay ward to be met by a fog of smoke but that has diminished in recent years, which is welcome. Environmental tobacco smoke is a carcinogen. I commend the initiative of the Government and the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, who led the way in banning smoking in the workplace. Senator Browne correctly referred to the number of young women who smoke and the general consensus is they smoke to control their weight. However, they could adopt healthier options.The issues of cervical cancer and BreastCheck are frequently raised and the target date for the complete roll-out of BreastCheck is 2007 but more must be done. The HSE and the Government must be proactive rather than reactive. Reference was made to the PSA test but it is only an indicator of prostate cancer and does not provide a conclusive result. According to medical opinion, a prostate cancer screening programme would not be useful but that is difficult to understand.We are what we eat and we should pursue a healthy lifestyle by avoiding processed and fast food and addressing obesity. For example, a major tumour was removed from the brain of a 15 year old constituent of mine recently. The poor boy is completely inactive, as he does not have the use of his limbs and that is another example of what cancer can do, even to the very young.We are all responsible for our own health. Most of us have a general practitioner and at least one visit a year for a check up is not out of the question. We service our cars; why do we not service our own bodies to make sure they are healthy and we are doing everything we should?Cancer is an affliction that impacts on large numbers of people, irrespective of background and status. Naturally it frightens many people. Accordingly, it is essential that the State takes an active part in providing the resources for prevention, diagnosis and treatment. As the strategy highlights, much progress has been made in cancer treatment in recent years and there is much cause for optimism that medical advances mean major strides forward in prevention and cure are possible in the coming decades. Such advances will have serious implications for resourcing our health care system but if they have financial implications, so what? What price health? Current services will not meet the substantial demand for treatment, cure and care. Meeting demand will require a significant Government commitment to cancer services in the years ahead. This will also mean decisions being made soon on investment, planning and organisation. The goal must be to deliver a universal, quality-based and timely service in line with the best available internationally.The strategy recommends a wide-ranging cancer control policy programme. It also places a major emphasis on measurement of need and on addressing inequalities. The strategy also focuses substantially on reform and reorganisation of the way cancer services are delivered to ensure future services are consistent and of a high quality. The strategy notes there is evidence of considerable variation in cancer survival rates between regions and also significant fragmentation of services for cancer patients. The strategy recommends that all cancer care be provided through a national system of four managed cancer control networks. Each network must serve a population of approximately 1 million people providing primary, hospital, palliative, psycho-oncology and supportive care. Patients should be fully integrated between each of these elements within each network. Each network should have a formal structure of clinical leadership. The emphasis of the network should be on integrated connection and partnership rather than on segregation and self-sufficiency, distribution of resources rather than on centralisation and on maximising the benefits for all patients.The strategy states primary care is fundamental in the co-ordination of the wide variety of services patients may use. It is a key partner in the delivery of effective secondary care services. The strategy calls for cancer centres, each serving a minimum population of 500,000, to be designated by the HSE as soon as possible. Ireland will require about eight such centres. The cancer centres within each network should be looked on as equal partners to ensure adequate case volume and expertise, and a number of centres should provide a higher level of care for those cancers that need larger volumes than would present in a single centre.The strategy contains a number of key messages. Approximately 60% of cancer patients die from the disease within five years of diagnosis. Although it must be recognised that the incidence is falling, it is important to note that the aging of the population will lead to large increases in the number of people who will develop cancer. There has been a transformation in the range and capacity of cancer services as a result of the 1996 national cancer strategy, as well as the work of the first National Cancer Forum.This is an important matter because as I stated at the outset, the word strikes fear in people's hearts and minds to such an extent that they are unable to bear mentioning it. Hence, the condition has been bestowed with many nicknames and terms. While this may be self-delusional, it indicates clearly the great fear of cancer and of developing the condition among the public and all Members.

Cé nach raibh mé i láthair, bhíos ag éisteacht leis. Moreover, I have examined his script thoroughly. Senator Glynn's last remarks regarding the extraordinary terror which cancer strikes into most people were spot on. I recall that my own late and much-loved father could never describe it as anything other than "the lad".

#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	209	While he never had cancer and did not die from the condition, it lurked in the background. Much of the fear relates to the time before the development of the palliative care and hospice movements which facilitated the realisation, organisation and delivery of the capacity to provide people with palliative care. Before then, horrendous stories were heard regarding the conditions of people in the later stages of cancer. Mercifully, such cases are relatively rare, if they ever occur, and there is a capacity to provide people with a certain level of palliative care.Dr. Sheila Cassidy became famous when she was imprisoned and tortured in Chile and now works as a palliative care consultant in south-east England. Anyone who has read some of her more recent writings on the lives of people in the final stages of various forms of cancer will have found them to be eye-opening, scary and extremely reassuring. They are reassuring because of the capacity to deliver a high quality of palliative care, as well as the extraordinary capacity of human beings to deal with life as it is, when obliged to so do.A close member of my family has been through breast cancer and has survived well. I recall one time when simultaneously, three partners of male Members were being treated for breast cancer. It was a scary encounter with reality for all Members and may have obliged them to think about many matters from a different perspective.Who could argue with the strategy? All agree it is a good strategy. However, I believe there are fundamental differences in respect of health care delivery between myself and the Minister of State and the Government. I do not agree with the Tánaiste's contention that enough is being spent on the health services. She is factually incorrect to state that Ireland spends as much as Germany or France. My own figures suggest that per capita, Ireland spends 25% less. Given the unique structure of the economy, indicators such as percentages of gross national product and gross domestic product are not great and may be ignored. However, the actual cash value is a good indicator. Senator Browne and I do not completely agree on this point either.I do not suggest that spending more money is necessarily a remedy. However, one must consider the possibility that although an efficient health service is a necessary condition for a good health service, it is not necessarily — in the manner in which logicians speak of it — a sufficient condition for a good health service. Both are required and there is a question of resources in this regard. In addition to a strategy, I would have wished for an unequivocal commitment to providing the requisite resources to implement everything within the strategy within a realistic timetable.With regard to timetables, it is difficult for women, particularly in the south and south west, as well as other observers, to countenance the interminable delays in the expansion of BreastCheck. While I hold an unequivocal belief in the public provision of services, there appears to be a public sector timetable regarding the expansion of services which takes the view that implementation should be carried out as quickly as one can, according to the manner in which things are normally done. However, many people would argue that such services should be implemented as urgently as possible, given the scale of the need.I am also sceptical about pilot programmes for everything, although good planning and structures are necessary. An inability to concentrate on more than one thing at a time is often attributed to men. It may be that too many men are involved in the delivery of health services, because it would be possible to set up a pilot programme, as has been done in respect of cervical screening, while simultaneously beginning to carry out the logistical planning required to extend it nationwide. Such an approach could be taken, instead of the serial thinking which appears to dominate the delivery of health services, whereby one waits until the end of the pilot programme, reviews the outcome and then begins the next phase.If it is believed that it is correct in principle to deliver a national BreastCheck service, a national cervical cancer screening service, a national prostate cancer screening service or whatever, there is good reason to start with a pilot programme to learn how best to do it. However, that does not necessarily mean that one is obliged to wait until the pilot scheme is complete before beginning to consider repeating the process elsewhere. It is possible to plan and organise matters in parallel. Moreover, it is possible to be well-advanced in respect of other aspects and to have in place funding, a recruitment strategy and a building strategy, as well as having secured planning permission in those cases for which building would be required. Consequently, after the useful lessons from a pilot programme have been learned, one can deliver the next phase.As for BreastCheck outside the pilot regions, it has emerged that nothing was planned and that it was necessary to carry out every single step of the developments de novo, from scratch, as though nothing had been done previously. Plans could have been made in respect of the location of buildings, organisation of planning permission, ring-fencing of funding and consideration as to whether there were sufficient trained radiologists, radiographers or whatever specialties are required for BreastCheck. All of this could have been done in parallel with the pilot programmes. Increasingly, this issue has become a hobby horse of mine.This is the purpose of project planning and project management. It pertains to the consideration of one's timescales and of how to ensure that matters fit together in an optimal fashion. This was not done in the case of BreastCheck and I have concerns that the proposed national cervical cancer screening service will suffer a similar fate, that is, serial thinking will be employed in which people will wait for one phase to be completed before beginning to consider the next matter. This is unnecessary. As I stated earlier, it is probably because men perform poorly in this regard that entire structures and technologies of project management and project planning have been developed as a separate skill. Otherwise, we men could not juggle two things simultaneously, in the manner of which women are capable. I do not dispute that.This constitutes a significant issue. While I believe in pilot programmes, I do not believe that one must wait until such a programme has ended before doing anything about the remainder of the project. Once can identify the critical areas, particularly if one receives continuous feedback from a pilot programme. One could interpret a pilot programme which waits until the end to feed back information as being a deliberate way to avoid spending money. If I was in a more political mood this afternoon, I would say "would interpret". I am not in the humour to say that this evening.

They are not good at parallel thinking and planning. Will the Minister of State seriously consider this matter?I am disappointed at how limited our efforts on prevention are. I am not sure what current statistics are on young people smoking. From anecdotally observing the large number of young people at my place of work, I believe the number standing outside the doors smoking is decreasing. Smoking was prohibited in most of the buildings for years and it is absolutely prohibited everywhere now.However, if one drives through Cork as I often do on a Thursday night at 11 p.m. or midnight, which is the student night out, the number of young women in particular outside student bars in freezing weather during February in clothes more appropriate to the southern Mediterranean than cold Cork——

#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	213	I assure the Senator I am young enough and healthy enough to notice all of that, thanks be to God.Evidence suggests a certain level of smoking still occurs. We must consider everything. The idea that increasing the price of cigarettes too much encourages smuggling is a classic Department of Finance excuse. It is not to do with smuggling, it is to do with declining revenue. It is probable that various Members on the other side of the House will give lectures on the imposition on old people by putting up the price of their 20 cigarettes, one of the few pleasures they have. I could make the speech myself. I still believe an overwhelming case can be made in favour of increasing the price of cigarettes.Either the Tánaiste or the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley, proposed selling a minimum quantity of cigarettes. My view is that a minimum quantity should be 40, 20 at the very least. It should be illegal to sell fewer than 40 cigarettes at a time to make it more difficult for people who are young enough to have extremely limited amounts of money to buy them at a cost of €15 or whatever. I am not a prohibitionist as I do not believe prohibition works. However, we should put up every obstacle possible. We should not have any cigarette advertising anywhere in the country, which we have nearly achieved.We should restrict the number of outlets in which cigarettes are sold. A case can be made for the introduction of regulations to prohibit the sale of cigarettes in third level institutions, such as CIT where I work. I do not know whether shops in hospitals sell cigarettes.

Places with large numbers of people and public access should not have retail outlets which sell cigarettes. They should not be sold within a 100 yard radius of such places. Putting up every obstacle possible is the most effective action that can be taken.Regarding diagnosis, I fully accept the need for a limited number of centres of excellence and the overwhelming medical evidence to that effect. The consequence of accepting that is to ensure people geographically remote from those centres can get to them comfortably, easily and without undue financial burden, even if this means using air ambulances. It is no excuse to state it is expensive. If the best way is to have a centre in one city, which involves a 100 or 150 mile round trip for people, we must ensure it is no more difficult for them, apart from the extra bit of time, than for someone living next door to that centre. That is a fundamental element of a proper treatment scheme.If we are to optimise results through the development of centres of excellences, we must ensure the experience of patients is not related to whether they are geographically near to or far from those centres. An ambulance which does a "Wanderly Wagon" trip and takes five hours to complete a 60 mile journey is not a solution, nor is a minibus. People must be provided with an efficient and comfortable means of travelling.Without being pessimistic, part of a cancer strategy is to ensure the availability of both hospital and home-based palliative care of a high standard throughout the country. Will the Minister of State ensure that happens? According to the lobby groups on behalf of hospices that is not available as services are provided unevenly and in patches. It should not be the case that the quality of palliative care one receives depends on where one lives.

I also welcome A Strategy for Cancer Control in Ireland. It makes extremely interesting reading.This is not the first time I have spoken in the Chamber on the issue of cancer, and at the outset of each occasion I spoke about what an emotive issue it is. Everyone knows someone within his or her immediate family, a relation or close friend who has been affected by the terrible scourge we know as cancer. I am delighted with the report. Once and for all someone took the bull by the horns and set out a blueprint to tackle all types of cancer. In early June when she launched the report, the Tánaiste stated 35 hospitals administer and treat all types of cancer. In her own words, she felt this was excessive.Two weeks ago, I attended a UN convention on HIV-AIDS in New York as a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children. We took the opportunity to visit Sloan-Kettering, the largest cancer hospital in the world. Until then, I questioned whether it was excessive to have 35 hospitals delivering cancer care. Having visited Sloan-Kettering I can state it is. I will discuss Sloan-Kettering later. The strategy points out that we have eight centres in four regions each serving a population of 1 million. We do not know whether the 35 units will be involved. However, many of them would link into one of those eight units and that is welcome.The cost has yet to be worked out. I remember thinking at the time it was a knee-jerk political reaction by the main Opposition parties when they had a go at the HSE, the Department and the Tánaiste for not costing it. The best expertise came together to set it out and the group was chaired by Professor Paul Redmond. The biggest and best of those delivering cancer services sat on the forum. Professor Drumm raised the issue of resistance and he could have screamed about it because there is resistance every time we discuss centre of excellenced. I see Deputy Connolly smiling at me from the Gallery and he is part of that resistance. I know I should not mention anyone by name.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	217	No, the Senator should not.
#GeraldineFeeney	unknown-#GeraldineFeeney-party	unknown-#GeraldineFeeney-dob	unknown-#GeraldineFeeney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	218	I will not.We must move away from the days of having or wanting a centre of excellence in every town, village or county. We must not continue to espouse this policy. Professor Drumm talked about clinicians having to accept that they must operate evidence-based systems focused totally on quality outcomes for patients. This, in addition to quality assurance, is what it is all about.Some 60% of breast cancer cases are treated by doctors who treat fewer than ten cases per year and this cannot be allowed to continue. I say this on foot of having spoken to the clinicians, surgeons and oncologists in the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Centre. They believe it is not right and that our continuing to operate in such a vacuum will result in an increased number of deaths. We will not have good outcomes if we continue as we are doing.I was interested to read that Professor Paul Redmond has asked for strong political, medical and executive leadership in addition to significant investment. The Government is committed in this regard and will make the necessary funds available. However, Members on all sides should show political leadership and move forward as required. There is an onus on all parties to ensure we provide what is best for people suffering from cancer.Of course there will be uncertainty regarding the capacity of smaller hospitals to adapt and implement further changes in the delivery of cancer care, especially where complex cancers are concerned. The smaller hospitals do not have the expertise to deal with complex cancers and one cannot compare a surgeon, male or female, who deals with ten cases per year with one who deals with 30 or 40 cases per month. There is clear evidence that those who receive surgical treatment for many common cancers in centres with a high throughput experience better outcomes and have a greater chance of surviving their cancer.Last week or the week before, I read that 70% of surgical interventions from prostate cancer may be unnecessary. It is in this regard that a centre of excellence would come into its own. It would show us what kinds of treatment and care are best in respect of individual cancers.The strategy is all about patients, patient care and patients winning and the implementation of its proposals cannot be achieved outside a centre of excellence. It was stated that 20,000 people develop cancer in Ireland each year and that 7,500 die of it each year. If we had better cancer care, this number would decrease.As I stated, I had an opportunity to visit the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Centre when I was in New York. Even its presentation pack was impressive. Five of us visited the hospital and my four colleagues were just as impressed as I was. We were met by clinicians who were the most experienced in their field. The centre's presentation pack is entitled A History of Commitment and it certainly portrays commitment. The clinicians are extremely committed to their particular areas of interest. The centre trains many young Irish trainee doctors and we would have its expertise if we were to adopt its approach.We visited a pediatric unit and a general adult unit in the centre and also looked at its scanning equipment. The paediatric unit was by far the saddest unit. It was so sad to see such young children, from neonates to young teenagers, in need of treatment. Everybody seemed happy and I did not see any sad faces. If there were sad faces, they were those of the Irish visitors who were so taken by what they were seeing and being told. The paediatric unit in particular interested me because we had been told its method of treating of paediatric cancers was the blueprint and way to go. We have some of the best outcomes in the treatment of paediatric cancers in the whole of Europe.I support the current campaign for a radiotherapy unit for the north west, to be based in Sligo. The Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, told us when we met her that one linear accelerator unit would not suffice for Sligo and that two would be required. There is a school of thought in Sligo that suggests one is sufficient but when I was in the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Centre, I took the opportunity to ask the experts and discovered that the Minister was correct. They confirmed her advice that two linear accelerator units would be required in a radiotherapy unit based anywhere outside a main centre of excellence.It is important that there be centres of excellence with expertise. Practitioners with expertise will have time to keep an eye on the radical developments in cancer treatment and research.
#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	219	I welcome the Minister of State and many of the aspects of A Strategy for Cancer Control in Ireland. One hopes the proposals will be implemented as soon as possible and one could ask why we have been waiting so long for them to be implemented.The Minister of State and everybody else will know very well that it is far cheaper to prevent cancer than to treat it, irrespective of the fact that prevention would save many lives. Over the years, we have missed the opportunity to save lives and, because of our inaction, we have put many people through a lot of pain. Had their cancers been diagnosed earlier, their treatment would have been far less aggressive.While I welcome the strategy, I must state the circumstances that now obtain are a disgrace. We all know early detection is the secret to preventing the spread of cancer and saving lives. As my colleague Senator Browne stated, early detection and the kind of treatment one receives depend on where one lives. BreastCheck is one of the best services I have ever availed of and I highly commend the efficiency of the people involved. It amazes me because we are not used to that kind of service. I had an appointment recently for around 4 p.m. and expected to have to wait in a queue but I was the only person there. I was in and out in ten minutes. BreastCheck is a free public service. Women are invited to come in to have their breasts checked. I missed my appointment on one occasion but BreastCheck wrote to me telling me that I had missed it and offering me another appointment. It is an excellent service and the people involved are fantastic.After the examination they write to the person to inform her, thankfully in my case, that everything is fine. When cancer is detected, women are given the opportunity to get treatment at an early stage and therefore have a much better chance of survival. Unfortunately, women in other areas of the country currently are not entitled to that service. While I welcome the fact that BreastCheck will be rolled out in the coming years, it must be done as quickly as possible. It should be in place already, as I said earlier. I will not bore the Minister of State by repeating it; he accepts that the service should be in place already. Similarly, cervical cancer screening should be in place. We should have a national screening service because as the Minister of State said in his contribution, there are approximately 200 deaths every year as a result of cervical cancer. Most of those deaths would have been avoided had they been detected at an earlier stage.The cost of attending for a cervical test currently prevents many people from doing so. Another aspect that concerns me is the delay in getting the results of a test. If the results of the test do not come back for some months in the case of somebody found to have cancer cells, that delay can be extremely serious. We must have a national screening service for cervical cancer and ensure that the results come back speedily. The same applies to prostate cancer, which is very treatable if found at an early stage, and colorectal cancer. We have much catching up to do in that regard and I am not surprised that we fall way behind other countries in terms of detection and successful treatment.We must focus on cases where there is a family history of cancer because we know that specific genes in families cause cancer. Family members should be tested regularly and followed up, regardless of whether it results in a death. If there is a history of breast cancer, colon cancer or other types of cancer in families, those family members should be screened on a regular basis. There is no reason that is not being done but I understand that is the case.We must plan ahead. We look forward to the further report the Minister will publish in the coming weeks outlining the location of the centres. We must plan and ensure that the expertise and the trained staff are in place. That will take some time but we must plan now because we are playing catch-up in that regard.Another issue I want to raise is palliative care for persons dying of cancer. I understand it can three to six weeks to get hospice home care. The hospice service is wonderful but I am sure the people involved are stretched in terms of resources. I was told by a public health nurse last night that it can take from three to six weeks to arrange to have a patient visited on a daily basis. We must not leave the provision of that service to charities. We must put a system in place to allow families care for their sick and dying loved ones. A package of community care must be put in place. We all know someone, whether a family member or a friend, who has died at home. Where possible, families want to have their loved ones at home with them but a great deal of support is needed both for the family and the patient, which is not available. I have seen that at close hand and am aware of the difficulty in getting such help.The hospice home care team does wonderful work and the Irish Cancer Society also provides an excellent service to families. I would like to recognise its work but I want the Minister of State to focus on providing that type of care, which is part of the overall package. If someone is not responding to treatment and is dying, we must ensure we can support that patient and his or her family in the best way we can, namely, by providing all the necessary services. Services that are available in other countries are much better than those we provide here.I agree with the provision of centres of excellence. The best treatment can be given in centres where all the necessary expertise is provided. I realise that causes difficulties for many families who must travel, particularly those who require radium treatment on a daily basis, but if people have a life-threatening illness they will go where they know they will get the best service. Ensuring we put all the systems in place to support them is essential. It would help if accommodation can be provided nearby to support families who have a loved one in hospital.The key aspect is early detection and early treatment. It is all very well if one can attend the Blackrock Clinic or the Mater Private Hospital as a private patient where, if cancer cells are found, one can get treatment within a few days but that is not the position for public patients. That inequality should not exist.
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	220	I welcome the Minister of State and I welcome the debate. Most of us have had relatives, friends or people who worked closely with us who had cancer and, in many cases, died of it. This area deserves a very high priority because in many cases life can be prolonged considerably with appropriate early treatment but there is a need for appropriate care in terminal cases. In that regard, someone I knew very well was looked after in the last period of his life in the Milford Hospice in Limerick. I was full of admiration for the care that was provided there.If there is any area where there is no justification whatsoever for a two-tier system, it is cancer. Public patients have the same right to urgent fast-track treatment as private patients and there should be no distinction. If there is a distinction, that should be got rid of as fast as possible. There has to be a certain proportion of cases where time is of the essence. If somebody has to wait three months, he or she may die. If the patient is seen very quickly, something may be done for him or her. There are a couple of issues in the Minister of State's speech that are worth highlighting. One of them deals with prevention and a good deal is being done on that front. One area that impinges on my role as a finance spokesman is the taxation of cigarettes.A very good job has been done over the past 25 years in gradually eliminating tobacco advertising and promotion. I regard the first legislation on that by the late Charles Haughey, when he was Minister for Health, as one of his finest achievements. As we know from all over the world, there are enormous vested interests that combat that type of legislation. Indeed they combatted the much more recent initiative, namely, banning smoking in public places. We have made a great deal of progress on that front. Indeed Ireland is one of the leading countries in that area.These days the problem with taxation is that most people have sufficient disposable income. If they want to smoke they will, regardless of taxes. Unfortunately, that includes young people, especially young women among whom the incidence of smoking is now higher than among young men. The deterrent effect of increased taxation is a fairly blunt instrument. The inflationary effects of an increase in tobacco taxes can add one or two decimal points onto inflation, which can be worrying for the Minister for Finance, but it can easily be counteracted by lowering indirect taxes in some other area. People would not quarrel with that, but one must be politically realistic. The older generation in particular will hold it against the Government if it raises taxes on the pint or on the packet of cigarettes. There is no doubt that smoking contributes to cancer. However, on the promotion front in the past, as regards tax measures and banning smoking from public places, the Government has done a great deal and is to be congratulated.The other controversial aspect is the whole question of centralisation of treatment facilities. This, perhaps, falls into two parts. There is radiation therapy, which I shall deal with first, and then there is the more general issue. There was a good deal of agitation in the south east because it was originally intended that Waterford would not be included as a centre for radiation oncology. As the road between Waterford and Dublin is still pretty bad, one is talking about journeys of three to four hours to the capital, perhaps on a weekly basis, and that was not at all acceptable to people in the south-east region. When people are not well they do not want to travel long journeys. In so far as radio-oncology is concerned, it is not primarily a centre for excellence issue, but rather economics and the cost of running the facility. In any event, I am glad that the Waterford situation seems to have been largely sorted.I have some sympathy with public representatives in this House who come from the north west and Donegal because I do not believe that region is quite as well provided for. Belfast City Hospital is mentioned in the Minister of State's speech. However, if one lives in west Donegal that is probably at least a three hour journey. In terms of regional equity serious consideration should be given to having a centre in Sligo, Letterkenny or Derry. I have no problem about Belfast City Hospital being outside the jurisdiction, it is the distance I have reservations about.This question cuts across all of medicine, not just cancer. There is tremendous pressure from the medical profession and experts to centralise all sophisticated and expensive facilities in a few hospitals. In some cases this may be justified on objective medical grounds, but sometimes while the motivation may be put forward on such grounds, much of the reasoning is based on economic considerations and maximising throughput. Some medical treatments are very complicated while others are much simpler and more routine. The Government needs to look somewhat more sceptically at some of the arguments made — I am not just referring to cancer services — which are all in the direction of the arguments made about the Hanly report. People want medical facilities in large population centres and do not want to have to travel for hours just to use a facility for 24 hours because it suits them to be in one place rather than in two. I do not believe the Government is sufficiently sceptical about aspects of self-interest that feature in the medical profession in this regard. There is reference in the Minister of State's speech about small numbers of cancer centres, and then managed networks in other hospitals. It is important, given the prevalence of cancer, that general hospitals around the country remain involved in its treatment. Apart from anything else, few people can regularly visit relatives and friends, unless it is a spouse or a child, 50 to 60 miles away whereas they can if people are only five to ten miles away.Humanity and compassion matter as well as getting the best treatment. Many considerations are at play in this area and the Government must take account of that.
#MauriceCummins	unknown-#MauriceCummins-party	unknown-#MauriceCummins-dob	unknown-#MauriceCummins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	221	I wish to share my time with Senator John Paul Phelan.I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Seán Power, to the House.I listened with interest to the Minister of State's speech. Whitfield private hospital will open in Waterford later this year. The company involved, UPMC Cancer Centres from Pittsburgh, is anxious that all patients who require treatments such as radiotherapy will have access to this facility, irrespective of whether they are public or private patients. This health care organisation is investing in Waterford and the south-east region, yet it seems to be coming up against a brick wall in dealing with the HSE and the Department as it tries to plan its services.If public patients are to be treated, UPMC needs to know now so that it can put a second linear accelerator in place when the facility opens later this year. The appalling prospect currently looms of private patients going to the top of the queue for treatment at Whitfield, while public patients continue to join the bus and ambulance queues for the horrendous journeys to Dublin and Cork. This reduces their quality of life and impacts on their chances of responding well to treatment. A voluntary organisation has spent thousands of euro to provide people with proper transport to Dublin. The country is awash with money and it is a shame to see those poor people having to travel to Dublin for this therapy.There is talk about developing another hospital under a public private partnership on the grounds of Waterford Regional Hospital that would also provide radiotherapy services. The Government seems to be in favour of such facilities one minute yet reviews the situation the next minute. All patients in the south east must have proper access to radiotherapy as a matter of urgency.The Minister of State mentioned that BreastCheck has been rolled out everywhere, including the south east. It has certainly not been rolled out in Waterford, which is a cause of great concern to the women of Waterford and its hinterland. I am disappointed that the long-awaited cancer strategy does not have a comprehensive implementation plan with costings, a detailed breakdown of funding and an indication of the location of the new cancer networks and cancer care centres.There is no doubt that the National Cancer Forum put much work into this strategy, for which it must be complimented. Given the serious concerns recently expressed about breast and cervical screening, why was the Tánaiste not in a position to deliver a detailed and comprehensive cancer care plan for the launch of the national cancer strategy?It is imperative that we act on this plan. We believe that centres of excellence are necessary, as are satellite centres. Difficulties encountered by the Department and the HSE must be overcome in the interests of patients, be they privately insured or holders of medical cards.
#JohnPaulPhelan	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-party	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-dob	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	222	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Seán Power, and I welcome the speech by the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley. I agree with much of his speech, but I would like to make a couple of points.Senator Cummins spoke about Waterford Regional Hospital and radiotherapy facilities in the south east. The Minister of State also referred to this in his remarks, but even after those comments and the report of the national strategy for cancer control, the policy for the provision of radiotherapy treatment facilities in the south east is still very unclear. People suffering from cancer are obviously very ill, but to compound their difficulties, trauma and illness, they must travel to Dublin to receive treatment. It is completely inappropriate that they be subjected to this extra trauma at such a distressing time in their lives. It should not be happening at a time when we seem to have the requisite amount of funding to solve this situation. I urge the Department of Health and Children to do everything possible to ensure full radiotherapy facilities for the south-east region. Everyone in this House has had a family member or friend affected at some stage. The treatment facilities in large parts of the country are still substandard and that is not acceptable. Under this national cancer control strategy, I hope we can work towards a situation where people all over the country can expect a minimum standard of service.In his opening remarks, the Minister of State referred to the fact that the poor cancer survival rates in this country may be due in part to our fragmented cancer services. That is an understatement. We need to do our utmost to improve those services. Senator Cummins spoke about the BreastCheck programme, which has been rolled out in parts of the country. It is stated that it has been rolled out in the south-east region, but there are areas in the region that are not covered, such as Waterford and south Kilkenny. There are also problems with screening for other types of cancer, including types of cancer common to men. The Government has not yet embarked on a programme of rolling out a screening scheme across the country for those cancers. We should be aiming at that for the future.The Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley, spoke about the Tánaiste's efforts to control the use of sunbeds. I commend her for trying to curtail their use by children. I was in a house in my own area recently and was shocked to find a child under the age of 16 on a sunbed. There is a direct link between some forms of skin cancer and the over-use of sunbeds, especially by children under 16.If we are serious about implementing the strategy and decreasing the number of those who suffer from cancer, we need to ensure that we have a proper screening programme and that facilities for treatment are available as uniformly as possible. We cannot provide radiotherapy services at every crossroads, but they should be available in major regional centres. As the regional hospital in the south-east region, I am making the case for Waterford Regional Hospital. People in my area who are affected by cancer should be able to get the treatment in the region, rather than facing a six-hour round trip to and from Dublin.
#EamonScanlon	unknown-#EamonScanlon-party	unknown-#EamonScanlon-dob	unknown-#EamonScanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	223	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Seán Power, to the House. This debate touches everybody. When I was 17 years old and the eldest of six children, my mother was diagnosed with cancer. I remember the trauma in our house at that time. I am delighted to say she is alive and well in 2006. It certainly brought it home to me and I have never forgotten the effect the longest day I have ever lived had on our lives at the time.It is good that we are having the debate during which many issues have been raised, including that of BreastCheck. That service is not yet available in the north west. I served on the North-Western Health Board for many years and I know the difficulty in trying to get fully trained staff to carry out the work particularly in a specialised area such as BreastCheck. I welcome that the programme will be extended by the end of this year or early in 2007. It is not a question of money, but of getting trained and qualified staff to carry out the work, which takes time.I recognise the work done by the hospice movement. The North-West Hospice in Sligo is supported by thousands of people. Approximately €700,000 is raised each year through voluntary effort. I am glad the North-West Hospice is back in operation again. It had difficulties with an oncologist and it had no cover. It took 12 months to get an oncologist to work in the service in the north west. There are issues with getting properly trained and qualified people to do such work.The Sligo Inner Relief Road opened last year. The mayor of Sligo, Councillor Rosaleen O'Grady, had the brainwave of holding a charity walk on the new road, which is approximately 5 km in length, on the evening before the road was opened to raise funds to provide a mammography machine for Sligo General Hospital. Some 5,000 people came out that evening. What had started as a small idea mushroomed into a massive explosion of voluntary effort. Some €80,000 was handed over to Sligo General Hospital to fund the machine, which shows the extent of the public support. Cancer affects everybody in the country and we should ensure we do everything we can.I recently attended a public meeting in Sligo organised by people who had suffered from cancer and their family members in an attempt to provide radiotherapy in the north west and in particular in Sligo General Hospital. It was heartrending listening to the patients and their relatives outline the hardship they suffer in travelling long journeys for radiotherapy. Senator Mansergh mentioned the radiotherapy satellite that centres exist. We should provide more satellite centres to alleviate the hardship experienced by these people who need to leave their homes and families at a very vulnerable time. I know a patient from Sligo who must stay in Dublin even though the treatment only takes ten minutes.While some people travel every day the majority do not have the strength to travel those distances every day. This treatment comes at the worst possible time in their lives and those of their families. It would be better for those people to be treated closer to their homes. I know it is not possible to provide such a service in every hospital. However, given the location of Sligo, it should be considered. I ask the Minister of State to consider providing the equipment in Sligo to prevent patients from travelling those distances at a very difficult time in their lives.
#PeterCallanan	unknown-#PeterCallanan-party	unknown-#PeterCallanan-dob	unknown-#PeterCallanan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	224	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Seán Power, to the House. Earlier the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley, asked the House to commend the Government for its positive and demonstrable commitment to cancer services and I do so. I spoke here a few years ago on the topic of cancer. Normally I do not go outside my brief of agriculture. However, cancer and I are friends, and have visited each other. I have had three attacks of cancer and because of this experience I take some interest in the matter.When I spoke four years ago I said I was not interested in excuses. I wanted funding provided for the service. In 1989 I had the experience of radiotherapy unit that broke down and took six months to replace. The people from Cork were bussed to Dublin. It cost more to bus the people from Cork to Dublin than it cost to buy the unit. However, as Senators know, the units are not available off the shelf.I recognise what has been done since 1996, when the then Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, recognised the need to do something about cancer. Since then great progress has been made. A Strategy for Cancer Control in Ireland is a fine document, which is beautifully written and reads well. However, did any of those experts who wrote the document ever sit in a queue for radiotherapy? Do they know how it feels to be on a terminally-ill line? By and large the answer is "No". If they need such treatment they have much more ready access to it than the ordinary people like us.I have reason to congratulate the Government and support its efforts. I welcome the extension of radiotherapy treatment to Waterford and Limerick, which regions had previously been overlooked. Senator Scanlon spoke about the north west. The people of the north west deserve a service and are just as entitled to it as the people in any other region. Making arrangements with Belfast for those in the north west is fine. However, it comes back to how it feels for the person in the queue for cancer treatment. It is a lonely place and they need the support of their families and friends. They should not be isolated. From a psychological point of view, it is easily understood why I say that we should give to the north west that to which it is entitled.Regarding BreastCheck for women between the ages of 50 and 64, a body of opinion believes that screening service should take place before 50 and after 64.

#PeterCallanan	unknown-#PeterCallanan-party	unknown-#PeterCallanan-dob	unknown-#PeterCallanan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	226	I do not understand why specialists recommend confining the treatment to that age band. While it is somewhat late, I welcome the pilot cervical cancer screening programme. However, there appears to be no mention of male-specific cancer. For example, what is being done to address prostate cancer and testicular cancer? Cures are readily available and can be successfully administered for such cancers if addressed in time. A previous speaker pointed out that men take their cars, tractors and machinery for servicing but are slow to do the same for their health. We are shy to discuss these matters. I regularly listen to discussions by female Senators of cancers affecting women. Similar discussions should be held by men. I commend the Government on its efforts in this respect but it has more to do.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	227	I welcome the participation by the Minister of State in this debate on the national strategy for cancer control. Figures for the National Treatment Purchase Fund were released the other day, which revealed that the top ten procedures were those involving cataracts, procedure scopes, tonsillectomies, varicose veins, joint replacements, cardiac surgery, cardiology, skin lesions, hernias, grommets and cholecystectomies and gall bladders. However, the two procedures which might involve cancer, procedure scopes and skin lesions, involve considerable delays before treatment, with potential effects for patients. We should be careful to ensure that any patient suspected of having cancer is referred much earlier than is the case at present. Delays arise, for example, in referrals for appointments with specialists, diagnostic procedures, operations and chemotherapy. All these delays increase the chance of a poor outcome.Everyone was incensed about the report from Europe which indicated that we are 25th out of 26 countries on an index of consumer satisfaction with health services. Senator Quinn said on yesterday's Order of Business that we should try to learn from this report rather than pretend it is of no significance. I am concerned about the report's findings that our neonatal figures are not as good as countries with which they should be comparable and that we have poorer medical outcomes in many areas.The appointment of additional consultants is to be welcomed because there had been a shortage of oncologists and specialists in cancer surgery. However, we should realise that teams must be appointed. The team approach to cancer treatment is now considered extremely important because, while a surgeon with great expertise in colorectal surgery may be appointed, if he or she is not complemented by a chemotherapeutic expert, patients' chances of survival may not be increased as much as expected. The appointment of such experts will be of great help to a service which has already made great strides over the past ten years.The Tánaiste is right to point out how good it is that, since 1996, mortality from cancer has decreased by 15% in the under 65 age group but she is also correct that more work is needed. As a result of our fragmented cancer services, the survival rate in Ireland in respect of many common cancers is significantly different from other European countries. The comments of some Senators about having cancer services in every corner of the country made me somewhat anxious. It is not possible to provide that level of service nor will we achieve the best results through such a policy.The Sloan-Kettering centre in New York is not one of the major cancer treatment centres in the world because it treats 50 cases of this or that but because it treats thousands of cases and has developed an expertise which gets the best results. We will have to do the same. I sympathise with Senator Callanan's remarks about people who suffer from a lack emotional support because they are far from their relatives. However, I would prefer to spend the money to move the relatives to be with the patients at centres which can provide the best treatment. Too many centres treat 50 cases a year when they need to treat 500 if they are to develop any sort of expertise. I appeal to Members on all sides of the House to remember that we are trying to deal with survival rates rather than parochial interests.The state of radiotherapy services is disappointing. The Hollywood report is now four years old, yet we have not yet decided where to locate radiotherapy centres. While I have little expertise in radiotherapy, others with even less expertise have called for linear reactors in various parts of this country, which will not allow us to ensure the best treatment for patients. We have to listen to the advice of the people with the most expertise.The Minister of State's proposal with regard to a cancer care network is welcome. Chemotherapy could be easily carried out in regional hospitals, thereby avoiding a great deal of travel. Such a network should be developed as speedily as possible.With regard to cancer prevention, while genetic factors are relevant, such as the incidence of breast or colorectal cancers in families, there is strong evidence that environmental factors are important to the development of cancer. Clearly, the population of this country will experience an increased incidence of cancer because we are all living longer and our control over cellular development and degeneration apparently decreases as we get older. That is why some of our cells turn haywire and produce cancer cells. However, we can do something about environmental factors.The smoking ban was extremely effective and only 25% of the population now smokes. That must be one of the best rates in Europe. Not having smoked since I was 11, I can feel particularly smug about this issue. Evidence on passive smoking increasingly supports the decision by the then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, to introduce a ban under health and safety legislation. The Tánaiste announced that she would take a fiscal approach to this issue. It would be helpful if tobacco was taken out of the consumer price index. Can we take this step on our own or must we find agreement with the rest of the EU to do so? We might have more sympathy now on the matter, given that a number of countries have followed our example.I was astonished at how easily a ban was introduced in Italy, where people appeared to have to give up overnight. Apparently, there was virtually no discussion about the issue in the Italian Parliament and people were told they would not be allowed to smoke by the end of the month. Scotland has also introduced a smoking ban and efforts are currently ongoing in the rest of the United Kingdom in that regard. If tobacco was taken out of the consumer price index, it could then be heavily taxed. Those involved in trying to limit the consumption of tobacco and alcohol agree that price and availability make a difference. If we could remove tobacco from the consumer price index and increase taxes on it, we would all pay less income tax. It would be better than the current situation, where smokers pay for the rest of us. It would also be good for their health.I am pleased that legislation on sunbeds was introduced but I wonder why the minimum age is 16. It might be better to have it at 18, the age at which childhood ends. Warnings should be displayed because people do not realise how it affects skin. It makes people look like old saddlebags. The Minister should be applauded for trying to prevent this.The speed of the implementation of the BreastCheck screening programme is very disappointing. I understand that cost is not the only reason and that we have a shortage of radiographers, histopathologists and specialists to examine X-rays. We have had a considerable amount of time to produce more radiographers. Many of the people involved in BreastCheck had not been working for some years but felt they had a moral duty to return and train for specialist work. We are short of radiographers and rather than take them from other countries we should train them here.The level of screening for cervical cancer is woeful and it is in this area that the Government is found wanting. It is entirely preventable if cases are detected early. The scheme has been in place in Limerick since 2000. It is known internationally that this screening is quite easy and the pathology of the disease is even easier to carry out than before. A sense of urgency is needed. Some 80 women per year are dying and they would not die if there was screening. The average age of those who die is 56, leaving husbands or partners and young children. This issue is most serious.Several Senators referred to screening for men. The problem for screening for prostate cancer is that the international jury is still out on its effectiveness. One can have cancer of the prostate without elevated levels of androgen and one can have elevated levels of it without prostate cancer. When one is screening for a condition, it must be common. Cancer of the prostate is a common condition and, perhaps for environmental reasons, it is increasing. The results of screenings are not good enough at present. I am most anxious about men receiving the wrong information and advice, having unnecessary biopsies and being told they are healthy when they may not be.Screening for colorectal cancer is very successful and only requires a piece of paper. The person can use it for three days running and if blood is present it can be analysed and a scope can be arranged. Haemochromatosis is more common in men and can lead to cancer of the liver. Screening for this and colorectal cancer should be encouraged because accurate results can be obtained. In the case of haemochromotosis a patient can be bled and in the case of colorectal cancer the colon and rectum can be examined. The results are good for those who have early diagnosis.I am delighted to see that more money is being allocated to cancer research. It is important that all hospitals give patients access to new drugs. I was shocked by what happened in the Mater Hospital some months ago when some women in a trial were denied access to new drugs for the treatment of breast cancer because the sponsor of the trial advised participants to abstain from sex or to use contraception. This denial of access should not happen. However, I am pleased that we do not deny people access to drugs because of price. In England the so-called postcode lottery determines whether one will receive the best new drugs. I commend the Minister of State on the fact that this practice does not happen in Ireland.I am pleased Senator Scanlon mentioned the hospice movement. It is important that, if treatment has not been successful, the best palliative care is available. A patient recently referred to the Blackrock Hospice, stating that the food is very good. It is wonderful that someone could be savouring food even when undergoing palliative care. I commend the speech of the Minister of State and hope he takes note of what I have said.
#MaryMWhite	unknown-#MaryMWhite-party	unknown-#MaryMWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryMWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	228	The chairperson, Professor H. Paul Redmond, and the second National Cancer Forum, are to be commended for producing this comprehensive, clear, concise document. The onus falls on those in the Oireachtas to ensure the strategy is fully and properly implemented.Approximately 170 cases of diagnosed cervical cancer and 76 deaths occur each year. We must urgently roll out the national cervical cancer screening programme provided for in the strategy. A nationwide programme for cervical screening was recommended by a Department of Health committee in 1996. Ten years later we are still without a programme. Some 700 women have died unnecessarily from cervical cancer since 1996. Of the eligible female population, very few have had the screening. Women, by their nature, put their children first rather than spend money on cervical cancer screening.The Minister for Health and Children has stated that a programme will be introduced but as a business person I want to hear a timeframe. While studying child care and ageism my office was full of reports. So many reports are carried out and so few are implemented. I wish to hear a timeframe for the implementation of the national screening programme the Minister has promised.The new strategy states that it is imperative that BreastCheck is rolled out nationally in line with current plans. It has been subject to unnecessary delay at a terrible cost to women affected by breast cancer. I wish to see a clear plan of action from the Minister and to hear an assurance that BreastCheck will be operational nationwide within the next 18 months. The Minister should drive a clear plan.The people know there are good intentions but they should receive clear indications of when certain steps will be taken. Breast cancer has overtaken lung and colorectal cancer to become the second most common cancer in Ireland. In Ireland, skin cancer is the main cause of cancer deaths among women. It is an excellent recommendation by the Minister that young people not use sunbeds. In fact, if I were Minister for Health and Children, I would not allow sunbeds to be used at all. I used one about ten years ago and my sister, who is involved in the medical sector, warned me against it saying it is too dangerous. Certain people could be more susceptible to skin cancers and the sunbed could activate it in one person but not another. They are very dangerous.I also wish to acknowledge the great drive of the former Minister, Deputy Martin, in implementing the smoking ban. I am proud of his achievement. When I see him or hear his name I think of the tremendous vision and drive he had in this regard. I am an ex-smoker. I gave them up 20 years ago but I understand the pleasure of smoking. Deputy Martin had the drive to implement the ban and fair dues to him. That is what politicians should do — when they believe in something and talk about it, they should implement it.The work of the Irish Cancer Society, chaired by Mr. John McCormack, should also be acknowledged. I spoke at one of the society's public meetings on cancer screening awareness. I am involved with the society and am helping it to try to get a national cervical cancer screening programme implemented. The commitment of the Irish Cancer Society, Mr. John McCormack and his team is to be lauded. He is a zealot about his mission and it would be wrong not to refer to it.I had the breast cancer check about two months ago and I felt quite guilty as I left. It is not only appalling that women in the rest of Ireland do not have the service but also that women over 64 cannot avail of it. In my document, A New Approach to Ageing and Ageism, recommendation No. 4 is that——

#MaryMWhite	unknown-#MaryMWhite-party	unknown-#MaryMWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryMWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	230	I thank the Senator. I recommend in the document that the 64 years of age limit on breast cancer screening be abolished. Professor Des O'Neill is one of the senior gerontologists in Ireland and one of the men who inspired me to produce my document. When I started on this mission 18 months ago I knew nothing about ageing, ageism and the health aspects. Professor O'Neill has said that women are at the highest risk of developing cancer between the ages of 55 and 75. This man is an authority on ageing and the body and its propensity for contracting illnesses. How dare anybody introduce an age limit for a service? That is downright ageism. There is no justification for introducing an age limit on any health service in this country.As a business person, I love to see implementation plans which contain a timeframe. When will the national breast screening programme be available nationwide and when will the cervical cancer screening programme be introduced? I apologise to the gentlemen that I am just speaking on a women's issue. It does not mean I do not have empathy——

I thank the Minister of State for attending the debate. As the Minister of State with responsibility for the elderly, he should put his foot down and insist there not be an age limit on cancer screening.

She was disturbed and agitated that there did not appear to be a co-ordinated effort with regard to cervical cancer. Her general practitioner volunteered to carry out a smear test but the general practitioner was not paid for it. She did it from the goodness of her heart. My constituent believed there should be a proper system in place. I agree. There should be a system whereby all women, regardless of age, could be screened.I welcome the publication of the national cancer strategy. I do not wish to undermine this important strategy but, like Senator White, I believe certain issues must be addressed. There must be a timeframe for the implementation of the strategy. Women from the west, north west and south west have a greater chance of dying from breast cancer because the systems have not been rolled out on time.The condition of haemochromotosis has become more well known in the last few years. It is not anything to do with the Minister for Health and Children but approximately one fifth of the male population of this country will have haemochromotosis due to the presence of the gene. Many of the insurance companies appear to look on it as a type of Klondike in that they are imposing serious loadings on policies. Perhaps we should examine what the insurers are doing. It is a side issue to the health system but it is time we checked this. I believe they see it as a Klondike for themselves. It is an issue we must address.Senator White is correct that over 700 women have died because of a lack of urgency about this issue. I hope the strategy will be delivered soon. The former Minister, Deputy Martin, has been complimented for introducing the smoking ban. I believe it is a wonderful ban but Deputy Martin more or less looked away from setting out and implementing a national cancer strategy. He deserves to be rapped across the knuckles for not dealing with that.The Minister of State, Deputy Seán Power, is very concerned about this situation. I wish him and the Government the best because this is a serious issue that should be above politics. I hope these matters will be dealt with sooner rather than later.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	236	I thank Senator Feighan for sharing time with me. This debate is an opportunity for politicians to put forward their views on the cancer strategy and to examine the anomalies within the strategy. We owe it to the electorate, whether we are in the Opposition or in Government, to continue to debate this issue. We have not found solutions although, ultimately, there will never be concrete solutions for some cancer issues.I wish to highlight two matters to the Minister of State. There is need for centres of excellence. There is a need to pool expertise, skills and knowledge to provide specialised cancer services. That is accepted. People who are undergoing radiotherapy and chemotherapy and who are availing of these services in the centres of excellence will travel to avail of them. That is a fact.However, there is the issue of peripherality. Senator Scanlon made that point very well when he articulated the point of view of people living on the periphery. There are varying types of cancer and varying degrees of suffering. Some cancer sufferers are not in a position to travel. They feel the journey is sufficiently arduous without having to go through the process of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. That is the challenge for us. On the one hand we must pool resources in centres of excellence but we must also argue for peripherality. There is no stronger voice for this argument than the Donegal Action for Cancer Care group. Nationally it has a high profile and it has been vociferous locally, organising a demonstration of over 15,000 people in Letterkenny to protest the possible downgrading of cancer care services in Letterkenny General Hospital. That is the argument for peripherality. It does not come from scientific research, it comes from the people. The people involved in the Donegal Action for Cancer Care group are cancer sufferers who have been through the mill. They know what they are talking about and they do not want to hear the argument that centres of excellence should be in the east of the country, in Dublin, Galway, Limerick, Waterford and Cork. They will not accept that.Senator Scanlon mentioned his constituency. Sligo, Leitrim, Donegal, Tyrone, Fermanagh and Derry form a nucleus for a centre of excellence. The people demand it and it is up to us as legislators to follow through.
#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	237	I very much welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate on the national cancer control strategy and wish to acknowledge the significant work of the National Cancer Forum which developed this strategy following a detailed consultation process with stakeholders in cancer, including major voluntary groups such as the Irish Cancer Society, ARC Cancer Support Centre and Reach to Recovery. I thank Members for their contributions.It is fitting that the House should allocate time to discuss cancer because not only is it a major element in health and social policy but also because it has major implications for so many people. Many contributors today have shared their experiences of the difficulties created by cancer for their families. Cancer has a major impact on society, in economic and health terms and, most important, on those diagnosed with cancer and their immediate family and friends. The statistics are stark: one in four people will die of the disease and 20,000 people annually will suffer from it. The number of cancer cases will double over the next 15 years. There are around 120,000 survivors of cancer, reflecting the improving diagnosis and more successful treatments for cancers generally. Thankfully there will be greater numbers of survivors as survival rates improve for many cancers.Some of the facts that emerged during the preparation of the strategy are worrying, such as the variation of survival rates and the poor rates of survival for common cancers when compared with other EU countries. This can be attributed to the fragmentation of cancer services where too many hospitals are involved in cancer treatment. That cannot continue if we are to deal with cancer realistically, instead of trying to provide a service in every small area.The House has already been advised of the substantial increases in investment which have resulted in increased medical, nursing and support staffing. This investment has delivered real improvements in care. An evaluation of the 1996 national cancer strategy, including a broadly-based consultation process, was commissioned by the Department of Health and Children. The key achievement of the 1996 strategy most commonly commented on by those consulted was that it provided a framework for the development and funding of cancer services in Ireland. In fact, the National Cancer Forum has concluded that "there has been a transformation in the range and capacity of cancer services since 1996".Palliative care is a component of integrated cancer care that is of particular interest to me. Since October 2001, almost €17 million has been invested in palliative care services and funding of €9 million was provided by the Government for specialist palliative care in the budget for 2006. A further €4 million will be allocated in 2007 to develop the service, giving the full year cost of €13 million. The funding provides for the following: 24 extended care beds in Our Lady's Hospice, Harold's Cross; €1.9 million to open six palliative care beds at Blackrock Hospice; ten new palliative care beds in Milford Hospice; a €1 million increase in funding for St. Francis Hospice, Raheny; €2 million for the development of palliative home care and community-based initiatives throughout the country; and the development of palliative care services in the midland, western and south-eastern areas.Questions have been asked about future investment in cancer control. This Government has invested heavily in cancer services and the House can be assured that we intend to invest substantially in cancer control in the coming years. As a first step, the Tánaiste has asked the Health Service Executive to conduct a needs assessment for cancer services with a particular emphasis on the need for reorganisation and reform; the need to maximise the efficient use of resources; the need for the development of cancer service capacity at national and network levels; and the need for appropriate linkages with the national roll out of BreastCheck, the cervical screening programme and the national plan for radiation oncology services.The executive has already commenced work on this exercise, which will take several months to complete given the importance and breadth of the work involved. Investment will be made based on demonstrable return on investment, an equitable distribution of resources and priority setting that maximises ambulatory care.There are major challenges in the way we deliver and organise cancer control. These include the need to expand capacity, the need to ensure equity in access and delivery of care. Outcomes are variable and poor in some cases where efficiency is poor and we have fragmented services. The future investment and delivery of care must build on the positive achievements while at the same time addressing the deficiencies I have outlined. This will require significant leadership at medical, executive and community levels.Senator Henry spoke about leadership but we are all guilty when it comes to the provision of services of trying to ensure our own area is looked after and that centres are as close as possible to our constituencies. That is simply not possible with cancer services. Expertise is needed and it cannot exist in every county. Politicians on all sides should look beyond the next election when dealing with this and should not give false hope to constituents. All parties have been guilty of doing that.

Cancer patients should receive multidisciplinary care from cancer specialists in radiology, pathology, surgery, medical and radiation oncology and oncology nursing — all working together as an integrated team. We will organise the delivery of cancer care to ensure that cancer patients will receive quality care regardless of where they live. I thank the Members for their contributions.

#PaulCoghlan	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-party	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-dob	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	243	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, to the House and look forward to hearing what he has to say on this matter.I am happy to introduce, in conjunction with my colleagues, Senators O'Toole and Ryan, the Housing (Stage Payments) Bill which is designed to abolish the practice of stage payments for certain types of newly-constructed houses, thereby reducing the cost to consumers of such housing and eliminating the risks associated with such practices.Stage payments mainly arise in the case of houses built in housing estates whereby their purchase is funded through stage payments. However, the system only operates in a few counties and does not, I understand, exist in Dublin or most of Leinster. Nowadays purchasers in these areas pay for the construction of newly-built houses with a 10% contract deposit and the payment of the 90% balance on final completion. This system is open and transparent, as it should be, with the purchasers being fully aware at the outset of the extent of their liabilities, thus enabling them to budget accordingly.Sadly, in some parts of the country the practice of purchasing newly-constructed houses in housing estates by stage payments endures. This Bill seeks to abolish this practice on the basis that it adds to the purchasers' costs of buying such new houses and introduces significant financial risks for the purchaser in stage payment contracts.The stage payment system in estate-type housing purchases is unfair as it involves the preponderance of risk in the construction of new houses in housing estates being carried by the purchasers rather than the builders. Similarly, it involves purchasers accessing significant funding by way of mortgages before they are in a position to live in the house and before work is completed. They must draw down their mortgage before completion and thus service a loan before they can occupy the property. They are often involved in bridging finance for this process at excessive rates over the normal odds.Where an individual purchaser arranges with a builder to construct a house, usually on a site that has been provided by the purchaser, then payment for this house by stage payments is perfectly normal and acceptable, given that payment of the cost of construction is made by the purchaser to the builder on foot of architects certificates after the various stages of construction have been completed. This practice is recognised, standard and well established. It is acceptable because purchasers are paying for building works that are already completed on their own site. In addition, it should be pointed out that section 3 of the Bill deals with variations and allows for stage payments for the construction of a house in an estate where the builder has varied the plans at the express instruction of the purchaser to suit his or her requirements.I am grateful to the Minister of State for his letter of 16 June last regarding this Bill and perhaps it would be helpful if I now read this letter. It states:Dear Senator Coghlan,I write in relation to the Private Members Bill in your name that was published on 3 April last. I would like to inform you of the ongoing dialogue that is taking place in relation to the practice of stage payments for the sale of houses in new developments.The Government are concerned to ensure that house purchasers are not disadvantaged by any practices that might make it more difficult or expensive to access a home. I am conscious of concerns that the practice of stage payments may be contrary to the interests of house-buyers in certain circumstances. While it is generally accepted that stage-payments may be warranted in the case of one-off housing, I do not consider that this is likely to be the case in the context of speculatively built estate housing.My officials met recently with members of the Construction Industry Federation — Southern Region (CIFSR). At this meeting, our strong preference for an agreed approach leading to a voluntary phasing out of the practice of stage payments in speculatively built housing estates was put forward and it was acknowledged that an agreed approach on the matter would be preferable to legislation or regulation. The CIFSR were also made aware that the balance of opinion among public representatives and the general public appears to be against the practice of stage payments in speculatively built housing estates. Subsequent to the meeting my Department wrote to CIFSR reiterating our position on the matter and seeking an indication of a definite commitment on the part of the construction industry to a voluntary phasing out of the practice of stage payments in housing estates. The CIFSR response is awaited and we will be pursuing the matter.The Government has kept open the possibility of legislation to prohibit the requirement to stage payments in house purchase contracts for speculatively built housing estates. In this regard the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform published the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Bill 2006 on 9 June 2006. The Bill is largely based on a draft Bill published with the Law Reform Commission's (LRC) report on the Reform and Modernisation of Land Law and Conveyancing Law, in July 2005. The Bill contains a general power for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to make regulations in the area of contracts. The LRC report proposed inclusion of the regulation of stage payments in the context of a provision for regulation of the terms of contracts. Accordingly, the provision in the Bill for regulation of contracts may provide an appropriate mechanism for regulation of stage payments, should such an approach be considered necessary.What I am working towards is obtaining a commitment, on the part of the whole industry, contained in a suitably formal instrument, to a voluntary phasing out of the practice of stage payments in housing estates. I would hope that this voluntary phasing out could take place over a period of, at most, twelve months with the CIFSR's cooperation in a manner that benefits both the consumer and the building industry.Yours sincerelyNoel Ahern.I am grateful to the Minister of State for that letter. He may have had a previous commitment when we dealt with this on 18 June 2004. He had hoped, and stated at that time, that he would have had the Government's legislation within six months.The Minister of State and the House, I am sure, agree that this is a serious loophole in the law which leaves consumers at a distinct disadvantage in purchasing a house in a housing estate off a particular plan. In particular, it reduces their bargaining power, adds considerably to their cost and involves them spending up to 90% of the price of their house before getting possession of it. I am sure the Minister of State agrees that the country is far too small for the lack of uniformity which exists in this matter.The practice, as I have stated, is wholly one sided and entirely anti-consumer. It is entirely inequitable that a consumer ends up paying up to 90% of the price of the house before getting possession of it. As a direct result of stage payments being demanded in such circumstances, purchasers end up paying their mortgage repayments well in advance of living in the house. This is grossly unfair, as I am sure the Minister will agree, particularly given that interest rates are still on the increase. The fact that the consumer has paid over the bulk of the purchase price of the house before completion inevitably lessens the consumer's bargaining power with the builder and provides little incentive for the builder to complete the project on time and to specification. It also involves transferring the financial risk inherent in the stage payments system to the consumer in addition to imposing unwarranted costs on him or her. This in unreasonable and incompatible with the ability of many consumers to carry such one-sided impositions.When the forerunner of this legislation was first introduced on 16 June 2004, I referred to the Law Society's report on the matter, which was prepared by the eminent firm of accountants Peelo & Partners. It stated stage payments cost consumers an additional €7,000 each. The majority of additional costs come in the form of extra interest on obligatory payments drawn down before the consumer took possession of the house. In addition, certification and survey costs had to be met. When one considers that 25,000 new houses are built annually in the affected counties, the total cost to consumers is €75million per annum. It is rare that we can implement legislation that can have such a direct and immediate effect to benefit consumers. This Bill would alleviate a considerable burden for house purchasers and, accordingly, I appeal to the Minister.Members will be satisfied that this loophole in the law is causing direct and avoidable hardship for consumers in house purchasing and we have a duty to rectify it. There is no justification for continuing the system of stage payments. It imposes additional costs, inconvenience and heartache on purchasers of houses where the practice is still prevalent. Furthermore, the Consumers Association of Ireland, in addition to the Law Society and the Law Reform Commission, is steadfastly opposed to the practice. It is a one sided practice, which offers no benefits to consumers. This measure, if adopted, could go a considerable distance towards helping first time buyers. Allowing stage payments to persist is to perpetuate a continued injustice against consumers. Accordingly, I commend the Bill to the House.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	244	I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I look forward to his contribution. I am pleased to have the opportunity to second the legislation.We are faced with a simple choice. Senator Coghlan has clearly outlined what we are trying to achieve. The decision we face is whether we are standing with the builder or the buyer, with the speculator or the consumer. The Minister of State must address a number of issues in this regard. He is playing ducks and drakes with this issue. He is stretching it out because he does not want a resolution and he has done everything possible over the past two years to defer a decision. The Minister of State contributed to the debate on the previous legislation in 2004 and both the Law Reform Commission and the Auctioneering and Estate Agency Review Group reported on this issue in 2005. The Minister of State wrote to both Senator Coghlan and myself last week saying he wanted another 12 months, which is appalling. Members should recall all the fine speeches, crocodile tears and concern for first-time buyers.This is a simple issue, which could be addressed to make life a little easier for such buyers. It would take pressure off them and allow them to purchase a house in a fair and legitimate way. We are proposing what the Law Reform Commission and consumer interests, including the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs, have sought. Any fair minded person would seek this and it is not too much ask to Government Members to support the legislation. If there are problems with it, the Minister of State can address them on Committee Stage. The Government, however, must make a commitment on the issue.How does the Minister of State stand on the issue? Does he think it is fair that young people struggling to buy a house must often involve their parents and extended families as well as their bank managers to make repayments on a house they are not even living in? Does it strike Government Members how grossly unfair it is that young people should pay for their houses while paying rent and other bills because they cannot live in the structure for which they are paying?I take issue with the Minister of State's letter to Senator Coghlan and myself last week. It contains misinformation and it is misleading. The Minister of State wrote that the Government had kept open the possibility of legislation to prohibit stage payments, which he has stated previously. He continued:In this regard the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform published the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Bill 2006 on 9 June 2006. The Bill is largely based on a draft Bill published with the Law Reform Commission's (LRC) report ... in July 2005. The Bill contains a general power for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to make regulations in the area of contracts.I was in contact with the office of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform four times earlier and I spoke to the Minister and that is not correct.The Law Reform Commission published a report last year while a report was also published at the same time by the Auctioneering and Estate Agency Review Group. The conveyancing Bill to which the Minister of State referred is before the House and it is largely based on the review group's report, paragraph 7.3 of which states: "While recognising that the issue of stage payments is largely beyond its remit, the group is aware that the Minister for Housing and Urban Renewal is considering initiating a consultation process with relevant interests in relation to the practice of stage payments in house purchase with a view...". This is similar to the Minister of State's commitment in 2004 and any other time he has been asked to do something about this. It is understood the guiding principle is along the lines Senator Coghlan has outlined.The group's report concludes, "The Group would generally support this objective and encourage the relevant parties, including the construction industry, the professionals dealing with the house purchase and the relevant Government Agencies, as appropriate, to work towards this achievement". This recommendation has been made by everybody but it has not been implemented. The only reason for this is that the Government is coming under pressure from vested interests in the building industry. The Minister of State is shaking his head but he should outline why he will not support the legislation. We have made a proposal that has been recommended by interests and agencies he represents.The Minister of State may wish to amend the legislation, to which we are open and he may wish to introduce other provisions on Committee Stage and we are also open to that. However, we are not open to the principle of what we are trying to achieve being voted down later. This is an issue about which Government backbenchers get kicked around when they return to their constituencies and speak to ordinary people who are trying to buy houses for their children and friends at the weekend and witness the struggle they endure. This would be a simple gesture, which would cost the State nothing. I ask Government Members to do the decent thing and to not vote against the legislation later.This is not a party political issue because Members on all sides are concerned about it. The Minister of State stated in his letter that he recently met officials of the Construction Industry Federation, southern region. I spoke to them to establish their views on the legislation. They wrote to the Minister of State saying they were prepared to phase out stage payments on a voluntary basis. The CIF's code of practice provides that its members should not take a stage payment over the value of what is on the site and that the site should be transferred to the potential owner immediately. The federation is trying to so something, although it is not sufficient. I accept, however, that the CIF is moving in the right direction.While everyone appears to be moving in the correct direction, it seems the Minister of State is not prepared to state that he agrees with the principle of the Bill but wishes to make amendments on Committee Stage. He could then make such changes. This is completely wrong and unfair. The Cabinet should consider that it is putting the Minister of State's party, ordinary party workers, the Government and its backbenchers behind the eight ball on this issue, because there is no justification for not supporting this Bill tonight.

#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	248	There is broad consensus in the Oireachtas that stage payments should not be a normal feature in the purchase of houses in residential estates. As has been noted, the Government indicated in June 2004 that this was its preferred position and undertook to work with the stakeholders involved towards a resolution of the issues. Substantial progress can now be reported and I believe it would be more beneficial to house purchasers to finalise good solutions on this basis rather than invoking a legislative solution which could prove to be too inflexible.A legislative approach risks being too rigid in an area that concerns private transactions and where circumstances can vary. Moreover, the introduction of additional statutory requirements in this area could add complexity to the process of property purchase.It is usually preferable to proceed on the basis of agreement rather than by compulsion. This has been the basis of much of Ireland's overall economic and social progress for nearly 20 years. In the case of stage payments, as every Member of the House will be aware, this practice does not exist in many parts of the country. The vast majority of the enormous numbers of new houses which are sold each year are transacted without such a system. This situation obtains as a matter of market practice without any statutory intervention. The logic should be to facilitate the extension of this approach throughout the country.Consequently, I am pleased to be able to inform the House that in recent days, the Department has received a strong commitment to pursue the voluntary phasing out of stage payments from the Construction Industry Federation's branch in Cork, which is the main centre where such payments now occur. In a letter addressed to the Department, it has indicated that its members have made a strong recommendation to the Irish Home Builders Association, IHBA, at national level to the effect that it should immediately enter into discussions with the Department with a view to voluntarily phasing out stage payments within a relatively short timeframe. I understand that this recommendation has been endorsed by the national body of the IHBA and the necessary follow-up arrangements will be put in place without delay.This commitment on the part of the Cork Construction Industry Federation, CIF, members has followed efforts by the Department over a long period. It represents a major advance which will, I believe, lead to the early ending of the practice of including stage payment requirements in house purchase contracts in the case of housing estates. By an early ending, I envisage that the practice should be phased out within the next nine months or thereabouts and that whatever agreement may be required for this purpose should be fully concluded before the Oireachtas resumes in the autumn.The option of legislative action would, of course, be available as a fallback position in the event of the matter not being brought to a satisfactory conclusion at an early date. In that regard, I should point out that the legislative approach proposed in this Bill is not considered to be appropriate. It is drafted as a stand-alone measure under a housing title, whereas any legislative measure in this area would require framing in the context of legislation relating to house purchase contracts and regulation of conveyancing practices as recommended last year by the Law Reform Commission.Perhaps the last time this matter arose in this House two years ago, I was foolish to more or less accept that the Department would deal with this issue. It has nothing to do with the housing section of the Department. As the matter pertained to housing, I decided to try to use our influence to try to solve this matter by agreement in a consultative manner. However, if Members wish to adopt a legislative approach, this matter should be under——

#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	267	While it is generally accepted that stage payments may be warranted in the case of one-off housing, I do not consider that this is likely to be the case in the context of speculatively built estate housing. Stage payments typically refer to the practice of requiring the purchaser in a new housing development to make payments to the builder at a number of set intervals or stages in line with progress of the building. While the practice of purchasing new houses in housing estates by means of stage payments does not apply in most parts of the country, it is recognised as being prevalent in Cork and some other parts of the south and west. The making of agreed phased payments under a standard building contract is a common arrangement for the development of one-off houses in rural areas generally. Substantial house extension or renovation contracts usually also involve such arrangements.I understand that in the main, the use of stage payments in Ireland developed during the 1970s among a number of Irish builders who had returned from the UK. These builders operated at a small scale and used stage payments to gain access to capital to enable them to construct housing, as sufficient financing was not always readily available from the lending institutions. I understand that the absence of stage payments in Dublin and other areas has been attributed, at least in part, to the consequences of a court case involving stage payments following which Dublin solicitors opposed the practice. However, I believe that stage payment arrangements were not the norm in Dublin and adjacent areas before then.The IHBA home purchase protection pledge code of practice contains provisions relating to stage payments. This is a purely voluntary professional code and does have any statutory effect or recognition at present. However, I understand that approximately 80% of builders subscribe to it and it includes a complaints procedure in respect of members who breach the code. It states that the value of a stage payment, when taken together with the cumulative value of payments made to that date, should not exceed the value of the site and the work completed at that date. There are also bonding systems in operation under which a certain amount of cover may be provided in cases where the builder is unable to complete the work and stage payments cannot be recovered.In December 2001, the High Court ruled in a case taken by the Office of Director of Consumer Affairs under the European Communities (Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts) Regulations 1995, that stage payments in house building contracts, which exceed the percentages stipulated in the IHBA code of practice, or which exceed the extent and value of works carried out at the date specified for the payment in question, shall not apply. However, it is important to note that the court made this ruling without prejudice to the propriety or impropriety of stage payments per se.Following the debate on a Private Members' Bill in this House in 2004, I had a detailed examination of the issues carried out in the Department. Arising from this, a comprehensive paper was prepared for the purpose of consultation with relevant interests but its circulation has been deferred to allow engagement with the construction industry regarding possible voluntary phasing out. This process has taken longer than I would have liked but, as I indicated at the beginning of this speech, it promises to prove successful. It is clear from the examination carried out that arguments can be put forward both for and against the system of stage payments.A claim made in favour of the system is that it tends to moderate house prices by virtue of reducing the builders' financing overheads during the course of construction. It has also been argued by the construction sector that stage payments can protect house buyers from gazumping, as contracts must be signed at an early stage for stage payments to commence, thus ensuring the house price is fixed and contractually binding.A key argument against the practice of stage payments is that, notwithstanding the existence of bonding arrangements, it results in a large element of risk being carried by the purchaser rather than by the builder during development. As such, it is the purchaser's funds that are at risk if, for any reason, a building venture failed. While it is understood cases such as these are few and far between, if it does happen it is a serious problem for a buyer. Furthermore, it is claimed that stage payments can create a significant additional financial burden for many home buyers, particularly first-time buyers, those with restricted budgets, and those paying for rented accommodation while also making stage payments.Many developers have ways to minimise financing costs not available to home buyers, such as extended credit facilities, more advantageous borrowing terms, time lag on payment of VAT and instalment payments for land purchase. Thus, overall cost savings from stage payments that might potentially be reflected in house prices are likely to be less than the additional cost falling on home buyers.The pros and cons associated with stage payments and the balance of advantage or disadvantage is likely to vary, depending on the circumstances. While it is generally accepted that stage payments may be warranted in the case of one-off housing, this is not likely to be the case in the context of estate housing. It is evident that the mainstream new housing market operates extremely effectively in most parts of the country without a stage payments system.While the extent of possible additional costs to purchasers arising from stage payments may be debatable, it would appear that the practice is, on balance, likely to have a broadly negative overall impact on purchasers in housing estates. Moreover, a stage payment arrangement is, on the whole, unlikely to provide the most effective form of contractual mechanism from the customer perspective outside of the one-off building contract. Indeed, it seems at odds with the emphasis in public procurement on seeking to achieve the most appropriate allocation of risk between developer and client.A good deal of discussion and correspondence has taken place over the past six months or more between my officials and members of the CIF in Cork. We emphasised that the balance of opinion among public representatives and the general public appears to be against the practice of stage payments in housing estates. We made clear our strong preference for an agreed approach and sought a definite commitment on the part of the construction industry to a voluntary phasing out of the practice in housing estates.I recently wrote to Senator Coghlan to keep him informed of developments. The fact that the CIF has now indicated its willingness to enter immediate discussions for early phasing out is a positive outcome of these efforts, even if it has taken longer than I would have wished.In the course of our engagement with the construction industry on this matter, we made clear that the Government will keep open the possibility of legislation to deal with this issue. Any legislative measures, for example as a backup to voluntary agreement, would fall to be considered in the context of conveyancing practice and house purchase contracts. This area of law comes within the responsibility of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform rather than my Department.The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform recently published the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Bill 2006. The Bill is largely based on a draft Bill published last year and a Law Reform Commission report on the reform and modernisation of land law and conveyancing law. The Law Reform Commission proposed inclusion of the regulation of stage payments in the context of a provision for regulating the terms of building contracts. The Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Bill does not contain a specific reference to stage payments, but it does have a general power for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to make regulations relating to contracts and conveyances for the sale of land, including buildings.I note Senator Coghlan spoke favourably about the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Bill on Second Stage. I am surprised that he or indeed any of his colleagues did not, as far as I am aware, mention stage payments in the course of the debate. Perhaps my letter did not reach the Senator before that debate.

I heard what Senator O'Toole stated but that conflicts with my information and understanding. I also understand further legislation to establish the new national property services regulatory authority will provide another opportunity to provide for matters recommended by the Law Reform Commission which are not included in the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Bill. That report is the basis of two Bills, one which is before the Houses and one which is to come. Either of those Bills will provide a more proper way than a housing Bill to enshrine this in legislation.My Department already indicated that agreement to phase out stage payments must be enshrined in a suitable formal instrument, possibly the IHBA code of practice on home purchase protection. I expect that an appropriate course would be for the CIF or IHBA and the Law Society to agree relevant aspects of standard contract documentation, since this is primarily a matter of conveyancing practice. As I already stated, I want to see the matter concluded before we return in the autumn, leading to an ending of the practice in all housing estate contracts by early 2007. This should enable a smooth transition and minimal disruption to the market while allowing builders, with the support of their representative bodies, to adapt, as necessary.The phasing out of stage payments in all areas is one of many important recent initiatives taken by the Government which will benefit house buyers. The new national property services regulatory authority, which will be established by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, is another major development. It will have a number of functions of importance to house buyers including regulating the auctioneering and estate agency business and related matters; licensing, regulating and dealing with complaints about property managing agents and the provision of relevant consumer information.In my Department's area, the new social partnership agreement contains important housing elements including commitments to 27,000 new social housing commencements or acquisitions and 17,000 additional units of affordable housing over the period 2007 to 2009. The agreement also endorses the principles established in the housing policy framework Building Sustainable Communities, which sets out the objective of high quality, integrated sustainable communities that will form key principles of housing policy during the ten-year framework of the partnership agreement.To summarise on the stage payments issue, I believe that we have now made an important breakthrough with CIF agreement to pursue voluntary phasing out of stage payments. This can be inferred from the letter of the Cork branch of the CIF, dated 23 June, which I have quoted. I have a statement in writing from that branch, which it sent to the national branch of the IHBA with a view to entering into discussions on how phasing out could be achieved. I understand the IHBA has endorsed the proposal. I hope this approach is preferable to legislation but the opportunity will arise in any event to make more appropriate provision in the context of the regulation of conveyancing practice and house purchase contracts.I would have liked this problem to have been solved two years ago. Senator Coghlan has spoken to me about it on many occasions and I hope he and his colleagues will feel it inappropriate to push this Stage to a vote. I hope they will withdraw the Bill and lend their support to an agreed approach to the phasing out of stage payments.I said 18 months ago that if the consultation with the stakeholders did not work, we would think about legislation. I did not necessarily say the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government was the most appropriate Department in this regard. If the stakeholders and construction industry talk to us and are prepared to do business, this is the way we should go. Legislation is necessary at times but can also cause complications one might not necessarily predict.This matter, if it is to be addressed legislatively, should be addressed in the Bills associated with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. One such Bill is before the Seanad and the other is to be published very soon — I am not sure of the date. Opportunities exist should the Senators wish to pursue them and should the discussions with the CIF not be finalised. I cannot accept the Bill as it stands and if the Senators do not withdraw it, I will have to recommend against it.We did not have correspondence from the CIF heretofore. There were discussions and meetings, some of which might have gone very well and others of which might not, but we now have a statement in writing from the organisation. On the letter of 17 May 2006, the matter was discussed at a meeting of the Cork branch of the CIF on 15 June 2006. Members of that branch made a strong recommendation to the IHBA that it should enter into discussions immediately with the Department with a view to the voluntary phasing out of stage payments within a relatively short timeframe. The national branch of the IHBA met on the morning of Tuesday, 27 June and I understand it accepted the recommendation. I hope we can now enter into the discussions and finalise matters in the coming months. Should the progress made prove insufficient, the opportunity will arise to make amendments to the two justice Bills. With this in mind, I hope the Bill will be withdrawn.

This is a simple Bill to prohibit the ripping off of young people buying houses. The Minister of State can put a long speech together but when one strips it down one realises it amounts to a statement to the effect that some builders from certain parts of the country, particularly Cork, discovered that they had, in a sellers' market, the capacity to make even more money from people who were already vulnerable. By God, did they go for it?There are two lobby groups that invite me to meetings regularly to explain all their troubles, namely, the CIF and SIMI. I attend none of their meetings because neither the motor industry nor the construction industry needs to engage in the solicitation of many Members of the Oireachtas. They are doing bloody well as it is and do not need my concern.The Minister of State said a great amount of time is taken up with an exchange of pleasantries, telephone calls, letters, requests and proposals between the Department and the CIF, both at national and Cork branch levels. Having had a substantial part of the personnel resource of his Department consumed by this issue, he now tells us he should not be doing this at all and that it should be done by somebody else. One does not have to be a particularly astute political analyst to realise he is effectively saying the Progressive Democrats, rather than the Fianna Fáil Party, should deal with the issue. Thus, members of the Fianna Fáil Party could say to their friends in the CIF, as they cough up large donations to the party, that they did their best and held up the process but that the crowd in the Progressive Democrats did not understand reality and gave in on it.

#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	283	We know what is going on. The Minister of State is one of the nicest people I know but he is stuck in an impossible position whereby decisions are being taken over his head not to upset the CIF in a year in which fairly substantial funding will be needed by a substantial number of Fianna Fáil Ministers. Not long ago, a Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government addressed the House and filleted the proposals on the rate of 20%. The following year, his funding was disclosed and the main funder was discovered to be a member of the CIF, a member of the construction industry.I do not attribute motives to people but when I see obvious occurrences like this, I can only draw one conclusion, that is, when it comes to a choice between the interest of those who are buying houses and that of the wealthy builders, Fianna Fáil will always jump as far as it can in the direction of the builders. Let me give a good example. Many of the extremely affluent builders in the part of the country in which I live drive large recently registered cars, including cars manufactured by Mercedes and Lexus, which cost up to €100,000. Many of these cars must be ordered six months in advance.

If many of the builders who pay €100,000 for a car were told by the garages from which they buy them that they would have to pay 90% of the cost up-front before getting them, which might take six months, they would tell them to get lost. The idea that they would have to order and pay for a car now and wait for its delivery would cause apoplexy among those who believe it to be perfectly reasonable to——

#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	287	I did not say it was a comparison, I said it was an analogy. It illustrates how uniquely sensitive to the interests and considerations of the building industry Fianna Fáil has been, is and proposes to continue to be. I do not understand the position of its partners in Government, who are committed unequivocally to an economic model that involves genuine competition between people in a genuine marketplace. The Progressive Democrats founder and first leader was particularly eloquent on this matter.It was rather telling that this most passionate advocate of business and free competition was not offered a single directorship by an Irish company after he left politics because he believed in genuine competition, which is something a huge chunk of Irish business, particularly in the building industry, does not believe in. They want a controlled, easy market where the risk is minimal. What does the construction industry do in areas where this is going on? It transfers the risk to somebody else.I have friends who had builders whose businesses collapsed at the last stage of purchase of a property and who discovered that they did not own the property and their payments were gone. They had to buy their property twice because of the nefarious activities of builders who went through the stage payments procedure. It took years to do something about company law to deal with that during which there was much pussyfooting and delay. We saw it in the car insurance industry where the report of the review body lay in a Department for years before it was finally published. It then turned out that the huge losses the industry was supposed to be making were entirely fictitious.It is a pity that we cannot do what should be done, which is to pass this Bill on Second Stage. The Minister of State can then say that the view of his own party and everybody in Leinster House is that this is part of history. He can say there are two ways of dealing with this, namely, putting together a code of practice, backed up by legislation, or introducing legislation to tell us what to do. He can then ask Members which course of action they wish to take. Instead, the Minister, with all the power of Government, is saying he is grateful to a private lobby group because it agrees not to rip off its customers. Those are extraordinary words from a Minister of State.One of the groups that made the most money out of our booming economy have kindly agreed, in the past month or two and under enormous pressure to bail out Fianna Fáil, to enter into discussions about putting an end to ripping off their own customers. We are supposed to be grateful for that. There is only one response. We must have a vote on this Bill and let Fianna Fáil show that when it comes to the crunch that it stands with the builders against those who must deal with builders.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	288	I welcome the Minister of State to the House and congratulate Senator Coghlan and his colleagues for producing this Bill. Senator Coghlan has outlined well in the explanatory memorandum the way stage payments arise. He gives an example of two types of house purchase transactions. The first, with which most people in rural Ireland would be familiar, is where an individual arranges with a builder to construct a house and stage payments are made as the work proceeds. The second is where stage payments relate to houses built in housing estates. In the first instance, dates are arranged for the payments. In the second case, a 10% contract deposit is paid with the 90% balance paid on completion of the house. In the past, the purchase of these houses was often funded through stage payments but that practice appears to have disappeared in most areas of the country, apart from Cork, as other speakers said.The ending of stage payments would be welcome. I was interested to hear the Minister of State say he was trying to do this in a voluntary way. Nobody wants purchasers to have to make extra financial payments where houses are being built. I would like stage payments to be ended as quickly as possible.The Minister of State mentioned his discussions with the Construction Industry Federation and said that the Cork members met with the national IHBA yesterday, 27 June. I hope its members will accept the Cork recommendation. I do not know if there has been any response on that and I would like to hear an update in that regard because if the problem is just in Cork and some other areas of the south west, it is important those areas be dealt with in the same way as the rest of the country.The code of practice of the Irish Home Builders Association the Minister of State spoke about is welcome. One of the difficulties is that this is a voluntary professional code, which does not have any statutory effect or recognition. I understand that 80% of house builders subscribe to the code and if that figure is correct, we have gone some way to achieving full compliance and it is a only question of getting the other 20% to comply. Full compliance is what we all want to achieve as we go forward on this issue.The Minister of State referred to a High Court ruling in December 2001 on a case taken by the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs. That ruling came out strongly against the practice of stage payments but was without prejudice to the propriety or impropriety of stage payments.The most important issue now is the voluntary phasing out of stage payments. The Minister of State mentioned the case in regard to one-off housing. The only issue in that regard was stage payments but as we all know many other issues arise in regard to service charges and, for example, archaeological reports which must be obtained on many houses. I would point out to the Minister of State that there is a shortage of archaeologists, particularly in County Galway, to do such reports.Another issue that arises is in regard to national safety audits, which are causing problems. I inquired recently about the number of personnel available to Galway County Council to do safety audits and was told there were three companies, all in Galway city. It costs €2,500 to €3,000 for a safety audit to be carried out. Those are the type of requirements that increase the cost of building a house to a point where it turns out to be much more expensive than many purchasers expected.The Minister of State said that Cork CIF has agreed to enter discussions with the Department on the voluntary phasing out of the practice of stage payments at an early date. That is a significant development which I hope will end the practice of stage payments as soon as possible.What we are discussing tonight is the provision of legislation by way of this Private Members' Bill. The Minister of State said the Bill is not appropriate and mentioned two items of legislation in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. One is the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Bill 2006, which has begun its Stages in the Seanad. The other is the legislation relating to a national property services regulatory authority. I hope these legislative measures could be dealt with quickly in this House.While the issue of stage payments is important, it is not the only issue causing difficulty for people acquiring a house. We have had debates here in the past, and I hope we will have them in the future, on planning because planning was something on which the Minister, Deputy Roche, put much emphasis. It is obviously down to interpretation when it comes to actually achieving planning permission. It is an issue I should like to see both the Minister and the Minister of State refer to in this House, again. I hope we will have another debate on it.Apart from planning some positive developments are happening. I understand we now have six years supply of serviced residential land, nationally. That is very welcome. I can speak with some authority about County Galway where affordable housing is very well supported. There are designated people in the housing authority who are available for any member of the public who wants to talk about affordable housing. I hope, also that the issues as regards Part V can be resolved. This House has discussed, and Senator Ryan referred in passing to, some problems about where the 20% affordable housing is provided in a county or particular town. There are positive aspects which should not be forgotten about. It is not just a matter of saying stage payments are the problem. They certainly are one aspect of the problem, but there are other challenges, too, that we should be able to meet. Hopefully we will have a chance to debate them in the weeks and months ahead.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	289	I welcome the Minister of State to the House again to discuss this issue. It is a case of déjà vu because on 16 June 2004 I spoke in the House on the first outing of Senator Coghlan’s Bill. A pretty clear indication was given by the Government at the time through the Minister of State with responsibility for housing that something would happen on this. Here we are two years later. The Minister of State has taken a letter he received from the Cork branch of the Construction Industry Federation only last week and informed the House that two years after the Bill’s first outing, the federation has now signed up to a voluntary code of practice. We are all supposed to be jumping up and down and acclaiming this as fantastic. I admire the Minister of State in many ways. His is a straight talking Dublin politician and we need more of those in Government.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	291	I will leave that to Senator Brady.The fact that it has taken two years to extract a voluntary concession from the area of the country where this anti-competitive practice is going on is just outrageous. There is nothing functional about the current Irish housing market. It is dysfunctional, primarily because the pent-up demand that has been there for many years far outstrips supply. Consequently, there are too many people chasing too few houses. In that type of market, anti-competitive practices such as stage payments and gazumping — which I will talk about in a moment — are bound to occur. The job of the Minister of State with responsibility for housing and that of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is to represent house buyers and stand up for them. They must introduce regulations or legislation for house buyers because it is a dysfunctional market. There is no way that the pent-up demand can actually meet supply. Hopefully, at some point it will and then there will be price equilibrium or even a reduction in price for some people who can then enter the housing market. The Government has been in dereliction of its duty, not just for the past two years. As I pointed out on 16 June 2004, it is inaccurate to say that the Law Reform Commission looked at this last year in a report and came to a conclusion as outlined in Senator Coghlan's Bill. That is inaccurate because the commission examined it the previous year. It also examined a whole range of other things.When I first introduced my anti-gazumping Bill in the other House in 1998, one of the initiatives it led to was the establishment by the Government of a Law Reform Commission report into anti-competitive practices in the Irish housing market. One of the issues mentioned at the time was stage payments. It is to completely mislead the House to say the commission only came to a conclusion about this last year. It did not. Its views on this were stated as far back as 2003. The fact that it has taken three years to get a voluntary concession or extraction from some aspect of the building industry is crazy. I do not believe the Minister of State has been doing his job, to put it bluntly. He has been sitting back as happy as Larry, while the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform produces a conveyancing Bill into which he has had no input at all. He came down very heavily on my colleague, Senator Coghlan, in his speech where he said that he recently welcomed the conveyancing Bill on Second Stage, as he did, but the Minister of State is surprised that he has not produced any Committee Stage amendments as yet or made any reference to the fact that he will amend the law. With all due respect, that is the job of the Minister of State. He is paid to stand up for home owners and young people who are trying to get on the first step on the housing ladder. The idea that fundamentally all legislative proposals in this area must be left to the Opposition is just daft, quite frankly.If this was coming onto the Minister of State's desk one month into office, that would be fine, and he should be given time. However, in effect it is three years since the first mention of this practice by the Law Reform Commission in 2003. The Minister of State has known about it for quite a while and suddenly, a week before this debate, a voluntary code is produced like a rabbit out of a hat. On voluntary codes, when I examined the issue of gazumping, I was told by the then Fianna Fáil-led Government that they would work. If we were serious about trying to outlaw the ugly practice of gazumping in the housing market, we should seek a voluntary code. Why is it that when it comes to any aspect of the construction industry, we do not want standard legislation outlawing practices, we refuse to include such practices in legislation or even regulate them, but we want voluntary codes? What is so different about the Irish construction industry that voluntary codes should apply to it, but to no other industry? I have never come across this obsession with voluntary codes anywhere else. Of course it only applies to those sections of the various construction groups who are members of the CIF. There is absolutely zero impact if one is not a member. Who is policing this? The people who are involved in the practice in the first place. As Senators O'Toole and Coghlan have said, the Irish auctioneers have already highlighted this particular problem. The notion that all of the interested parties are singing off the same hymn sheet on this issue is completely inaccurate.I do not accept the argument about a voluntary code. Something is either right or wrong.

The Irish housing market, unfortunately, is riddled with scamming in a whole range of areas. One of them is the explosion of management companies. Many young couples and individuals now have to pick up the bill on a yearly basis for essential services which local authorities provided for years.The job of Seanad Éireann is to get agreement on legislation such as this, which has the support of all sides of the House. It is not the Government's job to stop it. I regret that the Government has chosen on the second occasion in two years to stop this pro-consumer legislation, which could introduce guarantees into the housing market for a part of this country where this scam has existed for far too long.
#JohnMinihan	unknown-#JohnMinihan-party	unknown-#JohnMinihan-dob	unknown-#JohnMinihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	298	I welcome the Minister of State and his officials to the House this evening. I congratulate Senator Coghlan on maintaining his initiative on this issue. This is not the first time I have spoken about stage payments — inside or outside this House — and I am grateful for the opportunity to outline my views again.I have a certain level of experience of stage payments in County Cork, where the scheme is normal practice. Without doubt, there has been abuse of stage payments and that is a real problem. On the other hand, there are many occasions in which stage payments have operated effectively, both to the benefit of the builder and to the benefit of the house purchaser. My concern remains that we might see some reactive measure to alter a practice which has operated in parts of the country for more than 40 years.Housing provision is a hot topic and one that creates anxieties for many people, especially young people. It is a complex issue and the housing market should not be tweaked in a way that could damage or interrupt supply. The Government's policies are having a positive impact, but in the face of sheer demand, relief is difficult to identify. Tinkering around the edges of the problem achieves little. This was tried in the mid-1990s, but it was only when we started to get really serious about supply that progress of any sort was made. Initiatives taken by the Government have resulted in increased housing supply. We should be concerned that any legislation at this time could interrupt that process, especially for smaller developers. While larger developers should be able to carry the cost, we should not even inadvertently limit major housing developments to the larger builders. To do so could be anti-competitive and, ultimately, anti-consumer.Despite being a small country, a wide variation in practices has emerged over many years. This has resulted in two particular types of stage payments. In one case, the title to the site is transferred on completion of the transaction. In the second instance, the title is transferred before completion. From my understanding, the practice has been to transfer the title before completion of the transaction. As the site purchase is a separate transaction and the site is transferred at a very early stage, this provides the house purchaser with security of the site.I would like to give an example of this. A number of years ago in Cork, the builder of a large and expensive development went bust when three quarters of the development had been completed. The code of practice had been adhered to. After a period of deliberation, those purchasing the partially-built houses were able to continue the development. I became involved at that point as I was concerned about the rights of the purchasers. In the heel of the hunt, their rights were thankfully upheld according to the code of practice. Nevertheless, one can see how problems can emerge and can generate enormous distress. Outside of that instance, I have never received a complaint from a house purchaser in Cork about stage payments.Nobody can stand over the cases alluded to by Senator Coghlan and the horror stories reported widely in the media. There is a duty on the developers in question to provide answers. Legislation should be enacted to protect consumers. However, this does not mean that we should act in a way that could disrupt or interfere with the outturn and supply of houses in areas where a system of stage payments is practised. Lest anyone misunderstand me, I am concerned about small and medium-sized builders who are operating this practice and who are building badly needed houses. I am not referring to the big developers. The code of practice needs to be considered and developed further. Any action in this area is welcome and to be supported.Financial institutions in Cork have established a system under which mortgages can be released at an early stage. This can remove the need for bridging finance. It is paid in stages where the institutions are satisfied that the money advanced does not exceed the value of the work carried out. The financial institutions have embraced this and have been supporting house purchasers in the areas where stage payments take place. The amount of legal work for a solicitor operating on behalf of a consumer who has entered into a contract involving stage payments is undoubtedly greater. If there is only a deposit stage and a completion stage, there is less work involved. Should a solicitor be working for a scaled fee based on the purchase price of a house, he must do more work for the same fee in the case of a client who is purchasing in stage payments. Consequently, there in an incentive for the legal profession to see a streamlining of the system.My primary concern remains the consumer. We must not underestimate our responsibility to protect home buyers. Senator Coghlan's Bill has this concern at its heart and I commend that. However, there are three entities involved, namely, the consumer, the builder and the legal profession. Who is driving this change? Given the sensitivity of the housing market and the importance of supply, I support both the Government's somewhat cautious approach and the acknowledgment that if there is a need to enact legislation in this area, then it will be done. Such action should include discussion with the Construction Industry Federation, the legal profession, the Director of Consumer Affairs and other relevant stakeholders. I seriously suggest that we look at the role of the legal profession in this process. There are search fees for housing estates and for individual houses. In an estate of 200 houses, 200 consumers each pay a search fee.It is clear that no legislative provisions currently exist to deal specifically with the operation of stage payments. It would seem preferable to phase out stage payments, assuming an agreed basis for doing so can be found. However, there will always be an option to take legislative measures should the issues not be resolved adequately. Notwithstanding the commendable work of Senator Coghlan, it appears the proposed Private Members' Bill is not the most appropriate way to proceed. Given the linkage with conveyancing and contract law and that the Bill is a stand-alone measure, more work is required. The Law Reform Commission recommended in 2005 that should legislative action be necessary, it should be part of a broader approach on legislation affecting house purchase contracts and the regulation of conveyancing. In this context, I support the Government's proposals on the issue.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	299	I welcome the Minister of State to the Chamber to discuss this very important Bill. I thank those who helped to produce the Bill, especially Senator Coghlan, who has put so much time and effort into drawing it up.The practice of stage payments, which has resulted in this Bill that is before us for a second time, is a form of legalised extortion. It represents nothing more than a pushing out of the boundaries to extract every cent possible from those struggling to meet the costs of a first property. The rungs of the property ladder are being pulled further and further apart by the actions of modern highwaymen and pirates, who exploit the financial position and powerlessness of first-time buyers attempting to take their first step into home ownership.I call on the Government to support Senator Coghlan's Private Members' Bill to end the practice of stage payments for houses built in housing estates, which is another Government-supported rip-off. In June 2004, when it was first before this House, Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern said of this Bill:If the other routes to which I referred do not lead to potential success, I will support the legislation if we decide it is the only route to take. I suggest a period of approximately six months to see if the other routes are successful. I agree with the basic idea in the legislation. I find it difficult to disagree with what Senator Coghlan and others in the House to whom I spoke recently are trying to achieve.As a considerably longer period than six months has passed and the Government has done nothing to end the anomaly highlighted in the Bill, I hope there will be unity here this evening and common sense will prevail in the interest of home buyers, not developers. The Government must commit to this and replace empty words with action.In 2006 official statistics show the average first-time buyer is paying more than €250,000 for his or her first home. Meanwhile, only 1,833 affordable houses were acquired, only 730 shared ownership transactions were completed and only 57 sites have been fully or partially developed on foot of Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000.

I need to give facts and the Minister does not like to hear facts. The practice of paying for new homes by stage payments is not a countrywide one.

#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	311	There is evidence that the practice is spreading, in particular to County Kildare. It has resulted in some homeowners in these areas paying an extra €7,000 for the price of their new home. Regardless of the counties affected, the practice is totally unacceptable.The Bill aims to address a serious loophole in the law which leaves consumers at a distinct disadvantage when purchasing houses using stage payments, to which they often have little or no alternative, a fact that has not escaped the average developer. While stage payments reduce buyers' bargaining power and add considerably to their costs, there is little they can do. The practice of stage payments is wholly one-sided and entirely anti-consumer. It is entirely inequitable that a consumer should pay up to 90% of the price of a house before he or she gains possession. The practice is driven by developers and defies all moral values.As the direct result of stage payments being demanded in such circumstances, purchasers end up paying their mortgage repayments well in advance of moving into the house, which is entirely unfair and untenable. Paying the bulk of the purchase price of the house before it is completed, inevitably reduces the consumer's bargaining power with the builder and provides little impetus for the builder to complete the project on time and to specification. It so ties the purchaser to the developer or builder that the latter could be said to have a free hand, as the law now stands. It also involves transferring certain financial risk inherent in the stage payment system to consumers in addition to imposing unwarranted costs on them. This is unreasonable and incompatible with the ability of many consumers to carry such one-sided impositions.The Bill does not seek to outlaw the provision in contracts for stage payments where a single house is being built to the specification of a consumer, particularly for once-off housing. However, in other cases, the practice of stage payments is one-sided and confers no benefit, but rather penalties on consumers. I hope the Government has the foresight and the willingness to accept this legislation.Some 25,000 house purchasers and their families await the Government's response to this Bill, and they all have long memories. A general election is approaching and candidates will be running in Munster and the west, including Sligo. All those people will watch to see the Government's reaction to the Bill.

This issue should transcend party politics and the Bill would bring real and tangible benefits for hard-pressed first-time buyers. I urge the Government to accept the Bill now so that consumers can get the protection they deserve when purchasing their homes. Fine Gael has published three Private Members' Bills on the subject of housing protection. We pledge to implement them when elected to Government — it is no longer "if".

I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I remember a time, more than 20 years ago, when stage payments were an issue in Dublin. Fortunately this is no longer an issue. The question is how we should approach the problem. We all agree that the practice must end. The Minister of State and his Department have been working steadily towards that goal for many years. It probably has not been as quick as everyone would like but the question now arises as to whether we will achieve the goal through legislation or by agreement. The Bill before us uses a jack hammer to crack a nut. Even as late as yesterday, progress was being made on this matter. We must acknowledge that the construction industry employs more than 200,000 people in this country, a situation created by the policies of this Government.Unfortunately, when Fine Gael and the Labour Party had their chance, they were not in a position to do anything about improving conditions. Despite that, the Labour Party is hypocritically criticising an industry employing a huge number of people, many of whom are members of unions and, through no choice of their own, contribute to the party's coffers. It makes me smile to hear Labour Members rabbiting on — I ask Senators to excuse the expression — about the tent in Galway.

#CyprianBrady	unknown-#CyprianBrady-party	unknown-#CyprianBrady-dob	unknown-#CyprianBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	326	At least the people who go to Galway have a choice in doing so.A significant amount of work has been done on this issue. The voluntary code of practice put in place by the Home Builders Association and the CIF enjoys an 80% compliance rate. The remaining 20% of builders leave a number of people open to being ripped off. As the Minister of State noted, the code applies to a wide range of organisations throughout the country. We are all in agreement that the practice must be stopped but it has been restricted to a relatively small part of the country. Throughout the country, 80,000 units are being built each year and in my own area, tens of thousands of units of apartments have been built over the past three years.The Minister of State referred to the property services regulatory authority, which will have responsibility for the ongoing management of apartment complexes. A phenomenon has arisen in Dublin city and county whereby one-off houses are built in front and rear gardens and often paid for under the stage payments system. I am aware of a couple of instances in which three or four apartments have been constructed in a garden.The practice of stage payments was the subject of a High Court case in 2001. The Government's ongoing contacts with the CIF is paying dividends and all sides now accept that the practice is not in consumers' interest. A house purchase is probably the biggest decision a person will make in his or her lifetime. We are all in agreement on that but it is a matter of choice as to how we address the issue. We could trundle through with legislation which we try to enforce in a small part of the country but in the vast majority of the country, the industry functions without the need for regulation. In most instances, builders charge a 10% deposit and the remainder on completion.Despite the increase in houses built and, by extension, the profits made by many builders and developers, we have to accept that the boom cannot last because resources are limited in terms of space. There is sufficient serviced land to last an estimated six years, which is a relatively short length of time. We must look to the future by meeting the demand for housing.There has been much innovation in terms of providing housing, particularly in respect of social and affordable houses. The latest partnership agreement, Towards 2012, specifically provides for 27,000 social units between 2007 and 2009, in addition to 17,000 affordable units. The Part V scheme for social and affordable housing has been of great benefit to inner city areas. I have witnessed huge improvements in Dublin people's living accommodation. Since 1997, €6.5 billion has been spent by local authorities on providing social and affordable housing. It was intended that Part V would come into effect over time and that been the case. A major difference is being made to Dublin's north side now that Part V units are being completed. As many of the sites in the docklands were developed prior to the introduction of the Planning and Development Act 2000, they have managed to avoid the Part V requirements. However, many more housing units will come on stream over the next 18 months to meet demand. By working closely with Dublin City Council, developers in the area will play an important part in that process.The property services regulatory authority will have responsibility for property management companies, as well as auctioneers, valuers and estate agents. Oversight is needed in respect of these professions.We will eventually reach an agreement to make stage payments an issue of the past in housing estates. It is wrong to introduce legislation at this stage. I am amused to hear the Labour Party jumping up and down and using the words "developer" and "builder" as if they were dirty when the vast majority are indigenous Irish companies which employ large numbers of Irish people. I make no bones about encouraging them and ask the Labour Party why we should not be trying to help the construction industry to employ as many people as it does. The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is taking the correct approach on this issue and the Bill should be withdrawn.
#EamonScanlon	unknown-#EamonScanlon-party	unknown-#EamonScanlon-dob	unknown-#EamonScanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	327	I welcome the Minister of State to the House. As previous speakers have noted, everybody welcomes this Bill because we are all aware of people who have had bad experiences with regard to stage payments. In the 1980s and early 1990s, this was the only way to build a house. People found that difficult because they had to take out full mortgages as well as pay rent. I am glad the Minister of State has reached agreement with CIF on phasing out the stage payment system over the next nine months.I was shocked to hear that the practice is as widespread as it is. I am not aware of it in the north west and apparently it occurs mostly in the south of Ireland. It should be phased out because it is not needed at this stage.Reference was made to affordable houses built under Part V. All former councillors will be aware that this provision cannot be imposed on a site until the area has been zoned. Area plans have been drawn up for small towns and Part V will apply. Some 20% of these developments are designated for affordable housing and a substantial number of houses will become available in the next 18 months. Many affordable housing schemes are under way in Sligo and have proved popular. People who would not qualify for a full mortgage have been able to acquire a house.The county council housing lists are inaccurate. One must be on the county council housing list in order to qualify for rent allowance. Many of those in receipt of rent allowance have no intention of occupying a county council house. They may be building or buying houses. Those who wish to qualify for an improvement in lieu, usually young couples or elderly people whose houses are in bad repair, must also be on the housing list. Perhaps a survey could be done to clarify this. Housing lists could be exaggerated by as much as 50%.I raise the matter of shared ownership on any occasion I can. It has been a beneficial scheme, especially in the north west where one can buy a three bedroom semi-detached house for €170,000. Many couples and young families have purchased such houses, particularly in the past four or five years. Those who bought a house last year now have additional equity of €30,000. This would not have been possible without the shared ownership scheme. However, when one purchases a house under this scheme, the seller may not receive the money until three months after the contract is signed. There should be a system to draw up a contract between the county council and the seller. This would safeguard the property for the buyer. Many people lose out because the process takes too long. Today I dealt with a case that has dragged on for three months. While most sellers are decent people, some will resist selling in this case. I ask the Minister of State to request his officials to examine what can be done in this regard.There were not many apartments in the north west until recently. Management companies are a necessary evil. Who else but a management company will be responsible for the upkeep of the outside of a building? People in Dublin are used to management companies and the system works well. Some have purchased property without realising that fees are payable to management companies. In some cases that may be €400 per year but nothing prevents this from increasing to €1,500 per year. The lack of controls on charges should be examined.
#JohnGerardHanafin	unknown-#JohnGerardHanafin-party	unknown-#JohnGerardHanafin-dob	unknown-#JohnGerardHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	328	Fine Gael's concern was answered in the Minister of State's contribution, which stated:The Department has received a strong commitment to pursue the voluntary phasing out of stage payments from the Construction Industry Federation's branch in Cork, which is the main centre where such payments now occur. In a letter addressed to the Department, it has indicated that its members have made a strong recommendation to the Irish Home Builders Association, IHBA, at national level to the effect that it should immediately enter into discussions with the Department with a view to voluntarily phasing out stage payments within a relatively short timeframe. I understand that this recommendation has been endorsed by the national body of the IHBA and the necessary follow-up arrangements will be put in place without delay.The Government's record on housing is exemplary. House prices have risen considerably and some have attempted to use this as a stick with which to beat the Government. It is a product of our economic success. This Government is committed to ensuring that house prices are affordable. In fact, people may be paying significantly less for mortgages as a percentage of net income than in the 1980s.Another element that must be considered is supply. The land banks accredited with planning permission should be the subject of a "use it or lose it" timeframe. The market has not retrenched in any way but is not as buoyant as before. This was expected because prices could not increase by 15% per annum into the distant future. No tree grows to the sky. The rate of growth may decrease. If there is a threat in the future and affordability is in question, we should place an onus on builders to use available banks or lose the zoning status.The Government's record is exemplary. The total number of houses completed in 2005 is 80,957 units, an increase of 5.2% on 2004 and more than double the amount in 1997. Ireland now produces houses at a rate of 20 per 1,000 residents, the highest rate within the EU and five times the rate of the UK. Almost one third of Irish homes have been built since 1997. We are now building almost three times the number of houses built ten years ago, three times the EU average and six times the UK average.Our focus is on delivering infrastructure such as the extension of the service land initiatives and the more efficient use of housing land. A new housing policy framework, Building Sustainable Communities, was launched in 2005. The framework envisaged a substantial increase in investment, allowing for 50,000 householders to be assisted over the coming three years. There will also be a programme of reforms to improve the quality of the social housing environment. A more detailed document will be published in 2006.While the rate of house price increases is problematic it has moderated considerably since the late 1990s, when price increases peaked at 40% per annum in 1998. According to the ESRI and Permanent TSB house price index, the year on year growth rate to March was 12.1%. Measures announced in budget 2005 helped first-time buyers to purchase their homes by abolishing stamp duty on second hand homes costing up to €317,000 and by reducing rates on homes of up to €625,000 for first-time buyers. First-time buyers save €11,500 on a house costing €308,000.This Government has a good and strong record in ensuring there is affordable housing and ensuring that houses are built. The total capital spending on social and affordable housing output in 2005, including non-Exchequer finance, amounted to €2 billion and assisted in meeting the housing needs of over 13,000 households. This compares with 8,500 households in 1998. The extra capital funding in budget 2006 will allow for some 23,000 new social homes to be commenced between 2006 and 2008 and 15,000 affordable homes to be delivered. In total, 50,000 households will benefit over the coming three years from an Exchequer capital investment package of close to €4 billion.Since 1997, more than 42,000 new social houses have been built either in the local authority or the voluntary co-operative sector and over €7 billion in funding has been provided under a range of social and affordable housing programmes. At the end of 2005 that investment met the needs of some 100,000 households. A total of €1.3 billion is being invested by the Government in housing in 2006. It is anticipated that the needs of over 13,000 households will be met in 2006, including some 5,500 completions under the main local authority programme. A total of 1,850 units will be completed by the voluntary and co-operative sector and there will be a continued focus on the regeneration and delivery of some 3,000 units of affordable housing.Investment in housing under multi-annual plans for 2006 to 2010 will be close to €7 billion. A new agency has been established, the Affordable Homes Partnership, to co-ordinate and give impetus to the delivery of affordable housing in the greater Dublin area, where affordability pressures are greatest. Over 70 sites have been identified so far on State or local authority owned lands. It is estimated that in 2005 up to 1,350 units were provided under the initiative and up to 2,000 will be provided in 2006.While many statistics have been quoted, the figures I have mentioned represent homes for people that were built and provided by this Government on an unprecedented scale. We will continue to work to ensure that people can have affordable homes and that they will have the jobs to afford their homes.

#PaulCoghlan	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-party	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-dob	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	331	I thank the Minister of State and Senators O'Toole, Ryan, Kitt, Brian Hayes, Minihan, Brennan, Brady, Scanlan and Hanafin for contributing to the debate. There is no uniformity with regard to the extent of this payment system but there was uniformity, indeed unanimity, in the speeches about it this evening. Everybody said, in one way or another, that stage payments must end and that they would soon be a thing of the past.However, I am slightly confused. The Minister of State put great emphasis on an agreed approach. I am grateful to the Minister for his letter but I had not received it when I spoke on Second Stage of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Bill. That might not have been the Minister's fault. In any event, I accept the points he makes in that regard. The Minister of State, in both his speech and his letter to me, put great emphasis on the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Bill and its proposals to give a general power to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to make regulations in the area of contracts. The Law Reform Commission report proposed inclusion of a regulation of stage payments in the context of a provision for regulation of terms of contracts.Is the Minister of State placing too much emphasis on this great reforming Minister, as he sees him? I have not been talking to the Minister but Senator O'Toole apparently has been in contact with him. Perhaps on Committee Stage we can examine what can be done. I did not expect to be discussing this Bill again two years later. I am aware from the various discussions I have had with him during the intervening period that the Minister of State has meant well about ending this practice. I do not know what happened in the Department but the Minister is only saying now that he has a letter from a branch of the industry federation about the matter.Given the lack of uniformity throughout this small country, this is something that should not have been tolerated and should have been ended by simple legislation. If this Bill were allowed to proceed to Committee Stage and if something is required legally from a conveyancing or a contract point of view to be included in it, we have indicated that we are prepared to accept from the Minister and the expertise of the Civil Service whatever is required to improve it.All Members who spoke expressed themselves strongly in favour of ending stage payments. Senators Scanlon and Brady mentioned certain bad experiences which they had encountered. Senator Brady spoke about the normal practice in Dublin, where one pays 10% at contract stage and the balance of 90% is not paid until completion and conveyancing of the property. That is standard practice and how it should be done. Not only is the Law Reform Commission in favour of ending stage payments but the auctioneering review group, the Consumers Association, the Law Society and other groups mentioned by the Minister have expressed a strong view on the issue.I wonder if we are trying to confuse ourselves a little. The Minister spoke about the national property services regulatory authority which is to be established by legislation we have yet to see. Again, the Minister is trying to throw it over to somebody whom he considers to be a reforming Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell. However, this is about housing. Certainly there can be an input from Ministers at Cabinet level but it should not thrown on the shoulders of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, no matter how broad they are.I believe the Minister's heart is in the right place on this matter, despite Senator Leyden shaking his head. Let us send the right signal this evening to consumers and house buyers and let this Bill survive to Committee Stage.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	332	Can the Minister give me any reason for not including a fixed time limit? We are told the Bill is of considerable urgency and yet there is no establishment date. It is when the Minister is ready to do so. This is an old issue of mine. I would have thought it would be appropriate to include a date — a maximum of three months, two months or one month. In the case of a body which is urgent, which is limited and focussed, which effectively exists already and which we are only simply putting on a statutory basis, it seems strange that somebody, whether the Minister or the Chief Parliamentary Counsel, insists on leaving this open-ended date for establishment. I would like to hear the Minister's view on it.

In page 7, subsection (1)(d), line 9, after “generally” to insert “, with special emphasis on female participation”.This line should be included in this worthwhile Bill. In sport as in public life, my party is conscious of ensuring female participation.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	335	As Senator Feighan will be aware, one of the stated functions of the authority is to encourage and promote the use of the sports campus by people participating in sport at professional and amateur levels and by members of the public generally. In this context the authority will encourage and promote the use of the campus by a wide variety of groups. This promotion will be targeted at both male and female sportspersons and I am reluctant to make specific reference in legislation to any particular group as this could simply result in tokenism.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	336	I have a couple of questions for the Minister. I may have missed this matter, although I looked through the definitions. Subsection (2) states that the authority may develop and provide on the site such facilities and services of a commercial nature. As there are now so many definitions of commercial, what does that mean? Does it mean that the revenue must exceed the outgoings on an annual basis? Must the authority consider the capital cost and the need to fund capital costing in a discounted fashion, or what? Deciding that something is commercial is not quite as easy as putting two words in a Bill because one must decide whether one will include the capital cost of the project and if one does not, it is effectively running costs that one is paying for. It is probably a pity that there is not a definition of "commercial" in the Bill. Although I have a couple of other questions, they are not connected with this one. I wish to know the Minister's view of what is meant by the term "commercial nature".
#BrendanDaly	unknown-#BrendanDaly-party	unknown-#BrendanDaly-dob	unknown-#BrendanDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	337	Would this authority have any function in the management of projects other than this particular one? For instance, there is an excellent facility in Ennis where a large number of pitches of various kinds and tracks have been put in place, mainly by the local authority. I am sure that especially in many of the cities there would be a necessity for a facility, although perhaps not as all-embracing as the one referred to in the Bill. Under its functions, would this authority have power to organise a similar type of complex, facility or development, for instance, adjacent to Limerick city, Galway or any of the bigger towns?On Sunday there was an open day at the Lee's Road development, of which you are aware, a Chathaoirligh, where there was a significant turnout from the people of the town of Ennis who very much appreciate the funding the Minister gave towards the facility, which is managed and run by the town council. Perhaps an authority like this should have an additional function to move in to areas, not where there are developments such as the one in Ennis but where developments similar to those planned in Abbotstown might be put in place. Would the authority have any function to operate in such situations?
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	338	The specific remit of the authority is to develop a sports campus at Abbotstown, not anywhere else. The reason commercial buildings are mentioned in the context of the campus is that they might be complementary to the campus. For example, the GAA authorities have seen fit to construct a hotel connected to the Croke Park stadium. In the same way, it might be necessary for the authority to construct such a building. The objective is not to depend on the Exchequer or any other body for funding at any time. The objective must be to ensure the campus is run as economically as possible. Provision should, therefore, be made in the legislation for the construction of commercial properties.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	339	That is not what I asked the Minister. Does "commercial" mean the developments mentioned in section 7(2)(a) would have to be entirely self-financing? For instance, would the developers have to include the cost of the site in their budgets? Would they pay the market value for the site and fund the capital cost or would such projects be regarded as commercial as long as revenue exceeded expenditure? Perhaps a definition of “commercial” should be inserted, otherwise it is up to the campus authority to decide what is meant by it. I hope the Minister might clarify that.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	340	The private sector has never been excluded from the Abbotstown development and it will not be under the legislation. It was agreed that it might be possible for a commercially minded organisation to go on site and, for example, make an offer that would be sufficiently attractive to construct an indoor arena. That may happen but I do not know because it is impossible to say. However, the possibility of transferring a site for a certain consideration to a commercial organisation is not excluded under the legislation and that would not be desirable. It is my preference that the authority should own and run the facility but I am not excluding the possibility of the private sector coming in. If that happens, it will be done in the judgment of the authority, having due regard to all the commercial factors and the need to develop the campus sensibly. However, what I envisage by "commercial" in this context is a commercial outlet that would be complementary to the campus and that is why I instanced a hotel.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	341	The Minister did not answer my question about what "commercial" means, which is a pity. For example, the Railway Procurement Agency claimed the Luas made a profit last year. While its revenue exceeded its expenditure, the agency did not include the €700 million capital cost of the infrastructure. As I try to educate young engineers, that is not a profit.I am a little concerned about section 7(2)(d), which states “make arrangements with any person, on such terms and conditions as it considers appropriate, for the provision to it by that person of financial assistance (whether by 30 way of the provision of funds or the undertaking of works) for the development...”. What does that mean? Will the Minister explain the necessity for this provision?
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	342	An individual or individuals may wish to make a donation to construct a facility on site. For example, Mr. McManus decided to contribute £50 million to the construction of a national stadium but that fell through when the stadium did not proceed at Abbotstown. Other generous, public spirited people may wish to make a contribution and, in those circumstances, it makes perfect sense for the authority to make an arrangement with them for financial assistance for the development or provision of facilities or services or both on the campus and, in certain circumstances, the use by them of those facilities and services. In other words, while the authority has the responsibility of developing the campus, I am not seeking to inhibit it from entering into arrangements that might be beneficial to the campus. I am trying to ensure the authority has as much latitude as possible to construct the campus and ancillary buildings that might be required for the overall benefit of the campus.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	343	Section 7(7) states, "The Minister may approve, with such modifications (if any) as he or she considers appropriate, a plan submitted to him or her by the Authority...". Does the Bill make provision to prevent the Minister modifying the plans in a way that might affect their viability by increasing the authority's expenditure while reducing its revenue? If the Minister is seeking the power to amend the authority's plans, he or she should take responsibility for the additional costs he or she imposes. The Minister cannot issue an edict to the authority to do something, which increases its expenditure by 50%, without taking responsibility for the increase. If the Minister wishes to make amendments, he or she should be responsible for the costs that result.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	344	The Minister is responsible for the costs. The Government has agreed to provide €119 million in the Estimates over the next four or five years. That will be contained in the capital envelope of my Department following negotiations with the Minister for Finance, who has been very helpful and forthcoming in the construction of the first phase of the campus. There is no power for the Minister to make amendments to plans provided by the authority but it is only right that he or she should approve its plans when, ultimately, he or she is accountable to the Houses of the Oireachtas for the funding concerned. When the funding comes from the public purse, it makes perfect sense for the Minister to have a role in the approval of the plans because they must be drafted within budget. They cannot exceed the budget because the Minister might not have obtained the necessary funding from the Minister for Finance in his or her capital envelope to enable plans that run are over budget to be put in place.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	345	We are at cross purposes. If significant public funds are due to be expended, nobody will dispute the Minster should have the final say but the issue is modification of the plans. Has provision been made to prevent a Minister modifying plans under section 7(3), 7(4) and 7(5) in a way that could increase the expenditure of the authority and reduce its revenue? I have no problems with the Minister approving the authority's plans because he or she is the principal funder but I have a problem with the authority drafting a plan based on its estimate of its income and expenditure and the Minister modifying it so that it affects the income or expenditure in a negative fashion.I want to know why there is not an amendment to the effect that if the Minister makes modifications which increase the cost to the authority, the Minister must then fund them. It is a standard complaint on the part of many public bodies that they get increasing amounts of work from Ministers without matching funds. Every local authority in the country will scream blue murder about the degree to which its remit, but not its budget, has been extended.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	346	There is no provision in the legislation to allow the Minister to make additional funding available to provide for modifications which he or she might make because there is no provision in the legislation which would allow the Minister to make such modifications.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	347	In that case, what does section 7(7) mean?
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	348	It means that the Minister approves the plans which are submitted under sections 7(3),7(4) or 7(5). Section 7(4) specifically provides that while the authority can amend the plan, if it does so, the plan must be resubmitted to the Minister for approval.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	349	I have one further question. While I am not trying to be awkward, to a considerable extent this constitutes the nub of the Bill. I am surprised there is no definition of the term "campus" anywhere and one could end up with all sorts of complications in this regard. Section 7(9) defines "sports campus" as a campus of facilities for sporting activities. Although the fact that I had time to consult a dictionary it is probably a sad reflection on my life, I did so. The dictionary definition of "campus" is the grounds of a school, college, university or hospital.I can imagine the befuddlement of their lordships and ladyships in the courts if this legislation ever comes before them and if they will be obliged to work out what the term "campus" means and what the Oireachtas meant by it. It would have been quite simple to include a definition of the term "campus" which essentially constituted a description of the activities under discussion here. It is a pity there is no such definition. Alternatively, I may have missed it.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	350	There is no definition of a sports campus in the legislation. I am sure that a thesaurus or the Oxford dictionary will provide ample examples. If that fails, I presume there must be much legal authority available to precisely define what constitutes a sports campus.
#FrankFeighan	unknown-#FrankFeighan-party	unknown-#FrankFeighan-dob	unknown-#FrankFeighan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	351	I move amendment No. 2:
In page 9, lines 16 to 19, to delete subsection (3) and substitute the following new subsection:"(3) Of the members of the Council, no fewer than 6 of their number shall be men and no fewer than 6 of their number shall be women.".Fine Gael believes there should be gender balance on the council and that no fewer than six of its members shall be men and no fewer than six shall be women. As this is a new board, Fine Gael feels that balance would be required in this respect. I hope the Minister will take this on board.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	352	Section 9(3) provides that the Minister shall, in so far as is practicable and having regard to the relevant experience of the persons concerned, ensure an equitable balance between men and women in the composition of the authority. I have reflected on the issues raised by Senator Feighan and while I agree with the thrust of his proposal, I will not accept his amendment.However, I am extremely keen to include a greater number of women on State boards. I recognise there are a number of very successful women in the field of sport, business and finance, who could bring a wealth of experience to the operation of a national sports campus development authority. I fully intend to avail of the knowledge and capacity that such people could bring to the board or authority. At present, as the Senator is aware, it is Government policy that membership of State boards should have a target of 40% female participation. It is my intention to meet that target because I recognise the impact gender balance can bring to the operation of boards.However, I must note that sometimes difficulties have been encountered even in meeting the present target. The present wording of section 9(3) refers to "an equitable balance". This is a phrasing which permits what the Senator sought and more, while simultaneously leaving some flexibility to allow for a practical solution and to avoid binding a Minister who may find that he or she is without a sufficient pool of suitable candidates of either gender. The alternative proposed by this amendment is overly prescriptive.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	353	I have a couple of questions in respect of section 9 regarding some points which confused me. Perhaps I am easily confused. Section 9(10) uses the phrase "a person shall be disqualified for holding and shall cease to hold office". I appreciate the sensitivity of the draftspeople in recent years because at one time this clause would have included bankrupts, criminals and Members of the Oireachtas as the three excluded categories. At least membership of the Oireachtas is dealt with separately. I must admit to taking offence when it was included in the same section. Obviously, someone has responded to my sensitivities and has decided to put it in a separate section to avoid the implication that these were three different categories of the same kind of sinner.However, section 9(10) does not make it clear as to whether a member of the authority will be disqualified if he or she is adjudged bankrupt or to meet any of the other specified conditions, or whether someone who has been so adjudged can never be a member of the authority. There are different categories of people in this regard. I am unsure whether anyone who is convicted of an indictable offence in respect of a company should ever be allowed to be a member of a body which deals with public money. On the other hand, if people have the misfortune to be obliged to make an arrangement with creditors in business at some stage in their lives, this should not exclude them forever from participation in such boards.Ireland claims to be a country in which risk-taking meets with approval and sometimes business ventures go wrong and decent honest people must make arrangements with their creditors. It ought not to be something which remains on their record forever. Hence, can the Minister clarify whether the specified conditions are simply disqualifications for people once they have been appointed, or do they apply to anyone who has ever suffered any of these various embarrassments?
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	354	Unfortunately, it applies if a person has ever suffered any of these embarrassments, to use Senator Ryan's phrase. Incidentally, these are standard provisions which are included in a considerable number of Acts of the Oireachtas and beyond. The situation is as outlined by the Senator.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	355	Section 10(1) states, "the Authority shall hold such and so many meetings as may be necessary for the performance of its functions". Although I read through section 10, I did not find any minimum number of meetings. I may have missed it, as I do not claim to be the world's greatest authority on these matters. It seems strange that the board would not be obliged to have some meetings. I understand that in company law, there must be some requirement to the effect that boards of directors must meet for a minimum number of times per year. However, I do not retain the entirety of Irish company law in my head.Is there a reason for this absence, or is it an omission? If it is the latter, will the Minister consider an amendment on Report Stage? I suggest that three of four meetings annually would be a reasonable minimum. However, the idea that the board would only be obliged to meet once a year or once every few years appears strange.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	356	I am afraid that I must rely on the good sense of the chairperson and members of the authority to run the authority. If the members and board of the authority do not run the authority in a business-like, sufficient and efficient manner, it would clearly be open to the Minister of the day to move in and resolve the problem. I do not envisage a situation whereby people would be appointed as chairperson and members of the authority and would then decide not to have any meetings. It is best to leave such matters open to the board members and to the chairperson in particular.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	357	I disagree with the Minister and Members should set some minimum standard in this respect. Four times a year would constitute a reasonable minimum figure. Aside from this Bill, I must engage in further research in this regard. I find this to be an invitation to a domineering chief executive to minimise the role of the board, especially if the chief executive and chairman came to a convenient arrangement. While I do not imply improper behaviour, it would be very convenient for a domineering chief executive to minimise the number of meetings and consequently the input of the board.Moreover, there is nothing that a member of the board can do about this. I can see no provision to allow members of the board to call a meeting against the wishes of the chairman. There is no provision for them to hold a minimum number of meetings. I do not raise these points to be awkward, but as constructive suggestions in respect of how such agencies should perform their business, according to minimum standards of what I regard as good corporate governance.

Should it fail to do so it will be in breach of its statutory duty and all of the consequences which follow would come into play.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	359	I compliment the Minister. I may have missed this before but section 13(7) is the first time I have come across the provision that a chief executive shall not take up particular types of employment for 12 months after ceasing to be chief executive. It is a welcome development although I would prefer 24 months. People in such bodies or Government advisers should not be able to move seamlessly from one position to another, where they can use information, however carefully or properly they do so. While I compliment the Minister, I ask that he be more demanding in the future.

#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	364	I, like everyone else, am aware of the perpetual talk about the alleged pensions time bomb that is ahead of our children if not ourselves. I am not sure life expectancy will stretch that far. This Bill does not seem to provide for any equivalence to public service pensions. The scheme will be approved by the Ministers for Arts, Sport and Tourism and Finance. It could be a defined payment scheme and need not necessarily be a defined benefit scheme. It could have far more onerous conditions than currently exist for public servants or people in other State bodies. Will the Minister elaborate on this matter? I have seen it in other recent Bills. I am unhappy we might be at the thin end of a wedge to reduce the pension schemes available in quasi-State bodies with a view to moving on to the public sector generally.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	365	The scheme to which the Senator refers will be devised in due course. Section 15 deals with the superannuation of the staff of the authority and the powers of the authority in that regard. Incidentally, it is standard practice for an agency of this type to prepare and operate superannuation schemes in respect of its staff. It occurs in the Irish Sports Council Act 1999, where specific provision is made and it has worked quite well. I am sure the same will occur here.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	366	Section 16 deals with the disclosure of interests, which is becoming standardised. It never used to be included in Bills such as this. I do not have major objections to it, except for section 16(3), which states:A person shall not be regarded as having a beneficial interest in, or material to, any matter by reason only that he or she or any company or other body or person mentioned in subsection (2) has an interest which is so remote or insignificant that it cannot reasonably be regarded as likely to influence a person in considering or discussing, or in voting on, any question in respect of the matter or in performing any function in relation to the matter.I would prefer an objective test to the quasi-subjective judgment of the authority. I know this is not easy, and I do not have a problem with the concept. However, it is the type of ambiguity which leaves open the real possibility of considerable conflict if somebody has to make a judgment on whether an interest was minor or major.When the Minister was in the House yesterday, I stated I would not mention greyhounds and I will not mention them today either. However, suggestions were made that conflicts of interest arose in that controversy. The person about whom it was suggested was quite dismissive. He believed the interest was remote or insignificant. Many other people would not agree with him. I only use it as an example. If an objective test were not to be included, at least the judgment should be made by somebody outside the loop of the authority.

It provides that the disclosure requirements cover members of the authority or a committee, staff members, directors or staff of a subsidiary, consultants and advisers. It also specifically provides that where such a person has a monetary or other beneficial interest in the matter under consideration by the authority, it must be disclosed and the interest holder must not be involved in dealing with the matter by influencing in the decision or partaking in a discussion at a meeting.As far as I am concerned, this is a standard provision which, for example, applies to local authority members at local authority meetings, meetings of its sub-committees or constituent bodies. In the same way, it applies at Cabinet. We must be reasonable and decide whether a matter is, in the eyes of a reasonable person, so remote as not to affect the issue involved. It is not really possible to set in stone an objective benchmark against which one can measure whether a matter is so remote as to affect one's judgment or interest.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	368	Nobody is arguing with the basic thrust of this section. However, it seems it would be a lot easier if the judgment were made by an individual such as the Ombudsman, secretary to the Government or another person or body who would be in a position to make an objective judgment. Under section 16(6) the Minister can deal severely with somebody where he comes to the conclusion that he or she contravened these sections on disclosure. A person could have legitimately concluded that under section 16(3) there was no reason to do anything about it and the Minister could come to a different conclusion under section 16(6) and deal severely with a person who made a mistake.It would be more useful to have an objective independent way of making a judgment on this. We will have a situation whereby various State agencies have different interpretations of this and contradictory positions. I offer this helpfully for future consideration. I will not make a major fuss about it. However, I believe it is ambiguous.What is the significance of section 16(8)? I do not carry the Companies Act in my head. I gather the non-application of section 194 of that Act must have significance.

The test of reasonableness is successfully applied in tort and other areas of civil law all the time by judges. The test of reasonableness is even applied in the criminal law where a person must be found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. If it can be used as a determinant in murder cases, I feel sure it can be used as a determinant or benchmark when dealing with the question of whether an individual was obliged to disclose a certain fact or issue.Section 194 of the Companies Act deals with the duty of a director to disclose his interest in contracts, transactions or arrangements in the company in which he is involved. This Bill provides for disclosure in respect of the director of a subsidiary and therefore the application of section 194 is not required. Thus, the same disclosure regime applies to a member of the authority or a committee, a member of staff of the authority or a subsidiary or a consultant or adviser engaged by the authority.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	372	That the authority should define what is confidential is a bad idea. I have said this about every Bill I have dealt with in this House. We ought to have an objective test of what is confidential because different bodies come to different conclusions. Coillte, for instance, which is a publicly owned organisation, keeps insisting that it is not and is therefore not bound by the obligations of transparency by which public bodies are bound. It claims to be a private organisation, which it manifestly is not. Its interpretation of its own confidentiality is different from that of other agencies which believe they are bound by the reasonable rules of disclosure.On the issue of disclosure, I have long held the view that we ought to have some objective test so matters that are not covered by the Freedom of Information Act should, by definition, be regarded as confidential. Instead, we have circumstances in which anything the authority says is confidential is confidential. This is a bit like the circumstances in  Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland.

Section 23 brings the authority under the terms of the Freedom of Information Act. It would be quite unusual and inappropriate for me to introduce a confessor for the authority.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	374	I did not believe the Minister would.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	375	Amendments Nos. 2a, 2b and 2c are related and may be discussed together.
#FrankFeighan	unknown-#FrankFeighan-party	unknown-#FrankFeighan-dob	unknown-#FrankFeighan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	376	I move amendment No. 2a:In page 16, subsection (1)(d), line 17, to delete “elected or co-opted as a member of a local authority,”.Over the years, certainly under the dual mandate, it was felt that if people were worthy enough to be elected to a local authority or city council, they should be able to act as members of boards. Amendment No. 2b seeks to delete “or a member of a local authority” in lines 33 and 34, and amendment No. 2c seeks to delete paragraph (c) in lines 44 and 45.We must strike a balance. There seems to be much more emphasis than there was heretofore on excluding members of local authorities from committees or boards such as those under discussion. I would not call this politically correct. They often have a very deep knowledge of how the system works and possess common sense. Not everybody would be acceptable on a board. Most people on the boards in question will be interested in sport and will be from a business background, but not too many people, other than those with a local authority background, will have a deep knowledge of how the system works. I was on a many boards and in a chamber of commerce before I became involved in politics but discovered that being a member of a local authority gave me the desired vision and knowledge. The deletions I propose should be made.
#MauriceCummins	unknown-#MauriceCummins-party	unknown-#MauriceCummins-dob	unknown-#MauriceCummins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	377	I spoke at length on Second Stage on the subject covered by the three amendments. Local authority members should not be excluded from the boards. It seems the Parliamentary Counsel has included their exclusion as a matter of course. On two occasions, a Minister has agreed with what we said on this matter on this side of the House. One Minister decided local authority members should be included and, in the other case, a Minister of State said he would sleep on the matter for the night. However, he obviously slept on it the wrong way because he disagreed. It is one-all at this stage and we are in extra time. We are depending on the Minister to accept these amendmentsLocal authority members may have a vast pool of knowledge in the areas in question and they should certainly not be excluded from membership of the authority. The ball is in the Minister's court and we hope he will accept the amendments.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	378	There are clearly good reasons to require Members of the Oireachtas or the European Parliament not to be members of the authority given that it is ultimately accountable to the Minister and the Oireachtas. However, there is no such relationship of accountability between the authority and local authorities and therefore the logic does not apply. There is no logic to excluding local authority members other than that somebody in the Office of the Chief Parliamentary Counsel has got it into his or her head that the exclusion ought to be extended to them. That is the first reason I support Senator Feighan's amendment.The second reason concerns special policy committees, which now have significant influence on local authority policy-making. A member of a special policy committee who is not a local authority member could end up a member of the authority while the people who stick their necks out at elections and are elected to a local authority, as opposed to being appointed to special policy committee by some voluntary organisation, could not. This is not fair. It puts another obstacle in the way of people who get elected.I have great regard for anybody who gets elected in a competitive election. Campaigning is never a pleasant task, be it for a local election in which one requires 100 votes, a presidential election in which one might require 500,000 or a European Parliament election, in which one might need 80,000. I was in the latter category but got 20,000. Those who contest elections do not deserve always to be denigrated by the Parliamentary Counsel.I support the amendments. Senator Cummins stated some Ministers agree to such amendments and others do not. Perhaps the present Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, will choose to agree. The Dáil will be in session for another week and it would not take long to sort out the Bill in that House.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	379	There is no intention to denigrate the role of any person in public life. The proposed amendments would have the effect of removing the intended prohibition on members of local authorities, as individuals, becoming members of the boards of the authority. It has been argued that there is no express legal impediment to the appointment of members of local authorities but, in this instance, there are good reasons their exclusion should apply.I understand Senators' concerns that members of local authorities should be allowed sit on boards. Excluding local authority members from acting in or being members of those boards is becoming an established provision of late and is being included in legislation establishing other State agencies. There are several examples of that — the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, the Health Act 2004, the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act 2003, the Taxi Regulation Act 2003 — but I accept that in itself is not an argument for saying local authority members should not sit on the board of the authority. Everybody would agree, however, that public agencies which are established to carry out specific functions must be seen to be in a position to act independently of Government, both local and central, where that applies.The responsibility of the National Sports Campus Development Authority relates to capital development and its function is one that will impinge on areas that are the responsibility of certain local authorities. For example, the planning authority of Fingal County Council would be directly involved in the development process. In the circumstances, it would not be appropriate that either Members of the Oireachtas or local authority members would sit on the board. We are in an era of transparency and accountability like never before and it is important that the board of the authority be seen to be independent and not perceived as representing any interest group. Indeed, a steering group has been set up at Abbotstown in regard to further developments there. The steering group is engaging largely with the residents and the local authority. In those circumstances, people will understand why I am not anxious to have local authority members included in the board of the authority.During the course of the debate, Senators questioned whether the debarring from State boards of Members of the Oireachtas and European Parliament and members of local authorities is a reflection of a lack of trust in such people. I repeat that nothing could be further from the truth. My own opinion is that local authority representatives are a fine body of men and women gifted with a great deal of knowledge and expertise who work hard in the public interest for little or no financial reward. I accept that.I emphasise that the matter at issue here is not one of trust but the avoidance of any conflict of interest or any appearance of board members being selected in the spirit of any kind of political favour. From time to time all members of boards will have difficult decisions to take. It is desirable that such decision making arises from the best interests of the State body involved and that the board members are not conflicted by the need to serve any political interest, irrespective of that interest.For all the reasons I have outlined I do not in this instance believe it would be good practice to appoint members of local authorities to the authority. It might be best if the Sports Campus Development Authority were removed from the political sphere in so far as that is possible. I have been Minister for sport for four years and one thing I have learned well is that sport and politics do not mix.
#FrankFeighan	unknown-#FrankFeighan-party	unknown-#FrankFeighan-dob	unknown-#FrankFeighan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	380	If, to use the Minister's example, a member of Fingal County Council had a conflict of interest, he or she could be excused from any voting by the board. I am sure the chairperson would ensure the criteria was in place to allow that. I ask the Minister to look at this amendment with a view to including local authority members on the board. This is a serious issue. The Sports Campus Development Authority would benefit from the influence of local authority members and would not result in the doomsday scenario the Minister outlined.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	381	I am intrigued that members of local authorities are being excluded because they might have a conflict of interest but business people could be on the authority who could end up, perfectly legitimately, doing business with the authority and who would have to declare their interest and remove themselves from the decision making process. The Minister appears to be saying that is okay because that is the way the world works but if local authority people were in that position they could not be trusted. Effectively, that is what the Minister is saying. Somebody who owned land the authority intended to compulsorily acquire could be a member of the authority. I am not suggesting it would be deliberate but people who owned land the local authority intended to acquire, either compulsorily or by commercial purchase, could be members of the authority. They would have to declare their interest and withdraw, which is fair enough, but apparently a local authority member cannot be trusted to do that in the rare event of a planning application. If the Minister is concerned about Fingal he should refer to members of Fingal County Council in the Bill if that is the issue.The issue is that somebody somewhere, in the wonderful way in which legislation evolves, has now developed a standard section and it is included in all legislation unless somebody stands up and creates a row early on, and then it is left out. By and large, it goes into every item of legislation and it is not fair or right. It is totally different to exclude what are by and large full-time, professional politicians from the Dáil, Seanad and European Parliament but it is wrong to exclude members of, say, Athy Town Council, my home town. To suggest that somebody who attends a meeting of Athy Town Council once a month for two hours, does some local work around the place and who gets 120 votes in a local election is by virtue of that fact excluded from membership of a body such as this authority is entirely disproportionate and is using the classic sledge-hammer to crack a nut.There is a rational argument for Oireachtas Members and Members of the European Parliament to be excluded. This is no more than a reflex response somewhere in the drafting process which has stretched this out to include members of local authorities. The Minister could have specified Dublin City Council or the local authorities in the area but it is wrong to suggest that the members of Athy Town Council, elected by 120 votes once every five years, have some potential level of conflict of interest as might be the case with a prominent business person. I have no problems about people of business acumen being on this authority. This is a reflex response which has become part of standard legislation. In his previous incarnation, this Minister was the sort of person who would have done something about that.

The Government has committed €119 million to phase 1 but I envisage subsequent Governments, irrespective of their political make-up, to continue the construction of a campus at Abbotstown until such a time as we have a world-class network of facilities. In other words, I liken this to a necklace where the first few pearls are being put in. I anticipate that the complete necklace will take several years and that future Governments will complete the necklace. The result will be a sports campus which will be the equivalent of anything to be seen in the world. Ireland will be in a proud position as a result which will allow it host the most elaborate and the biggest international sporting events. That is what I see in terms of the vision for Abbotstown.Throughout the process there will be engagement with local authorities because they are central to the planning process. That is what we are involved with here. I could not possibly make a provision to exclude certain local authorities. The reality is that I do not know what population configurations will look like in the future, what shape demographics will take or what decisions will be made by future Governments as regards the boundaries of any local authority. I cannot make my mind up on those questions because I do not have the necessary information and neither has anybody else.In the circumstances I believe people will understand why local authority members are being excluded. We are talking about a statutory authority where there is potential conflict of interest ab initio. I just cannot differentiate in the manner that Senator Ryan has suggested. Again, this is a major capital project to which local authorities are central. In other words, a central role exists because of the crucial decisions they make.
#FrankFeighan	unknown-#FrankFeighan-party	unknown-#FrankFeighan-dob	unknown-#FrankFeighan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	383	Members of local authorities increasingly deal with ever-growing budgets. They seem to be capable and the Government and everyone else is aware of the multi-million euro development plans they deal with, between waste management plans etc. If the public accepts that elected local authority members are capable of taking control and dealing efficiently with a multi-million euro industry, they are capable of sitting on this board and making the right decisions.Since I entered politics, I have never seen any conflict of interest on any side of the political divide. This debate is about the right of public representatives to be on this board. We are falling for the public and indeed media perceptions sometimes aired that no politician is capable of doing the right job and cannot be trusted. Any time I have sat on VECs, etc., I was very proud of all my colleagues regardless of their political affiliations, because they always made the right decisions. The only time, however, I felt that a decision of the wrong nature was made was when there were people within the system with their own ideology and political favouritism.We are losing sight of who is elected. People elect politicians and local authority members to make the right decisions. One now sees people in unelected positions taking the serious decisions in health boards and on public bodies right across the country. They are accountable to nobody. At least politicians are accountable to their peers and to the electorate. I am pressing this amendment.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	384	I am at a loss. I know this Minister a long time and he is one of the more agreeable members of the Government. We have snarled at each other on occasions, but he is still one of the more agreeable ones. I am astonished that he says there is no way of drafting this. He could, for instance, put into this section, "entitled under the standing orders of the local authority from which the Authority would seek planning permission" and exclude those members if he wants to. I am not sure where the Office of the Chief Parliamentary Counsel is or whether it exists. It reminds me of Harry Potter sometimes. I think one has to get on platform 9b to find it. However, I gather it exists and somebody there picked the moment when local authority members were getting a rough time at tribunals and decided this was the time to stick in this provision. I do not accept it, but there is some argument as regards Fingal or whatever county council.. To suggest, however, that a member of Athy Town Council — I happen to know that town fairly well — who is otherwise qualified, competent and perhaps potentially very good, should be excluded is entirely disproportionate. To suggest that somebody the Minister appoints to this authority and wants to do some work in the local area either as an independent or as a member of a political party should automatically disqualify himself or herself from membership of an authority like this or any equivalent body, is disproportionate also. I believe this was sprung on the Minister, it is late in the year and should not be pursued any further.

#BrendanDaly	unknown-#BrendanDaly-party	unknown-#BrendanDaly-dob	unknown-#BrendanDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	387	In section 18, I accept the Minister's explanation why he felt it necessary to exclude members of local authorities from membership of this authority. It might be important to have local authority members on bodies such as this because there would be a link between what the authority is doing in the locality and what the local authority is doing. In Ennis, the local authority has been involved in the provision of sports facilities with State funding. It would be in the best interests of such authorities to have a democratic input from an elected representative on such an authority. For those two reasons it would be important that careful consideration be given to excluding members of local authorities who would have the benefit of being democratically elected to local authorities and bring a democratic view to an authority, which it might not have otherwise.Under another section of the Bill, the chief executive can be called before Oireachtas committees. While Members of the Oireachtas can make their input here on Oireachtas committees, members of local authorities cannot do so. While I accept what the Minister has said in this case, in future we should consider that it might be desirable to have a link between a local authority member and this authority or to have a democratic input into such meetings.

However, in future he should consider local authority members who have considerable experience at various levels in communities. It is important not to exclude them from such boards. They are democratically elected and are entitled to be considered for many such boards.

We have voiced this concern on a number of recent Bills. Unfortunately we have not yet determined the issue. As Senators Daly and Kieran Phelan have said, people involved in local or national politics have often excelled in other fields, such as business, sport, etc. Many of them would bring the acumen to such a board——

There is no exclusion, for example, for county managers or senior civil servants, who may be taken away to carry out duties such as this, often neglecting responsibilities they have at local level. This exclusion should not be in the Bill. I feel very strongly about the matter——

Like other Senators I feel the provision is unfair, particularly on local authority members. I do not believe Oireachtas Members or Members of the European Parliament should have an entitlement or an expectation to be on boards or authorities. As the Minister outlined yesterday, it is recognised that there is a conflict of interest, particularly when the annual report is laid before the Houses and is addressed at committees. Local authority members——

I want to recognise the Minister's desire on this matter. I had the opportunity to speak to him outside the House on the matter and I recognise the difficulties in trying to bring the Bill back through the Dáil. If this legislation needs to be amended at any stage in the future for any other reason, consideration should be given to amending this section to allow local authority members be considered for appointment to the board.

I accept and recognise the Minister's point of view on the matter. Like Senator Dooley, I ask that at a later stage we might reconsider the section. While I accept the Bill will be passed, we may get another chance to remove such a provision from all legislation. The wording is standard in all legislation going through the House. The Minister's colleagues in other Departments have heard the same objections on other Bills. It is the same old mantra. However, it is about accountability. The section deprives local authority members——

#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	415	I again register my disagreement with section 20(5) which stipulates that when appearing before the Committee of Public Accounts, the chief executive "shall not question or express an opinion on the merits of any policy of the Government or a Minister of the Government or on the merits of the objectives of such a policy". This is another of those standard clauses that is inserted in all Bills. It represents the most extraordinarily defensive position. The Minister spoke eloquently earlier about the need for an authority with a board that was immune from political pressure. He wanted people of talent and ability, presumably including the chief executive.When appearing before the Committee of Public Accounts the chief executive may be asked why the authority spent money on X rather than on Y. The reason may be that the Minister used powers available to him or her to tell the authority to do so. However, the chief executive cannot tell the committee that. If he or she does so, he or she cannot say why or whether he or she agreed with the decision. If the Government makes the authority spend money in one direction rather that in another and the chief executive is asked whether he or she approved of the expenditure, he or she is bound by law to silence. He or she may not express an opinion on the merits of any policy of the Government or a Minister of the Government or on the merits of the objectives of such a policy.What in God's name are we doing? We are hamstringing the chief executive. We all know that Departments are not particularly fond of the Committee of Public Accounts. It is a very effective committee and by tradition or law it is chaired by an Opposition Deputy. It is a committee with considerable powers and is constitutionally based. We are effectively trying to stymie the effectiveness of the Committee of Public Accounts. It is of no concern to the Seanad as Senators are not members of the committee for obvious constitutional reasons.The subsection is unnecessary. The CEOs of most State bodies are fairly diplomatic and do not need an injunction of this intensity to make them chose their words with care. I understand why Fianna Fáil backbenchers are disaffected, given that they must express their views on section 18 in the Seanad rather than at a parliamentary party meeting.

That has never been the case in the history of the State. It should be remembered that the chief executive in this instance is a public servant and has the role of implementing rather than creating or inspiring Government policy. It would be entirely inappropriate for a chief executive as envisaged here to go before an Oireachtas committee to declaim on Government policy because, if that was to happen, he or she would become a political football whose opinions on the Government would be quoted here, there and everywhere. If we pursued the line proposed by Senator Ryan, we would demean our public servants.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	417	The chief executive and the chairman of Dublin Airport Authority have made it clear that they disagree with the Government's policy of making Cork and Shannon Airports free of debt. If they came before an Oireachtas committee, they would be precluded from expressing their dissent, yet they can outline their opinions in a press conference with RTE. Given the Minister's understanding of the need for precise language, it is extraordinary that he juxtaposed civil and public servants. These are not civil servants because if they were, a special clause on superannuation would not be needed in the Bill. They are public servants who are supposed to run a commercial operation, subject to generous public funding. It is nonsense to suggest that the sky will fall in if they express their opinion.The chief executive of Aer Lingus demanded the privatisation of the company long before the Government got around to making a decision on the issue. He made his opinion known to Oireachtas committees. We will not silence the CEOs of bodies such as this but they will not be allowed to air their views before the Committee of Public Accounts. That is ironic because a CEO is not prohibited from expressing an opinion on the merits of Government policy before another Oireachtas committee.Until the Government began to fall apart about six months ago, I expected logic from it. A prohibition on dealings with the Committee of Public Accounts without similar prohibitions in respect of other Oireachtas committees suggests a lack of thought. Clauses such as this are stuck into Bills because somebody thinks it a good idea to do so. I have no more to say except that I suspect the Minister would agree it is rubbish.

There is no question but that the CEO would thereby become a political football to the detriment of the authority or company concerned.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	419	I move amendment No. 3:
In page 18, subsection (1), line 9, to delete "general administration of the".Section 21 states, "The Chief Executive shall, at the request in writing of an Oireachtas Committee, attend before it to give account for the general administration of the Authority as may be required by the Committee". The phrase "general administration" is meaningless and I propose that it be deleted. The phrase may be intended to preclude detailed analysis of the kind demanded by the Department of Finance. Unless the Minister can convince me otherwise, I consider my amendment to be reasonable.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	420	The amendment would have the effect of making the chief executive of the authority answerable to Oireachtas committees on matters pertaining to the authority rather than the more limited definition in the section as it currently stands. Section 13(3) sets out the chief executive's responsibilities as carrying out, managing and controlling generally the administration and business of the authority and performing such functions as may be determined by the authority. It is not proposed to accept this amendment because to do so would put the chief executive in the unacceptable position of having to account to an Oireachtas committee for matters which are outside his or her area of responsibility and might create the risk of the chief executive being drawn into expressing an opinion on Government or ministerial policy on the authority before a committee. That would not be appropriate or desirable for the reasons I outlined earlier.On the wider remit of the objectives and operation of the authority, the board of the authority is responsible to the Minister and, furthermore, the Minister is responsible to the Houses of the Oireachtas and may appear before the relevant committees to give an account of matters pertaining to the authority.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	421	Now I know I am right. Presumably the term "general administration" refers the running of a body. The Minister is not fond of definitions but "administration" has many meanings, including management, organisation, staffing and planning. I see no reason to withdraw the amendment.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	422	I move amendment No. 4:
In page 18, between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following new subsection:"(2) The Authority shall be accountable to the Oireachtas and shall subscribe to a code of practice to be agreed with the Minister, which shall include provision that the Authority shall give a substantive reply within 7 days to any written question submitted by a member of the Houses of the Oireachtas.".The idea that the authority has a commitment to respond quickly to questions from Members of the Oireachtas had, according to Deputy Wall, been agreed to in principle. The process and procedures had not been clearly agreed. This arises from the frustration Members have with the HSE and its inability to deal with queries in a timescale that may make a difference to people's lives. A question that would take three days to be answered when submitted as a parliamentary question takes three months when submitted to the HSE. My party colleague raised this matter with the Minister and this amendment represents our attempt to rectify the situation in legislation. I look forward to the Minister's reply and his proposal to ensure queries from Members are dealt with in an efficient fashion. Seven days is more than twice the amount of time it took the allegedly inefficient Civil Service — which is in fact extremely efficient — to reply to a written question tabled in the Dáil.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	423	I am sympathetic to the thrust of this amendment because, in the interests of democracy, we have an interest in ensuring availability of information to Members of the Oireachtas. I expect the new authority to reply quickly, effectively and efficiently. The requirement that the authority produce a substantive answer to any written question submitted by Members of the Oireachtas within seven days would pose an administrative burden on a very small administration. The best way to deal with this issue is through the customer charter of the authority rather than specifying such matters in legislation. This is an organisational matter and I recommend to the authority that it includes in its customer charter a commitment to respond to all requests for information in the speediest manner possible and not later than 15 working days, providing the information requested is available to the authority within the time specified.I would not be satisfied if authorities under my aegis would not reply to all communications speedily. I would take it up with agencies concerned if this happened. If this body procrastinates in dealing with requests for information the matter will be dealt with in future legislation. I cannot accept the amendment.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	424	Can the Minister indicate why the chief executive would not be in a position to question or express an opinion on the merits of any policy of the Government if he or she was called before an Oireachtas committee? He or she is forbidden to do so in appearing before the Committee of Public Accounts. What is it in section 21 that means he or she is not free to state whatever he wishes?

It would be inappropriate for such an instrument of Government policy to criticise it. The individual concerned would be entering the political arena. Many members of Dáil committees are capable of questioning and offering political opinions. That is their democratic right. However, it is not the function of a public servant to comment on policy.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	426	I know this is the Minister's view. Why does section 21 not contain a clause equivalent to section 20(5)?

#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	428	Although I do not wish to delay the House unnecessarily, let us suppose that the first issue that arises is the length of time it takes to reply to queries from Members of the Oireachtas. The chief executive may reply that funding is not sufficient, a clear criticism of Government policy. The Minister believes the chief executive should not do that. Section 21 does not contain a clause equivalent to section 20(5), confirming my view that paragraphs of legislation are transferred from one Bill to another. Very little thought is put into this transposition. The chief executive can make statements before any Oireachtas committee that he or she cannot make before the Committee of Public Accounts. Under the legislation the chief executive is free under law, if not in policy, to express opinions before other Oireachtas committees that he or she is forbidden from doing before the Committee of Public Accounts.

#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	434	This section intrigues me. I believe it was copied from another Bill. The section reads:The Authority or a subsidiary may borrow money (including money in a currency other than the currency of the State) for the purpose of performing any of the functions of the Authority, but shall not do so without the approval of the Minister given with the consent of the Minister for Finance.We are part of the largest economic bloc in the world. A vast amount of money is available to borrow in the currency of the State, the euro. There is no currency risk. Why would such an authority take currency risks? It was different when the punt was the currency and borrowing could be restricted.

It is now worth €0.80. This body would have lost a third of the value of its borrowing in euro within two years.I believe this section was taken from an old Bill that predates the euro and it has got through because nobody noticed. The idea of an Irish public authority borrowing outside the euro area does not make a scrap of commercial, economic or organisational sense. It would be an entirely daft risk to take. What would it borrow, Ethiopian birr? There are really only three currencies in the world now — dollars, euro and yen. Is it going to borrow dollars when the dollar is probably close to the bottom of a cycle and may shoot up in value? Will it borrow yen or euro? That little subsection should be removed.

I thank Members of the House for their comments and contributions over the past two days. Although the amendments discussed this evening have not been accepted, I have listened to the points that were raised and I mean to take the Senators' proposals into account even if they are not underpinned by legislation, which I do not believe is desirable in this case.I wish to take this opportunity to comment on the position and participation of women in sport and sports related activities. The Government recognises that the present level of participation in sport by women is less than what it might be. However, I recognise that the most effective way to persuade more women and girls to become involved in sport, and to stay involved, is by encouragement. I have already referred to the special funding of €2.25 million that has been provided to the Irish Sports Council specifically to support programmes aimed at increasing women's participation in sport.Two weeks ago, an amount of €250,000 was made available to the FAI by the Irish Sports Council from the special fund to assist with that association's development plan with a view to ensuring that there would be increased female participation in soccer. A national co-ordinator has been appointed and a number of development officers will be recruited to concentrate on women's soccer. There will be more female coaches, emerging talent will be nurtured and a national league will be introduced. This is the type of action that is required. We will have to focus on the types of sport women already participate in and enjoy, and provide the means of encouraging greater participation. A number of other organisations have also sought funding towards new programmes aimed at increasing participation and allocations will shortly be made in response to these requests.In terms of the Bill before us, I will direct the Irish Sports Council to have regard to the use of the Abbotstown facilities as part of its remit to improve women's participation levels in sport. I would expect that the national sports campus development authority will set out in its statement of strategy its approach to the various groups it will be attempting to attract.It is my intention to ensure that the board of the new authority is composed of an equitable balance of both men and women. Of course, the first concern will be to ensure that the membership of the board has capacity, relevant experience and knowledge. I am aware that a considerable number of women have distinguished themselves and would bring a very meaningful expertise to the operation of the authority. Regrettably, Senator White will not be one of them because of the provision we discussed earlier. I fully intend to tap this source of expertise but I am wary of setting in stone this commitment to a 50:50 balance because it might lead to an unnecessary limitation when selecting talented women and men to guide the development of the national sports campus.Similarly, I have not accepted the proposed amendment lifting the prohibition on members of local authorities from becoming members of the authority. I have given my reason in detail and it is not necessary to repeat it. In conclusion, I thank everyone involved for their assistance in the process of drafting, preparing and processing this Bill. I thank Senators for their co-operation and I am pleased that this legislation will be passed. I now look forward to the new authority delivering a state-of-the-art campus of sports facilities over the coming years at Abbotstown.I thank the Cathaoirleach and the staff of the Seanad. In thanking all Members of the Seanad, I particularly thank the spokespersons on all sides of the House. Listening to Senator Ryan over the last few days made me nostalgic for the days when I was Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, but only nostalgic.

The Minister will be aware that a number of families are entitled to home tuition for children with special needs. This is an important service in the sense that it is an early intervention which is so important when dealing with the problems of children with autism and other conditions. It is also important, from the point of view of communication and integration, for the children to have this home tuition.It was with dismay that the parents learned that the Department has decided to curtail the home tuition service which has been in operation for a number of years. Home tuition is provided in cases where there is no ongoing in-house education available in a primary school or the like. Concern was also expressed by many parents that psychological, speech therapy or occupational therapy services, to which many of these children are entitled, are not available in some regional areas. In the western area, the Department of Education and Science has decided to put in place special classes in Kilrush National School to deal with these children. That has not been completed, however, and because of the difficulties in finding psychological and speech therapy services in rural areas, the home tuition has become even more important.Parents are concerned about this and have raised it locally in west Clare and nationally. I hope the Minister of State will be able to continue the service as currently operated. In some cases it is only for two hours a day and the parents have expressed to me their strong desire to continue with it because the tuition in the home is more important than what might be available in the organised school environment. It is critical that this service continues and that funding is providing to allow home tuition to continue for the foreseeable future.

Recent years have seen a major expansion in school-based provision for children with autism. Current provision includes 162 special classes for children with autism, attached to special and mainstream schools, 15 pre-school classes, five special classes for children with Asperger's syndrome and 12 standalone facilities providing an applied behavioural analysis specific methodology. Approval has also been given for the establishment of a further two such facilities.The newly-established National Council for Special Education, and its team of more than 70 special educational needs organisers, is also working across the country to ensure that new services are put in place where needed so that children with special needs, including those on the autistic spectrum, have access to appropriate school-based provision.The decision to discontinue home tuition grant was on the basis that the educational needs of these pupils can be best met in their individual schools. It is open to any parent who may have a concern about the educational supports being delivered in the schools to discuss his or her concerns with the school in question.I thank the Senator for giving me the opportunity to clarify the position of the Department of Education and Science in this matter.

#PaulBradford	unknown-#PaulBradford-party	unknown-#PaulBradford-dob	unknown-#PaulBradford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	453	I welcome the Minister of State to the House and welcome her willingness to listen to my concerns about the possible building of a new prison at Spike Island, County Cork, and the impact that will have on the tourism industry in the Cork region and on the heritage and history of Spike Island.The island boasts a heritage and history unrivalled by any other international site of its kind. Spike Island transcends many of the most noted heritage sites in the world, such as Fort McArthur, Fort McHenry, Alcatraz, the Citadel at Halifax, Robben Island and many more. The difference, however, is that while many of these have had their historical value utilised to benefit from tourism, Spike Island is on the brink of having its heritage desecrated with the tourism benefits for the region lost forever. That may not be the Minister's desire when he proposed to build a new prison on Spike Island but that will be the effect.Spike Island has been mentioned as far back as 635 AD. The island was chosen then as the site for a monastery by St. Carthage, who had been granted the land by a local chieftain. He stayed on the island for a year before moving on to set up the centre of major ecclesiastical importance in Lismore and he left a community of monks on the island. In the early ninth century, the island and its monastery is believed to have been attacked by the Viking raiders who entered Cork Harbour. In the 12th century, Norman raiders took ownership of the land in the name of the king and a series of grants of land and leases followed. Oliver Cromwell used the island in the mid-1600s as a holding centre for those who were being transported to Barbados. In 1792 convict labour was used in the building of Fort Westmoreland, a classic star shaped fortress built to enhance the fortification of the harbour in conjunction with Fort Camden and Fort Carlisle.In the late 1840s, the practice of sending convicts to Australia diminished and Spike Island was used as a penal colony until 1883. There was a high mortality rate among convicts on the island, who were buried in unhallowed ground in unmarked graves on the west of island. Those graves would be disturbed by any new building. John Mitchel of the Young Irelanders was imprisoned briefly in 1848 prior to his transportation to Van Diemen's Land. Such heritage is unique and should be protected.During the War of Independence, prisoners were held on Spike Island but in 1938 the island was handed over by the British to the Irish Army. It was renamed Fort Mitchel and the Army remained on the island until 1979. There was a military prison on the island and then the Irish Naval Service was given the land in 1994. Since then and until 1994 there was a juvenile and general prison.The island has a penal history but also a monastic heritage. It is a unique site and should be declared a natural heritage site, before we seek for it to be declared a world heritage site like Alcatraz and Robben Island. When we speak about people's concerns and objections about the development of a prison on the island and the building of a bridge on to the island, it is fair to say that many of those who are objecting are putting forward a case for alternative prison accommodation in other parts of the general area. They are not suffering from the NIMBY syndrome. It is not that they do not want a prison, but that they want to protect Spike Island's heritage and history and they genuinely feel, as I do, that the building of a new prison and of a bridge linking it to the mainland would desecrate the island and its heritage and history. This matter needs to be examined urgently by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister to ensure that an historic monument of enormous international proportions is saved, retained and developed as a vast tourist facility for east Cork, County Cork and the country.

The need for a new prison to alleviate the current overcrowding at Cork Prison has been well documented. More recently the Inspector of Prisons in his inspection report on Cork Prison condemned the facility and acknowledged that space at the institution is at a premium.Officials from the Irish Prison Service, in conjunction with the Office of Public Works and professional advisers, are developing proposals for the construction of a new prison complex on Spike Island to replace the existing Cork Prison. The new facility will address the overcrowding and inadequate facilities associated with Cork Prison and will, in addition, offer significant improvements in the areas of work, training, education and medical services as well as providing predominantly single cell accommodation with in-cell sanitation facilities.The new prison complex on Spike Island will allow the Irish Prison Service to strengthen measures to ensure drugs are not smuggled to prisoners. For example, the new complex will locate exercise yards where drugs cannot be propelled into them and new visiting facilities will eliminate the potential for passing drugs to prisoners on visits.In addition to eliminating supply routes, the new complex will provide modern medical and other facilities to allow the Irish Prison Service to meet the commitment in its recently published Drugs Policy and Strategy, to deliver a broad range of high quality interventions to support drug abusers in attempting to conquer their addictions. Modern facilities support the staff delivering these interventions by providing them with the best tools and environment in which to carry out their work.The commissioning of the bridge will facilitate the development of new prison facilities on the island to replace the existing outdated accommodation at Cork Prison. The OPW has been instructed to prepare the relevant planning procedures including an assessment of the environmental and related issues arising to enable the construction of a bridge to the island. The Minister has been advised by the OPW that this planning process will commence by this summer. As soon as the planning requirements are complete it is intended to commence construction of the bridge, which will take approximately 18 months to complete.The contract for the bridge and the prison facilities will be placed following public tender and the Minister has instructed the OPW to prepare the design and other works which are required prior to the issue of the tender for the construction of the bridge. Outline plans for the island prison facilities are being developed at present and these will be finalised later this year. The Minister is not at this stage in a position to give an estimate of the amount of land required for the prison development or the costs of the project as this will be the subject of a public competition.The Minister does not propose to change his plans for a new prison development including a bridge at Spike Island. He does, however, note the concerns raised regarding the history and heritage aspects which arise in the context of this development.The implications, if any, on the heritage, archaeology or related aspects of the proposed developments will be addressed in detail in the course of the planning process which will be undertaken in due course. At that stage, all of the relevant material including properly balanced assessments of the various issues, including archaeology, will be made available as part of the public consultation process which it is hoped should commence later this year.
#TomMorrissey	unknown-#TomMorrissey-party	unknown-#TomMorrissey-dob	unknown-#TomMorrissey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	455	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy de Valera, for this Adjournment matter. I tabled it because no matter how many debates we have here on transport, we never seem to have enough because there are so many varied issues in the transport area.Bus licensing is an issue the Department has been grappling with for many years. The Department is not ambitious enough about this area of activity. If there was ambition in this area, it would mean that significant numbers of people could travel by public transport at no cost to the Exchequer.I met with some transport providers recently. One, in particular, who was unemployed five years ago, now employs 35 people. He has made a significant investment. He has mortgaged and remortgaged his house on several occasions against the advice of his accountant and others, and yet he is still in business providing a service. This is the question. Is he being encouraged and assisted by the Department? Regrettably, the answer is "No."For example, I have read correspondence where a licence was requested. A detailed application was submitted in January last, it was acknowledged in January and there has not been a word since. On that same line 60 miles from Dublin, there is a provincial town whose people cannot be accommodated by the commuter rail system. At 7 o'clock in the morning there is only standing room.Notwithstanding the considerable investment there will be in the commuter rail line bringing DART as far as Balbriggan, the future plans by Irish Rail can never meet the latent demand in that area, yet the Department is sitting on a licence application for six months. Were it granted, it would have the same impact as the current licences the operator holds. He is carrying 9,000 people at peak times to Dublin city every day during the year, yet it costs the taxpayer and the Government nothing by way of subvention or maintenance.On that same route, there is a Bus Éireann bus using hired private operators at €400 per trip. Where is the transparency in the use or abuse of taxpayers money by Bus Éireann to put a private operator out of business? This is a misuse of taxpayers' money. There is not proper transparency in the CIE accounts of how its subsidy is being used on the different routes. That is one of the reasons there is not proper ticket integration at present. If there was a fair fare box, we would then know the origin and destination of every customer. This is one of the reasons CIE is lethargic in bringing that forward and co-operating with the system.The other issue is that bus licences are granted on a yearly basis. Providing a route is a significant investment for an operator. It is a considerable investment in management, employment and capital. The operator gets a licence for one year and must reapply for another year. If the operator is to attempt to develop the route, obviously he or she needs to be given a little longer than 12 months.This system is in operation for a few years. I asked the Minister previously to consider issuing three-year licences. If an operator went to his bank manager to borrow money for new buses for a route for 12 months, he would be asked where was his guarantee that he would have a licence for the route in two years time.There are significant issues involved, which amaze me for the simple reason that it costs the taxpayer nothing if these private operators are brought into the system. They certainly give a good service. There are thousands of buses out there. The operators' bus fleets are new, well serviced and well maintained.Another issue I would raise is how the private operators are treated in the context of the subvention for old age pensioners. I have read correspondence in which the Department states a final offer on how much will be returned to the operator for carrying old age pensioners. The playing pitch is neither level nor fair. The system should be restructured, particularly since it will cost the State nothing.
#SiledeValera	unknown-#SiledeValera-party	unknown-#SiledeValera-dob	unknown-#SiledeValera-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-28 00:00:00	Prelude	456	The overall policy framework for the future of public bus transport operations was set out in the programme for Government and included the following specific commitments: the replacement of the Road Transport Act 1932 with modernised legislation to allow, inter alia, for new services in the bus market; further progress will be made on upgrading the bus fleet, providing bus priorities both in Dublin and other cities, and in increasing the level and frequency of service and the interchangeability of commuter tickets on bus and rail; and new services will be introduced both to some new housing developments and to existing poorly served communities.Against the background of those commitments, the Minister has committed to modernising the regulatory framework governing public transport and the provision of bus services by both public and private operators, not only in Dublin, but nationally. In particular, at the launch of Transport 21, the Minister indicated he was convinced a new approach was needed to transport in the greater Dublin area, delivered through a single authority with the power to ensure joined up thinking and delivery across all transport modes. In addition, specific commitments to the funding of bus requirements are set out in Transport 21. A total of €532 million is provided for buses to serve the greater Dublin area and a further €241 million for services in the provincial cities. This provides immediate recognition that the bus network will continue to provide a very significant element of the public transport system for the foreseeable future, particularly in the initial years of Transport 21 when major rail and other infrastructure projects are under construction.In pursuing an agenda for change for transport services both in the greater Dublin area and in the rest of the State, the Minister has had an extensive engagement with key stakeholders, including the CIE companies, the unions and representatives of private bus operators. That process, allied with the report of the establishment team he appointed to advise on the remit, structures and human resource requirements of the proposed Dublin transport authority, will inform the determination of the appropriate structures for a new framework for the future regulation and reform of the public transport market and the legislation necessary to support that framework.The engagement of private sector bus operators in the provision of public transport services is governed by the Road Transport Act 1932, as amended. It has long been recognised that the Act is in need of significant reform so that the legislative provisions better reflect the realities of modem public transport services. The reform programme the Minister is pursuing will address that particular need. Bus route operations by Bus Éireann and Dublin Bus are not licensed under the 1932 Act. The new legislation will address this issue and will focus on the delivery of a single licensing code that will establish a level playing field for both private and public service providers. In advance of the completion of the process for the passage of the proposed legislation, the Department will continue to promote improvements in the administration of the bus licensing service based on the principles of due process and fair procedures. In this regard, the Department continues to process applications or notifications for new or amended bus services received from both private and public bus operators under the existing regulatory regime.As a consequence of the successful investments made in bus and rail under the national development plan, the public's expectations are changing and are more demanding than ever in respect of public transport. The proposals under development will address those demands by providing a way forward that will focus on achieving an appropriate balance between creating sufficient competitive tension to drive greater efficiency, effectiveness and value for money while, at the same time, maintaining the stability and integration of the bus network and the need to maintain social inclusion. The Minister hopes to publish legislation on public transport reform in the current year.
