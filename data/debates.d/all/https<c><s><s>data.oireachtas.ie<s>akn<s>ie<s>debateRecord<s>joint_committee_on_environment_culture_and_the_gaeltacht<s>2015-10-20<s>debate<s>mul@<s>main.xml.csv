#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-20 00:00:00	National Library of Ireland: Chairperson Designate	0	I remind members of the rules regarding the use of mobile phones. Apologies have been received from Deputy Helen McEntee. It is proposed that the first part of the meeting, session A, will be a meeting with the chairperson designate of the National Library of Ireland. The meeting should conclude at approximately 4.30 p.m. although it may be a little later. Session B is a discussion on Culture Ireland with the Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin, which should commence immediately after session A. We will then deal with private business such as correspondence. Is that agreed? Agreed. This session has been convened to enable the chairperson designate of the National Library of Ireland, Mr. H. Paul Shovlin, to address the committee on the role he will play as chairman and his views on the future contribution of the National Library of Ireland. Is that agreed? Agreed. I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee. However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence. They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable. It is proposed that all opening statements and any other documents the witnesses have submitted to the committee will be published on the committee website after the meeting has adjourned. I congratulate Mr. Shovlin on his appointment to the post and invite him to make his opening statement.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-20 00:00:00	National Library of Ireland: Chairperson Designate	1	It is a privilege for me to be invited to appear before the committee today. I am grateful for the opportunity to speak about myself and the National Library of Ireland, which I hope to serve as chairperson. I will try to answer any questions as comprehensively as I can. The committee will already have received my written statement but I will summarise it now. I have had a fairly successful business career and believe I am well qualified to chair the National Library of Ireland. More important, I have worked extensively in the cultural and charitable sectors in non-profit roles. I have served on management boards and audit committees and I was inaugural chairman of the RDS foundation board, which co-ordinates the cultural, musical and educational programmes of the RDS. I have served as a board member of the National Library for the past five years. In that period, I have been an active board member, attending virtually all board meetings and participating in the library's audit committee. I also chaired the library board's sub-committee for the Seamus Heaney exhibition, which is planned for 2017. My vision for the National Library is to increase national awareness of its unique mandate. We need to tell the story of the National Library more loudly than we have in the past. I will try to ensure that the library claims its place at the centre of international engagement in the context of Irish history, culture and heritage. I intend to promote the idea that the library is the appropriate destination for important national collections, such as the Heaney collection. It is also my intention to help promote a diversification of funding sources for the National Library.  I care about the National Library and am very committed to it.The mandate I will have as chairman for the next 12 years, subject to the committee's ratification, will be my main work and responsibility. Other things I am involved in will be secondary to chairing the National Library. That concludes my opening statement.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-20 00:00:00	National Library of Ireland: Chairperson Designate	2	I welcome Mr. Shovlin. I am very glad to see he cares about the National Library. I do not imagine he would have been on the board if he did not. It is one of my own favourite places in the country. It is a real national treasure and Mr. Shovlin is quite right that it is under-appreciated. In his opening statement, Mr. Shovlin refers to the legacy of under-investment. He comes from a strong financial background. The storage and retrieval aspect of the library was drawn to our attention when we visited it some months ago. I was appalled at the risk we are taking with the national collection because of under-investment. I know the possibility of partnering with one of the universities in respect of a combined storage facility is being explored. How would Mr. Shovlin see that going? Would it be a priority area? We are coming up to a very important commemoration with which the library is going to be strongly involved, and rightly so. At the end of the decade of centenaries we will also be remembering another incident in which we lost a very large collection of irreplaceable material. My question about storage is in that context. I would like to see a higher premium placed on this matter. In his own personal time, Mr. Shovlin has been involved in a number of areas. How does he see the mixture of business and cultural aspects? Are they mutually beneficial? Only 1% of the collection is conserved to international standards. Is that a priority? I appreciate that there is a juggling act going on. I was very pleased with the digitisation that was done last year and the extent of interest in the parish records. Although I appreciate the work that has been done with the budget that is there, I feel we are under-investing hugely. 
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-20 00:00:00	National Library of Ireland: Chairperson Designate	3	I thank the Deputy for her ongoing interest in the National Library. I see good business practice as the enabler for the cultural aspect. Without that, we struggle. We have got to have good business practice to enable the culture to be accessed. The condition of storage is poor. Huge investment is needed there. As the board of the National Library, we need not just to repeat the mantra, "we are short of funding", but to create an atmosphere of saying: "This is where we need to be - how are we going to get there?" It is only through Government and other funding - I talk about diversification of funding resources - that we can get there. We need to set out our stall very clearly as to where we want to be in order to address those ills, such as storage, which the Deputy has identified. In a way, the library has been under the surface in terms of its profile, almost as though the nation had forgotten about it. We need to wake ourselves up. We are the custodians of huge national treasures. The problem with the National Library is that we do not have evidence - like potholes - if there is a problem. It is just there and can be the victim of inertia. Collaboration is another strand of our strategy. We do not just want to talk about collaboration; we want to activate something. There are institutions like the universities with which we can establish collaboration. It is our intention to pursue that line.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-20 00:00:00	National Library of Ireland: Chairperson Designate	5	Five years.
#FergusODowdFG	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-party	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-dob	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-20 00:00:00	National Library of Ireland: Chairperson Designate	6	I welcome Mr. Shovlin and congratulate him on his appointment. I would be a bit like my colleague, Deputy Murphy. I am an enthusiast in terms of digital access to media and particularly the National Library. I congratulate the library on the 1916 papers it has produced online. I have used the 19th-century baptismal registers to trace a relation of mine who, as I discovered, fought in the American civil war. It is a wonderful facility. In terms of joining up all the knowledge, for example Google books, the universities, and all the other institutions that are online right around the world - we have a lot of Irish records in America, in New York state, the Smithsonian or whatever - is there a vision of how to tie all that together? How can we leapfrog and have everybody working with everybody else to achieve a platform where Irish people in any part of the world can get a seamless link to the resources?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-20 00:00:00	National Library of Ireland: Chairperson Designate	7	As the Deputy says, access is very important. In terms of exploiting this wonderful resource and in terms of cultural tourism, we have got to be there. If one is working with the likes of Google, one has to be careful that one is at least an equal partner. We are the custodians of these collections and need to make sure we are clever enough not to surrender everything to the Googles of this world. We discuss that at board level in the National Library and have made some soundings on how American universities have been able to work with Google. The experience is generally pretty good, but people are careful. One needs to be very well advised and absolutely alert in respect of any legal agreements one might have with the likes of Google. We have to keep our minds open to approaches and to working with these people.
#FergusODowdFG	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-party	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-dob	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-20 00:00:00	National Library of Ireland: Chairperson Designate	8	I do not necessarily agree with everything Mr. Shovlin said there. The point I was making was that from the point of view of the consumer who wants to find out something from the past, I would put the emphasis on inclusivity. Most of the publications the library has in its 138-year history would be out of print and would not be available generally anywhere. Unless they are digitalised on the library's own collection or available or linked, they are hard to access. The library should be making as much as possible available to the public at all times. I do not want to go into the issues about Google wanting something the library does not want to give it. I would say that the library wants to give everything to anybody who wants to look at it in digital form. To put the question a different way, notwithstanding what we have just been saying, does Mr. Shovlin see the availability of digitalisation of the library's records and books on its own website or whatever as an objective task to be done urgently?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-20 00:00:00	National Library of Ireland: Chairperson Designate	9	Yes, we do. We are doing quite a lot already, subject to resources being available. The resources available have been quite light. I agree absolutely with the Deputy that it is our intention to keep pushing out, digitising and making our collections available online.
#FergusODowdFG	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-party	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-dob	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-20 00:00:00	National Library of Ireland: Chairperson Designate	10	What is the library's percentage that is digitalised at the moment?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-20 00:00:00	National Library of Ireland: Chairperson Designate	11	I am subject to correction on this but I think it is 1% or 2%.
#FergusODowdFG	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-party	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-dob	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-20 00:00:00	National Library of Ireland: Chairperson Designate	12	There is obviously a huge job to be done there. I would think that is a very important task and I recognise the library's commitment. I did not think the figure was as low as that. That shows how out of touch I am.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-20 00:00:00	National Library of Ireland: Chairperson Designate	13	It is very low.
#FergusODowdFG	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-party	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-dob	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-20 00:00:00	National Library of Ireland: Chairperson Designate	14	The other issue is newspaper records. I have been looking at The Brooklyn Eagle, a newspaper that was printed in New York in the 1860s. It is a fantastic resource. The digitalisation of newspaper media is top class in the case of that newspaper. It is hugely important to have all of that data and the copies of all those newspapers dating back probably 200 years. It is a huge potential source of information and knowledge to everybody of Irish extraction around the world, who number in the millions. Notwithstanding the support of businesses, the Government should also step up to the mark in terms of its budget. Is there a budget every year for that?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-20 00:00:00	National Library of Ireland: Chairperson Designate	15	My understanding is that there is no specific budget. It is part of the general pool of expenditure that is made available by the Department. To achieve anything would require a very substantial amount of money, and even then it would be over a long period. However, as the Deputy suggests, we need a fairly aggressive programme. We know the point we want to reach but it is a question of having the resources to get there.
#FergusODowdFG	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-party	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-dob	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-20 00:00:00	National Library of Ireland: Chairperson Designate	16	After this meeting, could Mr. Shovlin circulate an analysis from the National Library on what his plans and needs are?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-20 00:00:00	National Library of Ireland: Chairperson Designate	17	Yes, I would be delighted to do that. I thank the Deputy.
#FiachMacConghail	unknown-#FiachMacConghail-party	unknown-#FiachMacConghail-dob	unknown-#FiachMacConghail-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-20 00:00:00	National Library of Ireland: Chairperson Designate	18	I congratulate Mr. Shovlin on being chairperson designate. He is quite clear in his presentation about the considerable uncertainty that faced the National Library over the last five years, particularly regarding the lack of money and investment and also the uncertainty about the legislative proposals. It appears there will no longer be uncertainty around the legislative proposals and Mr. Shovlin's appointment is an indication of that. The National Cultural Institutions Act and the National Library will remain in the current position. If Mr. Shovlin has heard different mood music, it would be helpful for the committee to know that. However, that war appears to be over and we are now looking forward to supporting many of these organisations. I have a few questions and if Mr. Shovlin does not have the answers, perhaps they could be sent to the committee in writing. They are straightforward as I do not wish to put Mr. Shovlin in a difficult position. Will he confirm if the National Library has received any increase for its expenditure in 2016? Is that specifically aimed at the 2016 commemoration or has the National Library received an increase in its funding for next year?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-20 00:00:00	National Library of Ireland: Chairperson Designate	19	In 2015 there was an interim increase of €600,000. My understanding is that the increase is being held, so basically it is the funding for 2015 as well as the €600,000 but no increase beyond that. We are, nevertheless, appreciative of the pressures the Government and the Department have been under and we are relieved that the €600,000 has been held. It was a supplementary amount that we received earlier just to ensure that the National Library could function properly, so we have held that. However, we must move on from here.
#FiachMacConghail	unknown-#FiachMacConghail-party	unknown-#FiachMacConghail-dob	unknown-#FiachMacConghail-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-20 00:00:00	National Library of Ireland: Chairperson Designate	20	Mr. Shovlin is saying essentially that there is no increase for next year. It was stabilised for this year and it is on stand alone for 2016.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-20 00:00:00	National Library of Ireland: Chairperson Designate	21	Yes, stand alone plus the €600,000.

One is employment restrictions. How many keeper positions are unfilled, which the National Library is restricted from filling? They are key positions. The second is storage. Will Mr. Shovlin enumerate for the committee how bad the storage facilities are and give us a couple of examples? Is any of the library's material in danger of being destroyed or damaged or, indeed, being inaccessible to researchers? Has the section 1003 tax incentive been used recently by the National Library for acquisition? I understand there might be commercial sensitivities about it but is it something to which the library has access? Mr. Shovlin has much experience in the commercial world. He has also served on the board. In terms of diversifying funding, can he give us an assessment of the fund-raising climate he sees in both Ireland and the US in respect of helping him to diversify the funding?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-20 00:00:00	National Library of Ireland: Chairperson Designate	23	I am not sure of the exact number of keeper positions, but there are 30 unfilled positions.
#FiachMacConghail	unknown-#FiachMacConghail-party	unknown-#FiachMacConghail-dob	unknown-#FiachMacConghail-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-20 00:00:00	National Library of Ireland: Chairperson Designate	24	Thirty?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-20 00:00:00	National Library of Ireland: Chairperson Designate	25	Yes, 30 have been vacated and we have not been able to fill them. The library is very stretched. One hopes there will be some relief under those controls. We are in the process of appointing a head of security and facilities management. We had to get special permission for that appointment, which is an absolutely crucial appointment. We are grateful for that but we need to be in a position where we have far more flexibility. We have been nailed to the cross. The Senator mentioned the mood music on the legislation. The mood music has gone silent, so we are taking that as a positive indicator. Regarding material under threat, the collections are there and in the case of photographic collections when the photographs get old certain chemicals start to change their nature and the photographs start to disintegrate. Undoubtedly, there are issues in that regard. There are also issues in the main collections. There is potentially water damage and fire damage. To be fair to the staff of the library, they have done their best and we are hopeful that any damage would be minimal. Nevertheless, it is walking something of a tightrope. One should not have to worry about these things. These are national collections. One of my missions is to articulate this problem in a way that does not get into an argument, so people will say that it is a genuine and reasonable position and that funds are needed. It is investment, not necessarily to spend more money. We just need investment. That is crucial. The Senator mentioned section 1003. It has been used over the last few years, although not very often. We are hoping to use it more. As good, important national collections come up, we are anxious to be in a position to have a proposition to put to the people who are giving, selling or offering these collections to us. We hope to be able to use section 1003. I hope I have answered all the Senator's questions.
#FiachMacConghail	unknown-#FiachMacConghail-party	unknown-#FiachMacConghail-dob	unknown-#FiachMacConghail-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-20 00:00:00	National Library of Ireland: Chairperson Designate	26	What is Mr. Shovlin's assessment of the current fund-raising climate in terms of diversifying funding?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-20 00:00:00	National Library of Ireland: Chairperson Designate	27	We really have not tested it. We must gear ourselves in a way that we can go forward and put a proposition. If fund-raising and philanthropy can be done for different purposes, surely the seriousness of purpose of the National Library's mandate should enable us to raise funds for particular projects. However, it is similar to an investment as well. We must be able to package them and to research the tax environment, particularly in the United States. In this country it is fine and we understand section 1003. However, if one is doing something in the United States, and the Senator might have some experience in that regard, one must have all one's ducks in a row and the machinery in place to be able to receive philanthropy if it emerges.

I will begin by showing members a short promotional video about Culture Ireland.
#AodhanORiordan	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-party	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-dob	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-10-20 00:00:00	National Library of Ireland: Chairperson Designate	32	Culture Ireland was set up under the then Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht in 2005 to promote Irish arts and artists worldwide. As Culture Ireland marks a decade in operation, it is timely to examine its performance and set clear goals for its future. Culture Ireland’s strategy is to provide support for the international presence of Irish artists and arts organisations, develop new and diverse international audiences and markets for Irish arts and, in tandem with other relevant State agencies and as reflected in the expert advisory committee, link culture into the overall Government international promotional strategy. The expert advisory committee operates on a non-statutory basis and is comprised of representatives from the arts sector, the Irish Film Board, the Arts Council, IDA Ireland, Tourism Ireland and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Generating career opportunities for Irish artists and raising the international profile and awareness of Ireland’s creativity is at the core of what Culture Ireland does. Further, there is a concerted effort to maximise the potential of culture as a leading motivator for tourism to Ireland and to utilise Ireland's cultural profile as a driver of trade and investment. During the past ten years, Culture Ireland has supported over 4,000 events across 100 countries involving Irish theatre makers, musicians, singers, writers, dancers, visual artists and film-makers, presenting their work to audiences around the world. Culture Ireland gives financial support to approximately 400 events annually through its regular grant rounds for support of global presentation across all art forms. To date in 2015, Culture Ireland has generated the equivalent of 151 full-time jobs for artists abroad. By the end of the year, this is expected to have risen to in excess of 250 full-time jobs from the annual investment of €2.5 million. It is important to stress that 95% of Culture Ireland's funding is given directly to Irish artists for their travel costs. This support generally leverages other support and sponsorship, with artists’ fees usually covered by income generated at the international venues' box office. Culture Ireland has delivered high-profile events and special initiatives such as Imagine Ireland, a year-long programme in the US in 2011, the Culture Programme for Ireland's Presidency of the EU in 2013 and the Centenary International Culture Programme for 2016 which will be covered in more detail later. Culture Ireland also arranges cultural events around visits by members of the Government and by the President abroad. Most notable in recent times was the Ceiliúradh concert in London in 2014 to mark the President's visit to Great Britain. There was an audience of 5,000 people for this concert and it attracted 4.7 million television viewers in Ireland and Great Britain. In December 2014, to mark the State visit to China by President Higgins, Culture Ireland arranged an evening of poetry, music and dance in the Forbidden City Concert Hall in Beijing. Culture Ireland’s showcase programme is a strategic arm of the division. It creates and builds new opportunities for Irish artists to present their work at key international festivals and venues by engaging directly with international presenters. The primary purpose of the showcase programme is to present high-quality work by Irish artists which is export-ready and to build contacts and opportunities for touring with leading presenters and promoters. Culture Ireland actively promotes the showcase programme to presenters, targets contacts to see work, makes introductions for Irish artists and establishes partnerships and relationships with key venues in which to present work. Irish work is showcased at international markets such as: the traditional music market at Celtic Connections in Glasgow every January; rock and indie music at SXSW in Austin, Texas every March; wider music at the World Music Expo, WOMEX; literature at Frankfurt Bookfair; art and architecture at the Venice Biennales; and theatre at the Edinburgh festivals, where year after year Irish artists have attracted awards in what is a competitive marketplace. Culture Ireland also supports incoming buyers annually to see work at the Dublin Theatre Festival, the Dublin Dance Festival and the Hard Working Class Heroes music festival. To date, this year it has supported more than 100 buyers and presenters to visit Ireland to attend the following festivals and select works for international presentation: the 12 Points Festival jazz festival, the Temple Bar Tradfest, the Choice Music Awards, the Dublin International Film Festival, the Dublin Dance Festival, the Galway Film Fleadh, the Dublin Fringe Festival, the Dublin Theatre Festival and the Hard Working Class Heroes music festival. Each of these showcases has yielded positive results in new contracts for artists. St. Patrick’s Day is a key time for Culture Ireland to deliver globally across all artistic platforms, taking account of Government priorities and proposed visits. In 2015, for example, Culture Ireland allocated funding in excess of €200,000 to support more than 50 events in 22 countries. The culture programme coincides in many locations with visits by key Government-led delegations, which ensures the maximum impact can be generated through the investment. Culture Ireland funds a number of key organisations on an annual basis. They are the Ireland Literature Exchange which arranges for the translation of Irish literature into other languages; the Irish Film Institute which provides Irish films for festivals and venues worldwide; as well as the arts programme in Ireland's two international arts centres, namely, Centre Culturel in Paris and the Irish Arts Centre in New York. Culture Ireland's annual funding in 2014 and 2015 was €2.5 million. In 2016 its allocation will be doubled to €5 million to enable it to deliver a special international programme as part of the
Ireland 2016 centenary programme which will have a special focus on key territories, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. It is for our artists and their talents that Ireland is known globally and for 2016 I am committed to the special programme, I am Ireland, a copy of which members should have in front of them. It is inspired by the opening line of one of Pearse's poems, Mise Éire. I am Ireland speaks of a contemporary Ireland and will involve young and established artists presenting at international festivals and venues. The interest in Irish artistic excellence continues to grow internationally and 2016 will offer the opportunity to build on Ireland's cultural connections and share many special and diverse events with audiences around the world. Culture Ireland works on a cross-agency basis, most notably with Tourism Ireland and the embassy network, to raise the profile of the Irish arts globally. Irish artists continue to excel and win awards and critical acclaim on the world stage. Culture Ireland plays a key role in Ireland’s international promotional strategy, generating jobs for artists, creating an awareness of the strength of Ireland's creativity and supporting artists, Ireland's greatest ambassadors.  I look forward to hearing the contributions of members. I thank the Chairman for allowing me to make the presentation.

Gabhaim mo bhuíochas leis an Aire Stáit agus cuirim fáilte roimhe anseo tráthnóna inniu. Is mór an faoisimh é go bhfuil Aire againn a bhfuil nach amháin suim aige sa chultúr ach a théann chuig chúrsaí cultúr. Tá a fhios agam é sin le bliain anuas ó ealaíontóirí agus ó dhaoine a bhfuil páirteach sna healaíona. Nuair a théann an tAire Stáit go hócáidí, cuireann sé áthas ar dhaoine agus tugann sé aitheantas don tionscal agus tá sé sin tábhachtach.  I have a couple of questions, but before I ask them, I must make a statement on a potential conflict of interest. Everyone knows me by now. The reason I was appointed by the Taoiseach was to make a contribution in my field. I am director of the Abbey Theatre and on many occasions have gratefully received funding from Culture Ireland to enable many tours abroad, on merit of course, but it is still important to state this. We also receive funding from the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, the parent Department of Culture Ireland. There is a slight modesty in the Minister of State's commentary. It is important to say Culture Ireland has probably been one of the most successful Government agencies in the past ten years, in particular given its small staff. It has an extraordinarily large and increasingly wide reach when it comes to sending work abroad and making this country proud, in particular during the recession and the era of austerity when all we had to show for ourselves abroad was the presence of our artists and culture. It is also fair to say that when other funding was cut, Culture Ireland's indirect funding for the arts helped to sustain the lives and careers of many artists abroad, in particular on tour. It is important to acknowledge this. It is refreshing to have a Minister of State with responsibility for culture who knows what he is talking about, who attends events and engages with the industry. That has come back to me through my various constituencies. I have a number of questions for the Minister of State. At one point there was an aspiration for Culture Ireland to be put on a statutory basis. The reason that has not happened could have something to do with cost. In a way the Minister of State acknowledged the stability and future sustainability of Culture Ireland by increasing its funding for next year, on which I congratulate him. What are the thoughts on its future in terms of strengthening it, in particular the expert advisory committee? Although I do not hold any negative view on the advisory committee, there was what I would call a ham-fisted transfer from what was an independent board before it, which transferred in Micheál Ó Suilleabháin's second term as chairman. I would like to hear about the status of the committee. My second question relates to the key global regions. How were the regions picked for next year? Why were the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand picked? Was it because of a particular commemoration or what were the reasons? Are there other regions and territories in the pipeline for inclusion in future years?  I again congratulate the Minister of State on his presentation and the Mise Éire pamphlet.

On the future of Culture Ireland and strengthening it, I came in contact with it for the first time as Minister of State. I have seen the reach and power it has, which is quite remarkable. Figures were given to me earlier today for the level of investment and showing the global reach. A figure was given to me for the cost of sending certain artists to the United States and showing the promotional feedback. The advertising and promotion revenue from it far outstripped the initial investment, which is quite remarkable. The investment was €7 million but €22 million was recouped in media advertising. The media coverage was extensive. For the remainder of the term of the Government and if we continue to be part of the next Government, I am determined to ensure the independence of Culture Ireland will be strictly guarded and strengthened and that it will retain its separate identity as its work is unique. It must maintain its independence in that regard. Even though there were a number of references in the presentation to the economic worth of Culture Ireland and the fact that it could be connected with trade visits and attracting tourists to the country, the importance of the arts must be protected for what they are, not just for their economic value. As we come out of the economic constraints of the past, to which Senator Fiach Mac Conghail referred, and as we talk about what will happen in the future, we can consider funding for the arts, the type of lifestyle and career one can realistically have in the artistic space - there are many such matters that we must discuss - but Culture Ireland is much more than an add-on to a trade mission. It promotes the artistic and creative space on its own merits and value. Criticism of the arts in this country - perhaps it happens internationally also - is at the top and bottom of every political priority list. When a foreign dignitary comes to the country, we try to promote the economy or the tourism sector and the arts and cultural aspects of the country are given top priority. They are the first things we talk about, yet sometimes when it comes to funding, they can be on the bottom rung of the ladder.Perhaps it has been given, unfairly and unjustifiably, the sense of being a bit of a luxury where other things are more important. I made the point the other day at another event that the groups I dealt with in my equality role which were on the edges of Irish society and included Travellers, people with an addiction and those suffering from economic disadvantage, all needed the arts and a cultural space in which to express what they were going through and give expression to the human condition. We should not in any way diminish the importance of culture or what Culture Ireland does. We are looking at the wider 2016 programme linking with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the role of the Minister of State, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, with the diaspora. The locations mentioned will be key areas of connectivity for Ireland next year. That is why they are being mentioned. Many of them are areas in which people speak English and they are the main markets for many of our artists. Recently I have had a lot of contact with the Irish Literature Exchange. It is expanding with the revolution of young writers in Ireland who are beginning to translate their works into many international languages. It is remarkable to see their global reach. The answer to the question on whether we are constrained to these markets is "No", but they will be the main markets and the main areas into which we will try to push during 2016.

How extensive was Culture Ireland's involvement in it? I presume other arms of the State were also involved. How much did it cost? Did the money come out of the annual funding of €2.5 million annual or was it special funding supplied outside the annual budget? How extensive is the interaction between Culture Ireland and our foreign missions? Is the support or assistance for the events mentioned, be they in Paris, New York or Edinburgh, initiated by the organisers of the festivals or the embassies or is the initiative driven by the Department?

It was a once off event for a particular reason. The visit by President Higgins to the United Kingdom was of particular historical significance; therefore, a special designation was given to the visit because of this. Anybody who witnessed the event and celebration would have very much been taken by it and would certainly have said it was money well spent and an event worth attending, particularly because of its historical significance. Will the Chairman, please, repeat his second question?

The Minister of State mentioned the arts festival in New York and similar projects in Edinburgh and Paris. I asked about the extent to which our embassies proactively pursue such events. Is the initiative driven by the Department, the organisers of the events or the embassies? What is the extent of the interaction?

While it is certainly the driver, advice is taken to understand cultural sensitivities or the particular needs of the embassy at the time. Culture Ireland will definitely be the driver and initiator and the organisation promoting funding and allocating resources, but it must take account of what the embassies are thinking and feeling and what they want to do. Culture Ireland is the main body, but everything will happen in consultation and conjunction with other stakeholders.

I thank the Minister of State and his officials for making themselves available for the presentation to the committee.
