#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	0	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.The position is unchanged from that I outlined in the House on 1 June.  Expressions of interest were sought and have been received.  All suitable officers, regardless of whether they submitted an expression of interest,  will be considered before a decision is made by the Government.  In accordance with established practice, the filling of these posts is a matter for the Government.  The expressions of interest made, and other suitable candidates, are being considered by the Tánaiste and me in respect of a second post of Secretary General in my Department.  Therefore, no conflict of interest in respect of any other person arises.  I expect a recommendation will be made to the Government for appointment to these posts in the course of the coming weeks.  Special advisers have no function in these appointments.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1	Given that this is the procedure used for appointing the new Secretary General with responsibility for public expenditure and reform, which the Taoiseach will, no doubt, also examine,  is he satisfied with the procedures used for filling that role?  It is almost three months since the media were briefed that these jobs were being filled as a matter of urgency and that, in themselves, they represented a major reform.  The closing date for applications was 18 April.  What has happened to delay the appointments?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	2	The Minister for public expenditure and reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, with approval by the Government, has appointed a Secretary General and is  very happy with the outcome of that process.  I expect the appointment of the second post of Secretary General in the Department of the Taoiseach will be finalised in a very short period.  That Secretary General will report to the Tánaiste in respect of the economic management council and to me on the co-ordination of European matters.For the Deputy's information, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, is in the final process of seeking Government approval for appointment of a Secretary General to her Department.   The position of Secretary General to the Government,  as first secretary in my Department, will also be filled in due course.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	24	Fine.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	25	In light of the delay in filling the position referred to in Question No. 2, will the Taoiseach reconsider his decision not to publicly advertise the position of the second Secretary General in his Department?  He praised himself last week for his reform of the appointments system.  Therefore, does he not think he might use the reform process in filling this position?  The Taoiseach mentioned the position of Secretary General in the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  Will that position be filled by public appointment or public advertisement outside the public service?
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	26	That is a separate question.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	27	I do not regard this as an inordinate delay.  There has been a pretty hefty programme of legislation and events in recent weeks.  The recent period has provided an opportunity to reflect, in the general interest of everybody, on the range of qualities of the people to be appointed.  It is clear that the two positions in the Department of the Taoiseach are important.  The people to be appointed and approved by the Government will be required to have a thorough working knowledge of the mechanics of how the Government and the public service operate.  They will also have to exhibit enthusiasm and exuberance for the jobs in which they have expressed an interest and for which they are being considered.  The two positions in question — the Secretaries General in the Department of the Taoiseach — require a measure of experience and understanding of how the system works.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	28	I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 to 8, inclusive, together.I chaired the 12th meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council in Farmleigh House on Friday, 10 June last.  It was the first occasion for this Government to meet collectively with the newly appointed members of the Northern Ireland Executive since the recent Northern Ireland Assembly elections.  At the outset, I joined the Northern Ireland First Minister, Mr. Peter Robinson, and Deputy First Minister, Mr. Martin McGuinness, in paying tribute to former Minister for Finance, Mr. Brian Lenihan, who had sadly passed away that morning.During the course of the meeting, I highlighted the commitment of this Government, and my commitment, to North-South co-operation and all-island economic co-operation.  I encouraged Ministers to exchange contact details with their Northern counterparts and to keep in regular contact on matters pertinent to North-South co-operation.  We had a broad-ranging economic discussion with each Administration outlining the main challenges being faced.  My Ministers and I outlined the measures the Government is taking to tackle the debt problem and promote jobs and skills to tackle unemployment.  We discussed the importance of innovation, research and development to economic recovery on this island.  Given the budgetary constraints within which we operate, we stressed that it makes good practical sense to continue to explore areas where efficiencies and economies can be achieved by working together North and South.I welcomed the recent confirmation by the Minister, Mr. Poots that the satellite radiotherapy facility at Altnagelvin Hospital is to proceed as planned.  I confirmed the Government's strong support for the facility, which will take one third of its patients from County Donegal.  Altnagelvin is an excellent example of the potential to achieve economies of scale by investing together North and South.  We also discussed progress made on the A5 north-west gateway to Aughnacloy and A8 Belfast to Larne roads projects.  It was agreed that the Irish Government will pay the next round of funding of €11 million towards the roads project.  We reiterated the Government's commitment to these projects, which are essential for the development of the entire island.  It was also proposed that a technical working group be  established to examine how the projects can be delivered to the required standard at a reduced cost.On the issue of the St. Andrews Agreement review group, we agreed to forward the recommendations prepared by experts and advisers to the review group for consideration by Ministers in the new Executive and Irish Government.  This element of the review under Terms of Reference 1 will be finalised at the November plenary when we will also discuss Terms of Reference 2 and 3 of the St. Andrews review.On the establishment of the North-South parliamentary forum, we noted the successful conference that had taken place in October of last year and the intention of the Ceann Comhairle and the Speaker of the Assembly to hold a joint meeting of the working groups in Dublin on 23 June.On the establishment of the North-South consultative forum, we agreed to finalise deliberations on this issue at our next plenary which will take place in November of this year.  In addition, there was a full discussion of progress across a range of areas of North-South co-operation including good progress on road safety; co-operation on innovation, energy, tourism, higher education, the environment and trade and business; and the work of North-South bodies, particularly as it relates to fostering economic recovery across the island.  We also approved a schedule of future North-South Ministerial Council sectoral meetings which will take place before the end of this year.I met again with the Northern Ireland First Minister and Deputy First Minister along with Ministers from the Executive and the political leaders from across these islands at the 16th summit meeting of the British-Irish Council in London yesterday.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	29	There is quite a number of questions grouped.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	30	I tabled two questions.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	33	I want to be fair to everybody.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	34	Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle.  Tá mé buíoch don Taoiseach faoi an bhfreagra an-soiléir sin agus tá mé sásta leis an eolas a bhí ann.  That is a clear answer to the question and full of information.  Hopefully, this is a new start in our relationship.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	35	Always.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	36	Go raibh maith agat.I welcome the holding of that North-South Ministerial Council and also the reiteration from the North about Altnagelvin and from the Government about the carriageway — the N2-A5 major road scheme.  Of course, it is what happens in between those more formal meetings that is important in terms of building relationships.The Taoiseach might not be able to comment on this but if he could it would be helpful.  I note there was an altercation in the Short Strand area of east Belfast overnight and I am advised — I myself did not hear this — that the PSNI has stated it believes that was a UVF orchestrated incident.  I am wondering has the Taoiseach any eolas or scéal on that.  Second, are there communications as part of the almost informal back and forth between Ministers here and in the Six Counties if something like that arises?I appreciate the work that is being done at that forum and I thank the Taoiseach for the clarity of his answer.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	37	The tone of the meeting was very good.  Because it was the first time for members of the Government to meet members of the Executive, there was genuinely a very good interaction.  I certainly encourage members to exchange contact numbers so they could have informal meetings and make informal arrangements which, as Deputy Adams will be aware, are beneficial between formal meetings.  I expect that at the sub-sectoral meetings being arranged, Ministers will continue to make contact on a regular basis with the members of the Executive from the Assembly.  I will see to it.I have a briefing note on the Short Strand incident last night but I do not have it with me.  If Deputy Adams asks the question on Leaders' Questions, I will give him the up to date information.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	38	I have a harder question than that to ask the Taoiseach.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	39	I have got a briefing note in respect of that which I will be happy to share with the House if Deputy Adams asks the question on Leaders' Questions.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	40	Go raibh maith agat.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	41	In the context of Question No. 8 seeking a report on the outcome of the recent North-South Ministerial Council meeting, was the issue of parading discussed, either formally or informally, between the Taoiseach and the First Minister?  The events of last night have raised tensions significantly in interface areas early in the parading season and there were worrying signs earlier in the week, with tensions in north Belfast around the Tour of the North parade.  I suggest the combination of these two events is worrying and reflects the fact that, unfortunately, the peace process has not reached all communities in the North.  I am keen to ascertain whether any discussions have been held on what could be termed "hard to reach" communities or areas in which certain groups are receiving support.  The PSNI has been clear that the UVF launched the attack and that there was a response from the Nationalist side.  This is worrying, as people have been injured.  I would appreciate it if the Taoiseach would indicate whether any discussions took place on these issues at the ministerial council meeting, especially given its timing and the season ahead.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	42	There was no discussion at the formal meeting about parades.  I expect this issue to arise at the sectoral meetings with Ministers and members of the Executive.  My apologies for not bringing the comprehensive note on the incidents which occurred last night.  I would be pleased to share it with Deputies Micheál Martin and Gerry Adams in the House during Leaders' Questions if they come back to the issue then.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	43	It would be useful if there was significant engagement between either the respective Ministers or the Government and the Northern Ireland Executive on this issue to develop a multi-policy approach to the wider issues giving rise to the growing support for this activity, which is worrying.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	44	It is an issue of concern.  I encourage Ministers to engage fully and comprehensively with their counterparts.  Deputy Micheál Martin and I and Deputy Gerry Adams and others have discussed the matter on numerous occasions.  Clearly, there is a need for continuous vigilance and involvement in communities that are pressurised and fragile on both sides.  We all share this common purpose: having put in place after so many years of difficulty a peace process which has delivered normality to Northern Ireland, we intend to see to it that it continues and that those who seek to disrupt the trend towards peaceful and harmonious living within and among communities are not allowed to disrupt the process.  I share the view of every Deputy in the House in that regard.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	45	The Short Strand is a small Nationalist enclave in east Belfast.  A great deal of work has been done by people in that community and by their neighbours in loyalist neighbourhoods.  This has nothing to do with parading and it is not representative of either of these proud east Belfast communities.  I accept the Taoiseach does not have the briefing note, but it is good that a briefing will be provided.  Does the Taoiseach agree that the more ongoing and informal contact, good neighbourliness and so on there is, the better for all of us?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	46	Yes, I agree.  The Deputy can take it that I encourage Ministers to actively pursue such contact.  I intend to travel to Northern Ireland in the near future and engage in activities, projects and so on represented by the different parties and communities.  As the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister pointed out recently, having gone through a process of conducting normal elections in Northern Ireland, there is a period ahead in which there will be no election.  That will allow for stability and a platform to be built on.  We should seize the opportunity and demonstrate that we are serious about co-operation on North-South issues.  Where we can achieve efficiencies and demonstrate common purpose we should do so.  The Deputy can take it that Ministers will be engaged actively with their counterparts in the Executive.

I will seek to facilitate the Deputy at a later stage when he has received the information.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	49	That is a wonderfully transparent way of doing business.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	50	I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 11 together.The procedures for dealing with freedom of information requests in my Department follow the guidelines set out in the Department of Finance's Decision-Makers Manual.  The functions of general examination, primary decision-making and internal review are carried out by statutory designated officials, as envisaged in the Acts, and I have no role whatsoever in any of these processes.  I am satisfied that the processes being followed by my Department in relation to the freedom of information provisions comply with the manual and I do not propose to change them.The programme for Government undertakes to restore freedom of information provisions to what they were before the 2003 Act.  The Minister for public expenditure and reform is following through with the necessary reforms and any changes brought to the attention of the Government by the Minister will be implemented by my Department, with all others.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	51	I am not in any way questioning the capacity of the Department to administer the Freedom of Information Acts; that is not the angle I am pursuing in this question.  The Taoiseach referred to the relevant commitment in the programme for Government and the election manifestos of the two Government parties make specific promises in terms of increasing openness and accountability.  However, the evidence thus far is that we are going backwards.  For some years it has been the practice of key Departments to publish background documents on-line, thereby reducing the need for people to use the freedom of information provisions.  Most other Departments published briefing materials from March, but the Department of the Taoiseach did not do so.  Will the Taoiseach explain why this was not done?  In addition, there has been a reversal of the policy to publish the advisory documents prepared on all tax measures.In essence, because of the changes within the Department of the Taoiseach which are moving it towards becoming almost a Cabinet secretariat, the Department will be far less accountable.  In the past it was more open to ensuring freedom of information in terms of how it was structured, but by converting it into a type of Cabinet secretariat, the Taoiseach is cutting off the scope for many questions Deputies could have asked in the normal course of Dáil business.  That may not be the intention or design, but it is the outcome.  In other words, information will be covered by the principle of Cabinet confidentiality under the Department's new configuration and the majority of its work will be almost cut off from public or parliamentary oversight.  Is the Taoiseach satisfied with this development?  How does it dovetail with the commitment in the programme for Government regarding increased accountability, openness and transparency, including greater oversight by Parliament?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	52	I thank the Deputy for his observations.  I would be grateful if he conveyed to me examples of where he has found the Department restrictive in publishing information that would normally have been available.  As a general principle, the changes we are making in the way business is done in this House are designed to ensure Deputies who ask questions are given thorough and full information.  One of the problems with Members asking questions about the Freedom of Information Acts is that they are often not specific enough in the information they wish to acquire.I take the Deputy's point on the provision of background documentation.  Cabinet confidentiality is a constitutional requirement, as is confidentiality in so far as Cabinet committees are concerned.  However, in respect of the provision of background information, I will certainly be happy to respond to the Deputy if he can give me some examples of where he has found that information normally provided is in some way being constrained.  There is nothing to hide in this instance and it is my intention that every Deputy who asks a question will be given full and appropriate information as part of the normal course of business in the House.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	53	The Taoiseach stated that people needed to know what the Government is doing and promised to restore the Freedom of Information Act to what it was before Fianna Fáil undermined it agus nuair a bhí Fianna Fáil in oifig, bhíodh an Taoiseach ag tabhairt amach faoin slí ina raibh siad ag leanúint ar aghaidh.

#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	55	I put a question to the Department of Health under the freedom of information legislation and got back the redacted document I have to hand.  This is not a way in which to go about business, which in this case pertains to the crisis regarding junior doctors.  The Taoiseach also promised to extend the remit to the administrative side of An Garda Síochána.  Does the Government intend to review the operation of the Freedom of Information Act or is a review planned?I bring the Taoiseach's attention back to the document I have to hand, especially because he has just stated that Deputies should be able to get information.  This document I have to hand refers to how the italicised and bolded material should not be released and is exempt under sections 20(1) and 21(1)(c) of the Freedom of Information Act and then repeats that.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	56	As for the Freedom of Information Act in general, the programme for Government states the Government intends to restore it to what it was before 2003 when changes were made to it.  While sitting across the floor in the seat now occupied by Deputy Martin, I often asked questions about how, even when cases were referred to the appeals process, the charge on them always applied, even when the appeal was allowed.  This should be changed and if someone takes the opportunity or time to go through the process of appealing a freedom of information request that was turned down and if the Ombudsman and Information Commissioner states it should be allowed, the charge for so doing should be dropped.  However, this is being pursued by the Minister with responsibility for public expenditure and reform.  As for dealing with the administrative side of An Garda Síochána, that is the subject of discussions between the aforementioned Minister and the Minister for Justice and Equality.The Deputy should be aware the troika is watching all the time and the Government genuinely has an extremely strict guideline for introducing legislation with far-reaching effects that are timelined.  This has put enormous pressure on the resources of the Office of the Attorney General to comply with those strict conditions, which the Government intends to meet.  From that perspective, the pressure to bring through all legislative items in parallel simply does not stand up.  One must prioritise and, as I am sure the Deputy will appreciate, some complex legislation simply must be met in respect of the timeline.  However, the Minister is pursuing those matters concerning a review of the Freedom of Information Act and the changes the Government intends to introduce, as well as regarding the administrative side of An Garda Síochána together with the Minister for Justice and Equality.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	57	If I understood the Taoiseach properly, does this mean that if a Teachta Dála like me, a humble servant of the people, stands up in this Chamber and asks a question, the freedom of information request can be redacted because the troika is watching?

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	59	No, not at all.  My point is the proposal in the programme for Government to restore the Freedom of Information Act to what it was before 2003 cannot be dealt with as expeditiously as I would wish, simply because of the pressure arising from the requirement to introduce other legislative items that are timelined.  In other words, they must be introduced by a certain date to comply with the conditions that have been signed off in respect of the EU-IMF bailout deal.  It has nothing to do with freedom of information.  The Government has a particular problem in that quite a number of legislative items must be processed and drafted.  The heads of those Bills must be approved, they must come before the Government to be approved and then come through both Houses to be passed within certain timelines.  Obviously, the month of August is a time when those who are involved in drafting legislation take their holidays.  While the Dáil will come back earlier than previously, the Government must produce, process and have passed quite a number of Bills that are required if it is to meet the conditions that have been signed off in respect of the troika.  This is the only reference I wish to make to that.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	64	My question is related to the application of the Act to the Taoiseach's Department.  My essential point is that in the past questions and requests on economic and social issues were answered by the Taoiseach in a fully open way.  By converting much of his Department into a Cabinet secretariat, particularly with regard to economic and social issues, whether by design or otherwise, the impact will be to cut off much of its work from parliamentary and public oversight.  We need to work out how we can ensure parliamentary oversight is not undermined by the new arrangements and structures within the Department, particularly with regard to the issue of Cabinet confidentiality and how these issues are dealt with in Cabinet sub-committees.  The Taoiseach asked for some examples and details of how the Department is restrictive.  I refer to the jobs initiative as being a classic illustration of the point I am making.  Despite repeated requests, no background material has been provided for me.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	65	On a point of clarification, I am not turning the Department of the Taoiseach into a Cabinet secretariat.  It will operate as a Cabinet secretariat, but it retains its functions and constitutional position.  However, it is important as a driver for implementing Government policy by co-ordination through the Cabinet sub-committee system and with all Ministers, whom I meet on a regular basis.The jobs initiative was focused on by the Government without background material because providing jobs at a time when there is an unemployment rate of more than 14% has to be a priority for any Government.  It is not a case of having a certain number of boxes filled with background material on jobs initiatives.  Any politician, any public representative, can provide ideas which are backed up by information from the relevant sectors on how jobs might be created.  In order to pay for the creation of these jobs, the Deputy will be aware that the Government imposed a four year levy on the pensions industry which will kick in from 1 July.  I hope the thousands of jobs involved in upskilling and retraining and the schools and roads maintenance programmes, as well as those generated in the tourism and hospitality sectors will bring about a restoration of confidence in the short term.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	66	I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 13 together.The following Cabinet sub-committees have met since they were established: the Cabinet sub-committee on Irish and the Gaeltacht has met on two occasions, on 14 April and 9 May; the Cabinet sub-committee on social policy met once on 9 June; the Cabinet sub-committee on economic recovery and jobs had its first meeting on 26 May; the first meeting of the Cabinet sub-committee on economic infrastructure took place on 2 June.  The Government economic management council has met 20 times to date, most recently on 17 June.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	67	What are the roles and functions of the sub-committees as they have operated since they were set up by Taoiseach?  With regard to economic recovery and job creation, will the Taoiseach inform the House if he has a new strategy to try to address the critical problem of mass unemployment which clearly will hardly be touched by the jobs initiative which was scaled down from a major jobs budget?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	68	The function of Cabinet sub-committees is to focus on issues and matters of importance to particular sectors.  The sectors covered by the Cabinet sub-committees are relevant to everyday life in order that the committees will have an opportunity to focus and concentrate on particular areas of importance and make decisions on them to be referred back to the Cabinet for final approval.  Of course, the position on unemployment is completely unacceptable and the problem will not be dealt with by a specific jobs initiative on its own.  It has to be dealt with by cutting Government costs, becoming more competitive, allowing for the opportunity for businesses to flourish, removing obstacles to business and employment potential, continuing to send out a message internationally that Ireland's reputation should be revised upwards and that there is an opportunity for a continued foreign direct investment and demonstrating that we have a young and flexible workforce capable of meeting whatever challenge of change is coming down the line.This is how major unemployment will be dealt with.  Central to that until now has been a lack of confidence in our indigenous economy and a lack of credit available for small businesses to expand and change action.  That is why the Government decision on dealing with six dysfunctional banks and deleveraging the two pillar banks, Bank of Ireland and AIB, will result in approximately €10 billion in credit being available each year for the next three years.Through the economic management council I will require that banks demonstrate what new lending and credit they have available for business in order that people can be gainfully employed and employers can get on with their business of doing what they do best, which is exporting, manufacturing and employing people.

I did not think he or the Minister for Health dealt with the question well.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	70	The Deputy is straying from the question.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	72	That is not the question.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	75	Following the discussions that we had at the Cabinet committee on social policy, as health is of such importance to the general well-being of our nation I considered it sufficiently important to form a specific Cabinet committee dealing with health.  It has not yet been formalised but will be by next week and Ministers involved in health will obviously serve on it.  It will focus on the myriad issues in the area of health that need attention, as distinct from the Cabinet dealing on an extensive basis with matters related to health.The Minister for Health has pointed out what has been going on in regard to non-consultant hospital doctors and the difficulties we have had as a country because of the registration facility that exists here.  When we moved away from temporary registration we lost the opportunity to bring in many junior doctors or non-consultant hospital doctors to the extent that we should have.  The Government considered the issue today and changes will be introduced.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	77	No, it is not.  The Deputy's question referred to the number of meetings that have been held of each of the Cabinet sub-committees since their establishment.  Whether another committee has been formed is a separate question.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	78	There are now nine Cabinet sub-committees, four of which deal with economic issues, from the economic management council to economic infrastructure and so on.  It is extraordinary that the Taoiseach has not set a target for job creation and a reduction in the number of unemployed if, as he has said, he is putting such emphasis on economic issues in Cabinet sub-committees.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	79	The Deputy is also straying from the question he asked.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	87	It is not because the Taoiseach has not read it out.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	88	It is a question about sub-committees.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	89	No.  If the Deputy listened to the answer the Taoiseach gave, he did not give that information.  Therefore the Deputy's question is not in order.  I call Deputy Martin to proceed.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	92	I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 15 together.I understand that separate questions have been addressed by the Deputy to relevant Ministers regarding the costs incurred by their Departments in regard to these visits.  With regard to my own Department, the final total costs of the recent visits by Queen Elizabeth II and President Barack Obama are not yet finalised.  The projected cost of the visit by Queen Elizabeth is approximately €11,000 in respect of my Department.  The bulk of this expenditure relates to the catering and transport arrangements for the wreath-laying ceremony in the War Memorial Gardens, Islandbridge.  In excess of 570 guests attended this ceremony.  The projected cost of the visit of President Obama is approximately €600,000.  The main area of expenditure was the organisation of the large-scale public event in College Green.  I anticipate that the US Government will make some contribution towards the cost of that event, but the precise amount has yet to be finalised.  These costs must be seen in the context of the historic nature of the visits and the opportunities they present not only for trade, investment and tourism, but also in enhancing Ireland's international reputation and profile at a critical juncture.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	93	The Taoiseach forgot to answer Question No. 15.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	94	No.  I thought he answered it.  Did the Taoiseach forget to answer Question No. 15?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	95	No.  I said I would take both questions together.  The first question is about the cost to my Department and I have outlined that for the Deputy.  The second question concerned the total cost to the State of the visits.  I do not have that information because it has not yet been finalised from each of the individual Departments involved.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	96	In fairness, four weeks after the events, I think the Taoiseach should have a good estimate to report to Dáil Éireann.  The costs for his own Department are relatively small compared with what the overall national cost will be.  I want to hear the Taoiseach's current estimate of the overall national cost.  I am sure he has inquired about that and has been told.  With regard to the US Government's subvention, I think the Taoiseach should ask it to pay for the whole lot considering that it cost us perhaps €20 billion in vetoing the burning of bondholders in bad banks.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	97	The Deputy was doing grand up to now, but he is straying away.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	98	We might be talking about tens of millions of euro, so I hope the Taoiseach will give Members an estimate.  Parents and children throughout the country are getting word that their special needs assistants in schools are being disgracefully cut.  We had parents at the gates of Leinster House today in great distress——
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	99	That is a totally different question.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	100	——because their children are losing special needs assistants.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	101	The Deputy is totally out of order.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	102	How does the Taoiseach justify this huge cost of the recent State visits while making those disgraceful cuts at the same time?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	103	It is four weeks after the event.  I am quite sure that in Deputy Higgins's own election, it took more than four weeks to finalise how he spent the €41,000 allowance he received as an Independent.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	104	You cannot spend that allowance on the election.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	105	I must correct the Taoiseach again because he has made a false allegation or statement.  I am not an Independent Deputy.  I am a member of the Socialist Party and the United Left Alliance.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	106	Gabh mo leithscéal.  My apologies.

The Deputy is the leader of the esteemed Socialist Party.  I stand corrected.I expect the final cost of both State visits will be somewhat in excess of €20 million.  The estimated generated separate print and media broadcast pieces were more than 38,000.  The estimated cost of that is about €300 million, not to mention the impact in terms of Ireland's status and reputation and the global coverage that both visits received during that week.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	112	The role of developing commercial strategies for the post office network is a matter for the board and management of An Post and one in which I have no statutory function.  The legislation establishing An Post, the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act 1983 requires the company to provide counter services for its own and Government business, and other uses that the company sees fit.Responsibility for motor tax policy and legislation lies with my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, and any decisions around the outsourcing of the collection and issuing of motor tax certificates would be a matter for him.  I have no statutory function in this matter and I have had no discussions with either the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government or the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport in this regard.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	113	In this case a commercial company could not decide to do something unless the Government decided to give it the function to do so.  Does the Minister consider it would be a good idea to make this service available locally as it would have the treble advantage of localising a service, reducing the carbon footprint of people travelling to the central towns to purchase their car tax, and increasing the viability of the post office system and using it to maximum effect?  Does the Minister intend to have formal discussions with his colleagues to bring forward this issue and provide this service locally?
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	114	I agree that anything that enhances the viability of the post office network is worthy of consideration.  However, winning Government contracts perhaps ought not be the first focus of An Post from here on out because increasingly more Government business is going online and that will have its own implications.  There is no reason An Post ought not be able to win new commercial contracts.  With initiatives such as its Postfone arrangement with Vodafone and so on, it has started to do that and that is likely to be more productive.  Approximately 77% of revenue currently comes from Government contracts.  Whereas I am all in favour of An Post capturing new business in the State or elsewhere, it is in the commercial area that its future lies.I have had discussions with An Post management about the future of An Post and the extraordinary challenges facing it because of electronic substitution and so on.  It has made enormous progress recently and is involved in a major restructuring programme.  It is well aware of further commercial possibilities.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	115	Is it not convenient for people to pay their car tax in local post offices instead of making round trips of, for example, 100 or 120 miles?  I am surprised by the Minister's negative attitude.  As he knows, people have been able to get car tax online and through the post for many years, but many still choose to visit their local authorities.  One can see the queues every month.  Will the Minister pursue this issue, given that people must now travel considerable distances to avail of an extra customer service that used to be provided to them locally?
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	116	I am all in favour of An Post getting business wherever it can since it has the most extensive retail presence in the country.  From memory, it has 1,345 post offices.  I can recall no other organisation that has such a network nationwide.  As to the matter the Deputy is pursuing, one can already get one's tax online.  I am happy to speak to my colleagues about the issue formally.  I have spoken to them unofficially.  Within the Act, it is not my function to canvass for business for An Post, but I am happy to speak to my colleagues in that regard.In recent years, An Post's great success has been the provision of financial services in an arrangement with two banks.  Given the banks' attitude, the constraints on them following the hames the Deputy's Government made of supervising them and the crash, there will be a greater possibility for An Post to enter into arrangements with the banks concerning the provision of financial services to the type of customer to whom the Deputy referred.  Post offices see a significant footfall, constitute a tremendous retail network and have delivered expertise in terms of An Post's arrangements with the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA.  Those products have been successful and there is greater potential for An Post in that respect.

It is proposed that streamlined and restructured semi-State agencies will make significant additional investments over and above current plans during the next four years in next generation infrastructure in terms of energy, broadband, forestry and water.Proposals are being developed for the Government's consideration on the formal establishment of NewERA.  Intensive cross-departmental engagement is ongoing and I hope to be in a position to set up NewERA within the next three to four weeks.  I am committed to ensuring speedy progress is made in this regard.  One of the key objectives is the leveraging of additional investment and employment from streamlined and restructured commercial State bodies.  The Government has made clear its intention to ensure State companies play a full role in our economic recovery.  The energy companies are already engaged in significant programmes of development.  We must ensure all the investment programmes of the State companies are cost effective, strategic and subject to rigorous shareholder scrutiny and, where appropriate, regulatory oversight.  NewERA will have a key role to play in this regard on behalf of the Government.

For example, a new State company to manage the water network is a part of the NewERA programme.  During last week's debate, the House agreed that such an authority would be required to tackle the significant wastage of water.  However, the clear signal coming from quarters that appear to have sympathy with some of the Minister of State's Cabinet colleagues is that the establishment of such an entity and the introduction of meters would prepare the ground for the company's privatisation.  In light of this fear, I would like it if the Minister of State could clarify the matter.

Irish Water will be a State-owned entity, not a private one, and it will not be privatised.  The management of our water infrastructure will be by a State entity.  The Deputy need have no fears in that regard.The Deputy's second point related to the programme for Government, which states that €2 billion from the sale of non-strategic State assets will be used to finance the NewERA investment programme.  However, that which is essential for the State will remain in State ownership.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	130	I propose to take Questions Nos. 29 and 30 together.The genesis of the report of the advisory group on media mergers was the establishment of an advisory group by the then Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment in 2008 to review the current legislative framework regarding the public interest aspects of media mergers in Ireland.  The advisory group was specifically asked to examine the provisions of the Competition Act 2002 regarding media mergers.  Media mergers are subject to the normal clearance provisions under the Act.  The Act prescribes that, where the Competition Authority decides that a merger may not be put into effect because it would have the effect of substantially lessening competition, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation has no role.  If the Competition Authority determines that a merger should be put into effect with or without conditions, however, the Minister is mandated under the Act to consider such mergers having regard to the "relevant criteria" as specified in Part 3.  These criteria, essentially the public interest criteria, relate to the diversity and plurality of views in the Irish public sphere, the strength and competitiveness of media businesses indigenous to the State, and the dispersion of media ownership among individuals and other undertakings.  Following consideration of the "relevant criteria", that is, the public interest criteria, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation may decide that the merger be put into effect, be put into effect subject to conditions or not be put into effect.This advisory group reported in June 2008 to the then Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the report was noted by the Government in November 2008 and published in January 2009.  The report contains 11 principal recommendations, for example, that there should be a statutory definition of media plurality, that the Competition Act should be amended to incorporate a statutory test to be applied by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in the discharge of his or her function in respect of media mergers, the current definition of the "relevant criteria" should be replaced, there should be an ongoing collection and periodic publication of information and employment of concrete indicators in respect of media plurality in the State, and that the definition of media business should be amended to include the publication of newspapers and periodicals over the Internet and the broadcasting of certain audiovisual material over the Internet.  Implementation of the advisory group's recommendations will require the introduction of primary legislation.  The advisory group report points out that there are some indications of a trend towards the concentration of ownership and this may accelerate depending on economic circumstances.  Global trends also reveal a tendency by large media corporations to acquire other media organisations on a continuing basis.The audiovisual media business in Ireland is subject to the same technological advances, growth of new media, globalisation and convergence of what were formerly separate businesses.  These rapid advances in communication technologies, including, in particular, Internet based media offerings provide for freedom of expression and a plurality of voices but may also concentrate media in large conglomerates not subject to Irish jurisdiction.  I agree with the general view that with increasing technological advances, growth of new media and convergence of what were formerly separate businesses, new media is becoming inextricably interlinked.  These fundamental changes mean that the traditional print media business is migrating to audiovisual media and the Internet in a rapidly globalising print and audiovisual media landscape.Additional Information not given on the floor of the House.On this basis, I see an increasing role for my Department and the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland in the media mergers area as desirable.  Nevertheless, Deputies may wish to note that the report of the advisory group recommended that the public interest test in relation to media mergers should reside with the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, who, I understand, intends to shortly bring legislative proposals in this area to Government.  I will give my views on these matters to Government at that stage.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	131	I thank the Minister for his reply from which I take it primary legislation on redefining what is meant by statutory media plurality will be introduced at some stage.  Perhaps the Minister will indicate what these redefinitions will be and if he has any fears in regard to cross media directorships or the undesirability, as expressed in the report, of there being a lack of diversity in current media.  Lest I get into trouble, I should at this point declare an interest in this area.  I am not sure whether I will in this regard be promoted or demoted for having raised this subject.  As an employee and former business editor of the Sunday Independent I have a particular interest in this matter.Perhaps the Minister will indicate if there is any reason for concern about cross media directorships or lack of diversity.  Also, he might indicate when we can expect primary legislation with a new definition of media plurality.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	132	I have had initial discussions on this matter with my colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton.  While broadcast and related media are the responsibility of the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, print media and mergers are the responsibility of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.Deputy Ross referred to the report on this matter.  It is my tentative understanding from discussions with my colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, that he will bring forward legislation in this area.  It is likely — the Deputy should not hold me to this — to repose responsibility in one or other Department.  As the Deputy stated in his question we are living in a period of growing cross ownership of the media.  The Deputy asked whether I have concerns about cross ownership.  Yes, I have.  I believe undue concentration of ownership in the Irish media is unhealthy for our democracy.  This area of the media is different to other areas of enterprise endeavour in the sense that it conditions the quality of our public discourse and democracy.  If the convergence of technologies about which we have been speaking were to lead to undue concentration of ownership or, of cross directorships, it would be unhealthy for the democratic health of our society.  We are examining the issue.  It is hoped it will be possible to act on most of the recommendations of the report we are discussing.

Is the Minister happy with the current situation and does he believe we genuinely have a diverse and healthy mix of ownership?  Also, will the Minister indicate when primary legislation might be published and introduced into the House?Would the Minister agree it is important that we maintain a strong State hold on the public broadcasting sector?  Also, what is the Minister's view on keeping the new digital channels in State ownership?
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	134	Deputy Ross's question raises broader issues than those which come within my responsibilities in that it encompasses a question in regard to plurality in the media.  Deputy Ó Cuív asked how soon the legislation will be brought forward.  The legislation will be brought forward by my colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton.  I imagine it is a technical and difficult issue for which to legislate.  I note that the previous Government, of which Deputy Ó Cuív was a member, despite receiving the report in June 2008 had not managed to publish a Bill between June 2008 and March 2011.  That may be because it did not want to kick sleeping dogs as it passed or that it did not have the time to deal with the complexities undoubtedly wrapped up in this issue.  We will deal with the matter as soon as we can.I accept what the Deputy had to say in regard to the convergence of technologies.  They are, as the Deputy might say, fite fuaite and that has to be taken into account in the legislation.  I hope we will continue to have a thriving public sector broadcaster.  I take this opportunity to offer my congratulations to RTE on its remarkable achievement as announced last night and this morning in terms of the performance of RTE radio as No. 1 in the global assessment.  I hope that will continue to be the case as part of a diverse media where no particular acceptable view in society is excluded.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	135	I thank the Minister for his reply, which is helpful.  The Minister said that primary legislation to deal with this highly technical issue would be introduced but that it might take some time.  Things move fast in the media world.  What measures could the Government take to enforce the laudable principles it espouses if in the meantime they are offended prior to introduction of the legislation?
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	136	Perhaps the Minister will clarify if the new digital spectrum now available to RTE will be held in State hands or auctioned out to private interests, with the consequence of adding to the emerging problem, if it is not already an established problem?
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	137	We are not talking about the medium or long term in terms of tidying up this area.  The Bill will be before the House in a reasonable time.  However, if what Deputy Ross fears or anticipates happens, then current powers ought to be adequate if the political will exists to intervene.  In my direct experience going back over the years, it is political will that has been absent.  Although there are some 11 recommendations in the report to modernise the legislation, to acknowledge we are now dealing with a convergence of media that was never the case before, the measures that are in place in the legislation provide adequate power if the political will is there to implement them.I assure Deputy Ó Cuív there is no intention that the switch to digital should mean it will go outside the hands of the State broadcaster.  If the commercial revenue was there and if in better economic circumstances there might be the possibility of additional multiplexes in terms of some of the private sector companies renting space and so on, that is something I would not be averse to considering.  However, there is no question of the existing capacity going outside.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	138	In recent years there has been renewed interest in targeting the natural gas resource potential of the onshore north-west carboniferous or Lough Allen basin.  This potential had been identified in earlier exploration but was not considered commercially viable at the time.  In February of this year, following an open competition, my Department awarded two two-year onshore petroleum licensing options to Tamboran Resources Limited and the Lough Allen Natural Gas Company Limited over parts of the basin.The licensing options awarded are designed to allow the companies assess the natural gas and shale gas potential of the acreage.  This work will be largely based on desktop studies of existing data from previous petroleum exploration activity.  Exploration drilling is not allowed under these authorisations but shallow geological sampling is permitted.  Exploration activity under these authorisations is at an early stage and there is no certainty that it will lead to applications for follow-on exploration licences that would be required before exploration wells could be drilled.In the event that hydraulic fracturing was envisaged as part of a possible future exploration or production programme, then that activity would be subject to an environmental impact assessment, including an appropriate public consultation phase.
#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	139	We have both had fracturing in the past, although, unlike the Minister, I am not in denial.With regard to the Lough Allen project, in particular hydraulic fracturing, or "fracking", as it is known, is the Minister aware of the international concerns in regard to this exploration methodology?  In particular, in a number of areas where this methodology was used, such as Louisiana and Texas in the United States, the consequences for people living in the areas were serious due to the detrimental effect it had on the water table, which it contaminated to the point that the water was not useable and residents could not continue living in their own houses.  If the Minister is aware of this, he will agree there needs to be a public investigation at least into the consequences of adopting this exploration methodology.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	140	I am aware there are concerns in the United States about the process to which Deputy Ferris refers.  When this matter first came to my attention, I did not appreciate that the work going on consisted largely of desktop studies of existing data.  Therefore, the notion one could fall into a terrible hole around Lough Allen is not exactly in accord with what is happening.  I am also aware that a horror movie is being hawked around the country with the implication that dreadful things are going on in the Lough Allen basin.  When I found that all of this was a few chaps in front of a computer screen, I had to take a rain check with regard to what is happening.If the data suggests there is merit in continuing the process further into exploration, the exploration companies must come back to get an environmental impact assessment and then seek permission.  I do not know that this is in prospect at present.  If it is, we will consider it when it happens.
#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	141	I welcome that the Minister is prepared to, let us say, investigate the consequences of fracking in other jurisdictions.  I am not referring to any horror movie.  I understand a very alarming presentation was made by some group but I understand it had nothing to do with fracking and related more to the consequences for the landscape which result from exploration.  However, I have concerns about fracking given the information of which I have been made aware.  It has had a detrimental effect on people's homes and many had to leave their homes as a result of the methodology used.  Fracking involves putting pressurised water into the hole being drilled, which expands any cracks in the rock formation and leads to gas escaping into the water.  I suggest the Minister needs to get expert advice from jurisdictions where things have gone wrong.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	142	I would be as concerned as the Deputy if the fallout in this case was as he fears.  I believe we are a very long way from that and I assure people who live in the area that this is not the case.  I am aware there are concerns in the United States and that the French Parliament not long ago banned the practice of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, as Deputy Ferris refers to it.  There are certainly concerns about its application in this jurisdiction.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	143	I am happy to report that thanks to a combination of significant private and public investment in broadband provision, the vast majority of premises here, including many hard-to-reach rural premises, can now avail of at least a basic broadband service.  The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband services, is a matter in the first instance for private sector service providers operating in a liberalised market regulated by the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.  The State will also intervene in the market where there is evidence of clear market failure.The national broadband scheme and the recently-launched rural broadband scheme are examples of such intervention.  These interventions must be on a technology-neutral basis to comply with EU competition law.  Completion of the national broadband scheme roll-out last October means that all premises in the national broadband scheme target areas now have access to broadband services.  The recently-launched rural broadband scheme is specifically aimed at targeting those few remaining premises in rural non-national broadband scheme areas that for whatever reason are still unable to avail of a service from a commercial provider.My Department is currently accepting applications under this scheme and will continue to do so until 29 July next.  I encourage all Deputies to make constituents aware of the existence of this scheme and my Department will undertake some further promotional work in this respect between now and the end of July.  I am satisfied, therefore, that Ireland will comfortably meet its EU target of having basic broadband available to everyone by 2013.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.My Department does not collect or possess the type of statistical data referred to in the Deputy's question.  However, ComReg, in its role as regulator and promoter of competition in the Irish market publishes quarterly data on a national level which provides a wide range of information in regard to broadband penetration by technology platform.  This statistical information on the Irish electronic communications market and benchmark data from other countries is collected and analysed by ComReg's trend unit and is available on its website, www.comstat.ie

The fixed wireless-mobile wireless is excellent in some areas, but is non-existent or of uneven quality in many other areas.  Even copper wire or DSL Internet access can be of uneven quality in many rural areas.  When another €18 million is being spent on getting broadband to customers on that last mile, the Minister should ensure we have minimum standards and that the Department drills down to where the problems are so that we get broadband to every house in the next two years.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	145	I am aware of the Deputy's interest in the subject because he has been in contact with me on more than one occasion about it.  I am fairly convinced that we will have 99% penetration if not by the end of this year, certainly by next year.  The problem, as he pointed out, often relates to the last mile and often relates to the bandwidth and speeds rather than the availability of basic broadband.  I am considering a number of measures in this regard.  I have recently convened a task force, chaired by me and comprising the chief executive officers of the telecommunications companies and Internet providers.  Its purpose is to set down a roadmap for the future with the purpose of having a national broadband plan with effect from as early in 2012 as we can, that will deal with the undoubted issues of quality, to which the Deputy refers.  Where there are still outstanding premises throughout rural areas, but not exclusively in rural areas, that for reasons of topography or not being able to reach the Cabinet or whatever, do not have broadband, I would like colleagues to advise them of the existence of the rural broadband scheme, which closes on 29 July.  If there are such areas in rural Ireland, I would appreciate Deputies promulgating the fact that the scheme exists and counselling people to make application.

It has ensured that a wide swathe of the country without service has received service.  However, I am perplexed that the Minister has become a great proponent of the liberal private sector in his conversion to liberal economics.  I would have thought the Minister would have set a national minimum standard to which everyone would have had access.

Everybody would agree that while the national broadband scheme has provided a basic level, there are still issues because the demand for it has been so great.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	149	My conversion to the merits of private sector involvement in this area is as nothing compared with the conversion that has befallen the Deputy since he went into opposition.  He seems to expect that in 14 weeks I can remedy the mistakes his governments made in 14 years, which is stretching it a bit.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	153	We did not recover from the disaster of the privatisation of Telecom Éireann and the fact that it was ripped off successively purely for the purpose of asset stripping and taking money from it, meaning that the investment was not made when we had competitive advantage.  While that is history now, it is something that must be corrected.  The EU targets are that every household would have 30 megabits by 2020 and I am satisfied that we will easily achieve that.  I am satisfied that by 2013 every house will have broadband.  The private sector is making an investment of €400 million to €500 million going into the enhancement of quality at the moment.  I am satisfied that we will comfortably beat the targets.  I accept Deputy Twomey's basic contention that there are parts of the country where the quality is not yet good enough.  I had the opportunity to launch the metropolitan area network in Claremorris on Friday night.  Deputy Ó Cuív's Government spent €177 million in putting in the fibre optic networks in 94 towns, but all these years later only approximately 30 of them are lit.  Was it the most prudent investment?  I accept it was well intentioned, but based on the experience, it is a matter of some concern.  I am working with e|net to improve it.

I expect that the Minister for public expenditure and reform will consider the responses of all affected Departments and bring proposals on the report to Government in due course.It is accepted that the acute current and foreseeable fiscal situation facing the State demands that all measures that can assist in this regard be examined.  There is no doubt that the McCarthy report is a comprehensive overview of the issue and its recommendations merit serious consideration.  The study and recommendations of the review group encompass very significant areas of responsibility for my Department.  Of the 16 commercial State bodies referred to on page 2 of the review group report, eight are under the aegis of my Department.  In addition, the report also dealt extensively with regulation, and three regulators — ComReg, the Commission for Energy Regulation and the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland — are also my responsibility.While I do not propose at this juncture to comment on specific recommendations, I strongly support the view that consideration of the sale of State assets should be set in the context of the wider public interest, including sectoral and economic policy and not simply as a revenue raising exercise.  The report strongly recommends against a fire-sale of assets and underlines important complementary policy initiatives, which it concludes must be progressed in advance of sale of certain assets.More generally, any disposal of State assets, especially those in the ownership of commercial State companies, must be undertaken on a fully informed basis and consistent with wider sectoral policy in the area.  This must include best practice valuation of the asset, which it is proposed to sell, assessment of the impact of such a sale on Government policy objectives in the areas in question, appropriate consultation with stakeholders, and, in the event that disposal is deemed appropriate, timing of disposal to maximise value for the owner.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.Turning specifically to the energy State companies, the importance of the electricity and gas infrastructure and supply chain to national economic and social development cannot be emphasised strongly enough.  Electricity and gas are the lifeblood of economic production in the high-tech ICT sector, the employment-intensive services sector and indigenous sectors such as farming.  They are also fundamental to key social services such as health and education.Because Ireland has such a reliable and relatively modern electricity and gas infrastructure we almost take it for granted.  We must always remember that the creation of a modern and reliable energy networks system did not happen by accident.  It arose from extensive and well executed investment by State owned companies, notably the ESB and Bord Gáis.  These investments were funded without recourse to the taxpayer but on the back of well run and profitable State companies, which have garnered the trust of the capital markets to enable them to raise the necessary funding.Good regulation, and professional management and operation of the transmission network by EirGrid have further contributed to our excellent networks infrastructure and the introduction of strong competition in the generation and supply business.  The overall outcome is a modern electricity and gas sector and an evolution to average EU prices from a position where Ireland used to be well in excess of the EU average.The importance of the electricity and gas sectors to economic and social development place the sectors in a unique position in the context of public policy and the national interest.  Important issues in these sectors will fall to be addressed by the Government in the medium term.  These arise in part from the report on the sale of State assets, about which the Deputy has posed his question, but more significantly, from EU legislative requirements and developments.  We must prepare for the development over time of a pan-European energy market served by interconnection.  Ireland will be a small part of a very large European regional electricity and gas market.  This inevitable development must strongly inform energy policy, including that relating to ownership and structure of State energy companies.Given the importance of the sector to the very economic and social functioning of the State, the State must continue to have a strong and direct presence in generation, networks and supply.  This must be done in a way that protects overall economic competitiveness and does not deter private sector investment in generation and supply.  This approach does not preclude extracting value from the strong and profitable State companies that we have built.  The process of extracting such value and implementation of any other structural change within the State energy sector must meet the test that they are in the public interest in its widest sense.The review group also proposed the sale of RTE Networks.  This company is a key player in the major task of switching over to digital terrestrial television and switching off the analogue system.  This is a hugely important project to be completed by 2012.  I would not wish to see this timeline endangered by fundamental structural change.The report also makes a number of other recommendations which impact on areas of my Department.  I will give all recommendations serious consideration and make my specific views known to Government in the first instance.

Is the Minister prepared to resist the more radical proposals in the McCarthy report that favour extensive sales of assets and the preparation of key companies for eventual privatisation, in whole or in part?
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	157	I broadly agree with the Deputy that the selling off of State assets can be short-sighted and we do not have a great record in that regard.  Deputy Ó Cuív and I had an exchange of views on the fall-out from the manner in which Telecom Éireann was privatised and the way it set back the economic potential of the country by depriving it of the investment that would have been necessary for the rolling out of broadband which, like electricity in the middle of the last century, is critical in this century for economic development and social progress.I am not sure the sale of the Irish Sugar Company was very advisable either.  I was in the House when the first stake was sold, in 1990 or 1991, if memory serves.  The Minister in charge of the privatising argued vehemently that it was not privatisation because the Government was keeping a golden share which it would always be able to exercise.  In the event, we lost the sugar industry, unnecessarily in my view.  I recall a presentation made to me in Mallow after the Carlow closure which was purely a property play.  Mallow was making arrangements to transfer the Carlow machinery to its plant and the capacity existed to transfer the beet from the Carlow-Kilkenny region.  However, the industry was sold — in the interest of the developing world, as we were told, but more in the interest of ranchers in Brazil and elsewhere.For that reason, I agree broadly with Deputy Ferris.  The problem is that the country is broke as a result of the decisions taken by Deputy Ó Cuív and his colleagues in Government.  The deal they made with the IMF, the EU and the ECB provides for some disposal of State assets.  The programme for Government provides for up to €2 billion in total of a sale of State assets to invest in employment stimulation elsewhere in the economy.  The short answer to Deputy Ferris's question is that if I had a choice and we were not in the mess we are in I would not be in favour of disposal of further State assets.  My broad view is I am satisfied to assess them one by one, and this may well throw up a situation where it would not damage the economic future of the country to dispose of some of them.

#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	159	There are always choices for the Minister because politics is all about choices.  I ask about another report relating to the ESB, namely, the Cahill report which was carried out by Frontier Consultants.  It relates to the Minister's plan to hand over the transmission assets of the ESB to EirGrid.  The McCarthy report, of course, goes much further than that in respect of the energy assets of the State.  Why has the Minister not published the Cahill report?

#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	161	Will the Deputy ask a question?

Has the Government looked at means, reports or lines of inquiry other than McCarthy?
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	163	This is a key area of concern.  We are reading between the lines as to what the Government intends.

#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	165	Every week at the Whips' meeting I look for the McCarthy report to be on the agenda for debate.  It is high time we had a comprehensive debate on it but this has not been acceded to yet.  Unless we get a comprehensive statement from the Government and have a debate, there will be guesswork and reading between the lines, with people feeling concerned unnecessarily about some of the State assets.  Will the Minister ensure this debate is facilitated by the Government?
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	166	I ask the Minister to be brief, too, as we are in overtime on this question.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	167	To answer Deputy Murphy first, I am happy to facilitate such a debate on the McCarthy report and have no difficulty with it.  I will signal as much to the Government Whip, if that is helpful.  I am happy to debate the issue.Deputy McDonald is right — we still have some choices although not as many as those about which the Deputy waxes eloquent from time to time.  In the tough global world in which we live we want to keep it that way and do not wish to end up like Greece which has very few choices, being faced as it is at present with a demand to sell off billions in euro of its state assets.As to my plan to hand over the transmission assets, I do not know where Deputy McDonald gets this information.  I am not aware of any such plan on my part.  I will gladly publish the Cahill report as soon as the Government has disposed of the issue.  There is no difficulty there.I assure Deputy Buttimer there will not be any fire sale of State assets.  The author of the McCarthy report makes plain in his report he does not advocate that any of these assets ought to be put on eBay next week.  Nobody is recommending that course of action and I certainly do not.  Deputy Buttimer is right that such a sale is not the only panacea in the circumstances in which we find ourselves.  I explained that departments outside my area, such as Coillte, for example, are currently feeding back responses to the McCarthy report.  However, if the wish of the Opposition is to debate the report in the interim, I am happy to facilitate that.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	173	There is a conflict of interests there, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	174	I propose to take Questions Nos. 34 and 38 together.The bio-fuel obligation was enacted and introduced in 2010 to deliver on the mandatory EU target of 10% renewable energy in transport by 2020.  The initial penetration rate set was 4%, which represents almost a doubling of size of the previous bio-fuel market in Ireland.  I am confident that the obligation will promote the sustainable growth of the Irish bio-fuels market, thus supporting the growth of sustainable indigenous production of bio-fuels.  In these first six operational months of the obligation, the 4% market penetration target was achieved, and exceeded.  Preliminary figures to date in 2011 suggest this remains the case.  The bio-fuel obligation ensures Irish consumers have access to appropriately priced, sustainable and reliable sources of bio-fuel by creating a guaranteed market that will require in excess of 220 million litres of bio-fuel in 2011.  The policy of moving to an obligation system was signalled to the market three years before its coming into effect.  This obligation will increase over time and by 2020 will require suppliers of road transport fuels to make certain that even higher percentages of the volumes sold are bio-fuel.  This will ultimately create a market size of almost 500 million litres of bio-fuel.Small-scale indigenous bio-fuel manufacturers are facing ongoing commercial challenges.  Increases in commodity prices have made their position even more difficult.  The price of the feedstocks on which many such producers depend, particularly oilseed rape, has increased substantially.  However, the price they receive for their end product has increased by a much smaller amount.  This effect has been replicated across the European bio-fuel industry.  Temporary plant closures have been announced in the UK market due to the low margins on the product, mainly due to high wheat prices.The bio-fuel obligation scheme which requires large suppliers of road transport fuels to include a certain percentage of bio-fuel in their general fuel mix works on the basis of tradeable certificates.  Suppliers can meet their obligations by placing the bio-fuel on the market or purchasing certificates from companies which sell high blend bio-fuels to the market.  Indigenous producers can access this market by a number of means, including by selling bio-fuel directly to obligated parties, selling into local markets or selling certificates earned to obligated parties.  The price of certificates is set by the market, which ensures the consumer is only exposed to the actual additional cost of the bio-fuel component at a given moment in time.Conversely, placing any minimum value on certificates would lock in the cost impact of the obligation for consumers at a set level.  A level of 41 cent would have an immediate effect on the price of fuel paid by motorists and hauliers by adding over 1.6 cents to the price of every litre sold.  I do not propose to move away from the market approach to certificate pricing.  The obligation scheme provides market players with long-term certainty to develop projects which are economically viable and of scale.  The scheme is designed to facilitate the development of the industry in Ireland, while minimising the cost impact of bio-fuel use on consumers.

Does he accept that without continued support, the indigenous bio-fuel sector will not grow and that people will not be willing to invest in the industry?  What further steps does he intend to take to support the industry through this difficult phase?  As he outlined, the commodity price has increased but the fuel price has not increased consequently.  Although that is obviously good in itself, it creates a huge difficulty for the industry.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	176	As the Deputy is well aware, the difficulty that confronts any Government in this regard is that the subsidy required to accommodate the import behind the question would be prohibitive in the present climate.  I do not accept that the industry will not grow.  It is subject to fluctuations in the prices available in the market to farmers, in particular.  A number of small enterprises of this nature have closed in Britain because of the price available for wheat, for example.  If farmers can get better prices for their products on the market, they tend to go that way rather than servicing small indigenous bio-fuel production companies.  We have had to achieve a good deal of our 4% complement target — as I said, it has been exceeded — by purchasing from outside the jurisdiction.  Farming prices tend to fluctuate.  Prices are good at present, but that has not always been the case and will not always be in the future.  I am talking to different interests to see what we can do in these circumstances.  The subsidy in this instance, like that in the re-fit for wind scheme, is a big issue at a time when the State is otherwise strapped for investment.Written Answers follow Adjournment Debate.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	178	When the jobs initiative was announced, the Taoiseach and the Government decided not to publish any supporting documentation on the impact of the €1.8 billion raid on personal pensions.  This was a direct reversal of the policy that had been pursued for over a decade, whereby all background papers on revenue matters were published on-line.  With other members of my party, I repeatedly asked the Taoiseach to provide briefing material concerning this attack on pensions before putting the measure through the House.  On 11 May he said to me "if there is any outstanding information the Deputy seeks, it will be provided for him, because there is not anything secret here."  Nothing was provided; discussions were cut short and the measure was forced through the House.  It has now emerged that the Taoiseach was informed in April by the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, that the levy could have extremely negative impacts.  She told him well before the levy was announced that it could incentivise or force some pension schemes to close.  She also told him that it would disincentivise retirement savings and have negative long-term implications for pensions policy.  A Department of Finance briefing that he received expressed concerns about the solvency of some funds.  It stated the policy the Government was considering "could seriously undermine the pensions sector".  This extremely serious information suggests the actual cost of the attack on private pensions will be very different from that claimed by the Government.  Why did the Taoiseach decide to keep this information secret until after the measure had been pushed through the Dáil?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	179	I received a routine letter from the Minister, setting out her views on the impact on her Department.  The Deputy's allegation that information was kept secret is without foundation.  As Deputy Martin will be aware, we live in a democracy.  The Government is entitled to make decisions about how it might progress matters that are of interest to the people.  Clearly, the mess the Government inherited in respect of unemployment and the economy generally, warranted a focus on restoring confidence to the indigenous economy.There was technical advice from the Pensions Board.  The Government decided to impose a levy of 0.6% on the pensions industry for four years as a temporary measure bringing in €450 million a year which will be spent directly on focused areas where employment can be created.  As a consequence, the Government altered its decision on VAT with impact directly on the hospitality sector and the labour intensive industries, on the travel tax and on halving employers' PRSI.  These are measures within the jobs initiative that will have a direct impact.Deputy Martin's allegations of subterfuge and issues being kept from people are entirely groundless.  Any individual, Minister or Department can have views on Government proposals and the Minister for Social Protection, in writing a letter expressing concerns about possible impact on her Department, acted quite normally.

The Taoiseach decided to reverse a decade old procedure and he withheld this information from the public until he had pushed the levy through.  That is a fact.I have asked three times in this House for the Taoiseach to publish all background material on the pension levy.  He decided not to do that.  It took freedom of information requests to get that information out at the weekend.  I have had to put down three freedom of information questions to different Ministers to try to get the background to this decision.  The Taoiseach should not try to pass this off as some routine labour protection measure.

I stated that there would be at least 400 vacancies and that this will have a devastating effect on front-line services beyond 11 July.  I asked the Taoiseach to make a statement on this and he declined to do so.  It struck me that the Taoiseach did not know what was happening.  It struck me also that the Minister for Health did not know what was happening.

He stated that he could certainly say this much, that it will not be any of the major ones, and that it is the small rural hospitals where we are going to have real difficulties.  He then went on to say that the crisis will be fixed in so far as it can be fixed.I asked all the chaps and chapettes who are heckling here last week to go in and check what is happening with their local hospitals.  This is not good enough.  The Government needs to allow a debate on this issue and the Taoiseach needs to be able to tell us and the Deputies here.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	224	First, this problem in the shortage of non-consultant hospital doctors or, as they are called, "junior doctors", is not related to funding and is not related to a recruitment embargo or a moratorium.  It is related to an inability to attract enough of doctors to our hospitals.  It is an issue that has affected not only this country, but other countries as well.Second, the Minister for Health is working intensively with the HSE, with his Department, with the Medical Council and a range of other bodies to try to solve this problem before 11 June——
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	225	July.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	226	——when the changeover date occurs.Third, I want Deputy Adams to understand, in fairness, that the HSE mounted a serious recruitment campaign in India and Pakistan and several senior consultants and a number from the HSE travelled to India and Pakistan.  That recruitment drive identified 400 suitable and qualified doctors who could work in Irish hospitals and who are interested in coming here.  In many cases these are doctors with quite a few years of experience gained in hospitals already.The issue is to see how best to secure these doctors to work in Ireland in a manner that will give complete assurance regarding the safety of patients and the standards that are required.  I am sure Deputy Adams would not require anything else.  The problem centres around the fact that under the present arrangements such doctors would have to do an examination that is not totally suitable and that legislation does not allow for a temporary registration facility which is the best way to accommodate incoming doctors in that regard.  While the Minister, Deputy Reilly, is currently putting in place a facility to allow the doctors to face an exam more tailored to their level of experience, he may well amend the law to provide for a temporary registration system for doctors.  It is not about a moratorium, funding or an inability to recruit.  It is about finding a facility that we have let slip in this country by the abolition of temporary registration and the fact that in many cases, as the Minister has pointed out, doctors required to do an examination across the entire medical spectrum might not pass such an examination.  The example he has given is that someone doing surgery might be required to pass an examination on something they have not had surgical experience of for quite some time.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	227	It is like politics.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	228	The Minister, Deputy Reilly, has identified this problem and the delivery of a solution to the problem is his number one priority.  He is receiving every assistance from those involved.  However, when speaking on RTE last night the Minister made it clear that it is unlikely he will be able to fill all the posts by 11 July given the scale and the nature of the problem he faces and he outlined what the facts are in this regard.  I wish to make the point clear: it is not about recruitment inability, a moratorium or funding.  It is about the fact that we do not have a temporary registration facility, which other European countries use to fill spaces at the changeover of non-consultant hospital doctors, in the way we should have.The Minister has identified the root of the problem.  There was a recruitment drive in India and Pakistan and 400 were identified.  It is to have the facility now that will allow the Minister to accommodate this and the Government decided on that this morning.  Let me assure Deputy Adams there will be no compromise on either quality or safety nor should there be.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	229	It is absolute rubbish to say there will be no compromise.  We held this exercise last week as well.  I asked a straight question about what hospitals will not be safely staffed.  The Taoiseach did not answer the question.  The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation stated today that 329 citizens are on trolleys in hospitals throughout the State.  This is before the crisis kicks in.  The fact is there are people out there.  As a health professional the Minister, Deputy Reilly, should have known this before he took up his position as Minister.  He was briefed and I have before me the redacted freedom of information request and his briefing.  One the first day he came in as Minister he was told about this crisis.  Approximately 150 of these doctor positions were substantially vacant and now it has risen to 400.  The question was about which hospitals will not be safely staffed.  People need to know.  I have other questions.

Will the Taoiseach ensure that nurses are given an enhanced role and that consultants will fulfil their contracts and carry out their work in public hospitals?  It is work they are contracted to do.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	232	Deputy Adams strayed from his original question into the consultants contract issue.

It will be a couple of weeks before the Minister will be in a position to inform the House of that.  He has identified the problem and he has identified the solution.  The Government made a decision on it this morning.  As this moves through the system and when the Minister becomes aware of which hospitals are not capable or do not have the capacity to provide a supervised setting for non-consultant hospital doctors, he will so inform the House.  However, there will be no compromise on safety or standard.

#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	245	——for what the Minister for Finance did last Thursday when he announced that he would burn the Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide bondholders.  It is the first time since the Government came to power that it has put the interests of the taxpayer in front of the bondholders and the banks and this should be applauded.  Having said that, I wish to ask about the follow through.  It appears there has been a deafening response from Europe.  Will the Taoiseach confirm, as it appears, the ECB was not informed about this in advance?  It is important to know and it would be a welcome departure and re-emphasis of Government policy in that we are moving to stand up to the ECB, to stand up to Sarkozy and to have our own independent policy on the bondholders and Europe.Our European policy and the policy with regard to the ECB up to now has been singularly unsuccessful.  However, if the Minister, the Taoiseach and the Government are taking the attitude, as the Taoiseach stated here last week or the week before, that it must take note of the attitudes of the peripheral countries, then it should be welcomed.  Is this part of a new departure or is it something old?  What will happen if the ECB says "no"?  Will we unilaterally burn the bondholders?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	246	I held some brief discussion with Deputy Ross about the Committee of Public Accounts.  He is an experienced Deputy and I am sure he will do very well on that committee in the investigations they carry out.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	247	I forgive the Taoiseach.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	248	I am sure he will do well out of that.  There has been no change, rather a consistency from the Government in respect of Anglo Irish Bank, Irish Nationwide Building Society, INBS, and the bondholders.  The Minister for Finance clarified that he will raise the matter of the different circumstances of senior bondholders in Anglo Irish Bank with the ECB in autumn.  Those in the ECB were not aware of the Minister's comment.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	249	Good.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	250	They were not forewarned of his comment because his comment was consistent with what has been the position of Government: the bondholders in Anglo Irish Bank are in different circumstances to those in Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland.  Those in the ECB made it clear on the day of the publication of the stress tests of the Irish banks that, irrespective of a potential downgrading by the ratings agencies, they would continue to guarantee liquidity into the Irish banking system.  In the context of where Ireland finds itself at the moment this is a demonstration that the bailout facility can work and that where a country is capable of making the changes, challenging though these may be for its people and economy, it can head in the right direction toward being in charge of its economic affairs again.  From this perspective the Minister, Deputy Noonan, has pointed out the consistent Government view of the different circumstances that apply to senior bondholders in Anglo Irish Bank.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	251	I thank the Taoiseach.  It is a helpful response and it is welcome to be certain that the Minister did not tell the ECB in advance.  It shows an independence of which we should show more.  Unfortunately, the Minister came straight back, went to Europe yesterday and fell back into the friendly embrace of Madame Lagarde again.

#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	255	Come on.  This is not just about Madame Lagarde, and I do not want to personalise it too much.  Despite this extraordinary courting of France in which we have been engaged, we did not get any cut in the interest rate yesterday.  What has been the result of these constant meetings with the French Minister of Finance and in what way have they paid off for Ireland?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	256	French courtship has been a matter of considerable comment over the centuries.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, gets on very well in a professional capacity with all of his colleagues in Europe.  The French have been very helpful in respect of Ireland's case and those of other countries in terms of the changes on preferred creditor status in regard to the European Stability Mechanism.  France and Ireland get on very well in areas besides the rugby field such as the agri-economy and our support for reform of the Common Agricultural Policy and other areas in regard to the development of the Single Market.The French Minister of Economic Affairs, Finances and Industry, Ms Lagarde, has a complete understanding of the challenge facing Ireland and was very strong and forthright in her view on the positive change brought about the Ministers in Luxemburg in regard to the change in so far as preferred creditor status is concerned.  For a country like Ireland, which has no wish or intention of being involved in a permanent bailout facility such as the ESM, this is a positive move by the Ministers for Finance and is something in which the French played a central and strong part.The question of the interest rate did not arise and was not discussed yesterday because of the overriding imperative of dealing with the situation regarding the Greek Government and economy.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, in going to Luxemburg, was very clear in his view that what was needed from the Luxemburg decision was, irrespective of what decision might be arrived at in regard to Greece, that Ireland and countries like Ireland would be protected.  He has achieved that and is to be commended on so doing.

It will also lose its special needs assistant and its resource teacher.

Although mindful of the horrendous job facing the Minister for Health, who should not be blamed in trying to deal with the budgetary cutbacks that have to be implemented by the Health Service Executive, cutting home help hours and obliging people to be cared for in hospital will potentially cost the State more than caring for these persons at home.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	263	It is proposed to take No. 10, motion re referral to joint committee of the proposed approval by Dáil Éireann of the Harbours Acts 1996 to 2009 (Transfer of Functions of Dundalk Port Company) Order 2011; No. 11, motion re the ministerial rota for parliamentary questions; No. 12, motion re membership of committees; No. 13, motion re the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009; No. 14, motion re the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998; and No. 5, the Central Bank and Credit Institutions (Resolution) (No. 2) Bill 2011 — Order for Second Stage and Second Stage.It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that: Nos. 10, 11 and 12 shall be decided without debate; proceedings in regard to No. 13 shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion after 45 minutes and the following arrangements shall apply: speeches shall be confined to a Minister or Minister of State and to the main spokespersons for Fianna Fáil, Sinn Féin and the Technical Group, who shall be called upon in that order, may share their time and whose contributions shall not exceed ten minutes in each case; and a Minister or Minister or State shall be called upon to make a speech in reply which will not exceed five minutes; proceedings in regard to No. 14 shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion after 45 minutes and the following arrangements shall apply: speeches shall be confined to a Minister or Minister of State and to the main spokespersons for Fianna Fáil, Sinn Féin and the Technical Group, who shall be called upon in that order, may share their time and whose contributions shall not exceed ten minutes in each case; and a Minister or Minister or State shall be called upon to make a speech in reply which will not exceed five minutes; and parliamentary questions next for answer by the Taoiseach on EU matters shall be taken on the same day as the statements on the pre-European Council meeting, scheduled to be taken on Wednesday, 22 June 2011, and shall be moved to be taken first as ordinary oral questions to the Taoiseach on that day.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	264	There are four proposals to put to the House.  Is proposal No. 1 for dealing with Nos. 10, 11 and 12, motions without debate, agreed to?

There have been many issues presented and highlighted in this House in recent times regarding the crisis in the health service.  It is simply not good enough that the Minister is not accountable to the House.  Affording us only one opportunity to question him before the end of next week simply does not meet the need.I am in possession of correspondence issued today by the national ambulance service for the entire west advising that from 1 July there will no longer be ambulatory services for people in regard to dialysis and cancer care.

When will Members get the chance to address this disgraceful situation?
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	268	Deputy, you are straying beyond the——

Members see new crises unfolding within the health service every day and the Minister will not be present to take account of such matters or to advise the House on the steps he is taking to address them.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	270	Thank you, Deputy.

This is a serious matter and I ask the Minister to indicate through the Taoiseach that he will come to this House this week to address this critical matter for patients depending on dialysis access and for cancer services——
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	272	That is a different issue.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	274	I will put the question.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	275	Will the Taoiseach respond?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	276	I might just be helpful in this regard.  The Deputy will find the Minister, Deputy Reilly, to be more than willing to avail of the opportunities made available to him to answer questions.  This has happened because the Dáil did not sit last Tuesday arising from the unfortunate and tragic death of the former Minister for Finance, Brian Lenihan.  Question Time was pushed out by one day as a consequence and, as the Minister for Health had undertaken to attend a number of meetings abroad, he changed places on the rota with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	278	The Deputy has had his say.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	279	The Minister will be back again to answer questions early in July and is available, if the Ceann Comhairle so desires, on Adjournment debates or whatever.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	281	Is the proposal for dealing with Nos. 10, 11 and 12, motions re referral to joint committees of proposed approval by Dáil Éireann of the Harbours Acts Order 2011, the ministerial rota for parliamentary questions and membership of committees, without debate agreed to?
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	282	It is not agreed.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	283	Is the proposal for dealing with No. 13, motion re Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 agreed to?
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	284	It is not agreed.  I oppose the imposition of the guillotine on the debates on the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act and on the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act.  These legislative items have a profound effect on citizens' rights and more time should be allocated to debate these motions.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	285	I understand there was no disagreement about the time allocation for these matters at the Whips' meeting.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	286	As the note I have to hand came from my party's Whip, the Taoiseach may go back and talk to the Government Whip.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	287	Is the proposal for dealing with No. 14, motion re Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 agreed to?
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	288	It is not agreed to.  Dúirt mé an méid faoi sin.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	289	Is the proposal for dealing with parliamentary questions next for answer by the Taoiseach on EU matters agreed to?  Agreed.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	290	On that last proposal, I thank the Taoiseach and the Chief Whip for the additional small amount of time that has been offered, even though my party asked for more.  I suggest that for the past three months, the European Union has failed to implement the agreement to reduce the interest rates.  The crisis at European level has been allowed to get worse and the risk of a dramatic default has increased.  Unlike what President Barroso has stated, I suggest this is not Greece's moment of truth but that of Europe.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	291	Is there promised——
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	292	This week's European Council meeting does not have our issues on its agenda and even in light of the incredible seriousness of the issues facing Europe, the discussion this week specifically on the European Council meeting is being limited to approximately one hour.  Will the Taoiseach agree to, and ask the Government Whip to discuss with the Opposition Whips, a more substantive debate on the broader European debt crisis next week, given the incredible seriousness of a most fundamental issue of the issues concerned?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	293	Next week.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	294	Yes.  Members will not have time to go into the details tomorrow.  Moreover, most Deputies will not get a chance to speak tomorrow on what probably is the most fundamental issue facing Ireland and Europe at present.  As a more extended and substantive debate is needed on that subject, I ask the Taoiseach to agree to organise such a debate.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	295	I do not object to this——
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	296	I apologise, Taoiseach. I call Deputy Higgins on the same issue.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	297	Only four weeks remain after this week is over and to follow on from Deputy Martin's comments, will the Taoiseach agree that Members should have a major debate on what is the Government's policy with regard to the financial crisis?  When the Minister for Finance goes to Washington, in other words, far away from Frankfurt and Brussels, he acts like the lads behind the shed who are smoking and insulting the teacher.  However, when he comes before the teachers in Frankfurt and Brussels, all changes.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	298	Would the Deputy cut out the theatre and let us have a question, please?
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	299	Could we have a fairly lengthy discussion in which the Government would outline its policy exactly and then allow Members to ask specific questions?
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	300	Deputy Adams on the same issue.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	301	I also have another issue to raise.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	302	We will come back to that.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	303	I agree with the comments of the other Deputies.  A full-blooded debate on this issue is required, as it is the biggest issue facing us at present.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	304	Briefly, on the same issue, I add my voice to the appeal to such a debate.  Could that debate also include the issue of State assets and what the Government plans to do with them?
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	305	Thank you.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	306	Before the EU and IMF come here in July, surely Members have the right to discuss what is on the table in respect of public assets to be handed over to pay off the bankers.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	307	In response to Deputy Boyd Barrett's question, the programme for Government is quite clear in this regard.  Over its lifetime the Government will realise €2 billion in respect of the sale of non-strategic State assets.  This issue will be decided on by the Government at the appropriate time and there will be a full discussion on it in this House.Deputy Martin has suggested a longer debate in respect of Europe infringing into other areas.  This is the big crisis for the European Union, and the Minister for Finance, as well as everyone else, is taken up with it completely.  As the Deputy is aware from his time in government over a number of years, this issue blew everything else off the pages and will continue to so do, which is unfortunate for so many people in so many countries.  There has been an endless stream of debates in this Chamber.  While Members will debate the Central Bank and Credit Institutions (Resolution)(No. 2) Bill later, they engaged in an exhaustive debate a short time ago on the memorandum of understanding and the troika's assessment of how Ireland has measured up to these conditions.  There are questions on finance and the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, which also will have full scope to deal with this issue, is getting under way.In respect of the European Council meeting, the Government at least has agreed to get Members' views before the meeting takes place.  While it will be a short debate, at least it will provide Members from the different parties to have their say before the meeting takes place.  I will ascertain what can be fitted in next week arising from the Council meeting.  While the Government will try to provide a little additional time, there has been an endless list of debates on the economy, on Ireland's position, on the memorandum of understanding, on the Central Bank and so on.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	308	I referred to the European debt crisis.  It is the most fundamental issue facing Europe at present.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	309	Will the Deputy resume his seat, please?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	310	This issue needs a substantial debate in this House.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	311	The Taoiseach has not yet finished.  The Deputy should sit down for a moment.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	312	If the Deputy wishes, we can have a specific addition next week on the Council meeting.  I assume it will be discussing matters such as Libya, Syria and the fall-out from other issues such as the Schengen agreement, migration and so on.  The Minister for Finance will report in due course on the outcome of the Ministers' meeting in Luxembourg, which is well publicised.Therefore, it is not a case of not wanting to give this time but rather that we have so many debates about the debt crisis and about the economic situation, about Europe's position, about the fact Ireland is in a very different set of circumstances than Greece, and how, as the Minister set out to go to Luxembourg we would see that the Ministers would protect countries like Ireland who are in very different circumstances from Greece.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	313	Is the Taoiseach saying "No"?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	314	I am not saying "No".
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	315	He is really.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	316	There have been a plethora of debates
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	317	I am talking about a substantive debate on the debt crisis.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	318	I will be here to deal with the debt crisis for the Deputy.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	319	The debt crisis facing Europe is the most substantive issue.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	320	I am calling Deputy Adams.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	321	I am sure the Taoiseach agrees that people with friends, parents or partners in private nursing homes are concerned.  This sector is very much in the public area after the fair deal controversy.  The Health Information and Quality Authority made an effort to close a private nursing home, Creevelea in Laytown.  This is the second such intervention in the past three weeks.  Will the Taoiseach agree on the need for a debate if the issue is raised at the Whips' meeting tomorrow?
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	322	It is a matter for the Whips.  I suggest the Deputy refers the matter to his Whip for debate during the week.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	323	I am sure Deputy Adams will find the Chief Whip to be accommodating, perhaps not on every matter but this is an issue that should be raised at the Whips' meeting as that is the place in which to do so.
#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	324	I ask the Taoiseach if legislation is promised with regard to the issue of ground rents and their abolition.  These are one of the last relics of colonisation which places a financial burden on people, apart from their awkward, legal, archaic, complex nature.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	325	No legislation is promised with regard to the abolition of ground rents.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	326	On promised legislation, last week the Government announced three referendums to be held in October.  Does the Taoiseach envisage it will be possible to have the legislation for all three through the Oireachtas over the next four weeks, together with the other legislation that has to be processed?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	327	The legislation for the referenda must be finalised by the Oireachtas by a date in September.  The Government will be hopeful of getting those three pieces of legislation through the Houses in time for the holding of the referendums on the date of the presidential election.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	328	Are there plans to bring definitive proposals on upward-only rent reviews before the House before the end of this session?  What is the position on this issue?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	329	That will not happen in this session but the matter is under consideration.
#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	330	As a result of the recent An Bord Pleanála decision to allow a casino-type development in County Tipperary, are there plans to introduce new gaming legislation and when is this likely to happen?  Perhaps instead of a replica of the White House, we could have the headquarters of Esat.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	331	The Deputy will be aware that planning permission was granted for this rather extensive development outside Two Mile Borris.  The development can now proceed as it has full planning permission but it cannot proceed with a casino.  The Minister for Justice and Equality is examining the question of the review of the gaming laws which have been in place for quite some time.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	332	I recently met the parents of a disabled child who is a ward of court and I was quite shocked when I was acquainted with the situation of wards of court.

One of the most important traits of a democratic society is a justice system that operates free from interference by anyone seeking to wrongfully influence outcomes.  Our criminal justice system is made up not only of judges and lawyers but also by the participation of citizens, whether as witnesses or jurors.  The latter role is central to our idea of trial by a jury of one's peers.  Nothing can be considered more insidious than the targeting of those citizens who are prepared to do their public duty by serving as jurors in order to influence the outcome of criminal proceedings, but that is the reality we must face and it is a matter we, as legislators, have to resolve.  The House will share my view that trial by jury must be preserved to the greatest extent possible.  However, none of us can be blind to the threat posed to the criminal process by individuals, terrorist groups and organised criminal groups which seek to intimidate jurors or potential jurors.  Their aim is to subvert the criminal justice system.  We cannot allow that to happen.  Therefore, we have to take appropriate and proportionate measures to prevent this interference.  To do so we have to make the hard decision that a proper trial by jury is simply not possible in certain limited circumstances.The measures contained in the 2009 Act were put in place by the Oireachtas to take the necessary action to address the increasing levels of violence by gangs involved in organised crime.  I emphasise the point that section 8 of the 2009 Act is aimed at particular types of cases and that the centrality of the jury trial to our system remains intact.  The 2009 Act primarily provided for the trial of organised crime offences in the Special Criminal Court unless the Director of Public Prosecutions directed otherwise; the creation of a new offence of directing or controlling a criminal organisation; an increase in the maximum penalty for the offence of participation or involvement in organised crime; a court, with regard to all organised crime offences, to be able to draw inferences from a failure to answer questions or to account for movements, actions, activities or associations; and an increase in the penalty for the intimidation of a witness or a juror from ten to 15 years imprisonment.The view of the Garda authorities is that these provisions are indispensable to them in tackling organised crime.  A large number of arrests have been made under these provisions and charges are being pursued against a number of people, but I would be less than frank if I did not say to the House that, useful as the provisions are, there will be disappointment that they have not proved to be greater benefit in tackling the death and destruction caused by criminal gangs.  That is why I have asked my Department to review them to see if there are any further measures we can take.Section 8 of the 2009 Act is aimed at ensuring organised criminal gangs cannot interfere with the court process to influence the outcome of cases.  For this purpose, the section declares that the ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice and the preservation of public peace and order in relation to certain organised crime offences under Part 7 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006, as amended.  I will detail these offences for Deputies presently.  The offences are deemed to be scheduled offences for the purposes of Part V of the Offences against the State Act 1939, which means that they will be tried in the Special Criminal Court.  However, the Director of Public Prosecutions may still exercise his power to direct that they should be tried in the ordinary courts.Section 8(4) provides that the section shall cease to be in operation unless a resolution has been passed by each House of the Oireachtas that it continue in operation for a further period.  The Dáil and the Seanad passed such resolutions on 29 June 2010 to continue the provision in operation until 30 June 2011.Section 8(6) provides that before a resolution to continue section 8 in operation is tabled, I must lay a report before both Houses on the operation of the Act in the period under report.  I laid such a report before both Houses on 14 June.  The particular offences to which the section refers are set out in Part 7 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006, as amended.Section 71A is the offence of directing a criminal organisation.  This offence was inserted by section 5 of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009.  It is intended to target those who direct the activities of organised criminal gangs.  However, it is aimed not just at those who are in a leadership position in the gangs but at all levels of the gangs.  The offence carries a penalty of up to life imprisonment.Section 72 is the offence of participating in or contributing to the activities of a criminal organisation in order to enhance a gang's ability to commit a serious offence or to facilitate a gang in committing serious offences.  This offence was inserted by section 6 of the 2009 Act and carries a penalty of up to 15 years imprisonment.Section 73 is the offence of committing an offence for a criminal organisation.  The maximum penalty for this offence was increased from ten to 15 years imprisonment by section 10 of the 2009 Act.  Section 76 provides for liability for offences under Part 7 of the 2006 Act where they are committed by corporate bodies, their members, directors and managers.Deputies will be well aware of the ongoing threat which organised crime presents to society.  Unfortunately, there is plenty of evidence of the involvement of criminal gangs in murder, armed robbery, kidnapping, drug smuggling, counterfeiting and other serious offences.  There is also no doubt about their willingness to use the most serious violence to protect their own interests and ensure they can continue their activities.I take the opportunity to praise the Garda Síochána for its ongoing work in tackling these criminal gangs.  It continues to deploy considerable resources to tackling organised and serious crime.  The Garda organised crime unit has the primary role of targeting organised criminal gangs, working in conjunction with other Garda national units such as the emergency response unit, the Bureau of Fraud Investigation and the Criminal Assets Bureau.  Working collaboratively, these units have had and continue to have success in disrupting these criminal gangs.Deputies will also know that there have been a number of seizures of significant quantities of drugs and arrests so far this year as part of ongoing Garda operations being carried out with the co-operation of the Customs service.  In one operation in Slane, County Meath in March drugs to the value of over €750,000 were seized and in another operation in April near Enfield, County Meath almost €1 million worth of heroin was seized.  The Garda made arrests in these and many other operations and charges are being brought.Given the nature of organised crime, the investigation and prosecution process can be lengthy and difficult, particularly given the power that these criminal gangs hold over the people involved with them.  However, the Garda Commissioner has made it clear time and again that there will be no let up in the action being taken against these gangs.  He has mine and the Government's full support in that approach.The report which I laid before the House is based on information provided for me by the Garda authorities.  It shows that section 8, the subject of the resolution, has not been used in the period under report.  While there have been many arrests under the relevant sections of the 2006 Act, no cases have yet come before the Special Criminal Court.  This does not, however, invalidate the reasoning for having such a provision available for use should the circumstances require it.  The House would be rightly critical if measures to protect the integrity of the criminal justice system were not in place at any time when that system came under threat.The relevant sections of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 have been used by the Garda on 72 occasions.  These arrests have resulted in four persons being charged with offences contrary to section 71A which provides for directing a criminal organisation and section 72 which provides for participating in or contributing to the activities of a criminal organisation in the period under report.  However, I emphasise that these arrests have also resulted in other charges being brought, relating to firearms offences, the sale and supply of controlled drugs, robbery, aggravated burglary and other serious offences.As I stated, the Garda authorities are clear in their view that the provisions of the 2009 Act are indispensable to the fight against organised crime.  The Garda authorities also consider that it is of paramount importance that the relevant provision of the Act be extended for a further period.  In matters such as this, I must have the utmost regard for the views of the Garda authorities.  It essential to ensure the Garda has at its disposal the best possible range of powers to deal with these dangerous criminal gangs.In combating organised and serious crime, the House has in recent years brought through a comprehensive programme of criminal law reform.  The legislation is making a significant contribution to tackling this type of crime, but I will keep under review the question of whether any improvements could be made to the overall legislative architecture in this area to render it more effective.  As I have indicated to the House, I have asked for a specific review of the provisions of the 2009 Act.Let us be clear: those who are deeply involved in organised crime are desperate people who will stop at nothing to avoid being brought to book.  Extreme violence and brutal intimidation are simply a way of life for these thugs.  They have no regard for society or the law and we have a duty to make sure the criminal justice system can hold sway over them.  To that end, we must ensure that in the most serious of cases, in which jury intimidation is a real possibility, the law has the means available to bring these criminals to account.  In the circumstances this is a justified and measured limitation of the right to trial by jury.On balance, I consider that the period of time for which I propose to renew the section is proportionate.  The 2009 Act provided for an initial period of one year for the provision to be in operation before its continuance would be reconsidered.  The period now proposed, running from the current expiry date up to 29 June 2012, corresponds to this.  Of course, if it is proposed to continue the provision in operation after that date, the Oireachtas will again have to consider the matter.  I commend the resolution to the House.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	352	I welcome the Minister's remarks.  My party will support the extension of this legislation, which was introduced by the Minister's predecessor, Mr. Dermot Ahern.  I note the Minister's remarks about the comprehensive programme of criminal law reform in recent years.  I welcome the fact that he will review elements of it which are probably not performing in the way that had been envisaged.  He will certainly have my support in strengthening any such proposals.The participation of ordinary citizens in the criminal justice process is an essential component of the validity and integrity of that process.  Participation through jury service and acting as witnesses is essential in ensuring that the judgment of one's peers is as robust as possible.  Jurors and witnesses make significant sacrifices in many cases.  Unfortunately, in recent years, they have come under considerable pressure in fulfilling their civic duties.  Without their participation, our criminal justice system would collapse along with many pillars of society.Unfortunately, the centrality of the system has made, and continues to make these people a target of people whom the system seeks to punish.  It is absolutely certain that those who target the system, including witnesses and jurors, have no regard for the House, this democracy or the views of the vast majority.  They have no regard for human life or the integrity of the justice system.  Their concept of justice tends to stop at their bottom line.  That lack of respect for human life means this provision is needed and so we must once again renew it.Section 8 is essential to repel these forces.  As a democratic parliament, we must send a strong message that we will not stand for that kind of attitude towards our criminal justice system.  It is not just politicians that want to send that message.  As the Minister said, the Garda Síochána is still seeking to maintain these provisions.  It is important that when we look at the report the Minister has laid before the House, we note that the Garda uses only part of the provisions.  It shows the Garda is not abusing this, but is treating it with the seriousness we have granted to it within the legislation.It is noticeable that areas of the legislation are not functioning as strongly as had been envisaged.  I acknowledge the election today of Deputy David Stanton as Chairman of the Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, along with Deputy Joanna Tuffy as its Vice-Chairman.  I wish them well.  When the Minister attends the committee, we might reflect on those areas that are not as robust as they should be.  We must try to get as much cross-party agreement as possible to tackle them.The Minister referred to the ongoing level of organised crime and gangland activity generally.  We must ensure that the legislation is as responsive and flexible as possible.  Unfortunately, the resources available to these people often mean that they are better equipped than the security services and one step ahead of the law.  We must therefore ensure that this legislation is robust.  I welcome the fact that the Minister must lay a report before the House every year when seeking to renew the legislation.The offence of directing a criminal organisation is not just aimed at gang leaders but at the foot-soldiers who perpetrate crimes on their behalf.  Other offences include: participating in, or contributing to, the activities of a criminal organisation; committing an offence for a criminal organisation; and being liable for an offence committed by a corporate body on behalf of a criminal organisation.  Few would argue that those are significant offences posing a threat to the State.  Those committing such offences have no regard for jury trials or witnesses, which is why we must continue to support this provision.The offence of directing a criminal organisation brings such matters into sharp focus.  A number of documentaries, including one recently on RTE, reflected on times when these legislative provisions were not available.  Because it was not possible to bring the perpetrators to justice, they continued with their campaigns of destruction in communities around Dublin and elsewhere, regardless of the consequences for the general public.  The introduction of these powers and others has ensured that we are now supplying the Garda Síochána with a legal basis to protect citizens from damage to their daily lives through drugs, arms and various other criminal offences.The section is particularly relevant at this time.  This Sunday will mark the 15th anniversary of Veronica Guerin's death.  Those are the depths to which these people are willing to descend to protect their citadels and their interests.  We should remember that Veronica Guerin was gunned down while doing her job as a journalist in exposing gangland activities.  Criminals are still as liable to do that today as they were 15 years ago and unless we robustly support this legislation and ensure it is maintained and flexible, they will certainly do it again.  That is why all of us in this House have a responsibility to be careful in commenting publicly on any body that seeks to assist us.We support the continuation of these provisions.  When the Minister attends the committee I would like him to flesh out the reasons some elements of the overall Bill are not as robust as they could be.  We will then see what changes can be made.  I endorse everything the Minister has said about the role of the Garda Síochána  in implementing this legislation.  As legislators, we make the laws while the Garda implements and enforces them.  We are not exposed to the dangers that members of the Garda Síochána face daily in dealing with criminals.  We do not have to carry out surveillance operations or place ourselves in such danger.  Members of the Garda Síochána have served, and continue to serve, this State incredibly well.  In passing this legislation, we should always remember the sacrifices that members of the force have made in dealing with criminals and protecting citizens.  We owe it to them to ensure the legislation we pass is as robust as possible to give the Garda the powers it requires.

#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	355	The sub-culture of gangland crime is thriving in our society.  It knows no bounds and carries on regardless of whether we are in a Celtic tiger period or the current recession.  It is often described in the media as the criminal underworld, but it is a very visible way of life for many in large urban areas.  It is a plague which, whether we like it or not, some people find attractive.  Given the potential riches involved and the apparent impunity with which many gangland figures operate, there is always a danger that impressionable youths with no money, little hope and no real future will see it as a viable way of life.  They see it as a means of putting cash in their pockets and having self-esteem.There is a darker, more sinister side to this plague upon which we all need to shine a spotlight.  It is the side that involves drugs, firearms, robberies, extortion, torture, kidnapping and murder.  Beyond that lies the misery that gangland crime inflicts on communities through drug addiction, intimidation, fear and a general breakdown of law and order.When first introduced, this amended legislation was held up as a means of dealing with the rise in gangland crime — a sickness that has found its way into every corner of this State.  At the time, we were told that by giving the Garda Síochána those extra powers, which were deemed critical to stem the rise of gangland crime, we would start winning the war and the tide would turn.  While there was an understandable rush to stem that tide, I question if we reacted hastily in a knee-jerk fashion.  The result was the amending legislation passed by this House previously, the powers within which are up for renewal again today.  I wonder if the moral argument on the extra powers given under this amending legislation came into the conversation at that time.  There is no legitimate argument for the continuing process of introducing emergency legislation which is not human rights based such as measures to hollow out the presumption of innocence or the removal of the right to a jury trial.There has always been a wide array of criminal law on the Statute Book to counter serious crime.  Sinn Féin has no difficulty in facilitating the introduction of good law to deal with any shortcomings that may exist but the powers that are the subject of this motion, as the Minister outlined, have rarely been used.  Adequately resourcing the Garda and maintaining a consistent committed strategy to tackling gangland crime is what is needed.  There is a whole new way of utilising the resources available to us and that must also be central to any solution.  For instance, how can we justify cutting the budget for Operation Anvil while at the same time spending millions of euro policing the private interests of companies such as Shell in Rossport?  There is a stark contradiction in that.We were told by the Minister's predecessor that this measure was a necessary tool in the fight against serious crime but yet it has resulted in zero cases being sent to the Special Criminal Court.  Last year it was utilised 72 times, resulting in four people facing charges but none of them was sent to the Special Criminal Court.  Nobody would be happier than I if a mechanism existed whereby the right people were jailed and criminal enterprises were smashed, but that task has been made all the more difficult given the constraints we now face in terms of the EU-IMF bailout and the Minister's recent announcement on Garda recruitment.I agree with Deputy Calleary that the establishment of the justice committee gives us an opportunity to have a discussion on improving policing and starting to move towards a multi-agency approach to crime prevention and detection.  We have consistently called for a wide range of realistic and potentially effective proposals for tackling serious crime in our communities.  We would like to see the fast-tracking of the Garda civilianisation programme to free gardaí from administration duties to fight crime on the front line.  We have called for increased funding for Garda drug units with enhanced community input.  We require an independent oversight of informer handling practices.  That is important to prevent a perception developing that there are individuals who may have a close relationship with members of the Garda and who are allowed amass criminal empires.  As the Minister will be aware, the Ombudsman office is currently investigating one such allegation where a drugs haulier was allowed to operate with impunity in return for information on others.  We hear such stories all too often in our local communities.  There is a perception that if people dealing in drugs who are brought in give information to members of the Garda, they are not brought before the courts.Garda visibility in activities in areas experiencing chronic drug problems is essential.  The only way to defeat the drugs scourge and to deal gangland crime a fatal blow in this State is to remove the market for it.  We need greater investments in our communities, in education and in better planning practices.  These are all strands towards a holistic solution.  We would be better off discussing these points rather than the motion on this amendment Act.We will not be supporting the renewal of these powers.  I ask Members to reflect on the growing consensus at home and abroad in regard to the Special Criminal Court and such unnecessary draconian legislation which should be removed.  The Irish Council for Civil Liberties, the UN Human Rights Committee and ourselves have all expressed concern in the past about its continuing existence and that is the reason we will not be supporting this motion.

Ba mhaith liom ar dtús, mo chomhgairdeas a ghabháil leis An Garda Síochána agus le lucht an chustaim as an obair iontach a rinne siad i mbliana.  Léiríonn sé sin go bhfuil gá le breis maoine agus áiseanna a thabhairt dóibh siúd.The Garda Síochána and Customs and Excise should be congratulated on their drug seizures this year.  That proves that they need additional resources.  The number of gardaí should be maintained at the current level and Garda civilianisation should be increased at a proper rate.This legislation is corrosive to the justice system and the continual renewing of it each year is definitely corrosive.  When this legislation was proposed in 2009 I warned of the danger that it would be continuously rubber-stamped in this House.Much more can be done to protect juries and witnesses.  We argued in committees in previous Dáils for a range of measures that could be taken to ensure our justice system operates free from the interference of anyone seeking to influence outcomes wrongfully.  I would never ask for leniency for any criminal, especially those gangs who have brought drugs and destruction to my area and other areas throughout the country.  I have continuously asked for the Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB, to be refocused on those at a lower level in the chain.  Young people in working class areas who have suffered greatly see drug barons and drug dealers with the trappings of wealth and that must stop.  CAB needs to refocus on those on the lower level and in the next year or so such refocus would be seen to have an effect on tackling the scourge of drugs and the trappings of wealth around the drugs trade.There is a need to ensure that juries and witnesses are protected.  Some of the mechanisms of doing that is to have quicker trials, the screening of juries where they are under threat and using existing provisions within our justice system, of which there are quite a number, which have not been fully used prior to the introduction of this measure; they are well capable of protecting our society, juries and witnesses, which the implementation of this Act sought to do.  The introduction of the Tetra system for the Garda Síochána needs to continue apace and new technologies need to be embraced .  The forensic laboratory which should have been built many years ago should be up and running.  Until those steps are taken we should not be invoking further corrosive changes to our legislation and in this case we should refuse to renew these powers at this time.

#JohnHalligan	unknown-#JohnHalligan-party	unknown-#JohnHalligan-dob	unknown-#JohnHalligan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	359	I want to focus on an aspect of the Act providing for special powers for the Special Criminal Court.  While I fully recognise that organised crime is a major cause for concern and one that has potential to cause great harm to Irish society, is organised crime so big a threat as to justify restrictions of the constitutional right to trial by jury?  The answer is, we do not know and in the absence of supporting data I have grave concerns about the blanket assumption regarding the actual or potential level of jury intimidation in Ireland.When real threats are posed to jurors, questions must be asked about the operation of the jury system, but that should not automatically mean that in non-emergency situations we deny citizens of this State their rights.  The right to trial by jury is an important safeguard against the abuse of power and this proposed extension of the remit of the Special Criminal Court is clearly in contravention of the UN Human Rights Committee.  That committee has already criticised Ireland for continuing to use the Special Criminal Court.The jury system provides for a rare check of excessive Government prosecutions.  A jury trial also presents an opportunity for a defendant to be judged by a group of his or her peers.  Individual prejudice and irrationality are checked by the group, leading to a fairer, more reasoned administration of justice.  As well as the perception of fairness when defendants are tried by their peers, providing for trial by jury is a powerful symbol of public participation in the criminal justice system.  It is important that people believe they have ownership of the system and a jury trial nurtures that feeling.  It also reinforces our confidence that justice is seen to be done.  Human rights lawyers working in countries undergoing democratic transition aspire to the western model of jury service.I remain to be convinced that jury intimidation is at such a serious level that it warrants the extension of the powers of the Special Criminal Court in the way proposed in the amended 2009 Act.  It is remarkable that policies are being made and applied on the basis of anecdote and supposition.  In 2009 the Irish Human Rights Commission made clear a similar objection in its observations on the Act when it stated it considered the developed system of criminal justice was capable of confronting effectively the problem of organised crime without resorting to a parallel system that did not provide an accused with a right to trial by jury.  The main problem arises in respect of witness intimidation which would not be solved by providing for trial by judge only.  Witnesses in the Special Criminal Court still need to give evidence in open court.  It is incumbent on the Government, therefore, to tackle this issue.Perhaps the real issue we need to consider is not that of the criminal justice system, Garda powers or special courts but how communities are served, protected and resourced in order to deal with a small criminal minority.  However, we would then be dealing with a welfare issue and I suspect that in a recession it is deemed far less problematic to pass laws than to fund services.  The famous Rock Tansey, QC, founder of the European Criminal Bar Association, stated, "There are serious circumstances where jury intimidation can happen but it is not beyond the wit of man to put measures in place to protect juries."  As an institution, the jury has much to commend it.  Juries add legitimacy to the decisions of courts precisely because they involve people in the process.  If they can function, they ought to do so.  Before resorting to using the Special Criminal Court, we should consider other means by which we could strengthen the jury system.  Above all, we must always guard our personal and civil liberties.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	360	We all agree that criminal gangs engaged in murder, smuggling, supplying drugs, kidnapping and so on need to be tackled.  The Minister has told the House that this curtailment of civil liberties is necessary to achieve that aim, but the first question to be asked is whether that is the case.  The legislation has been in place for a number of years, yet it has not impacted on the reality of organised crime positively.  Deputies have referred to the serious erosion of civil liberties and rights.  In our experience, this and other oppressive legislation introduced under the headline of dealing with subversion and so on has been misused to target ordinary people, protestors, students and Shell to Sea campaigners.  I have been on the receiving end of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act a few times.As Deputy Halligan stated, what is at issue is the trial of offences in non-jury courts allegedly to overcome jury intimidation.  A departure from the jury system is never justified.  It is serious that we allow a weaker standard of evidence to be accepted in cases where the outcome for someone could be 15 years or life in prison.  Section 72 is particularly concerning.  It contains a broad clause, whereby a Garda superintendent or a garda deemed to have an appropriate level of expertise swears that he or she believes someone is guilty of participating in or contributing to the activities of a criminal organisation which is enough to see that person receive a sentence of 15 years.  In the light of the serious miscarriages of justice that have occurred in the State and elsewhere, this provision is a retrograde step.If the issue really is one of jury intimidation, other measures could be put in place.  For example, investment in communities cutting across the scourge of drugs is the way to deal with organised crime, not suppressing liberties.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	361	I welcome the opportunity to give my opinion on the renewal of the powers to address the gangland crimes that have become all too prevalent throughout the country, particularly in disadvantaged areas.  Investment in restorative justice programmes and other schemes such as those that tackle juvenile crime and addressing the reasons people become involved in crime are important.  I give my full support to the continuation of the legislation in the interests of protecting the jury system and ridding the streets of people who commit these heinous crimes, in particular tiger kidnappings which strike terror into families and communities.  Many people in local post offices have recently been the victims of these savage crimes.  Where some of these offices have been threatened with closure, finding people to keep them open will be difficult.  It is a public duty, but they would be threatened by criminals.We cannot forget the good work of the Garda is undermined when intimidation prevents the prosecution of those involved in organised crime.  I am neither afraid nor ashamed to say I have some experience of the jury system.  I understand the vital public service provided by jurors on a daily basis up and down the country.  I hope this legislation will strengthen the Garda's powers to detain and rearrest.  Above all, I hope it will allow law-abiding citizens and their families to live our their lives in peace and harmony.I do not agree with everything stated by the Irish Council for Civil Liberties.  In many respects, it has exaggerated its points.  The recent visits of Queen Elizabeth II and President Obama showed the good work being done by the security forces.  That a few people tried to wreck these visits in the name of the Irish people was wrong.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	362	I join Deputy Calleary in congratulating Deputies Stanton and Tuffy on being elected Chairman and Vice Chairman, respectively, of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.  I look forward to working with them.  Deputy Calleary and I will use the committee constructively to deal with legislative and policy matters.I thank Deputy Calleary for supporting the extension of the operation of this legislation.  I share his opinion of the importance of jury service and the jury system, and it is important that we preserve the integrity of the criminal justice system.  This includes ensuring those who are engaged in gangland crime do not intimidate juries and can be brought to trial in circumstances where there is a genuine concern that juries may be intimidated.To date, the legislation has not been invoked to require the usage of the Special Criminal Court in the circumstances envisaged.  The operation of the legislation is being extended and we will see the extent to which it will be used this year.  One wonders whether the legislation's existence acts as a protection against jury intimidation in that those brought before the courts may be concerned that if there is any suggestion of intimidation, they will be brought before the Special Criminal Court.I thank Deputy Calleary for his contribution.  It is important that, like Deputy Mattie McGrath, we recognise the dangers to which the Garda Síochána is subjected in the work it does in this regard.  I thank Deputy Mattie McGrath for his positive and supportive contribution.  It was notable that the other Deputies who contributed and opposed this provision commenced their contributions by expressing support for the Garda Síochána, their opposition to gangland crime and their concern to ensure people are brought to justice.  Deputy O'Brien argued for additional resources for and recruitment to the Garda Síochána.  All of those Deputies who expressed support for the Garda Síochána do so in circumstances in which they are opposing the resolution before the House and disagreeing with the advice of the Garda authorities.  This resolution is before the House for one reason, namely, the Garda authorities have asked that it remain in place.  They believe it to be important in the fight against gangland crime that it remain in place as it provides for the possibility of trials, in limited circumstances, before the Special Criminal Court in circumstances in which there is a real and present danger to juries.  I find it difficult to understand why Deputies would preface their contributions by expressing support for the Garda Síochána and then oppose a resolution which the Garda authorities want passed.  It is an inconsistent approach.Those involved in gangland crime are engaged in a broad range of serious offences, including drug trafficking, drug selling, shooting people on the streets of Dublin and elsewhere, human trafficking and so-called tiger kidnappings.  Unfortunately, we in this State are subject to this type of tyranny from those who have no respect for the law or human life, as can be seen from the activities in which they are engaged.Much has been said about human rights.  I believe the role of the Garda Síochána is to protect the human rights of the community, the rights of ordinary people to walk safely in the streets, the rights of people to go about their business without fear of kidnap and the rights of the State to raise revenue in circumstances that are legitimate without thwart by those engaged in illegal importation of cigarettes into the country.  There is a broad range of areas that relate to the human rights of the ordinary citizens of this country and of jurors.  Any person asked to serve on a jury is entitled to know we will protect him or her as best we can.Deputy Ó Snodaigh having congratulated the Garda Síochána and called for extra numbers for the force then provided two interesting solutions in regard to the protection of jurors from intimidation or the possibility of injury or fatality.  His prognosis was that we should have quick trials and should screen jurors.  I do not know if by quick trials he means that jurors should go into a room for ten minutes and run out again.  Trials must take their normal course.  If there is a possibility of jurors being intimidated during a trial those who are accused at a trial or those part of a gang who come to view a trial but are not being prosecuted may be able to identify jurors whether the trial is quick or slow.  How screening jurors would provide them with protection, I do know.This is an important measure.  I acknowledge that the contributions made by Deputies Halligan and Daly were made in good faith.  They both made reference to issues of human rights and trials by jury being a protection against abuse of power.  Deputy Daly appears to be of the view that this particular legislation has given rise to a serious erosion of civil rights.  The reality is that the Special Criminal Court has not yet been used under this legislation.  It is simply a backdrop protection which the Garda authorities believe valuable and have asked that it be kept in place.  In the circumstances, I believe we should do so.  I commend the resolution to the House.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	364	I move:That Dáil Éireann resolves that sections 2 to 4, 6 to 12, 14 and 17 of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 (No. 39 of 1998) shall continue in operation for the period of 12 months beginning on 30th June, 2011.The resolution before the Dáil seeks approval for the continuance in operation of those sections of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 which would otherwise cease to be in operation after 30 June.  Deputies will be aware that this legislation was enacted in the aftermath of the Omagh bombing in August 1998, a dreadful atrocity which claimed 29 innocent lives and injured more than 200 people.  The attack at Omagh was a callous act of mass murder aimed at undermining the then developing peace process.  If anything, its brutality galvanised the already strong desire of both communities on this island for a shared future based on peace and democracy.  It is a testament to the resolve of those parties who supported the peace process that not only did it survive this attack, it flourished and great advances have been made in normalising politics in Northern Ireland.  We must never forget, however, the suffering of so many people who were bereaved by the mindless criminality of the very few.Recognising the exceptional nature of the measures contained in the 1998 Act, it was decided that certain sections of the Act should be revisited annually by the Oireachtas.  The purpose is to allow the Oireachtas to decide whether the current circumstances justify the continued operation of these sections.  I have no doubt that their continued operation is justified and will outline my reasons to the House presently.To support consideration of the need for the renewal of these sections of the Act, I am required to lay a report on their operation before both Houses prior to the resolutions being moved.  The report, which I laid before the House on 13 June 2011, covers the period since the last such report was prepared in June 2010 to 31 May 2011.  The clear message from the report is that the relevant sections of the Act continue to be of significant value to the Garda in tackling the threat from terrorism.  Taking into account the provisions of the Act, the numbers of occasions on which certain provisions have been used and the current security environment, the Garda authorities consider that the Act continues to be one of the most important tools available to them in the ongoing fight against terrorism.  The inevitable conclusion must be that the provisions are necessary to counter the threat from terrorism and their continued availability to An Garda Síochána is warranted.The sad fact is that there is an ongoing threat, both in this jurisdiction and in Northern Ireland, from a variety of subversive paramilitary groups.  The Real IRA, the Continuity IRA and other groups remain resolutely committed to violence in pursuit of their aims.  They continue to seek to acquire and manufacture weapons and to plant explosive devices without any concern for life or limb.  In particular, they have targeted members of the security forces in Northern Ireland.  The recent tragic murder of PSNI Constable Ronan Kerr is a stark demonstration of their ongoing murderous intent.  Put plainly, these are gangs of criminal terrorists.  I use the word "criminal" because these groups are involved in a wide range of organised criminal activities and I believe that, in many cases, their continued commitment to the so-called cause is centred more on preserving their personal positions.  These groups represent nothing but their own warped views of the world.  Their actions display nothing but contempt for the peace-loving majority on this island.The 1998 Act was brought in following the Omagh bombing and was mainly targeted at domestic terrorist groups.  However, we cannot ignore the threat from international terrorism and should not imagine that Ireland is completely immune from it.  We certainly must not be complacent in responding to it.  The Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act 2005 enables the application against international terrorist groups and individuals of the Offences against the State Acts, including the provisions under consideration today.I return to the provisions which are the subject of the resolution.  The report I laid before the House is based on data received from the Garda authorities and shows the following information.  Section 2 was used on 48 occasions.  Section 2 provides that where, in any proceedings for membership of an unlawful organisation, an accused fails to answer or gives false or misleading answers to any question, the court may draw such inferences as appear proper.  However, a person cannot be convicted of the offence solely on an inference drawn from such a failure.  Section 3 was used on 12 occasions.  This section provides that, in proceedings for membership of an unlawful organisation, an accused must give notification of an intention to call a person to give evidence on his behalf, unless the court permits otherwise.  Section 7 was used on 24 occasions.  This section makes it an offence to possess articles in circumstances giving rise to a reasonable suspicion that the article is in possession for a purpose connected with the commission, preparation or instigation of specified firearms or explosives offences. Section 8 was used once.  This section makes it an offence to collect, record or possess information which is likely to be useful to members of an unlawful organisation in the commission of serious offences.  Section 9 was used on 63 occasions.  This section makes it an offence to withhold information which a person believes might be of material assistance in preventing the commission of a serious offence or securing the apprehension, prosecution or conviction of another person for such an offence.Section 10 was used on 12 occasions.  This section extends the maximum period of detention permitted under section 30 of the Offences against the State Act from 48 hours to 72 hours, but only on the authorisation of a judge of the District Court.  The judge must be satisfied, on the application of a garda not below the rank of superintendent, that further detention is necessary for the proper investigation of the offence concerned and that the investigation is being conducted diligently and expeditiously. The person being detained is entitled to be present in court during the application and to make submissions or have them made on his behalf.  In the reporting period in question, an extension under section 10 was applied for and granted in 12 cases and charges resulted in six of those cases.Section 11 was used on five occasions.  This section allows a judge of the District Court to permit the re-arrest and detention of a person in respect of an offence for which he was previously detained under section 30 of the Offences against the State Act but released without charge. This further period must not exceed 24 hours and can only be authorised in circumstances where the judge is satisfied on information supplied on oath by a member of the Garda Síochána that further information has come to the knowledge of the Garda about that person's suspected participation in the offence.  Section 14 is a procedural section which makes the offences created under sections 6 to 9, inclusive, and 12 of the 1998 Act scheduled offences for the purposes of Part V of the 1939 Act.  The sum total of the uses of sections 6 to 9, inclusive, and 12 was 88.I now turn to those sections of the 1998 Act that were not used in the period under report, namely, sections 4, 6, 12 and 17.  Section 4 amends section 3 of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1972 to expand the definition of "conduct" that can be considered as evidence of membership of an unlawful organisation.  Specifically, conduct can include matters such as "movements, actions, activities, or associations on the part of the accused".  This change simply aligns the definition of conduct in the 1972 Act with the reference to movements, actions, activities or associations used in section 2 of the 1998 Act.Section 6 creates the offence of directing the activities of an organisation in respect of which a suppression order has been made under the Offences against the State Act 1939.  Section 12 makes it an offence for a person to instruct or train another person in the making or use of firearms or explosives or to receive such training without lawful authority or reasonable excuse.Section 17 builds on a provision in the Criminal Justice Act 1994 which empowers a court, in its discretion, to order the forfeiture of any property in the possession of a convicted person which was used, or intended to be used, to facilitate the commission of an offence under that Act.  The effect of section 17 is, in the case of a person convicted of specified offences relating to the possession of firearms or explosives, and where there is property liable to forfeiture under the 1994 Act, to require the court to order the forfeiture of such property unless it is satisfied that there would be a serious risk of injustice if it made such an order.  Although these sections were not used in the period under report, I am sure Deputies will agree that their continued availability is essential to an effective response to the threat from terrorist groups.I would be delighted to be able to inform Members that these provisions are no longer considered necessary.  However, that would necessitate a very significant change of attitude on the part of these criminal terrorist groups.  In the absence of such a change I could not, as Minister for Justice and Equality, recommend to the Dáil that valuable legislative provisions be allowed to lapse.  I consider that the relevant provisions of the 1998 Act should remain in operation for a further 12 months and I commend this resolution to the House.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	365	My party will support the Government on this occasion.  Regrettably, certain events during the past 12 months have highlighted the need for us to renew this legislation.  As the Minister has said, it was introduced in the aftermath of the horror of the Omagh bomb.  With the passage of time, the difficulty was that many people did not recognise or remember that horror.  If they needed to be reminded, the death of Constable Ronan Kerr will have served as a reminder.  The response of our democratic institutions to the Omagh tragedy was robust.  We are required to continue that response this evening, in light of the death of Constable Kerr and the subsequent threat to the lives of Catholic members of the PSNI.  Such people have fulfilled the vision of the Good Friday Agreement by getting involved in the police force.  The agreement was endorsed by the community, by most organisations in this House and by many people on this island.  For some bizarre reason, certain people are continuing to threaten the lives of Catholics who want to be part of the PSNI.  For that reason alone, this House should unite in renewing the provisions of the 1998 legislation.In October 2010, the authorities in Britain increased the threat level associated with Irish-related terrorism to "substantial".  This shows that the threat of dissident republicans, who are affected by this legislation, continues to be as real and active as the threat of international terrorism.  I compliment the Garda and the Army on the manner in which they have dealt with this threat, particularly before and during the visits of Queen Elizabeth and President Obama.  In light of all the activities, including arrests, that were reported around that time, it is strange that section 12 of the 1998 Act was not used.  Media reports give one the impression that these organisations, particularly dissident so-called republican organisations, are on the verge of increasing their capacity to use arms, firearms and explosives.  Perhaps there are charges in the pipeline under section 12.  I hope that provision is used to prevent — God forbid — another Omagh from happening.We need to examine the composition of dissident organisations.  By continuing to abuse the term "Óglaigh na hÉireann", they are showing complete contempt for the democratic institutions of this State and the fine men and women who serve in our Defence Forces.  This is another reason for the House to unite in support of this proposal.  There is only one group that can call itself Óglaigh na hÉireann.  I refer to the men and women of the Defence Forces who put their lives on the line to serve this country abroad.  They are heading to Lebanon once again.  They have a fine track record of representing Ireland across the world.  They are the Óglaigh na hÉireann to whom this House and this country owe allegiance.  We will show that allegiance by passing this legislation.By coincidence, the RACO magazine, Signal, appeared on my desk today.  It includes a good article by the security editor of the Irish Independent, Tom Brady, which should be read by anyone who doubts the reality of the situation we face.  The article refers to the current situation with regard to dissident republicanism in Northern Ireland.  Mr. Brady warns that vicious attacks like that which killed Ronan Kerr “could happen again” and argues that “existing deterrents should not be watered down”.  This evening, we are renewing this procedure rather than watering it down.  I agree with the Minister that it is regrettable that we have to do so.  We owe it to the Garda, the Defence Forces and the people of this island to renew this measure as long as there is a threat to their safety and their ability to get on with their jobs and fulfil the dream of the Good Friday agreement.  That is why we are supporting the Government.

#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	368	The Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 was introduced as a response to the tragic events in Omagh on 15 August 1998, when 28 people, including a young woman who was pregnant with twins, lost their lives.  All these years later, many of the more than 220 people who were injured, some of them seriously, continue to bear the scars of that day.  It was truly a horrendous day in the history of this island.  The events of that day were a direct attack on the peace process and the Sinn Féin strategy.  It is a testament to all those involved in the peace process at that time that it survived and has since flourished.  While there is a long way to go before we, as republicans, realise our ultimate goal of a united Ireland, we must continue to defend the peace process.  Although full responsibility for the events of 15 August 1998 lies with the Real IRA, subsequent details have shown that less than perfect policing procedures, analysis and communication of intelligence were employed.Draconian legislation can never be a substitute for sound law and good and accountable policing.  As Members in this Chamber know, Sinn Féin has consistently opposed the retention of this amendment.  We have argued each year that it should be repealed in its entirety.  At this time, there is neither a need for such legislation nor an argument in favour of it.  The continuation of it will only serve to erode further the human rights ethos in which this State's legislation should be grounded.  If Deputies in this Chamber truly value the concepts of democracy and human rights, I implore them to vote accordingly and to reject the motion.I recognise that a small group of people are still determined to derail the peace process.  They do not have the capacity to do so.  They do not warrant a strong argument for the retention of these measures.  Sinn Féin has been in a minority in this House in recent years when it has rightly opposed the 1998 Act.  The chances are that we will be in a minority again today.  We are not in a minority internationally, however, as we analyse this measure.  The UN Human Rights Committee shares our stance on it.  As I pointed out in a previous debate, it has asked the State year after year to factor the Special Criminal Court out of our judicial system.Our international commitments are not the only reason for us to oppose the motion.  The Government has certain obligations under the Good Friday Agreement.  The agreement places an onus on both Governments to work towards the normalisation of the security apparatus in the Twenty-six Counties and the Six Counties.  As the Minister said, the agreement was endorsed overwhelmingly by the majority of people on this island.  It needs to be protected and implemented in full.  Therefore, the scrapping of the legislation before us for renewal is a pressing issue for all of us in this Chamber.  In the past, many Deputies have argued in favour of the provisions of the Act because they have played a role.  However, I do not think anyone can truthfully argue that these provisions have a place in the present or future of this State.  Sinn Féin believes the legislation is counter-productive in the long run.  In my opinion, the report supplied by the Department of Justice and Equality serves to reinforce this argument.Little more than a decade has passed since the amendment was first enacted.  Some sections of the Act, such as section 17, have never been used.  Sections 4, 6, 12 and 17 have not been used in the last 12 months.  Section 8 has only been used once in the past three years.  Sections 4 and 12 have not been used for several years.  The figures also show a huge discrepancy between the annual arrest and conviction rates.  This strongly suggests that the provisions of this legislation are being used for purposes other than those for which they were originally designed.  It is for this reason, and those I mentioned earlier, that we will not be supporting the motion.  The context in which the Minister is seeking the renewal of this Act is clear from his opening statement.  His reference to those groups that are still engaged in armed actions set the context for this debate.  It is important that all parties in this House renew the call on those groups to cease their activities.  We must do everything in our power to convince them that the path they are on is fruitless.  That is not a moral argument surrounding the rights or wrongs of physical force republicanism, but rather on the futility of their actions to deliver on their goals in the current context.We all must engage with these groups.  We must make every attempt to move them away from violence and to get them to accept the will of the people as expressed in the Good Friday Agreement.  We must also convince them of the opportunities that the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process give republicans to further the republican and all-Ireland agenda, and that is where our focus for the next 12 months should be.  I ask Members to vote against this measure.

I call on them to open their eyes to the considerable progress made on this island since the passage of the Good Friday Agreement.  There is space for those with varying views to put forward those arguments and if they believe in the strength of their convictions, I ask that they debate them with the rest of society.  The Good Friday Agreement was overwhelmingly and democratically endorsed by the vast majority of the Irish people.  If they believe in democracy at all, which is questionable, I ask that they desist.  Their actions are an affront to democracy, are besmirching the ideals of republicanism and are delaying the eventuality of a united Ireland.The retention of these provisions is an admission of the failure of this and previous Governments.  Similar to the earlier motion on the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009, these provisions turn the basis of the justice system on its head.  The killing of Constable Ronan Kerr shows that these groups wish for an abnormal society.  The challenge to us is to prove that we have a normal society and that normal policing will convict those who seek to undermine it.There is no place in our society for the emergency legislation that was passed in 1998.  We are a normal society and the existing laws are strong enough if properly resourced.  An Garda Síochána and the courts can convict and can ensure that those who carry out atrocious acts in this day and age serve a proper sentence for those actions.Thar ceann na Teachtaí a chur i gcoinne an rúin seo gach uile bliain ó thoghadh mé ar dtús i 2002, measaim go bhfuil sé thar am fáil réidh leis.  Is oth liom a rá go bhfuil sé arís ós ár gcomhair agus tá mé chun chuir ina choinne.  Fiú roimhe seo, chuir mise i gcoinne na Offences Against the State Act toisc, seachas dlíthe breise atá ag déanamh staid éigeandála sa tír seo, gur chóir go mbeadh breis áiseanna, trealaimh agus maoine curtha i dtreo An Garda Síochána agus na cúirteanna chun déanamh cinnte nach bhfuil gá le aon forálacha mar seo, má raibh gá riamh leo, agus gur chóir dúinn fáil réidh leis an mbunreachtaíocht.An phríomh argóint ná nach bhfuil fiú na forálacha seo á úsáid agus nach raibh siad riamh chun a bheith úsáidte mar bhí siad go dona nuair a chuireadh le chéile iad sa chéad dul síos.  Ba chóir dúinn casadh arís ar an ghnáth chóras justice insan tír agus ba chóir dúinn é sin a dhéanamh anois.  Tá an deis againn, fiú anois, fáil réidh le na forálacha ó 1998.

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	371	Tá mé ag roinnt mo chuid ama leis an Teachta Thomas Pringle.The Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 was introduced after the Omagh bomb atrocity in the summer of 1998.  At that time, we in the Socialist Party trenchantly opposed that atrocity, as we did all the atrocities that took place prior to it, and opposed paramilitarism on this island for decades in advance of that atrocity.  However, we pointed out that when sectarians threatened civil war as a result of atrocities carried out in the 1970s and 1980s, it was not repressive legislation enacted by the State or Britain that defeated that drive towards civil conflict which would have been an absolute conflagration and an utter disaster for ordinary people in the North and on this island.  It was the mobilisation on many occasions of ordinary working class people in Northern Ireland across the division that forced the paramilitaries and the sectarians back.  The record will show that in the 1970s and 1980s in response to horrific atrocities carried out by groups on both sides, the activists in the trade union movement, for example, mobilised onto the streets and in their workplaces tens of thousands of workers in a clear message to the paramilitaries that they were not acting in the interests of the working class people of the communities of the majority.  Similarly, what ended the paramilitary campaign was not repressive legislation in the State or the above state; it was the mood of opposition to war, war weariness etc., among ordinary working class people in the North and in this island.As a Member of the Dáil in 1998, I strenuously opposed this legislation and explained that at the time.On other related aspects of repressive legislation, the Offences Against the State Act 1939 is a wide-ranging and repressive statute.  It is not simply paramilitary organisations that can be the target of that Act.  That legislation is so wide-ranging, for example, that a group of citizens who held a protest and decided to withhold their road tax in opposition to a particular aspect of Government policy could be severely punished under it.  Other mass protests of civil peaceful disobedience also come under such repressive legislation.  My party is firmly opposed to that.Those self-appointed minorities which are now tiny, the so-called republican dissidents, whose only policy — one could not call it a policy — is the reactionary aim of regressing society back to sectarian conflict, are not representative of anybody outside their tiny ranks, but to impose legislation on an entire people in their regard is in opposition to civil rights and a danger to civil and human rights.I think I have one minute remaining.

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	373	The rioting, for example, in the Short Strand last night, shows the continuing dangers of sectarianism.  Last night it was orchestrated by the UVF, most likely in response to an internal power struggle.  Sectarianism continues under the surface, and not too far under it, to be a danger.  The power-sharing Executive is implementing cuts, the Government in this State is pathetically unable to resolve our economic difficulties, and the establishment in the North and in Britain has no solution to the problems that are underlying these issues in Northern Ireland.  Putting more oppressive legislation in the books is not a solution.  Only a radical transformation of the economic base of society, a socialist policy approach and an alternative that can provide jobs, homes and a decent future for working class people and youth form the basis of a solution.
#ThomasPringle	unknown-#ThomasPringle-party	unknown-#ThomasPringle-dob	unknown-#ThomasPringle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	374	There is no doubting the savagery and futility of the Omagh atrocity that led to the Offences Against the State Act 1998 being implemented.  There is no doubting the total futility of the campaigns being waged by so-called dissident republicans in the State.However, the operation of the Offences Against the State Act has had a severe and detrimental impact on the human rights of all Irish citizens.  The State must ensure the functioning of law and order, of that there is no doubt.  However, the State must protect the human rights of our citizens as well.  The UNHCR, the Irish Penal Reform Trust and the Irish Council for Civil Liberties have all expressed concerns for the potential erosion of human rights and miscarriages of justice as a result of the continued operation of the Offences Against the State Act.I intend to focus on the right of arrest under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act and the period covered by the report laid before the House by the Minister.  According to the report some 764 people have been arrested but only 38 convictions have taken place in the relevant period.  This is an example of the potential for the abuse of the rights of citizens under the operation of the Act with the wide-ranging right of arrest for the Garda under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act.  There is no doubt many people have been arrested for offences and that the right of arrest under the Act has been used as a convenient method to arrest people for wide-ranging offences and potential offences not covered by the Act.The continued operation of the Special Criminal Court has been widely condemned.  Recent submissions to the United Nations report on the prevention of torture have called for the scrapping of the Special Criminal Court.  The Special Criminal Court was set up for one reason: to guarantee convictions for the people who come before it.  When one considers the history of the Special Criminal Court, the lack of people who have been acquitted from among those tried before the court is remarkable.  This shows the sole reason for its establishment was to guarantee convictions.I have no doubt the motion will be passed based on the vote on the previous motion.  However, in the case of subsequent reports to come before the House related to the operation of the Act I call on the Minister to include the Irish Human Rights Commission and its reporting on the operation of the Act such that it can examine the matter in terms of the human rights abuses or potential human rights abuses that may take place under the operation of the Act should the Government decide to continue with the Act in future.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	375	Yet again I thank Deputy Calleary for his support on this important motion.  He referred to democracy.  There is a basic and simple principle: a democracy must protect itself against the tyranny of those intent on its subversion.  We must consider the reality in dealing with this legislation and resolution.  We must consider the reality of what is needed to deal with the threat which, unfortunately, remains from subversive organisations such as the Real IRA and the Continuity IRA.  The sad reality is that they have not gone away, you know.  They are still there.  There is no ideological approach that provides the immediate means to ensure we can protect our communities and our democracy against those intent on subverting it not only in this State, but in Northern Ireland and to protect the peace process, the institutions that have been established and those committed to them.I remember being in the House many years ago when we considered the position of policing in Northern Ireland, the reality that the RUC largely represented one section of the community of Northern Ireland and the difficulties this created for the minority community in Northern Ireland.  The world has substantially moved on.  We now have the Police Service of Northern Ireland, PSNI, of which 30% of the membership come from the minority community in Northern Ireland.  There are subversive groups intent on trying to ensure we do not have a police force in Northern Ireland that is truly representative of the communities there and on targeting members of the Catholic community who have joined that force to provide a cross-community force.  They do not hesitate to target and kill people as we saw with the case of Constable Ronan Kerr and as we saw with the horrendous event that took place on or about Easter at which there were hooded gentlemen standing in a cemetery threatening more murder and mayhem and supported, unfortunately, by too many people who stood in the cemetery with them.  They may be a small minority but it only takes a small minority to create murder and mayhem.  In the context of considering the reality of this issue the report tabled before the House and the information contained in the proposed resolution clearly detail the use that has been made of this legislation.  Its use has been made for the protection of people on this island.We celebrated the fact that the Queen visited here.  That was another big step, an additional block laid on the foundations of the reconciliation that has occurred and the peace process.  However, behind the scenes as Minister for Justice and Equality and as Minister for Defence I was absolutely aware in the lead-in to and during the course of the visit that there were subversive organisations intent not merely on disrupting that visit, but on causing death and mayhem if they could during the course of that visit.  That is the reality.  The Garda and the Defence Forces did an extraordinary job.  To do that job they required the assistance of the legislation available to them and which we seek to extend by resolution before the House.I refer to what I said about the previous resolution.  This is a human rights issue.  It is about the fundamental human right of the vast majority on this island to go about their business without fear that a bomb might explode or that someone they know might be shot because a small group of individuals are not willing to accept the democratic verdict of the people throughout the island of Ireland.  Such individuals reject the very peace process that the Deputies from Sinn Féin support in Northern Ireland, in this State and for which they advocate.  One should not be blind to the reality that there is a small group of people intent on destroying that process.  This resolution is about protecting that process, allowing it to continue to grow and allowing communities on both parts of this island to be safe from the type of subversive activity in which these groups engage.  It is no more complicated than that.As in the case of the previous motion, I wish it were different and that we did not need this resolution or these provisions.  The sad reality is that we do need them and the facts and their use have confirmed that they are an important part of the armoury available to An Garda Síochána in protecting us all.

It is fair to state this is a motion of huge importance.  The wages and conditions of more than 250,000 workers are at stake.  This involves some of the most isolated and vulnerable workers in Irish society, including women, immigrants and young people in the main and, quite often, workers who find themselves isolated in small employments in which union organisation is limited.  The little protection such workers have comes from the joint labour committee, JLC, and employment regulation orders, EROs.  Even with such protection, studies have revealed the extent to which the regulations are exploited.  A study conducted by the Migrant Rights Centre of Ireland in 2008 indicated that 53% of restaurant workers earned less than the minimum wage.  Moreover, 44% of such workers did not get rest breaks, 85% did not receive additional pay for working on a Sunday and 85% did not receive overtime payments.  An attempt is now being made to go even further than this and legitimise such exploitation, which is outlawed at present.  Those Members who support the motion wish to send a signal to the Government to the effect that they will not allow this to happen.  They believe it is an indictment of the Labour Party, in particular, that this is being carried out on its watch.

#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	384	The issue must be seen in the context of the overall strategy agreed with the European Union and the IMF to drive down wages and conditions across the entire economy.  Over the weekend Members will have had sight of the leaked document from the IMF that made it clear that the intention was for these agreements to not simply be reformed but scrapped.  No matter how one dresses it up, that is what is at stake.  The lessening of terms and conditions of the lowest paid workers in our society is on the table.Behind this measure is the unrelenting propaganda to which we have been subjected to the effect that Ireland became uncompetitive during the boom and that labour market inefficiencies somehow have contributed to this loss of competitiveness.  Although such sentiments are bandied about, they are untrue.  Ireland was ranked 20th last year by the World Economic Forum and identified as having a well functioning labour market.The other mantra one hears quite a lot is that high labour costs in Ireland have contributed to the high unemployment rate.  Again, such statements are untrue.  Nevertheless, the Minister has answered parliamentary questions in this regard in the Chamber.  He has spoken of unemployment levels and a loss of employment of 60% and 15% in the construction and retail and wholesale sectors, respectively, but has followed on by stating high labour costs are a contributory factor to such unemployment figures.  However, both reality and studies have disproved his statements and demonstrate clearly that he is wrong in this regard.  Labour costs in the hospitality and wholesale and retail sectors in Ireland lag far behind the EU 15 average, both in respect of nominal pay and purchasing power.  Hourly labour costs in the hospitality section in 2008, the latest year for which such studies have been undertaken, were 11.4% below the EU 15 average, while the figures were the fifth lowest for purchasing power.  In the wholesale and retail sector, they were the sixth lowest for purchasing power and almost 11% behind the EU average.  Moreover, costs in Ireland have since fallen even further, while wages in other economies have increased.The point I make strongly is that the real agenda is not about protecting employment but transferring wealth from the lowest paid to wealthy employers.  One can state categorically that unless these measures are abandoned, they will not lead to the creation of a single job.  The targeting of such wages will lead to an increase in unemployment by reducing the volume of domestic demand, thereby having a further impact on the retail sector.  This is incredibly short-sighted.  When one considers the forces that have assembled behind the scenes to lobby and call for such measures, one gets a glimpse of what really is at stake.  I suggest one looks at who is leading the charge for the so-called reform of these agreements.  Up in the front row is the founder of the Quick Service Food Alliance, who is mounting a legal challenge to the JLCs, Mr. Pat McDonagh, owner of Supermacs.  Poor Pat is finding himself struggling off the backs of these greedy workers who earn just marginally above the minimum wage and who have the audacity to seek to be paid time and a half for Sunday working.  Despite the greed of these workers in their claims in this regard, Pat has managed to leap up to position number 68 in Ireland's rich list, up from a position of number 139 in 2009.  He has managed to increase his profits despite the fact that his revenue has fallen.  He is already making a fortune off the backs of his workers and clearly, the agenda at stake is that it is not enough for him.There are other examples such as the likes of John Magnier, with a personal wealth of almost €600 million and in receipt of significant subsidies from this State for his training industry.  He is a tax exile who is bringing low-paid agricultural workers earning €9.10 an hour to the courts because he thinks their wage demands are excessive.  The real agenda here is greed.  It is a continuation of the policies which were activated in the course of the boom, a transfer of wealth away from workers into the hands of employers.We have noted that over the past period there has been a certain attempt, maybe by some members of the Labour Party, and some members of the unions, to try to isolate these measures and claim they are the sole project of the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, and they have another agenda to say the Minister is going down one road but the Duffy Walsh report is not really that bad and we will lean on it.  Our attitude very clearly is that we will not fall for either of those measures.  The Duffy Walsh report also calls for reform of these committees and a reform of these agreements.  Let there be no mistake, this is not an upward reform.  They want to streamline the agreements and to attack the pay and conditions of the lowest paid people in society.Studies by the Irish League of Credit Unions in Ireland reveal a situation where already, more than 1.2 million people in this country are surviving on less than €70 a month once they have paid their essential bills.  To attack wages further is, in our opinion, absolute economic lunacy.The Duffy Walsh report calls for a radical overhaul of JLCs.  Our position is clear.  We will not stand by and we will not allow one cent, nor one condition, of the hard earned, hard fought battles by ordinary workers over generations to secure relatively decent pay and conditions to be overturned.  This is a particular opportunity for the Labour Party and for the unions which went out and canvassed and lobbied their members to support the Labour Party in the attempt to cushion the Fine Gael blow.  This is the first test on that measure.  So far, the Labour Party has not done very well but its members have an opportunity tonight and tomorrow night to nail their colours to the mast.  There are no more hiding places.  If they are against the attacks on the wages and conditions of the lower paid, they will support the motion.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	385	I support the motion 110%.  This is a red line issue for the Labour Party.  As Deputy Clare Daly said, it will be down to the Labour Party to show its support for this motion and its support for the workers in these industries.It may surprise some Deputies and others that the first legislation in this area was introduced by Winston Churchill in 1909.  This was a recognition that in certain areas, sweat-shop conditions and the undercutting of wages were a significant problem at that time.  In Ireland these trade boards were incorporated into industrial relations law as joint labour committees, JLCs, in 1946.  There has long been a recognition, even by people not friends of the labour movement, such as Churchill, of the need for effective legislation and regulation for vulnerable workers.  The proposals by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, would, in effect, dismantle this protection.  It would declare open season by unscrupulous employers on those who are the poorest, most vulnerable and least able to stand up for their rights.Some of the employer groups pushing for these changes to the JLCs are the Irish Hotels Federation and the Quick Service Food Alliance.  The so-called hospitality industry includes hotels and restaurants and employs 130,000 workers.  A total of 35% of these are migrant workers.  Wages in this sector are the lowest of any sector in the country.  A survey of more than 800 catering businesses by the National Employment Rights Authority in 2008 showed that 53% earned below the minimum legal wage, 51% did not receive a payslip, 84% did not receive a contract or any terms of employment, 44% did not get any breaks and 85% received no overtime pay or Sunday premium.  One third of all complaints to the Migrant Rights Centre came from workers in the hospitality sector.  Brutal exploitation and denial of the most basic legal entitlements are rampant and this is even with the JLCs in place.  What is needed is not the Minister's new charter for exploitation but instead, Labour Party Deputies should demand that the employment law (compliance) Bill is given real teeth and brought before this House for urgent attention.  Will the Labour Party Deputies do this?  This legislation was promised after the Gama and the Irish Ferries disputes.  It has since been buried.  Workers in the hospitality sector need greater, not less, protection.  The National Employment Rights Authority must be beefed up with extra staff and the power to impose on-the-spot fines on employers.In the main, workers covered by the JLCs are women, young people and migrant workers.  Driving down wages in this sector, which is the purpose of these proposed reforms, will increase inequality and widen the gap between male and female earnings.  Such proposals will increase levels of poverty.  Many cleaners are part-time workers and their wages are crucial to family income.  We already have the highest rate of poverty out of 17 developed countries and only the United States is worse than us.  A total of 100,000 children live in persistent poverty.  A total of 23,000 people work in the contract cleaning industry and these are women in the main.  The JLC rate is €9.50 an hour.  This job involves working outside office hours, from 5 a.m. and after 7 p.m. or later in the evening.  Putting the boot into people working unsocial hours on extremely low pay is criminal, while the people who destroyed our economy have walked away with huge pensions or are still in place on obscene salaries.I refer to what a Fine Gael Minister said, post the election regarding the protection of the vulnerable in society: "These are the women who clean the offices in the morning; these are the women who serve food at weddings or hotel functions, who do the washing up but who go home to their families before the dancing begins."  That Minister is the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan.  The women to whom he refers are women whose income is set by the JLCs and whose families will be the most affected by any dismantling of JLCs.I remind Labour Party Deputies that they are in very strange company on this issue.  I note there are none of them in the Chamber: they seem to have disappeared.  Wage councils, the equivalent of JLCs in the United Kingdom, were first reformed by Thatcher in the 1980s and given the coup de grace by Major in the 1990s.  Therefore, the Labour Party will be standing shoulder to shoulder with the right-wing policies of Thatcher of the 1980s which destroyed the workers’ movement in Britain at the time of the miners’ strikes and were against women workers throughout Britain.We call on the Labour Party to support these low paid, vulnerable and often abused workers.  The best way to do this is to support this motion.  I refer to recommendation number 17 of the Duffy Walsh report which recommends that statutory provision be made to allow for derogation from the terms of either an ERO or an REA on economic grounds.  Any Labour Party Deputy hiding behind that should be ashamed of themselves.  They either support this motion or they do not.  If they support the Duffy Walsh so-called report, they are supporting the fact that the ability to pay clause is embedded in it.The Labour Party Deputies should come out from wherever they are.  We would like to see them in the Chamber and eyeball them on this issue.  We want to know their stance.  In 1981 the then Department of Labour said any inability to pay element would affect and undermine the whole system.  It was very critical of the inability to pay proposition, saying: "Any proposal which would allow for a fallback position weakens the principle in such a serious way as to make a nonsense of the entire concept."This is an important red line motion.  It is an important and serious issue for the thousands of workers affected by JLCs.  Any Labour Party Deputy who supports the proposal of the Minister, Deputy Bruton, to change JLCs should be ashamed of themselves.  We ask them to come into the Chamber and discuss and debate the matter in a true and honest fashion.  They should look us in the eye, as they should the 250,000 workers who are waiting desperately for some sort of certainty on this issue.  They are fearful for their jobs, families, incomes and futures.  The Labour Party Deputies can either back this motion or deny the workers what they deserve, which is decent pay for a decent day's work.
#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	386	I support the motion.  The proposals from the Minister are an outlandish attack on the most vulnerable people in society, namely, the low paid and their families.  It is important to paint a background to the current situation.  The current Government, which has taken over from the previous Fianna Fáil and Green Party Government, has effectively carried on the EU and IMF deal even though Fine Gael and the Labour Party said during the course of the election that it was a bad deal for Ireland and would be renegotiated.  They gave the impression that it would be thrown out.  However, having entered Government, they have now embraced the deal and are effectively fleecing taxpayers and workers to pay for a recession which those taxpayers and workers had no hand, act or part in creating.  It is worth reminding ourselves that the EU and IMF deal is not, as I have said before, a Good Samaritan helping out a neighbour in trouble.  European banks, in particular British, French and German banks, are fleecing Irish taxpayers to pay their bad gambling debts.  They want an each way bet and now they want the Irish taxpayer and low-paid workers to pay for the debts.During the course of the general election we were told repeatedly by Fine Gael and the Labour Party that the most vulnerable in society would be protected if they got into Government.  The attack on low-paid workers, JLCs and payment structures is far from protecting the most vulnerable.  It is a direct attack on very low-paid workers and children who in many cases are on the poverty line.  As Deputy Collins said, the current Minister, Deputy Noonan, indicated during the course of the election what he meant when he said he wanted to protect workers.  He said:These are women who clean the offices in the morning.  These are the women who serve food at weddings or hotel functions, who do the washing-up and go home before the dancing to their families.It is these women and their families that this attack on the JLCs is affecting.Another issue is consistent poverty, which affects children in particular.  Deputy Collins has given some indication of that.  In Ireland, one in ten children, that is, 100,000 or over 9%, lives in consistent property.  About 230,000, or 22.75%, live in relative poverty.  These statistics refer to the very families who are covered by JLCs.  The proposal to change JLCs is an attack on very low-paid people while the super rich who have significant levels of income get off scot free.There are figures which show that the top 5% of the super rich in this country have approximately €250 billion worth of assets.  They do not pay a ha'penny in taxes on wealth or assets, yet we have this type of attack on the lowest paid workers in the country.  Recent figures from the Central Statistics Office show that personal assets, apart from houses, land or businesses, increased by €27 billion in 2009 and probably by the same amount in 2010, yet not a single cent has been taken from people with large assets in a tax on wealth or assets.  Other countries in the EU and the United States have a tax on wealth but the Government prefers to attack low-paid workers.The case has been made time and again by people in support of these cuts that competitiveness and wage costs in Ireland are out of line.  Far from being the case, all the statistics show that labour costs in Ireland are significantly less than those in other European countries.  EUROSTAT data revealed that labour costs in the hospitality and wholesale sectors lagged behind the average of the 15 EU member states in nominal terms and purchasing power parity.  Labour costs in the hospitality sector are about 11.4% below the EU average.  In the wholesale and retail sector, labour costs are 10.9% below the EU average and are in the sixth lowest place.  Comparatively speaking, Irish labour costs are significantly less than in other European countries.  The 240,000 or 250,000 people covered by JLCs are among the lowest paid in the country.  The OECD stated that Ireland has a greater instance of low pay than the EU average.  Restaurant workers are paid about 6% below the average.  Far from saving or creating jobs, the proposals of the Minister, Deputy Bruton, will destroy them.Reductions in the income of the poorest section of the Irish workforce will depress demand further and cause more closures and unemployment.  People on low wages spend every last ha'penny of their income in this country and their locality.  If one walks down the main street of any town, one will find shops closed for business because demand has been depressed.  This is destroying jobs and businesses.  Taking more money from the pockets of low-paid workers will further depress demand, leading to more unemployment and the closure of more businesses.The JLC rates protect good employers from being undercut and driven out of business by those who are trying to make a quick buck at the expense of their employees.  The proposal to introduce an inability to pay clause will inevitably lead to the collapse of the entire JLC system.  The Minister's proposals are part of an employer strategy to drive down wages across the economy, while the financial assets of the super rich remain untouched by tax and are allowed to grow exponentially.Other elements of the proposals will depress demand.  The contention that existing employees will not be affected by the proposals is grossly misleading.  The proposal to discontinue annual increments of service pay or craft pay is a major attack on low-paid workers.  It will depress demand, as well as causing unemployment and the closure of businesses.I come from the town of Clonmel where in 1912 James Connolly and Jim Larkin proposed to the Irish Trade Union Congress that the principle of independent political representation of workers should be established on a 32-county basis by a Labour Party.   The centenary of the Labour Party will be celebrated next year, but will income reductions for the lowest paid mark that anniversary?  Connolly and Larkin were addressing the evils of low pay and poverty when they founded the Labour Party in Clonmel in 1912.  I hope, therefore, that tomorrow night Labour Party Deputies will vote against these proposals and show that this is a red line issue for them.

I want to introduce a reasoned debate on the issue.  As an employer, I understand something of the issues involved, as well as dealing with my constituents.  I agree with most of what my colleagues have said but the Minister, Deputy Bruton's intervention is timely.  We must be reasonable because we are in a deep and serious recession following a boom.  Many thousands of workers never benefited from the so-called Celtic tiger.  Nonetheless, the lMF is in town and, together with our EU partners, they are forcing us to deal with issues and examine matters across the board in order to introduce competitiveness to the economy.  Above all, we must continue to have fair play and protect low-paid workers at all costs.  I voted against my own Government when it sought to cut the minimum wage.  However, what some of the JLCs had established was pure nonsense and unsustainable.  One pay rate might apply in a Dublin pub, while next door in a café a different rate could apply.The previous speaker referred to what happened in 1912 with Connolly and Larkin.  In more recent decades I have supported moves to protect workers, but when we introduced new laws, we never repealed the old ones.  Therefore, we have a plethora of laws and it is impossible for employers or prospective employers to work with them and related issues.  Many such measures were negotiated under the aegis of the former Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, when there was a "give all" policy and anything could be negotiated.  Union leaders made good packages for themselves, but many workers were left outside the remit of such negotiations.  In addition, small companies were not represented at the table in the partnership talks because they were not members of IBEC or the Construction Industry Federation.  These employers have been ploughing a lonely furrow, although they have a good relationship with their workers.  The minimum wage does not enter their minds; they are more concerned with ensuring the payment of fair remuneration for workers with whom they have had an excellent relationship for many decades.In opposition many members of the Government made promises to undo and change everything.  They said there would be fair play across the board, but when they took office, they found that the IMF had laid down strict guidelines.  However, we should not throw out the baby with the bath water.  We must seriously examine some agreements and renegotiate them.  Many people in my area are ready, willing and able to work for the rates they receive in the catering business.  They are also happy to work unsocial hours.  They do not want to be told by the National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, that they must charge for working extra time because they have a good relationship with their employers.  NERA is supposedly working to police employers.  I do not condone the actions of unscrupulous employers for one minute and would condemn any who treat workers unfairly.  However, we must support reasonable employers and encourage them to stay in business and create more jobs.Reference has been made to the bloodstock industry which has major issues to face.  Most of those involved in that sector, including trainers and jockeys, understand most race meetings are held on Saturdays and Sundays.  The wages might not be 100%, but they are in the job for the love of it.  They do it well and are rewarded for winning and maintaining the good name of the bloodstock industry, especially in south Tipperary.  They are not asking NERA to police the industry and demanding time and a half on Saturdays or double time on Sundays to ride horses.  They love to be out on the racetrack doing what they do best — winning races and promoting the business.  We must be fair and reasonable in this regard.  We must examine the issue and listen to the Minister.  I hope fair play and reason will prevail.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	388	I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to speak in this important debate on the issue of low pay and the joint labour committee system.  Cutting low pay rates further will not do anything for the economy, job creation or the country as a whole.  Attacking the low paid and making them pay for the actions of the greedy should never be an option in a democratic society.  I will show clearly why this type of economic vandalism will never work and want to push the issue of low pay, particularly concerning job creation.  I am glad the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, is present to listen to the arguments.In recent days I heard the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ring, talk about middle Ireland losing out and constantly being hammered by taxes, cuts and new charges.  I accept his point that such people are suffering, but what about those who have lost their jobs and those on low wages who are really being hammered?  Middle Ireland is hurting, but low-paid workers are on the floor.  That is the reality for many.  Does the Minister think it is fair for a cleaner, his wife and two children to have to live on €330 a week?  After three years in the job his hourly rate is €9.50, rising to €10.50 for night work, with time and a half on Sundays.  This is tough going for any family, yet that is what is happening in the real world.  Could the Minister and his family survive on such an income?  I ask him to give a commitment not to cut such wages in any form under the joint labour committee system.  Some 23,000 cleaners will be directly affected if the proposed changes are made.  I plead with the Minister to consider these situations.Is the Minister also aware that economic research shows that the abolition of the JLCs could cost 10,000 jobs due to the reduction in the spending power of low paid workers?  Does he and his Government understand the findings of the Duffy Walsh report, which states that lowering the pay of these low paid workers is "unlikely to have a substantial effect on employment"?  There is a strong economic argument against hammering lower paid workers.In recent days we all have received letters from staff members of Vodafone Ireland which announced recently that it will move 130 jobs based in Ireland to offshore locations in Egypt and India.  I ask the Minister to use his influence and any methods at his disposal to stop the relocation of those jobs from Ireland and to develop his job retention strategy in a more sensible way.The motion before us states:according to the OECD, Ireland suffers from some of the highest levels of low-pay; Over 21% of full-time employees are low-paid, compared to a eurozone average of 14.7%, and EU Commission data shows that labour costs (including wages and employers' contributions) in the food and accommodation sector in Ireland are 6% below the EU 15 average;very many people covered by Joint Labour Committee/Employment Regulation Orders (JLC/EROs) and Registered Employment Agreements (REAs) are vulnerable people such as immigrants and young people and those working in small employments not amenable to trade unionisation;the majority of workers covered by the JLC/EROs and REAs system are women and that any reduction in remuneration in this sector will widen the gender income gap contrary to national and EU policy;due to the serious and disproportionate reduction in male employment, female workers form a higher proportion of primary bread winners and that reduction in female earnings would have a major impact on household and child poverty contrary to national and EU policy;reduction in the remuneration of already lowly paid employees will result in a reduction in revenue to the State through PAYE and VAT and will lead to an increase in claims for Family Income Supplement payments...Low pay leads to more poverty and more disadvantage, and we must acknowledge that.I strongly support the motion tabled by the members of the Technical Group and the United Left Alliance.  It is important to listen to all sides of the debate.  We on this side of the House stand up for low paid workers.  It is also important to challenge the Labour Party and its history of supporting workers on the ground.  I call on Members of the Labour Party to support us on this motion at 8.30 p.m. tomorrow.  This is an important motion.  It is about protecting more than 200,000 low paid workers, retaining and preserving jobs and thus preventing people from having to obtain rent supplement and a medical card, which end up costing the State more.  These are issues that are not mentioned when one reads coverage of the broad debate in the broader media.  It is important that we stand up for and respect these people, make a strong effort and give a commitment to support them in this motion.I call on all Members of this House to support the motion.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21282	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	391	I thank the Opposition for raising this matter and it is important to have a debate on it in the House.We must consider the context in which this debate is occurring.  We have had the most catastrophic collapse in employment in this economy.  We have lost 340,000 jobs and 450,000 people are on the live register.  We must strike a balance between regulating detailed arrangements governing the working conditions of individuals and creating employment opportunities.  That is what the programme for Government set out to do.  As stated in the amendment, we immediately increased the national minimum wage to restore the wages of people who are on the very lowest pay.  We are retaining the JLC system, which is a system for regulating and giving certainty to people who are in sectors that are typically poorly organised, but we are reforming that system because it must be responsive to those dramatically changed employment conditions.  Following the collapse of demand that has occurred, with people having to cut prices — hotel prices are down 20% — and having to scrabble and scrounge to keep businesses alive, we cannot pretend that competitiveness does not matter.  It does matter and we must be able to be competitive.The Government is reforming not only this system but the upward only rent review system, legal costs and other professions that are in the sheltered sector.  We are reforming access to credit to ensure small businesses can get credit to survive.  We are reforming the way we regulate business to ensure there is less red tape.  There must be a concerted effort to create employment in this society and that is the most critical issue we face.Our system of labour regulation is unusual in Europe in that we have a combination of centralised bargaining, a national minimum wage system and a series of sectoral minimum wages that regulate not only wage levels but an array of details about employment terms, some of which are protected in other parts of labour law already.  We have a very complex structure.  It is not only in Ireland labour market structures are being reviewed so as to become more able to create employment; this is happening throughout Europe.  It is not surprising that has arisen as very much part of the adjustment to our difficulties.Jobs are the key to recovery in this country.  That is the core belief of this Government.  It is essential that we make choices that make jobs the priority.I listened to talk about poverty and that is a real concern.  There is no category in the labour market more prone to poverty than people who are out of work.  They are ten times more likely to be living in poverty than people who have jobs.  That is the core driver of disadvantage in our community.  It is the surge in unemployment that is marginalising people.  We must do everything we can to protect against that.One can say that reform in this area is affecting people who are low paid.  People covered by JLCs and EROs are predominately low paid and less organised, but it is also to those sectors of construction, retail, catering and hotels that we look for opportunities to bring young people and less skilled people who are out of work back into employment.  They will not get jobs in teaching or social services; those are not the opportunities that will be available to them.  We need to examine this sector as well as all the other sectors that the programme for Government is addressing.  It is vital we open up opportunities for people and that we counteract poverty in the most practical way by giving people a purpose to get up in the morning, a job to go to and a reward for their efforts.  That is very important.We have had the Duffy Walsh report which was initiated on 8 February by the previous Government.  The report, conducted by Mr. Kevin Duffy and Dr. Frank Walsh, undertook widespread consultation.  The independent review concluded that substantial competitive gains could be realised in some of the sectors covered by joint labour committees, JLCs, and registered employment agreements, REAs, by reforming the structure of decision making so that the system would be more flexible and responsive to the needs of those particular sectors.  The review favours simplifying the system in a way that reduces the burden of supervision and compliance with regulations and provides a degree of co-ordination and oversight in the system so as to ensure arrangements across sectors are reasonable and proportionate.The review observed that there is validity in the argument that the current arrangements regarding Sunday working are unduly burdensome, particularly in sectors in which Sunday is a normal working day.  The review accepts that there is a need for greater consistency across sectors in respect of such matters as overtime and Sunday premiums.While the Government is committed to retaining the basic structure of the JLC-REA system, we need to reform it to make it more responsive to changed circumstances.  The rates of pay are substantially above the national minimum wage and have increased more rapidly than it.

The Government believes that this sector offers real opportunity for job creation.  We have cut the VAT rate, eliminated the travel tax, reduced employers' PRSI and opened up opportunities for the sector.  It is the Government's ambition to see 1 million extra tourists visit Ireland.  To take advantage, we need a flexible system wherein people can deliver on a Sunday cost effectively and where there can be changes in the hours of operation to catch that business.

They are vital and we cannot pretend that the competitiveness of those sectors, be it in terms of rents or wages, is not important.  We need to confront these issues and try to create more opportunities in those sectors.The review was clear that these sectors have been particularly affected by the recession.  Deputy Higgins cited the absolute collapse in them.  Some 60% of jobs in the building industry have gone.

As the review pointed out, these sectors need reform.  The rules apply to some hotels but not to others.  They are applied to hotels in rural areas, where there is lower footfall and fewer opportunities to do business, yet they do not apply to hotels in the cities of Dublin and Cork.  How is this a fair or level playing pitch for people who are creating employment?The same situation obtains in respect of retail.  The rules apply if one is selling groceries like eggs, butter and milk, but they do not apply if one is selling flowers or books.  We need a balanced system that allows jobs to be created in a way that is fair.  Some of these regulations need to be reformed to be made more responsive to the demand conditions we face if we want to make jobs our priority.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21282	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	403	It is important that we recognise the value in protecting these rules.  We are not going down the road of abandoning them, as has been called for by employer organisations and others.  These rules provide orderly regulation of conditions for people who would otherwise be poorly organised and would not receive their rights.  Where legislation governs sectors, though, it is a different matter.  We should recognise the importance of the collective bargaining that has underpinned the REAs. Throughout Europe, there are systems to protect collective bargaining and negotiated terms.However, the Duffy Walsh report has indicated that our systems need to be more flexible to be able to respond to dramatically changed conditions, predominantly in the construction sector, which is regulated by these rules.  Costs in the construction sector have decreased by 30% or 40% and people cannot get contracts.  Due to changed demand conditions, rates that could be paid previously are no longer possible.  If Irish companies are to win business, they must be able to respond.  Many people claim that contractors are coming from the North to take business for which the former cannot contract.  As we address this sector, we must be aware of different levels of competitiveness North and South.It is important that we provide certainty by ensuring agreements remain in place and the playing pitch stays level.  Where maverick employers abuse the system, we support the need for proper enforcement.  The National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, which is within my Department's aegis, is designed to ensure fair terms and conditions are being applied.  NERA was set up in 2007 to foster a culture of compliance and to encourage people to respect these rules.  We support the idea of maintaining a system that protects people who are not well organised or who have collectively negotiated REAs so that maverick employers do not break away.  Enforcement and encouraging compliance are essential, but this does not mean that one should blind oneself to the need to make these systems responsive.  At the heart of the Duffy Walsh analysis is that systems need to be made responsive to the changed conditions we face.

I hope to be able to revert to the Government with proposals.It is important to remember that, while these systems change, they create an opportunity for employers to take on new workers at different rates or in different circumstances, but existing workers are still protected by their existing terms and conditions of employment.  Their contracts remain valid and protect people in employment.

No doubt it is a topic that deserves robust debate in the Chamber, but the United Left Alliance's motion is hypocritical, to say the least.

To single out people in this debate is a new low in this Chamber.  We must engage with the reality on the ground.  People throughout the country are struggling to put food on their tables.  There is no doubt about that.  That is a consequence of the previous Government.Unlike the United Left Alliance, the Labour Party cannot afford to live in a constant revolution.  We must deal with reality.  I have given careful consideration to the Duffy Walsh report, the employment regulation orders and wage setting mechanisms here.  I, and many of my Labour Party colleagues, speak as one on that.  While it remains my opinion that cutting wages will not do anything for job creation, I understand as well anyone the position in which the Minister finds himself as a consequence of the previous Government's commitment to the EU and IMF, in particular a document signed off with the EU and IMF under the memorandum agreement in December 2011.  The Duffy Walsh report affords this Government a considerable and viable roadmap to bring about reform which is widely accepted and agreed by the social partners and trade union movement here.  There is no disputing this Government on the need for reform.  There is wide consensus that reform of our antiquated system in this area is necessary.  The Labour Party welcomes the opportunity to be part of that reform.There are varying views within Government on the scope of that reform.  I am fully confident that the Cabinet will make the right decision when this issue is laid on the table next week.  Within the Duffy Walsh report there is no evidence to suggest that cutting wages will lead to job creation.  There is no evidence to suggest that if we cut pay there will be a corresponding growth in employment.  It would be a mistake to ignore a cohort of expert opinion in this area.  If we go down this road we will find that it has the potential to destroy the economy.  The central cause of failing business and job losses is the unprecedented collapse in consumer spending.  That fall is ten times greater in Ireland than in any of our eurozone competitor countries.  Not surprisingly, we can thank the previous Government for this.A couple of weeks ago I spoke in this Chamber in support of the jobs initiative, a commendable attempt by the Government to help people get back to work and get their lives in order.  It is imperative to be mindful of what we are trying to achieve.  We must avoid making any decision which counteracts the proposals we are making.  This Government was elected on a promise to protect people from the politics of the past.  I intend to defend that promise because there are people who quite literally are hanging by a thread.  I spoke two weeks ago about retailers in my constituency of east Galway who face the reality of that day in and day out.  This is about keeping money in the pockets of working people and ensuring they can attend their work with some element of dignity.  It is not about personal tax or points on red line issues, such as have been made here.Despite the conflict we are hearing in the House today, we need reform and to protect the domestic economy.  We need to protect what people have in their pockets, thus ensuring that high street Ireland can be confident consumer spending will keep doors open.  I look forward to the outcome of the deliberations at Cabinet.  We look forward to the Cabinet collectively standing over a decision to protect working people.

I echo much of what the previous speaker said.  I wish to deal with the reality on the ground.  I hold a candle not for any vested interests but for people whom I know and went to school and college with, many of whom now live in different corners of the world owing to our economic situation and others who live in Kilkenny, Carlow and other parts of the country who want jobs but cannot get a job.The Minister set out in his contribution to the House the Government's position on the fundamental difficulty faced by our society.  We are facing not alone an economic problem but a societal problem.  A whole generation of young people is unemployed.  Many have emigrated.  We must, as a Government, do everything to ensure we create jobs for those people into the future.As complications attached to any field of employment rise, the fluidity of that market and the willingness and capability to create employment within it falls.  For example, there are currently 20 different rates of pay in the hotel sector.  This is not an isolated case.  Across the 21 main employment regulation orders, EROs, and registered employment agreements, REAs, there are 314 different wage rates which increase complexity relating to pay arrangements and decrease employment by reducing clarity and stagnating the areas which they cover.Reform such as that proposed by the Minister, Deputy Bruton, is not easy.  With misrepresentation, the hallmark of some of the comments I have heard from the Opposition tonight, this becomes even harder.  We need to be clear.  This is not an assault on the most vulnerable workers.  Fine Gael and the Labour Party committed themselves, prior and subsequent to the election, to restoring the national minimum wage to its previous level prior to the cut introduced by the former Government.  This is not an attempt to abolish Sunday rates, as suggested by many.  This reform is about bringing simplification and clarity to our wage mechanisms.  It is about reducing inequity not creating it.  One of the myths that persisted in this debate, and was echoed throughout the media, is that the Government intends to reduce Sunday pay rates.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Sunday pay rates are safeguarded by the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 which requires that Sunday working be compensated either by an increased rate of pay, a premium payment on Sunday or time off in lieu of the Sunday worked.  Ultimately, this means that workers in the sectors affected by JLCs would have the same conditions for Sunday working as do employees across the remainder of the economy.Since the introduction of JLCs in the 1940s our labour laws have changed dramatically.  Protection has been introduced.  The Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 was enacted and a minimum wage was introduced, which minimum wage was recently restored to its prior level.  It is disingenuous and it is a distraction from valid points in this debate to suggest that this is anything other than ironing out inequity in our system, one which divides 25% of private sector workers from the remaining 75%.The proposed legislation seeks to safeguard jobs and to remove barriers for people willing to hire in these sectors.  I do not speak for anyone on any rich list anywhere.  Many small businesses in my constituency and on high streets eager to take on employees find themselves unable to do so because of an outdated JLC system.  There has been a 60% loss in construction employment and a 15% loss in retail employment.  If one combines this with the knowledge that there are 314 different rates of pay across the 21 sectors mentioned, one would agree this is a barrier that should be removed to prevent further loss of jobs and aid potential gains.  Sectors governed by JLCs are among the hardest hit in terms of employment reduction in our economy.  Wages in these sectors have remained on an artificial plateau relative to other private sector wages.  This has prevented employment creation.  For this reason, I support the Minister's amendment.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14076	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	421	The programme for Government states:We will reform the Joint Labour Committee structure beginning with the appointment of independent chairpersons to JLCs who will retain a casting vote.  Reform options will examine the rate of pay for atypical hours.To inject some context into the debate and, perhaps, give an account of the conclusions of the Duffy Walsh report, the so-called independent review, I will speak to some of the facts as they pertain to that report.The basic framework of the current JLC-REA regulatory system should be retained, the report concludes.  However, the system requires overhaul to make it fairer and more responsive to changing economic circumstances and labour market conditions.  The overriding purpose of the recommendations of the report is to create a framework within which greater efficiencies and necessary adjustments in payroll costs can be achieved in the affected sectors.Lowering the basic JLC rates to the level of the minimum wage rate is unlikely to have a substantial effect on employment, the report concludes.  Having investigated the size of the wage differential in some detail, the review team did not find evidence of substantial wage premiums.  Even to err on the side of the strand of the literature that finds the largest negative effects from minimum wages on employment, the results imply that cutting minimum wages lowers total earnings of low wage workers and has potentially important distributional consequences.  However, as is clear for all to see, the minimum wage has been restored.Those who advocated abolition of the current system pointed to the significant body of employment rights legislation now in force as providing adequate legal protection for employee rights and interests.  However, the review team concludes that it is not accurate to suggest that the body of primary employment rights legislation currently in force adequately covers matters dealt with by EROs and REAs.  Most of the EROs provide for overtime payments and premium payments to those required to work on Sundays.  These provisions are a source of significant concern to employers in sectors which normally trade on Sundays.  They contend that the cost of employing staff on Sundays is now prohibitive.  Independently of the JLCs, the obligation to provide additional compensation for Sunday working is derived primarily from section 14 of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997.  The review team believes, however, that the mode of compliance with that provision should be addressed to ensure uniform and fairer arrangements across the affected sectors.There are potentially substantial competitive gains that could be realised in some of the affected sectors by reforming the structure of decision making in JLCs so that the system is more flexible and responsive to the needs of particular sectors.  Competitiveness can also be enhanced by simplifying the system in a way that reduces the burden of supervision and compliance and by providing a degree of co-ordination and oversight over the system that ensures arrangements across sectors are reasonable and proportionate.Nothing in the Duffy Walsh report is radical, depending on one's point of view.  It speaks to the issue of a greater degree of flexibility but also to the issue of reform in regard to examining the rates for atypical hours, which is dealt with in the programme for Government.  A process is under way in which all the stakeholders have been consulted, including trade union interests, and I understand there has been extensive consultation in that regard.  I hope this will bring about a measured solution so that all parties, whether workers or employers, can find a middle ground in order that there is a degree of satisfaction on all sides.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	422	I congratulate the Technical Group on tabling the motion which gives us the opportunity to debate this very important topic.  Reference was made to a leaked IMF document.  I point out that what the previous Government agreed with the EU-IMF is itself a public document.  It was agreed between the EU-IMF on one side and the previous Government on the other that this matter would be studied, that the study would be complete within six weeks and that the Government would give attention to that study.If Deputy Keaveney thinks the reference by the Technical Group motion to the Labour Party is a new low in debate in this House, all I can say is that he is pitifully unaware of some of the carry-on of the Labour Party when it was in Opposition in recent years.  Moreover, if these measures were being proposed now by a Government which did not contain the Labour Party, this House would be like the Wailing Wall of Jerusalem.  In fact, we would hear the wails in Jerusalem.In the interests of balance, I must agree with one point made by the Minister.  I agree that the present Government did the right thing in reversing the minimum wage cut.  The previous Government made two serious mistakes in regard to the minimum wage, first, by cutting it, because that did not work and did not achieve what it set out to achieve, and, second, in the way it was done.  I say this because it is of clear relevance to the present debate for the simple reason that the very same people who approached us and made a case for the cutting of the minimum wage are the ones who are coming back now to make similar arguments for the dismantling of the JLC scheme.  They are almost the same personalities making literally the same arguments.The previous Government was seduced and entertained by the arguments that no sooner than the ink would be dry on the legislation reducing the minimum wage by €1 an hour than there would be a rush of employers to take tens of thousands of people off the dole queues.  Of course, that did not happen.  While there was a rush, unfortunately, it was a rush to the bottom.There have been media reports referring to the women staff in the Davenport Hotel who took a case because their wages were reduced, even though they had been employed before the changes came into force.  I can tell from my own constituency clinics what happened at the time the Government introduced the new minimum wage.  Many people, including migrant workers, young people, women and those who were not well educated — I say that in no condescending way — told me their employers were putting pressure on them.  Employers threatened to get rid of part-time workers unless they agreed to the new minimum wage, although they were employed before its introduction and were supposed to be entitled to the old minimum wage.  They were told there were thousands of people prepared to do their jobs, and they were subjected to all sorts of pressure and displacement threats.  It was an immediate race to the bottom.The Minister's claim that the new regulations he is introducing will not affect those already in the system is especially risible.  Despite minimum wage legislation which is clear, precise and specific and which everyone can point to, the new regulations would have created a two-tier system.  If it was impossible to make a two-tier system stick in that regard, how much more impossible will it be in the more amorphous situation we are talking about here?  It is unthinkable.The traditional view was that wage floors imposed on lower wage workers had a terrible effect on employment.  The latter view, supported by much study, is that a binding minimum wage set at a low level, as it is in this country, will have at most a marginal negative effect on employment.  The Duffy Walsh report cites various studies, such as that by O'Neill, Nolan and Williams in 2006 and the 1995 study from Card and Krueger of Princeton University, and there is much additional contemporary literature that all comes to the same conclusion, namely, cutting low wages or refusing to put a floor on a low wage sector has at best a minimal impact on job creation.  In some cases, in fact, imposing minimum wages or putting a floor under wages actually has a positive effect on employment, which is the conclusion of the Duffy Walsh report and is supported by practically all modern literature on the subject.  There is no doubt that people in the JLC sector in this country are low paid, by any standards.  For the most part, they are paid an average €10 an hour.  That includes people who get time and a third, which rate, in the overwhelming majority of cases, applies to Sunday work or to those who get extra pay because they are more experienced or skilled.  If anybody has any doubt about this, let them open the Duffy Walsh report on page 29 and look at tables 4.4 and 4.5.  One table deals with wages on a weekly basis for people in the JLC sector as opposed to others in the private sector; the other deals with hourly rates.  One can get a distorted picture dealing with weekly rates because some of the people in question are part-time, do not work a full 39-hour week and therefore their wages show up as being lower.  To rectify the situation, the hourly rates tell us those people are paid roughly 40% of what the private sector in general is paid.One does not even need to look at the Duffy Walsh report because one can look at the latest figures from the CSO, produced last weekend.  These looked at average earnings throughout the economy which, apparently, are now €674.56 per week, down from €709 some two years ago, a considerable drop.  In the public sector average earnings were €871.09 per week; in the private sector they were €602.85.  What is interesting is that the CSO looked at different sectors within the private sector.  Surprise, surprise — in the accommodation and food services sector, the very sector where the vast majority of workers are JLC workers, average wages were €288.63 per week.  We are talking about the very lowest waged people in the economy.I have a question for the Minister, Deputy Bruton.  Does national salvation lie by cutting these wages even further?  Are the wages of those people who are barely eking out a living really such an obstacle to national recovery?  Would reducing them open the floodgates to job creation?  There is not a scintilla of evidence to support any of those propositions.However, there are important demand consequences, as was mentioned.  We are dealing here with people who are at the very bottom of the wages rung, who have to spend every cent they earn in order to survive from one week to the next.  They spend all their money within the domestic economy.  It follows, as night follows day, that if there is a cut, resulting in their earning less money, they will have less money to spend in the domestic economy.  The jobs and livelihoods of people such as shop assistants etc. who depend on these people spending their money will suffer.  Jobs will be lost.  The Duffy Walsh committee suggested the figure in question would be approximately 10,000.  I do not know the statistical evidence for that but suspect it may understate the situation.  The reason tens or hundreds of thousands of jobs have been lost in the domestic economy is that domestic demand has fallen catastrophically.  It follows that if one further reduces domestic demand by reducing wages further demand will fall even more and the consequences will be more of the same — more unemployment, less tax revenue and more people dependent on social welfare, a system that is creaking at the seams.  There will be more welfare traps.  It will become less attractive for people to go to work and more attractive to stay on welfare simply because people will not be able to afford to go to work if their wages are cut by much more.The issue of Sunday premiums is a total myth.  People telephone my office and write letters and e-mails claiming people are getting double time on Sundays.  The JLC for the main sector of people who work on Sundays was recently changed, without any ado, very quickly and efficiently.  The time premium was reduced from time and a half to time and a third.  That is the position for the vast majority of people who are paid extra for working on Sundays — time and a third.  Most of those people are on €9 an hour.  I know a few of them — they now get €3 an hour extra.  Let us say they work four hours on a Sunday — that is an extra €12 before tax.  Will interfering with or taking that away destroy the economy?  In 1993 the British Government decided to abolish Sunday premiums but this action did not create a single solitary job, as all the studies show.  That is the reality.I utterly reject what the Minister stated about the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997.  We are told there is legislation which covers this matter, namely, that Act.  However, with all due respect, there is a fundamental difference between the JLC system and the legislation of 1997.  If employers do not meet their obligations under a JLC, then the National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, is there to enforce them.  On the other hand, if an employer does not meet his or her obligation under legislation it is up to the individual who may be vulnerable, perhaps young, a migrant or a part-time employee, to take on the employer.  It is an impossible contest but that is the shift being made here.Why do we have JLCs in the first place?  The reason is that collective bargaining was not available in those sectors.  Now we are reversing the whole process, sweeping away what was put in place of collective bargaining even through collective bargaining is still not available.  That is what is happening throughout the Minister's proposed additions to the Duffy Walsh report.  I do not accept them.The same is being tried in regard to extra pay for more experience or more skills.  Do we expect a migrant worker who works part-time and may be in an extremely weak position vis-à-vis an employer to go and negotiate this rate for himself or herself?  Of course, people will say about Sunday working that under the legislation one can go to the Labour Court.  However, it would take at least five years to get into that court — that is the reality.Another proposal was mentioned by the Minister, although not today in the Chamber nor, indeed, in the public domain.  In regard to the derogation clause he mentioned two points, the first that there is a derogation clause under the national minimum wage legislation, which is the case; the second that there is a derogation clause attached to national wage agreements.  He did not make entirely clear in which direction he wished to go.  The Duffy Walsh committee chose the derogation clause under the national minimum wage, where there is at least some protection for workers, and insisted on putting another restriction on it.  If the Minister is talking about the derogation system being under the national minimum wage there will be no protection.  The employer can say, "Look, can't pay, good night, that's it, no appeal".  The whole system will be set at nought.This is insidious and I am deeply surprised that the Labour Party is so blasé and casual about the matter.

The Minister, Deputy Bruton, mentioned the possibility of significant employment gains in the tourism sector, on which the Government is focused as witnessed by the VAT changes.  However, tourists expect a certain level of service and one cannot expect people to provide First World levels of service and effort with Third World rates of pay.I ask the Minister seriously to rethink these proposals.  They are not supported by any economic studies I have read and will not create any extra employment.  They will reduce wages, damage the source of solidarity and, by reducing demand in the economy, will increase unemployment and all its attendant illnesses.

#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	426	I support this motion and reiterate my party's opposition to any attempt to undermine further the wages and conditions of low-paid workers.  I reiterate there has been an attempt to create a type of myth about workers who are covered by the rates set under the employment regulations orders and registered employment agreements.  Some employers and media commentators have even suggested that doing away with these could lift the burden from employers and, in itself, this would almost lead to an economic recovery.  That is nonsense, as clearly proved by statistics cited in the Duffy Walsh report, which shows that the majority of workers who are covered by the rates in question are on low wages. In many cases, the rate set by order was less than the restored national minimum wage.  In many of these instances, the only things bringing these workers above that level were overtime rates and, in a few cases, commission.  If overtime were to be eliminated or drastically reduced, many workers covered by these orders would slip below the minimum wage.  If that were allowed, and the proposal to allow employers who are covered by wage orders to avail of an "inability to pay" clause were accepted, it would have drastic implications for hundreds of thousands of workers and their families.  In such circumstances, a substantial proportion of the workforce would be living in dire poverty.  Is that what the champions of the free market wish for this country?  Do they want people who are in work to be unable to afford to maintain any reasonable standard of life?  I suggest that will be the consequence if they have their way and persuade the Government to go well beyond the recommendations of the report by sanctioning a race to the bottom.  It would make the national minimum wage almost an irrelevancy.I would like to refer to the myth that drastically reducing the wages of people covered by these orders will somehow lead to a huge expansion in employment.  In the majority of cases, we are talking about people in the service sector, such as hairdressers, hotel workers, security personnel and cleaners.  In other words, we are talking about people whose jobs depend on other people's disposable income.  It does not take a genius to realise that many of these sectors are doing badly because of the overall state of the economy.  Fewer people are working and more people are earning less than they were.  This has drastically reduced the amount of money people are spending.  It takes even less of a genius to work out that if the wages of people working in the sectors I have mentioned are reduced further, there will be even less money to go around.  The less money people spend, the fewer jobs there will be.  Any reduction in the wages of hairdressers, hotel staff and security workers will not create jobs or provide an economic stimulus.  All it will do is shift more of the shrinking pie from the pockets and purses of workers to the pockets and purses of employers.  More than such short-sighted thinking will be needed if this economy is to recover and get back to growth.  Real investment in the productive economy will be needed.  Rather than retreating from the economy, as many people are advocating, the State will be required to play a central role in it.I wish to emphasise a central issue that needs to be remembered when we are talking about the economy.  Every cent that is paid to the low-income families and people about whom we are speaking is spent in local economies and helps to keep people in work.  If the Government intends to reduce their wage levels, or to take away the few hours of overtime they might get at the weekend, the effect of that will be to take money out of the economy, to create more unemployment and to put the economy in a bigger mess.  The State needs to defend those whose wages and conditions are under attack.  It should not allow hard-won rights to be abolished or ignored in the interests of a short-sighted, mean and reactionary agenda.  Those who are pursuing that agenda want our right-wing Government to placate its new masters in the IMF and the EU, penalise the less well-off in our communities and societies and attack the most vulnerable.  That is what is happening.  I am really shocked that members of this Government who claim to be socialists are involved in making this decision.  I have known the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, for a long time.  I do not think this type of situation sits easily with her.  The Minister of State and her party have the ability to withstand the agenda I have mentioned and to stand up for real, ordinary and decent people.  I refer to working-class people on low incomes, who represent the soul of the community and of society.  The Labour Party should stand by such people rather than allowing this to happen.

#MichelleMulherin	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-party	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-dob	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	428	There has been a great deal of debate about the excellent wind speeds along this country's western seaboard.  We do not have hard information about the nature of the resource that is available to us.  It is like drilling a few trial holes for oil without being able to assess or quantify the actual resource we have.  Notwithstanding all the fine talk about our renewable wind energy resource, and the fact that we have the best wind speeds in Europe, the reality is the development of our wind energy potential is decades behind that of our European neighbours.  If we are to stop guessing, it is important for us to have an objective measurement of this resource.  When we are telling investors about this commodity, we should be able to calculate the productivity and returns they can expect at certain heights, such as 50 m, 100 m or 150 m.  Such bankable information is needed to ensure investment in the wind industry is fast-tracked.Bankers demand quality of production data, known as P90 data, when they are deciding whether to invest in wind industry products.  We need to be able to take such information to the ECB and the UK Treasury.  Such data allow the Government to be realistic about the actual commodity when it is assessing how wind can contribute to the targets of producing 40% of energy from renewable sources by 2020 and reducing our carbon emissions.  The British Government recently said it would be interested in subsidising the Irish wind farm industry.  When the State deals with such investors, it should know with what it is dealing, for what it should be looking and the terms it should be striking.  Information on the optimum locations and heights for turbines should be available to county councillors and planning authorities when they are deciding how to achieve the best productivity with the smallest number of turbines.  We do not need wind turbines in every location where the wind blows.  Therefore, we need to be able to plan and prioritise where we should, or should not, build this country's transmission grid.The wind is an indigenous natural resource like oil, gas and peat.  The State needs to avoid relying on investors to ascertain the value of this commodity.  This is one of the recurring themes that have blighted the progress of the Corrib gas field, for example.  It has been suggested that the best deal for Irish citizens was not obtained when a natural resource was being developed in that instance.  Above all, the Irish public is entitled to get full knowledge about the value of this commodity.  The people of the west will be required to accommodate the infrastructural burden associated with the wind turbines and transmission lines that have to be constructed for the benefit of the entire country.  They need to be shown what is the prize and  the community benefits for people living in the west.  If the Government's ambitions for the development of our wind energy capacity and the achievement of European targets are to be fulfilled, ordinary citizens must embrace and participate in the journey towards this realisation.  Although the people of the west are keen to play their part in this country's economic recovery, they do not want simply to be told by experts what is best for them.  People are intelligent enough to appreciate a good deal if that is what is on offer.  If wind is the resource to be developed, people will get behind it.  Dialogue and transparency are needed as part of that.Has the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources properly measured this resource?  If not, does it intend to do so?  A resource assessment could be conducted using the resource data held by Met Éireann, Coillte and Bord na Móna.  Separate assessments could be done if there are gaps in that information.  I was a member of Mayo County Council when it was trying to develop a renewable energy strategy.  When we sought resource data from semi-State and State agencies like Bord na Móna and Coillte, we found they were unwilling to share them with us even though their compilation had been paid for by Irish taxpayers.  It is unacceptable that they refused to provide this data on the grounds that they were commercially sensitive.  We are working in unison in this respect or we are not.  Does the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources accept that this resource needs to be measured?  I believe it does, as a critical starting point in our journey towards a true realisation of our wind energy resource potential.  What steps will be taken in this regard?  If the Minister does not believe we need to do this, perhaps he will explain why.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	429	I thank Deputy Mulherin for raising the issue.  It is something we will have to deal with much more substantially in the future.The seasonal and annual mean wind speeds per county have been modelled by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, which has responsibility for the production of the national wind atlas.  The mean wind speed figure might provide an indication for a county and a useful comparison of a county to other counties but local factors are always crucial in producing the actual mean wind speed at a site.  Such local factors include altitude, aspect, topography, land use and exposure.  As a result, the mean annual wind speed at different locations within a county can vary greatly.  A particular site's annual mean wind speed can be estimated using the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland's online wind atlas which is available on the SEAI website.  This will provide a better indication of the potential mean wind speed in a locality as opposed to the county's mean figure.At a national level the estimated accessible wind resource on land in 2020 is 12,000 MW using the methodology developed by SEAI.  My Department is in discussion with the SEAI regarding plans to update this information and data.  The SEAI advises that the accessible resource estimate accounts for the following constraints among others: minimum recommended spacing between turbines; extracted wind speeds below 7.5 m per second; buffer zones on and around habitation, roads, lakes, infrastructure and airports; cost; and social acceptance of wind turbines.  Current installed renewable generating plant capacity is at 1,776 MW.  Estimates for the amount of installed renewable energy capacity needed to reach our 2020 targets are in the order of 4,630 MW to 5,800 MW.  Clearly, the accessible resource far exceeds what will be required for domestic needs.High fossil fuel prices and geopolitical uncertainty underline the importance of renewable energy for security of supply and sustainable energy production.  It is clear that renewable energy has a crucial role to play in providing us with a cleaner and more sustainable source of fuel in the context of climate change.  The European Union has also recognised the important role that renewable energy can play.  To ensure member states harness the benefits of renewable energy, each country has been given a binding renewable energy target that it must achieve by 2020.  Ireland's target of 16% overall of all energy consumed across transport, heating and electricity is a five-fold increase on where we were in 2005 and, while very challenging, is deliverable.  Ireland has one of the best wind resources in all of Europe.  The bulk of our overall renewable energy target will be met through wind.  This is because of the scale of our wind resources.  By 2020, some 36% of our consumption in the electricity sector will be from wind generated electricity.We have made great strides in Ireland in the last decade in increasing our use of renewable energy.  In 2003, only 4.3% of our electricity consumption was from renewable sources.  At the end of last year, this was in excess of 13%, mainly due to the large increase in wind energy.  Wind generated electricity is supported through a feed-in tariff scheme known as REFIT.  This means that a minimum price is paid to renewable generators over 15 years to allow them to finance renewable projects.  Studies by EirGrid and the SEAI have shown that wind energy reduces the market price of all electricity at certain times, which benefits consumers and offsets any costs of the REFIT scheme.  Developing a large amount of renewable energy over the next decade will mean that significant electricity grid upgrades are needed.  EirGrid's Grid 25 strategy and implementation plans set out how this can be done.  New electricity infrastructure is necessary to transport this renewable electricity.  What we will see over the next decade is a transformation of our electricity landscape from one where we are highly dependent on fossil fuels to one where renewable energy makes a significant contribution.  The Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, attended the British-Irish Council meeting with the Taoiseach in London yesterday.  The considerable potential for close co-operation across these islands in the development and trading of renewable energy was the main focus of the agenda at that meeting.  We will be working with the UK, Northern Ireland and Scotland to deliver on this shared opportunity and challenge.I thank the Deputy for raising the issue.  I hope the reply was of some benefit.
#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	430	I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, for being here to take this matter.  I congratulate the Minister and the Government on the initiative taken in this area already as part of the larger jobs initiative programme.  It is important there is consistency with our nearest neighbours in this regard and I very much look forward to reviewing the scheme when it is completed.  No doubt its eventual success will be positive for this country.I have raised this matter with the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, on a couple of occasions already since the Dáil began.  I noted the figures he provided to me on those seeking and receiving the business permission entry scheme in recent years.  I believe we can do better and I think the Minister agrees.  In that regard, I was encouraged to learn his officials are working on new immigration schemes in the area of entrepreneurship and investment.I have raised this matter on the Adjournment because I wanted to offer some ideas of my own.  We lost a generation of entrepreneurs in this country.  Those who had the spirit and the talent went into property development.  Others, for whatever reasons, were persuaded to go into the perceived safety of certain professions.  We risk losing another generation overseas because of the economic crisis.  We need to get that spirit of enterprise back into this country and I think we need help from abroad to do it.We know Ireland is an attractive place to live.  We know people want to come here and to work.  We also know people want to come here to set up companies.  This is very true in particular sectors, especially the high-tech one.  We have some great start-up companies getting going in this area in this country.  We have the big foreign direct investment players such as Google and Facebook, but we need to get that third pillar, the foreign start-up company.  We need to look at ways of attracting foreign start-up companies to Ireland to add to the culture in that sector and in other sectors and to get that aspect of the economy growing again.The UK has what is called an entrepreneur visa scheme, which it recently reviewed.  We have the business permission scheme.  I think that we can learn from our neighbours in this regard to rebrand the business scheme as an Irish entrepreneur's visa and make some changes that will make it easier for foreign persons to come to Ireland to start a company in whatever sector, to create investment and jobs, and also to create a new culture of enterprise that, unfortunately, has been missing in recent years.I want to outline to the Minister a couple of suggestions as to how this scheme could be improved into an enterprise visa.  I have more details if the Minister would like them, but I will briefly go through six points that I have here.  The first relates to start-up funding.  If a foreign person wants to come to Ireland to set up a company, he or she needs to have a minimum of €300,000 to do so.  That is quite a lot of money, especially if one is working in the high-tech sector where today's start-up companies are quite lean and mean.  We need to reduce this figure to €200,000, for example.  It is still a lot, but €300,000 is too much.  That small reduction could help in attracting people into this country to set up their own companies.On business partners, most people setting up a company do not do so alone.  If two persons were to come here from abroad to set up a company and needed permission to do so, they would have to make two separate applications, go through two separate vetting processes and have two separate amounts of funding.  That is too much.  We need to facilitate it in order that a company — the business or potential business itself — can apply as one.  That would make much sense in that regard.The INIS website is not clear enough.  This is a simple change we can make.  People need to find the information more quickly and easily.  For example, people cannot find out details on the overall length of visa, the initial residence as well as any eventual terms of settlement or naturalisation.  The lack of information is acting as a barrier to people.There is also a bureaucratic burden in which an individual making an application must make it to two separate bodies.  That does not make any sense.  We need to centralise that.  We could take an holistic approach to the applications for such enterprise visas.There is also a support gap.  Companies starting up here have good supports — the city enterprise boards, the county enterprise boards and Enterprise Ireland — but there is no support for a foreign person coming to Ireland to set up a business.  We need to fill that gap.The last issue is vetting.  Currently, a person who wants to apply for the business permission scheme must have his or her business plan vetted by an accountancy firm.  They want to know where one is taking out a rental agreement and the layout for one's offices.  It is too much information.  If a person has €300,000 or €200,000 in funding and is backed by a VC firm or accountancy firm, that should be enough.These are six small changes that I propose to the Minister.  I would be interested in hearing the Minister's thinking on reforming the business permission scheme into something akin to the UK enterprise scheme.  If the Minister would like any further information from my office, I would be happy to give it.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	431	I very much appreciate Deputy Eoghan Murphy's input.  I note he has already had several conversations with the Minister in this respect.  I thank the Deputy for raising the matter and for inviting me to outline to the House the future direction of the Government's policy in this area.  As indicated previously to the House, there is scope for the Department to play a more proactive role in the national recovery effort.  An early indication of this commitment was clearly displayed on 11 May when the Minister, Deputy Shatter, announced the introduction of a visa waiver programme to provide an impetus to the tourist sector by allowing nationals of certain specified countries who obtain a short-term visa for the United Kingdom to visit Ireland without the need to obtain a separate Irish visa.  It has been our view for some time that we need to ensure our visa regulatory framework does not act as a barrier to expanding our tourism industry or as a disincentive to potential visitors to the State.  The Minister, Deputy Shatter, is pleased to be able to provide practical assistance in this regard.Other initiatives undertaken by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service in recent times have involved changes to the immigration arrangements for several categories of migrants to ensure more transparent and appropriate rules and, in particular, the ongoing reform of the student immigration system to assist the development of Ireland's high quality international education services industry.In the area of entrepreneurship and investment, the Minister agrees with the Deputy that the current business permission scheme operated by the Department through the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service needs a major overhaul.  The current scheme, which has been in operation for several years, has been reviewed by the Department and it is considered to be insufficiently flexible in several areas, including the financial investment threshold and the employment targets.  In this regard the Department's analysis concurs in many respects with the Deputy's views.  Furthermore, the existing system does not cater for the needs of innovation start-up enterprises which will often initially employ only the principals.  In addition, at present we do not have an immigration regime that caters for high net worth individuals who are willing to make a significant investment in the country in return for being allowed to reside here.  Most other countries have such schemes in place and we need to be competitive.  Even a small number of additional investments and enterprises attracted to Ireland could have a significant impact.The purpose of an investor scheme is to ensure that the funds available provide a clearly visible benefit to the State.  The funds would need to be substantial and for such arrangements to have any meaningful impact the investment would probably need to exist for an appreciable period.  The nature of the investment is one of the issues being explored at present.  Accordingly, the officials have been drawing up draft proposals for the Minister that would have the effect of broadening the eligibility criteria for business persons and investors to reside in Ireland.Migrant entrepreneurship and investment remain resources that have been insufficiently tapped into in the past and we must create what might be termed a more "diversified portfolio" within the immigration system aimed at attracting such persons to live, work and invest in Ireland.  In this regard we can consider putting in place an attractive immigration package while ensuring that necessary immigration controls remain in place.  The Department is currently in consultation with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and others and key agencies such as the IDA, Enterprise Ireland and Forfás with a view to assessing how the immigration system might facilitate further entrepreneurship and investment here.  Draft proposals are under discussion at present.  A key component identified by the Department will be the role the agencies can play in vetting or recommending projects, especially those where capital requirements can be offset by significant potential.Also, we have been reviewing what has been done in somewhat comparable immigration countries like United Kingdom, the USA, Australia, Canada and New Zealand in this area.  We expect to receive recommendations in the coming weeks.  We do not wish to be too prescriptive at this point but there is significant scope for progress in the area.  Certainly, we expect that the new arrangements will be up and running later this year.I thank my colleague for raising this important and topical issue.  Deputy Murphy's contribution has been most helpful and he may rest assured that all the points he has made will be taken on board.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	432	I wish to share time with Deputy John O'Mahony.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing this debate and I thank the Minister of State for being here.  The patient transport scheme enables those on the west coast who cannot access dialysis or cancer care appointments to get to their hospital appointment.  It affects 456 patients from Donegal to the Galway border, 125 of whom are dialysis patients in Mayo, Galway and Roscommon and a further 73 of whom use the service to access cancer treatment generally in the regional hospital in Galway.People in need of dialysis or cancer treatment are at their lowest ebb and should not need to worry about transport.  It may be difficult for those living in an urban or city environment to imagine that we need this service.  However, when one lives 100 miles or 150 miles from a hospital or treatment centre, when one does not have access to a car, a neighbour or family member to provide assistance, one needs such a service.  One should not need to worry about how to get treatment at such a stage of one's life.There are many operators on the west coast who give ceaselessly and selflessly to the service.  I imagine most of these do not make much profit given the service they provide.  Deputy Mulherin is in the House and I cannot let the occasion pass without acknowledging her late father who operated this service wonderfully for many years.  The fact that Deputy O'Mahony and I are sharing time shows that we are keen to do this on a cross-party non-partisan basis to try to get a resolution to a letter that issued on Friday to Mayo General Hospital and Roscommon County Hospital that the service for dialysis and cancer patients would cease as of 1 July.I understand at the HSE Regional Health Forum, West meeting today an indication was given that work is under way to try to resolve this.  I call on the Minister of State, who has an interest in this issue, to intervene to ensure that urgent clarity is given to the effect that the service will continue beyond 1 July.  The 456 people to whom I referred tonight wonder how they will get their dialysis or cancer treatment after 1 July.  We should not allow these people to worry beyond tomorrow.A review is under way into the quality of the service.  That review should continue but I call on the Minister of State to allow the service to continue until the review is complete.  Many options could be examined collectively in terms of co-operative transport, rural transport and schemes similar to the Irish Cancer Society scheme.At issue is a relatively small amount of money.  A sum of €500,000 could resolve the issue for this year.  Let us consider that in the jobs initiative there remains €200 million underspending from the money being raised through the pension levy.  One operator informed me yesterday that he will lay off five people if this decision goes ahead.  Lord knows how many people along the west coast will be laid off.  Surely, we could take a little of the underspending to save these jobs and, more importantly, give comfort to these people at a low ebb in their life.
#JohnOMahony	unknown-#JohnOMahony-party	unknown-#JohnOMahony-dob	unknown-#JohnOMahony-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	433	I thank Deputy Calleary for sharing time to discuss this immediate issue which, since it broke in recent few days, is a cause of great concern among the people who use and depend on the service.  Deputy Calleary provided the facts and figures but all of us have spoken to people affected by it.  Before I came into the Chamber I spoke to an elderly lady who is living with her elderly sister.  She does not have transport, she cannot drive and she is living in the south of the county.  She must get a lift to Claremorris to get a bus which does not arrive in Castlebar until one and a half hours after the treatment is due to begin.  When her treatment is finished at the end of the day there is no bus service to bring her back.The reality is that the required public transport is not in place but these vulnerable people should not be exposed in this situation.  I realise the Minister, Deputy Reilly, has seen many issues fall out of the sky during recent weeks, including accident and emergency issues, hospital doctors, the fair deal scheme and so on and he is dealing with these.  However, it is important that this matter is dealt with quickly and that the trauma of wondering whether transport will be available is removed.  Earlier this evening, I spoke to the Minister, Deputy Reilly.  I realise that in the coming days he will meet senior officials from the HSE, west.  I realise he wishes to see this matter solved but I stress to the Minister and all Deputies that it should be done as quickly as possible.The immediacy of the proposed change requires urgent action.  Patients who require this service are suffering enough trauma without having to wonder whether it will continue beyond 30 June.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	434	I am taking this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly.The national ambulance service provides pre-hospital emergency care, as well as emergency and some non-emergency patient transport.  Non-emergency transport comprises inter-hospital transfers and patient transport from home to health facility and from health facility to home.  It includes both Health Service Executive and private transport providers.The HSE has not taken any decisions to withdraw services.  However, the executive is operating within serious budgetary constraints and must take the necessary actions to live within budget.  The Minister has instructed the HSE generally not to withdraw any services from acute hospitals unless and until he receives a full briefing on the details of what is proposed, alternative arrangements to be put in place and the overall implications for patients.Supported by the Department of Health and the Health Information and Quality Authority, the national ambulance service is working to improve the management and integration of its services.  This involves a reduction to two ambulance control centres nationally, with appropriate technology; a clinical lead for pre-hospital care; development and implementation of new performance indicators for pre-hospital care; and development of standard national criteria for non-emergency patient transport.There are several systems of support in place for cancer patients who have to travel for treatment, through community welfare office services and the Travel2Care scheme.  The latter is being implemented on a phased basis in line with the transfer of cancer services to the eight designated cancer centres and the approved satellite centre in Letterkenny for patients for whom the transfer of services would otherwise cause financial hardship.  The scheme which is funded by the national cancer control programme and administered by the Irish Cancer Society provides some financial help towards the cost of public transport such as trains or buses, private transport costs, or petrol and parking costs.The national ambulance service has undergone significant change in order to ensure quality, safety and value for money.  In line with other clinical areas, this process is ongoing as clinical needs and standards develop.  These developments are in the best interests of patients and a key part of the Government's work to ensure high quality emergency care.  If we are to provide the best of care for patients with high-end medical needs — people who are already worried and stressed because of their condition — we must do all in our power to ensure we do not exacerbate that worry.  I completely agree with the Deputies in this regard and will bring the matter to the Minister's attention in the morning.I take the opportunity to thank Deputy Dara Calleary for his unceasing support and great advice on Adjournment matters.  I appreciate his assistance.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	435	I propose to take Questions Nos. 35 and 37 together.As the Deputy will be aware, the marine renewable energy is an emerging industry worldwide which has considerable potential for economic growth and job creation.  The acknowledged scale of Ireland's wave resource is such that the development and deployment of wave, tidal and offshore wind technologies is considered to have considerable potential for economic activity as well as contributing to our renewable energy targets in the longer term.To that end my Department and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) have been working for several years to support a number of R&D developments under the Ocean Energy Strategy.  These include funding support for ocean energy prototype devices and support for the development of the Maritime and Energy Research Campus and Commercial Cluster (MERC3) in Cork.MERC3 is an established joint venture by University College Cork (UCC), Cork Institute of Technology and the Irish Naval Service, with the objective of becoming a maritime research and commercial cluster of global standing.  The new Research Campus in Ringaskiddy, alongside the National Maritime College of Ireland, will feature UCC's new Beaufort Building, which will house one of the largest marine renewable energy research group in the world.The SEAI operates a dedicated Ocean Energy Development Unit which is represented on the board of the MERC development.  I look forward to meeting the key stakeholders in MERC at an early date for a detailed briefing on their plans.As part of a Strategic environmental Analysis of Irish waters for renewable energy development, my Department and SEAI are currently finalising an Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan (OREDP).  EirGrid is also modelling different scenarios for possible offshore grid infrastructure as part of the European North Seas offshore Initiative comprising 10 countries including Ireland.Ireland is already considered to have developed world-class ocean research and test facilities at the Galway Bay ¼ Scale Test Site, and the SmartBay Ireland project, which is led by the Marine Institute.  The National Wave Test Facility at the Hydraulic and Marine Resources Centre in UCC also has a high international reputation and is scheduled to become part of the Maritime and Energy Research Campus and Commercial Cluster. The development of a full scale grid connected wave energy test site at Belmullet, County Mayo will also require decisions shortly.In common with all other areas of Government expenditure, future investment support for ocean energy development is being kept under review on an ongoing basis having regard for overall budgetary constraints.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	436	In recent months wholesale oil and gas prices have been trending upwards.  There are concerns in the markets that oil prices will continue to rise in the months ahead. As oil prices rise, European wholesale gas prices, which lag oil prices by about six months, are expected by the markets to rise during the last quarter of the year.Prices are being driven by geopolitical events in the Middle East and North Africa coupled with high demand in the developing economies.  Other factors include the knock on impact on gas prices of the need to replace nuclear energy in Japan and Germany.  It is also of concern that the recent meeting of OPEC concluded without agreement to increase either production quotas or actual production.Ireland is a founder member of the International Energy Agency (IEA).  National energy policy directions are fully informed by the IEA's ongoing analysis and data.  The IEA's report on gas published earlier this month examines the key factors that could result in a more prominent role for natural gas in the global energy mix and the implications for other fuels, energy security and climate change.The IEA also concludes that natural gas can help improve energy security and when replacing other fossil fuels can lead to lower carbon emissions.Ireland has a high dependence on natural gas for power generation and the market is vulnerable to price volatility.The focus of Government policy is on delivery of strategies to ensure the provision of secure, sustainable and competitive energy supplies, framed against the continuing back drop of volatile fossil fuel prices.  Among key strategies to mitigate gas dependence are facilitating investments in major infrastructure, increasing the contribution of renewables and enhancing energy efficiency.  Bringing Corrib gas ashore is also a vital component.As regards mitigating measures, energy efficiency and consumer engagement remains the most cost-effective means of consumers reducing exposure to energy price rises.  The most immediate step that electricity and gas customers can, and should, take to keep downward pressure on prices is to engage actively with suppliers in the market.  In so doing, they may secure better value offers and/or lower prices from their existing or alternative suppliers.  Improving the efficiency of their energy usage will deliver demonstrable savings and make their energy costs more affordable in the longer term.  The Government has put in place a range of energy efficiency incentives to assist in this regard.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	437	I propose to take Questions Nos. 39 and 50 together.I have no statutory function in the setting of energy prices, whether in the regulated or non-regulated market.  Responsibility for the regulation of the electricity and gas markets is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), which is an independent statutory body.The electricity retail market is now fully deregulated and CER has announced that the small to medium business segment of the gas market will be de-regulated from 1 October next.  Business and domestic customers can increasingly avail of the competitive offerings from a number of electricity and gas supply companies.  The first step that business customers should take to reduce their energy costs is to work actively in securing better value offers in the market and in switching to suppliers delivering lower prices.I acknowledge the action taken over the last two years to bring Ireland's energy prices into line with, or below, European averages.  This is resulting in positive outcomes as is evidenced by improved competitiveness in the gas and electricity sectors when compared with other European countries.Eurostat data for the first half of 2010 showed such convergence to the EU average for many categories of business and residential consumer in both the electricity and gas sectors.  Analysis by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) shows that average residential gas prices for the majority of Irish gas consumers went from being 4% above the EU average at the end of 2009 to being 5% below the average in the first half of 2010.SEAI analysis of Eurostat data for the electricity sector show that in the 12 months to June 2010, Ireland experienced the largest fall in business electricity prices in the EU for medium to large consumers.  Prices fell by 20% to 36%, depending on consumption levels.Electricity prices for business in Ireland were below the EU average for medium to large customers for the first half of 2010.  For the group of businesses consuming the largest amount of electricity and for which we have data, Ireland was 27% below the Eurozone average.  For business customers consuming smaller amounts of electricity Ireland was ranked between 5th and 12th   in Europe out of 27 countries for the same period.Competition helps to put downward pressure on energy prices.  But the focus must be kept on all possible additional actions to mitigate costs where possible for business and for domestic customers.  This is essential for competitiveness, for employment and for economic recovery.This convergence to the EU average has been an important factor in supporting greater competitiveness for Irish enterprise and foreign direct investment.  Global gas and oil prices have risen sharply since the start of the year driven by events in North Africa and Japan and high demand from the emerging economies of China and India.Markets and analysts are forecasting that international oil and gas prices will rise further over the coming months.  The Energy Regulator, Bórd Gais Eireann, ESB and other energy suppliers consider that such increases will have an impact on domestic gas and electricity prices.  Ireland is a price taker in the global fossil fuel market and the economy is therefore vulnerable to energy price fluctuations and price rises.  Competitor countries are in many instances facing the same prospect and the objective in the context of higher global prices must be that we retain or improve our competitive position.Ireland's concerns about high oil and gas prices are shared at EU level and fellow Member Countries of the International Energy Agency (IEA).  The EU and IEA agree that high fossil fuels prices which pose a threat to economic recovery underline the need to reduce dependence on fossil fuels by radically enhanced energy efficiency measures and the development of renewable energy.I am committed to working with enterprise and with the energy sector to ensure that the costs of energy for business are as competitive as possible through those measures at our disposal including notably a sustained focus on energy efficiency.In the latter context I would urge all businesses of whatever size to place a relentless focus on energy efficiency.  SEAI is available to provide advice and, subject to available resources, financial assistance in this respect. In addition there is now extensive tax relief available to businesses under the accelerated capital allowances (ACA) scheme for energy efficient technologies.

The Report contains an assessment of costs, benefits and regulatory impact of the options for unbundling the electricity transmission assets set in the context of EU Third Package and the all island single electricity market.The process involved input from the direct stakeholders and other stakeholders.  The direct stakeholders were the management and the unions of ESB and EirGrid and the ESB Employee Share Ownership Trust.  The direct stakeholders were provided with a copy of the draft conclusions of the Frontier Report and the opportunity to comment on those conclusions.Both EirGrid and ESB have vital roles to play in delivering our national electricity infrastructure.  The unbundling of the transmission assets involves the resolution of complex technical, financial and operational issues as well as the possible development of legislation.  Both companies were given a copy of the final Report on a confidential basis and have submitted observations on it.I will be bringing proposals to Government shortly with a recommendation on the next steps with regard to the electricity transmission assets.  The Frontier Report contains significant and detailed commercially sensitive information.  I expect to be in a position to publish the Report, taking account of the commercially sensitive information, which it contains, after conclusion of Government consideration of the transmission assets issue.

Pending such completion, it is not possible to state a date for when gas from the Corrib gas field will become available.The Corrib Project requires a number of statutory permissions in order for the developer to construct, operate and maintain the development.In February of this year, the then Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources granted consent to the Corrib Partners pursuant to Section 40 of the Gas Act, 1976 and Section 13 of the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act, 1960 to construct, but not commission, the Corrib Gas Pipeline, subject to 47 conditions. No works have yet been undertaken by the Corrib Partners pursuant to these consents.The Deputy might also note that other licences and permissions beyond my statutory remit, including planning permission, Foreshore Licence and an Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control Licence are also required with respect to the construction and operation of the Corrib Gas Pipeline.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	440	Following scientific research conducted by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES), indicating that the European eel stocks are in a critical state, the EU introduced Council Regulation 1100/2007, the objective of which is to achieve recovery of the stocks to previous high levels.  The Regulation required Member States to prepare a national Eel Management Plan for implementation from 1 July 2009 or from the earliest possible time before that date.  Ireland's Eel Management Plan was approved by the Commission on 30 July 2009.The EU target is clearly defined in the Regulation where it states that the objective of each Member State's Eel Management Plan shall be to reduce mortalities so as to permit with high probability the escape to sea of at least 40% of silver eel relative to the best estimate of escape that would have existed if no mortality had impacted the stock.Ireland's level of escapement was estimated at only 24%. Given the critical status of the eel stock, as demonstrated in the assessment contained in the National Eel Management Plan a number of management measures were identified as necessary to reach the target set in the EC Regulation, including closure of the commercial and recreational eel fishery from 2009.  It is also necessary to mitigate the impact of hydropower on escapement, to ensure upstream migration of juvenile eel at barriers and to improve water quality.The decision to cease the eel fishery was taken, based on the best scientific advice available, as a conservation measure to support a recovery of the stock in the shortest time possible.  Under the Regulation, all aspects of the plan must be reviewed in 2012 and reported on to the Commission.  This review will consider, inter alia, whether the eel fishery and market could be reopened in any river basin district in light of the data gathered in the interim and the performance of the stocks.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	441	The provision of electronic communications services, including broadband, is, in the first instance, a matter for private sector service providers, regulated by the independent regulator, the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).The two key broadband issues for Government are (i) broadband availability and (ii) broadband quality.  While these matters are primarily for the private sector operators, Government may intervene if the private sector market fails to address the issues satisfactorily.Targeted interventions, such as the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) and the Rural Broadband Scheme are aimed at addressing rural areas where broadband services are not otherwise available due to reluctance on the part of commercial operators to invest because of inadequate financial returns.The NBS network provides a widely accessible broadband service in all of the 1028 Electoral Divisions that were identified as needing intervention.More recently, I announced a Rural Broadband Scheme, which aims to provide a basic broadband service to a relatively small number of remaining individual un-served rural premises.This approach, which has prioritised Government intervention to provide widespread customer access to a basic broadband service in the first instance, is consistent with EU targets published last year, which prioritises such widespread access by 2013.As regards broadband quality, significant improvements have been made in the delivery of broadband speeds in recent years.  For example, broadband speeds of up to 100 megabits per second are already available to 500,000 or so premises using coaxial cable.  This will increase to over 700,000 premises by the end of next year.  Telephone lines now provide digital subscriber line quality (DSL) offering speeds of up to 24 mbps, depending on distance from exchanges.  In addition to these improvements in fixed line services, developments in wireless technologies are also delivering higher speeds.  WiMax products, which are increasingly available, offer speeds of up to 10 mbps, while mobile broadband speeds are also being increased.Under the NewERA proposals in the Programme for Government to deliver higher broadband speeds, there is a commitment to co-invest with the private sector and commercial Semi State sector to provide Next Generation Broadband to every home and business in the State.  Consideration of how best to progress these proposals is being advanced by my Department.Specifically the Next Generation Broadband Taskforce (NGBT), which I chair, is now considering how best to roll out Next Generation Broadband network access.  The NGBT, which includes representatives of large network owners and smaller telecommunications services providers, held its first meeting on 13 June 2011.  I expect that the NGBT, which will conclude its deliberations by the end of the year, will be helpful in terms of identifying the optimal policy position to deliver wider customer access to high-speed broadband.

The involvement of local community participants in renewable energy projects has been advocated as a means to progress the uptake of renewable energy and promote local community acceptance of large scale renewable energy projects. The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) has carried out work to assess the scope for community involvement.A study funded by SEAI and by the Western Development Commission investigated the potential for communities to benefit from the establishment of wind farms in their region.This report concluded that communities are likely to encounter significant resource difficulties if they attempt to develop 100% community owned wind energy projects, given the considerable technical and financial challenges facing developers.  The levels of risk and uncertainty appear to be too high for a community group to enter a development on their own.A key finding of the Report however was that the most promising investment option for community based groups would be to participate in commercial projects once such projects have secured the requisite consents and contracts for scale of electricity.The SEAI is working closely with the International Energy Agency to develop best practice guidelines for social acceptance of wind farms including in that context guidelines for facilitating investment by communities in local wind farms.

In this context, Deputies should be aware that Capital Expenditure of up to €70 million will be incurred by RTÉ. It is important that the costs of DTT rollout do not place an undue burden on the company.

This compares with 4.4% in 2003.The Gate 3 programme which is overseen by the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) was designed specifically to support delivery of Ireland's national renewable target of 40% of electricity supplied from renewable sources by 2020.  EirGrid is responsible for the issuing of connection offers to developers under Gate 3.  The programme represents the largest connection offer ever undertaken on the island of Ireland.In order to ensure that Gate 3 offers are rolled out to projects in the most efficient and cost effective manner, the CER required the System Operators (EirGrid for the transmission system and ESB Networks for the distribution system) to develop a detailed project plan for the issuance of connection offers.A project plan is in place which involves the roll-out of connection offers over an 18-month period running up to the end of this year.  Gate 3 offers have been issuing according to schedule.  From April 2011, 2,519 MW of offers in Gate 3 were issued by EirGrid and ESB Networks.There is acknowledged scope for streamlining, and making more cohesive, all the permitting processes inherent in developing renewable energy projects.  This was noted in Ireland's National Renewable Energy Action Plan submitted to the EU Commission last year.  These include planning permissions, environmental authorisations as well as grid connections.  The EU Commission itself has recognised that streamlining of permitting processes is required generally across Europe if renewable energy targets are to be met.Having regard also to EU developments, my Department is working with the Commission for Energy Regulation, EirGrid and the renewable energy sector, as well as all other key stakeholders, to progress the scope for a more streamlined approach for both onshore and offshore renewable energy development in future.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	445	The provision of broadband services is, in the first instance, a matter for private sector service providers operating in Ireland's fully liberalised telecommunications market, regulated by the independent regulator, the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).  Investment in broadband infrastructure and associated upgrades in marketed services is primarily a matter for the private sector, facilitated, where appropriate and possible by Government.Under the NewERA proposals in the Programme for Government, which is the responsibility of my colleague Minister of State O'Dowd, there is a commitment to co-invest with the private sector and commercial Semi State sector to provide Next Generation Broadband to every home and business in the State.  Consideration of how best to advance these proposals is being advanced by my Department with other stakeholders across Government and with industry who are continuing to invest considerably in this area.On 13th June, I convened a meeting of the Next Generation Broadband Taskforce (NGBT), which I chair.  The Task Force comprises the CEOs of all of the major telecommunications companies currently operating in the Irish market and CEOs of some Internet Service Provider companies.  Its purpose is to discuss how best to deliver the optimal policy environment and to identify a roadmap for the speedy delivery of high speed broadband across Ireland.  The Taskforce will consider issues such as appropriate targets, investment plans, and the role of Government policy and actions in driving and facilitating investment.I expect that the NGBT, which will conclude its deliberations by December this year, will be helpful in terms of identifying the optimal policy position to deliver wider customer access to high-speed broadband.It is a fact that some broadband services are constrained by contention.  I expect that the output from the NGBT, as well as newer technologies that are emerging, will address contention and other bandwidth quality issues.  Additionally, the Programme for Government commits to ensuring that broadband providers publish average speeds for each package and ComReg is actively engaging with industry to develop a mechanism that allows for more transparent reporting of actual speeds experienced by those using the broadband services.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	446	The 2009 Wild Salmon and Sea Trout Fisheries Statistics Report outlined that salmon catches were less than a tenth of what they were in 2001.  The close season for fishing for salmon and sea trout is based on scientific and management advices aimed at conserving and protecting wild stocks.  The present position, underpinned by legislation, is that nationally all salmon angling finishes on September 30th.  With the exception of six rivers, angling for sea trout in the Kerry District finishes on the 12th October.  In the six rivers the season closes on September 30th.Section 137 of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act 1959 Act states ‘‘that the annual close season for angling for salmon shall for the purposes of the Act , be the period commencing on the 13th October in each year'', this protects stocks during the spawning season.  A decision to extend any fishing for salmon until the end of October would require changes to the Primary Legislation.Extensions for the fishing of salmon and/or sea trout until the 12th October would have to be considered on a river by river basis.  Recently I requested Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI), to review the temporal management of the wild salmon and sea trout fishery and to report to me with recommendations for permissible adjustments to apply in the 2012 season that will enable the most economically advantageous exploitation of the total allowable catch by the commercial and recreational fisheries while ensuring that stocks are not put at risk.

This is the largest number of applications ever received in a single licensing round in Ireland.My Department has commenced its assessment of the applications received and has invited all fifteen applicants for interview.It is anticipated that the evaluation process will conclude by the end of July, following which offers of Licensing Options will be made.The number of applications received under the licensing round is encouraging.  I understand that the applications received include applications from companies not currently active in the Irish offshore and this is a further positive feature of the outcome of the round.In relation to the specific terms of the licensing round, the authorisations on offer are two year Licensing Options and will be subject to agreed work programmes.  The work programmes will include procurement of all available and relevant technical data, along with new data acquisition projects as considered necessary.I am confident that the 2011 Licensing Round will help bring much needed new momentum to the level of exploration activity offshore Ireland.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	449	The EU Renewable Energy Directive of 2009 sets a binding 2020 target of 10% renewable energy in Transport for each Member State.  In common with other Member States, Ireland is committed to ensuring that approximately 10% of road transport fuel in Ireland is biofuel by 2020.To date the majority of biofuels brought to market have been first generation.  These biofuels are produced from numerous sources, the most common of which are sugar cane, maize and wheat.  There are growing and profound uncertainties over the extent to which first generation biofuel on a very large scale can be brought to market globally without causing severe effects in the food commodities markets.  There are also concerns about the sustainability of such production.Second generation biofuels come from wastes, residues or non-food material.  These generally have little impact on land use or sustainability.  International research shows that algae have the potential to produce around 60 times more biodiesel per hectare that oil seed rape. They generally offer higher Greenhouse Gas savings and have no effect on food prices.  At present, these technologies are at a pre commercial stage, but are believed to show promise.To encourage the development and use of second generation biofuels, Ireland's Biofuel Obligation Scheme, in line with the EU Renewable Energy Directive, awards double certificates for each litre of second generation biofuel placed on the market.The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) has reviewed the potential of Marine Algae as a Source of Biofuel in Ireland.  This work is serving as a good basis to inform further research and development work on the potential use of marine algae for biofuel production.In a joint Inter-reg funded project with Scotland and Northern Ireland Irish researchers are working to demonstrate the feasibility and viability of producing biofuels from marine biomass, including seaweeds.  The project was launched in 2009.  Initial indicators are positive, but the outcome is as yet unclear in terms of the scope for actual production in Ireland.  My Department will continue to monitor national and international developments in all second generation biofuels.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	450	Ireland competes with other countries, both in Europe and much further afield, to attract mobile international exploration investment to Ireland.  To that end, it is important that Ireland maintains a licensing regime that appropriately reflects both the risks and rewards of investing in petroleum exploration in the Irish offshore, relative to investing in exploration in other jurisdictions.A comprehensive review of Ireland fiscal terms was carried out in 2007.  This review, which was underpinned by independent economic analysis, considered the appropriateness of Ireland's licensing terms in comparison to other European countries that Ireland competes with for exploration investment.  The outcome of that review was the introduction of a profit resource rent tax of between 5% and 15% that will apply in the case of more profitable fields.While I will keep the licensing terms, both fiscal and non-fiscal, under review in light of relevant future developments, at this point in time I believe that the focus should be on attracting a larger share of mobile international exploration investment to Ireland, to increase the chances of new commercial discoveries being made.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	451	I announced the launch of  Better Energy: The National Upgrade Programme in early May in the context of the Government’s Jobs Initiative.  Better Energy   is replacing the three existing energy efficiency and renewable energy programmes: the Home Energy Savings Scheme, the Warmer Homes Scheme and the Greener Homes Scheme.The Better Energy   grant levels have been set to ensure that the level of Exchequer support is in line with market prices.  The grant levels represent approximately 30% of the cost of each efficiency measure supported under the Programme.  Since the Home Energy Saving scheme was launched in 2009, there have been considerable reductions in the market prices being charged for most of the efficiency measures covered by the scheme.  The exception at this stage is external insulation which is a relatively new technology in the Irish Market.  It is self evident that the level of Exchequer support should reflect actual market prices.Measures being supported under the Better Energy programme are those designed to deliver the greatest energy savings, thus maximising the value achieved from the Exchequer allocation.  The additional €30 million provided to the Programme for 2011 under the Jobs Initiative will be matched by a further €30 million in private sector investment.  It will therefore help to generate further economic activity of at least €60 million this year.One of the key objectives of the Better Energy programme is to support the construction sector and the delivery by the sector of quality installations in line with best practice.  The level of take-up and activity under the domestic retrofitting schemes to date is demonstrably supporting jobs, given the labour intensive nature of energy efficiency upgrades.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) advises that over 5,800 full time jobs are projected to be supported in 2011.  This represents an increase of some 2000 jobs this year over the 3,800 jobs already being supported under the Schemes.SEAI also advises that the number of applicants has remained steady since the launch of the Better Energy Programme last month.  This underlines the continued strong interest of householders in the home energy savings scheme.My Department is also working to transform the way in which upgrades are funded with the aim of making participation even more affordable for householders.  The first step will be by offering the grants as upfront discounts, followed by a move to a pay-as-you-save model.Pay-as-you-save is a financial model which would allow energy consumers to finance energy efficiency upgrades through the energy savings generated.  The Programme for Government commits to the roll out of a pay-as-you-save scheme after 2013.  This will enable the home energy efficiency programme to continue without recourse to public funding.  It is also in line with developments at EU level.There are considerable complexities involved in the development of an effective pay-as-you-save model.  My Department is working with the utilities, the energy sector, as a whole, and financial institutions to develop an appropriate model.  I expect to bring proposals to Government to underpin the scheme towards the end of the year.

Approximately 90% of these offers are wind powered capacity including around 800 MW of offshore wind.  The Gate 3 decisions, combined with the existing renewable capacity and projects currently being built and connected, point to the 40% target being met and even exceeded by 2020.Ireland's National Renewable Energy Action Plan, which was submitted to the EU Commission in June 2010, sets out the detailed projections and strategies to achieve the national target.  The plan was developed in consultation with the renewable sector and all stakeholders.EirGrid published its GRID25 strategy, which outlines how they intend to deliver an upgraded electricity infrastructure network to 2025.  It shows how EirGrid intends to increase network capacity between now and 2025 by reinforcing existing lines, deploying new grid management technology and building new transmission lines.The projects in Gate 3 were selected by the CER on a "first come first served" criterion.  Grid connection offers for projects within the Gate 3 process began to issue in December last year.  They will continue to be issued on a phased basis until mid 2011.  The Gate 3 process was extensively consulted on by the CER.  Through public consultation and dedicated industry workshops, all industry stakeholders were given the opportunity of responding in advance to the proposed connection process.

The purpose was to ensure that our Mission network is fully briefed on the Government's new approach to promoting and marketing Ireland as a country to do business in, and strengthen their capacity to continue their ongoing work in support of the effort to repair Ireland's international reputation.  The programme included a session with the State economic promotional agencies on how best to address the challenges we face and dialogue with senior representatives of the business sector on the support provided by Missions to our companies abroad and how this might be further strengthened.  Every effort was made to minimise the costs associated with the conference.  Specific travel and subsistence arrangements were put in place for the event.  These mandated economy-class travel for all participants, including those travelling long-distance and requested Heads of Mission to make private arrangements for accommodation.  Where this was not possible vouched expenses to a maximum of €75 per night were payable.As of 17 June, claims for travel and subsistence have been received from 17 Heads of Mission totalling €3,567.  It is expected that further claims will be received in the coming weeks.In addition 45 airfares, all of which were for economy-class travel, have been paid totalling €31,433.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	456	Ireland does not possess, and has never possessed, any weapons, armaments or ammunition containing depleted uranium.  It is the firm policy of the Government that depleted uranium munitions will never be used by the Defence Forces.  To date, the research carried out by recognised relevant international organisations, including by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), has concluded that depleted uranium does not pose a significant radiological risk.  These reports are readily available. Other research has consistently returned inconclusive results.Ireland has voted in favour of resolutions on depleted uranium at the United Nations since 2007.  These resolutions requested the UN Secretary-General to seek the views of member states and relevant international organisations on the effects of the use of armaments and ammunitions containing depleted uranium.In consultation with the Department of Defence, Ireland provided a national report to the UN Secretary-General in 2009.  This confirmed that while there is no practical method of testing people that may have been exposed to depleted uranium, thorough medical examinations are carried out on all Defence Forces personnel returning from deployment overseas.  These include tests intended to detect signs of those disease processes most likely to arise in cases of contamination with depleted uranium.  To date, no evidence of an unusual incidence of disease has been found.There is at present no international framework or treaty concerning depleted uranium munitions (and therefore no internationally agreed definition or prohibition).  To achieve political traction worldwide, and the momentum required for an international ban, a necessary first step would be to conclusively establish the negative impact of depleted uranium on human health and on the environment.The Government is supportive of further study and research by relevant international organisations and the scientific community and does not believe that it would be appropriate to introduce legislation on depleted uranium weapons at this time.  A number of like-minded partners, including Austria, Canada, Finland, Germany, Italy, Japan and Spain, have adopted a similar approach.

He did so however in a private capacity as he is not yet formally accredited to Bahrain, pending the finalisation of bilateral accreditation procedures.As he is not yet able to make formal representations directly to the authorities in Bahrain, Ambassador Holohan met yesterday with the Bahraini Ambassador in Riyadh to inform him of my own deep concerns, already expressed in this House on a number of occasions, and those of the Irish Government and people in relation to recent events.  The Ambassador also used the occasion to urge the Bahraini Ambassador to convey immediately to his authorities that all those who are charged with nothing more than peaceful protest should be released without further delay.The Government's clear stance on current developments in Bahrain will continue to be conveyed in the fullest terms to the Bahraini authorities on all appropriate occasions, through our Embassy in Riyadh and all other appropriate channels.In relation to the RCSI, whose graduates receive degrees awarded by the NUI, I have already made clear previously that the Royal College of Surgeons' provision of educational services in Bahrain and elsewhere is primarily an operational issue for the RCSI.The RCSI is a private third-level institution which has its own relationships in Bahrain and which decides for itself the extent to which it wishes to comment on developments there.  However, it also has to be acknowledged that the RCSI has been involved on a commercial basis in Bahrain for some years now and that the medical campus and facilities which it operates represent a very substantial investment which is of direct economic relevance to this country.I would further like to say that I regard the activities of the RCSI in assisting with the training of foreign medical personnel overseas as a highly worthwhile activity through which the College makes a significant contribution to the quality of life of millions of people around the world.

I take every opportunity to advance Ireland's economic interests, particularly given the importance of export-led growth to our economic recovery. I have done so at meetings with my counterparts from the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Norway, Australia and New Zealand in recent weeks and I will be doing so this week in Vienna.    Trade missions constitute a valuable support to Irish business, in terms of establishing credibility with and gaining access to target markets.  The Taoiseach will lead a trade mission to China later this year and I hope to visit Russia, Japan and Korea in the autumn myself. During the visit to Russia a meeting of the Ireland-Russia Joint Economic Commission is planned. My colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Richard Bruton TD, led a trade mission to India and Saudi Arabia in April.The Export Trade Council, which will be established shortly, and which I will chair, will consider the overall programme of trade missions and seek to integrate trade, tourism and investment promotion activities. My Department, Enterprise Ireland and the Department for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, in particular, will work closely together in the planning for these trade missions.As the Deputy will be aware, the promotion of inward investment in the manufacturing and internationally-traded services industries is a function of IDA Ireland under the aegis of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. IDA is implementing its strategy Horizon 2020 which has ambitious targets for the period 2010 to 2014My Department and our Embassy Network will continue to work closely with the IDA in its role of securing inward investment for Ireland, including in the emerging BRIC markets which have been identified as an important element of the Horizon 2020 strategy.

The table beneath sets out the visa allocations for 2011 and the available information on the number of visas approved in 2010 In the case of Australia the programme runs from 1st July to 30th   June and the figures provided reflect the period 2009/2010. The Working Holiday agreement concluded between Ireland and the United States allows those enrolled in or recently graduated from post-secondary education to apply for a visa to work and live in the United States for a period of one year.Allocations under the Working Holiday agreements for each of the countries concerned are reviewed on a regular basis. Allocations have, however, remained unchanged over recent years with the exception of Canada, which increased an initial allocation of 2,500 to 4,000 in 2010 with a further 227 places reallocated to Ireland from other unused programmes, giving an overall figure of 4,227.Working Holiday AgreementNo. of Visa Approvals in 2010Allocation in 2011Argentina21100Australia14,833Not cappedCanada4,2274,000Japan50400Hong Kong21100New Zealand2,363Not cappedSouth Korea3400U.S.A321Not capped

This Decision shall enter into force on 1 January 2013 provided that all Member States have notified the completion of the procedures for the approval of the Decision in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements.       Having considered the matter carefully, including the legal advice of the Attorney General, the Government is satisfied that the amendment to the Treaty is compatible with the Constitution.  As no amendment of the Constitution arises, a referendum will not be required in order for Ireland to approve the amendment to Article 136 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.

This has taken the form of copies of statements or arguments on the issues, political or technical, and transmitted via their Missions here in Dublin or our own Missions in Tel Aviv and Ramallah.  I would characterise such contacts however as entirely normal and not out of the ordinary. As I have stated in answer to previous Questions, i  f the issue of recognition arises at the United Nations in the autumn, the Government will consider Ireland's response very carefully. We will take into account factors such as Ireland's long-standing support for the achievement of a Palestinian State, the exact terms and nature of what may be proposed, the positions of EU partners and other friends, the progress on the wider peace process, and our assessment of the practical impact of any such decision.It is certainly my view that there should be a State of Palestine, and very soon.

The content of the documentary referred to by the Deputy underlines, once again, the importance of addressing the crimes of the past as part of a process of national dialogue and reconciliation in Sri Lanka.  At European Union level, a statement by High Representative Ashton on the 10 May also called for an inquiry into the allegations of misconduct by both sides to the conflict.  As we know from past experience, such an investigation could make an important contribution to building lasting peace and stability in Sri Lanka. Officials from my Department have conveyed this point to the Sri Lankan authorities and as recently as last week re-iterated this at the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva.The promotion of human rights is a key element of the Government's foreign policy towards Sri Lanka.  Ireland played an active part in the European Union decision to suspend duty free access which was granted to Sri Lankan exports under the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP plus) after the Sri Lankan Government failed to deliver written undertakings on human rights conventions dealing with torture, children's rights and political rights.The international community can play an important role in facilitating dialogue and reconciliation in Sri Lanka.  I would again urge the government in Colombo to co-operate fully with the UN and address the recommendations made by the Panel of Experts.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	465	I have made clear in answer to previous questions my deep concern at recent reports of the use of force against Camp Ashraf residents in Iraq and the resulting loss of life.    I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate that Ireland and the EU are determined to seek a long-term and peaceful solution to the predicament of the residents of Camp Ashraf. The EU Foreign Affairs Council discussed the situation at Camp Ashraf on 23 May, emphasising the need to respect human rights. I fully support the view widely held within the Council that we must work with the UN (including the UN High Commissioner for Refugees) and US in particular, to seek a lasting resolution to this situation. However, I note that there is also no agreement as yet with the US or the UN on the future of the camp, nor any agreement as yet on the idea of the UN assuming responsibility for its protection. HR Ashton made clear at the FAC last month that more consideration was needed on what is a complex issue and a further discussion may take place at a forthcoming Foreign Affairs Council, which we would obviously welcome.HR Ashton has clearly set out the EU position, including a strong condemnation of the recent violence in Camp Ashraf, and has conveyed this position in writing and by telephone to Iraqi Foreign Minister Zebari. I particularly endorse HR Ashton's renewal of the EU's repeated call on the Iraqi government to refrain from the use of violence and to show full respect for the human rights of Camp Ashraf's residents. I also strongly support her call for a thorough and independent inquiry into the events of 8 April.Along with our EU partners, Ireland will continue to support clear messages to the Iraqi authorities that while there are no easy remedies to the situation in Camp Ashraf, force is not the answer. Iran's sovereignty should be respected over the entire territory of Iraq, including in Camp Ashraf, but the human rights of residents of Camp Ashraf must be respected also. The Iraqi government must accept full responsibility for ensuring the protection of all those persons resident on its territory.In actively seeking a solution, Ireland and its EU partners will continue to work with international institutions and partners, while calling upon the Iraqi government to grant access to independent international observers, to show restraint, and to seek a peaceful and sustainable solution.

This cancellation notice is circulated to worldwide border control agencies through Interpol on a daily basis.   The Passport Service treats the loss of a passport as a serious issue.  Passport Service policy has been developed in accordance with EU regulations and our international obligations to other States in relation to lost and stolen passports.   In relation to this specific case, the passport holder lost his two most recent passports.  Where a citizen has a poor passport record, such as in any case where two or more passports have been lost, restrictions will apply to the validity period of the next passport obtained.   In this specific case, a restricted passport with two years' validity was issued in February 2010.  Should the Passport holder now require a passport with at least twelve months validity, he is entitled to apply for a new passport at any time and to return his current passport for cancellation.  A decision on whether to restrict the validity of any subsequent passport will be made at the time of his application.  In any event, the minimum validity period of any new passport would be two years which would enable the person to apply for a Canadian visa.  The general advice to citizens remains that passports are valuable documents and should be kept it in a safe place while at home and looked after carefully when travelling.

The Passport Service regrets the delay and any difficulties caused in this regard.  Notice of the current extended turnaround time and its likely duration has been published on the Passport Service website www.passport.ie since 18 April 2011.  It is regularly updated.  The Passport Service has also informed An Post so that customers can be advised of the situation at the point of applicationThe exceptional peak season demand on all passport services is being tackled by the recruitment of 85 additional temporary staff and the use of overtime.  The ongoing efforts in this regard will see the Passport Service bring processing times back to normal levels in the coming weeks.In terms of the application in question, a parent of the applicant was in direct contact with the Passport Service's Customer Care Unit to arrange the collection of the applicant's passport, which was issued on 16 June.

The Deputy can rest assured that Ireland will support the Government of Colombia in its implementation of this important and far-reaching legislation, including within the framework of the next EU Country Strategy for Colombia.   The 2007-2013 EU Country Strategy paper for Colombia recognises that the "situation as regards human rights and democracy in Colombia is still critical" and that "the most vulnerable groups include indigenous peoples and Afro-Colombians, as well as, inter alia, social leaders, trade-union leaders, journalists and human rights defenders".The approach of Ireland, and indeed of the European Union, in the drafting of the next Country Strategy for Colombia, will continue to be one of support for the implementation by the Colombian Government of concrete steps that address the consequences of decades of terrorism. The Victims Law is one such step.

If at any time in a registration period (i.e. a calendar year to 31 December) an Oireachtas member including an office holder has a holding of shares, bonds, debentures or other like investments  , with an aggregate nominal or market value in excess of €13,000, in respect of any one company or enterprise or undertaking, the Oireachtas member including an office holder is required to disclose the holding in his or her annual statement of registerable interests to the Standards Commission.A holding does not include money in a current, deposit or other similar account, but does include a holding in unit trusts, managed funds or equity based accounts.  An approved retirement fund would be a like investment and would require disclosure where in excess of the €13,000 threshold.An office holder would also be required to disclose the holding regardless of value to the Taoiseach and the Standards Commission if it were to represent a material interest in an official function which fell to be performed by him or her. The Taoiseach would disclose an interest in those circumstances to the Chairman of the Standards Commission.

The purpose of the ESM will be to arrange funding and provide financial assistance, under strict economic policy conditionality, to the benefit of such ESM Members as may be either experiencing, or threatened by, severe financing problems, if seen as indispensable to safeguarding the financial stability of the euro area as a whole.  The establishment of the ESM does not of itself change the role of the EU in relation to national economic and budgetary policies. Access to ESM financial assistance will be provided on the basis of strict fiscal and economic policy conditionality for the duration of the support programme.  This will be accompanied by a rigorous analysis of public-debt sustainability, which will be conducted by the EU Commission together with the IMF and in liaison with the ECB. The objective of such support programmes is to return the country involved to the financial markets as soon as possible. Strict budgetary and economic policy conditionality is already a condition of the funding provided to any Member State under the EFSM, EFSF and indeed funding from the International Monetary Fund.Under the proposed ESM Treaty, the capital structure of the ESM will have a total subscribed capital of €700 billion. Of this amount, €80 billion will be in the form of paid-in capital by the Euro Area Member States, paid in five equal annual instalments from July 2013. The balance of €620bn will be callable capital. The contribution key for each Member State is based on the ECB capital contribution key. For Ireland the key is 1.592% of the total paid and committed capital. Thus, Ireland's share of €80 billion will be just above €1.27 billion, to be paid in five equal instalments starting in July 2013. Ireland's share of the €620bn callable capital will amount to €9.87 billion.On 25 March 2011, the European Council adopted Decision 2011/199/EU amending Article 136 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union with regard to a stability mechanism for Member States whose currency is the euro adding the following paragraph to Article 136: "The Member States whose currency is the euro may establish a stability mechanism to be activated if indispensable to safeguard the stability of the euro area as a whole. The granting of any required financial assistance under the mechanism will be made subject to strict conditionality".Primary legislation will be required to enable Ireland to ratify the ESM Treaty and implement its decisions.  Based on the existing text, the Attorney General's Office has confirmed a referendum will not be required for the adoption of the ESM Treaty.

Section 161 of the Finance Act 2010 provides for a voluntary scheme that enables members of the Judiciary to make a gift to the State of an equivalent amount to the pension related deduction imposed on State employees under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009.  Subsection (8) of that Section provides that, inter alia, the Revenue Commissioners shall publish for each year of assessment details of the number of donors who avail of this scheme in the year. I understand that the Revenue Commissioners published information in their Annual Report for 2010, in accordance with Subsection (8), which shows that 126 Judges participated in the Scheme in 2010.

The disability criteria for these concessions are set out in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994. To get a Primary Medical Certificate, an applicant must be permanently and severely disabled within the terms of these Regulations.   Some 13,500 people have benefited under the scheme in 2010 at an overall estimated cost of €55 million.  I have no plans to widen the exemption qualification criteria.

The Government will examine a number of proposals in relation to this commitment.   One of these proposals relates to increasing mortgage interest relief to 30% for First Time Buyers who bought between 2004 and 2008 and to finance this in part by abolishing mortgage interest relief for new buyers.  When this proposal has been thoroughly examined, I will decide on the appropriate action to be taken.  However, any measures will not be introduced before Budget 2012.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	475	Section 248 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provided unrestricted relief for individuals in respect of interest on monies borrowed to purchase directly or indirectly (such as through a holding company) an interest in, or make a loan to, a trading company.    This relief was abolished in Budget 2011. In recognition of the impact that immediate withdrawal of the relief would have, it was decided to gradually phase out the relief by reducing the amount of relief available on current loans to 75% of the interest payable in 2011, 50% in 2012, 25% in 2013 and 0% in 2014. Furthermore, any loans taken out after 7 December 2010 will not qualify for relief at all.  I would be happy to respond directly to the Deputy if there are any specific cases about the impact of these changes he wishes to bring to my attention.

The report provides a detailed factual overview and expert assessment of the risk profile of the credit union sector as a whole, including specific proposals to strengthen the prudential soundness of credit unions.  Due to the commercially sensitive and prudential nature of the information contained throughout the report, it is not suitable for release at this time.  The findings of the report will now feed into the work of the Commission on Credit Unions which was established by Government on 31 May 2011 and met for the first time on 20 June 2011.  The Commission will review the future of the credit union movement and make recommendations in relation to the most effective regulatory structure for the sector.  In carrying out its work, the Commission will take into account credit unions' not-for-profit mandate, their volunteer ethos and community focus, while paying due regard to the need to fully protect depositors' savings and financial stability.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	477	As part of the Jobs Initiative announced in this House on 10th May, both the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and I confirmed the Government commitment to initiating a tendering process for the development of a temporary partial credit guarantee scheme. A call for competition for the design of a scheme was published on e-tenders on 15th June on behalf of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.   The design of the scheme will draw from international experience to support new lending that would not otherwise have been extended by the banks.  In this way, the scheme will be limited in its scope and will complement, rather than be a substitute for, existing lending activities by the main financial institutions.  It will be designed to encourage banks to lend to these new or expanding commercially viable SMEs so that they can grow their company, develop new products or expand into new markets.The Government's commitment will be for an initial period of one year.  Specific performance criteria will be set down that allow for review and revision of the scheme at the end of that initial period before committing to a roll-over of the scheme for subsequent years.It is intended that the scheme will be in place in the autumn.  Ensuring that a strategic investment bank is operating in the domestic banking market, providing finance to large capital projects and acting as a conduit for venture capital as well as a lender to SMEs, is an objective in the Programme for Government.  As the Deputy will be aware a comprehensive programme of bank recapitalisation and restructuring is currently underway following my statement on the future banking landscape in Ireland at the end of March last.  The essential detailed assessment and planning work to meet this objective will be accelerated once the Government's key immediate objectives for the repair of the banking system have been completed.In the interim, it is important to make the point that important steps have already been taken to ensure that there is sufficient credit availability to meet the needs of the SME sector. These include the capacity being available under the pillar banks' deleveraging and restructuring plans to provide new lending which is estimated to be more than sufficient to meet the needs of the economy including the SME sector.

In the case of a vehicle being registered by a car dealer, the PPS number or the VAT number of the dealer is required.   In cases where new vehicles registered by Authorised Traders via the Revenue on-line System, a PPS number is not requested as the Revenue Commissioners do not ask members of the public to give their PPS numbers to a garage. However in all instances where relief is sought from Vehicle Registration Tax the PPS number is required.  It should be noted that there is no Vehicle Registration Tax form as the registration process is an electronic process.

These bonds are available to be used by these institutions to obtain liquidity from the normal monetary operations of the Eurosystem.  This funding plays an important role in supporting the domestic banking system and in facilitating their lending into the economy.  The Deputy will be aware that the banking system restructuring plan creates capacity for the two Pillar Banks, Bank of Ireland and AIB, to provide lending in excess of €30 billion in the next three years.  SME and new mortgage lending for these banks is expected to be in the range of €16-20bn over this period. In each bank, a team of senior managers will be dedicated to the task of ensuring lending continues to grow to support economic growth.  This lending capacity is incorporated into the banks' deleveraging plans which allow for repayment of Central Bank funding through asset run-off and disposals over the period to 2013.Both pillar banks provide my Department with monthly figures on balance sheet volumes, sanctioned facilities and geographic and industrial breakdowns of their SME lending. The Deputy may also be aware that under the terms of the government recapitalisation, both banks also produce a quarterly report which incorporates figures for sanctions and drawdowns by SMEs. The data contained in these reports will continue to be reviewed and analysed by my Department and the Credit Review Office to ensure that the banks are compliant with the terms of the Government recapitalisation as it relates to the provision of credit for SMEs.As I have said before the Credit Review Office will, on application from the borrower, carry out an independent and impartial review of a bank's decision to refuse or reduce credit. This is another means of ensuring that the money is lent to the productive sector. I would strongly advise anyone who has unsuccessfully appealed through the bank's own internal appeals process to seek a review by the Credit Review Office.

Section 221(3) and (4) provides for circumstances where communication with NAMA is not an offence.  These circumstances are: where the communication is published; is made without an intention to benefit, or confer an advantage on, any specific person; is made in the public interest; or where the person who makes the communication concerned is acting in his or her professional capacity or in the course of his or her employment and does so in that capacity.  These provisions allow citizens who believe that their business or personal finances are affected by NAMA to make enquiries about these issues by direct contact with NAMA as long as the contact is consistent with the requirements of subsections 3 and 4.I am in discussion with NAMA about making improvements in the availability of information within the confines of the legislation.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	489	I would refer the Deputy to Chapter Five of the Report of the Comptroller & Auditor General 2009 (Volume 1) which was published in September 2010.  This chapter, entitled "Financial Commitments under Public Private Partnerships," provides information about the financial commitments entered into by central Government departments and agencies under PPP contracts. Figures for 2010 will appear in the Comptroller and Auditor General's Report for 2010 which will be published later this year.   The Deputy will be aware that my Department has put in place the overall PPP investment framework, including the framework for the appraisal, assessment, procurement and evaluation of projects.  Individual Departments are responsible for the projects and programmes in their areas, within that overall framework. Further details about individual projects can be obtained directly from the relevant Department.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	490	The question of providing cover to new policyholders or renewing it for existing ones is a matter for each insurance company to decide on a case by case basis. This allows a company to assess properly the risk it is considering accepting.  Consequently, I am not in a position to comment on particular cases as neither the Central Bank nor I, as Minister for Finance, have any influence over such matters.  However, it should be noted that the industry has informed my Department that it is reluctant to discontinue flood cover for existing policyholders, and would generally only do where there have been repeated claims. The best option open to a person who is unable to get cover or to renew it is to contact the Irish Insurance Federation which operates a free Information Service in order to discuss the matter.  Their service can be contacted at (01) 6761914 or by email at iis@iif.ie.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	491	The section in the Finance Act 2010 that provides for the application of the carbon tax to solid fuels (coal and commercial peat) is subject to a Ministerial Commencement Order. This approach was primarily adopted by the previous Government in order to allow time for a robust mechanism to be put in place to improve the control of high sulphur coal being sourced from Northern Ireland suppliers.     As the Deputy may be aware, in that context the Department of the Environment in conjunction with the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) proposed new regulations for coal which would effectively extend the existing voluntary agreement for low sulphur coal to the entire State on a regulatory basis.  A stakeholder committee was established to provide an input into the proposed regulations. Under EU law dealing with technical barriers to trade, Member States are required to notify the European Commission of all draft technical regulations concerning products before they are adopted in national law. Formal notification of the proposed new standard for coal issued from NSAI to the EU Commission in November 2010.Following acceptance of the proposal by the EU Commission, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has recently introduced a new specification for the sulphur content of coal placed on the market for residential use in Ireland. This has been given legal effect through the Air Pollution Act, 1987 (Marketing, Sale and Distribution of Fuels) (Amendment) Regulations 2011.In light of these developments, the issue of coal with a high sulphur content potentially being sourced from Northern Ireland has been addressed. In those circumstances the timing of the application of the carbon tax to solid fuels, as had been planned, will be considered.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	492	There are 16 solicitors or para-legal staff working in the Legal & Tax division of NAMA.  The National Asset Management Agency Act 2009 (Section 42) provides that all officers of NAMA are National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) employees.  The remuneration packages of all NTMA staff are negotiated on an individual contract basis and are confidential.NAMA has also established panels for the provision of some legal services. A total of 42 Solicitor firms were appointed to an Enforcement and Re-financing Panel for both Ireland and the UK on 29 October 2010.  To date 29 firms have been assigned work from this Panel.  A total of 64 Solicitor firms were appointed to a Legal Due Diligence Panel on 28 November 2009. To date 18 firms have been assigned work from this Panel.  A number of these firms have been appointed to more than one Panel.As regards fees and remuneration, NAMA informs me that the contractual details of all contracts between the Agency and individual service providers are negotiated on a case by case basis, are commercially sensitive and are confidential. However, the NAMA Quarterly Report for the 4th Quarter of 2010 shows an unaudited aggregate figure of €3.099 million for legal and tax fees in 2010. I also am advised by NAMA that all major contracts awarded by it since its inception have been awarded through www.etenders.gov.ie, the website for Irish public tenders and have been fully compliant with standard public procurement procedures, which require that the most economically advantageous bid be accepted.  The names of all successful service providers to NAMA are published on the NAMA website at www.nama.ie/TendersIntro.php .
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	493	It is assumed that the Deputy is referring to the annual alcohol excise licence fees payable by the on- and off-trade respectively.   In that context it has to be recognized that the main Exchequer receipts for the sale of alcohol arises from excise on alcohol products, which for example yielded €968m in 2009, compared to a yield of around €13.6m in respect of all alcohol excise licence fees. Off-licence  owners require a licence for each type of alcohol they sell, for each premises.  Excise duty on off-licences is currently set at €500 each per licence for a beer, wine or spirits off-licence, having been increased in recent years. This means that a typical off-licence premises, including a supermarket, offering the full range of alcoholic beverages for sale will have three off-licences and will be paying €1,500 per annum in duty.Pubs have a graduated licence duty fee structure based on turnover ranging from €250 to €3,805 (total of 6 bands).  However, over 70% of pubs fall within the two lowest bands and pay excise duty of €505 or less. Some 85% of pubs pay annual licence fees of €1,140 or less — i.e. well below the usual full off-licence trader at €1,500 per annum. Indeed only around 10% of pubs pay licence fees that are clearly above those of off-licence traders, but the amounts involved are minor compared to the overall tax take otherwise from alcohol. The average licence fee paid by the on-trade is around €778.It is difficult, therefore, to accept that there is a great deal of inequity in the present arrangements, and I have no plans to change them.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	494	Advancing the proposed Children's Museum project at a site at Heuston Gate, Kilmainham, Dublin, is entirely dependent on the availability of State capital funding. In the current economic environment, I cannot state when building work will commence.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	495	The Deputy will be aware from my Statement on Banking on 31 March 2011 that the future of Ireland's banking landscape will be built around the two Pillar Banks, Bank of Ireland and AIB.  Each of these banks has already begun to reorganize their operations into core and non-core functions and to implement a carefully managed programme of deleveraging.  Both Bank of Ireland and AIB have submitted revised deleveraging plans for consideration by the Central Bank of Ireland.  It is important to note that both banks are fully operational and continue to provide an important service to their customers.  In my Statement on Banking, I said that the Irish banking system needs to be reduced to a size appropriate to our economy.  Our banks will become smaller, more focused on core operations, better funded and better capitalised.  In that context I announced that the operations of AIB and EBS would be combined to build a second Pillar bank from the strengths of both institutions.  I expect this merger to be completed in early July 2011.   The Deputy will be aware that the Memorandum of Understanding between the Irish Government and the EU/IMF requires that the legal merger procedure be completed not later than end September 2011.Irish Life and Permanent are required to submit their Restructuring Plan to the European Commission for approval by 31 July 2011 and the process to effect the sale of ILP's life insurance subsidiary, Irish Life Assurance has begun and it is expected it will be offered for sale by the end of October 2011.    A fundamental element of Government Strategy has been to restore a functioning banking system and the Government has made particular commitments to recapitalising the banks and restructuring the banking sector as part of its Programme for Government.   This radical restructuring of the banking system is designed to put our banking system on a firm footing which is essential to Ireland's economic recovery.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	496	The Deputy will be aware that under the EU/IMF Programme of Support for Ireland, stress tests and loan book reviews on credit unions have been completed by the Central Bank of Ireland.  The purpose of this work was to provide the Central Bank of Ireland with the necessary regulatory information to concentrate its supervisory focus and, where necessary, to take pre-emptive remedial action to maintain member confidence and protect the financial stability of the credit union sector.  The Registrar of Credit Unions at the Central Bank is working closely with those credit unions that require particular attention at this time.   More broadly, and also as part of the EU/IMF Programme, I have prepared a strategy to enhance the viability of credit unions.  I intend to bring this strategy to Government shortly after which time it may be published.The Commission on Credit Unions was established by Government on 31 May 2011 and met for the first time on 20 June 2011.  The Commission will review the future of the credit union movement and make recommendations in relation to the most effective regulatory structure for credit unions.  In carrying out its work, the Commission will take into account credit unions' not-for-profit mandate, their volunteer ethos and community focus, while paying due regard to the need to fully protect depositors' savings and financial stability.  I have also asked the Commission on Credit Unions to examine the Strategy and make recommendations to me as Minister for Finance regarding any relevant proposals.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	497	I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, as advised in our letter of 6 January 2011, contact was made with the employer in January 2011. However, the details necessary to carry out reviews have not yet been made available to Revenue. Contact has again been made, today, with the employer to obtain these details.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	498	The initial application for a Primary Medical Certificate under the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994, is made to the Senior Medical Officer of the relevant local Health Service Executive (HSE) administrative area.  If the Primary Medical Certificate is refused, the person may appeal the refusal to the Medical Board of Appeal, National Rehabilitation Hospital, Rochestown Avenue, Dun Laoghaire, Co. Dublin.I understand the person appealed the decision of the Senior Medical Officer not to grant a Primary Medical Certificate and the appeal was subsequently refused by the Medical Board of Appeal. If the person wishes to apply again for a Primary Medical Certificate, the application to the Senior Medical Officer must be accompanied by a medical certificate from a registered medical practitioner indicating that the practitioner has formed the opinion that the medical condition of the person concerned has materially disimproved since the previous application. I would point out that the Medical Board of Appeal is independent in the exercise of its functions.I understand that the HSE administers both the Mobility Allowance and Motorised Transport Grant Schemes, which the person may be eligible for.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	499	I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that all processing of personal taxpayer information by Revenue is carried out in accordance with the Data (Protection) Acts. A general principle of Irish data protection law is that the data controller needs the consent of the data subject in order to disclose personal tax information to a third party. Revenue has a duty to protect the confidentiality of taxpayer information, both personal and commercial, which is now formalised by s.77 Finance Act 2011.  Revenue staff are expected to take great care to protect taxpayers' information and accordingly, where enquiries of a general nature are made, for example, by telephone to Revenue it is not unreasonable that staff should request the appropriate evidence of consent in advance of passing on or discussing personal taxpayer information.However, Revenue fully recognise the role of public representatives in relation to their constituents. When Deputies make representations on behalf of individual taxpayers, these representations normally contain personal information such as individual's PPS Number or other personal tax identifiers. In these circumstances there is generally sufficient evidence to reasonably support Revenue in a presumption of consent on the part of the taxpayer to third party representation on their behalf.I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that this approach is working well; for example, in the year 2010 more than three hundred and seventy representations were directed to the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners by public representatives in relation to individual taxpayer issues.The Revenue Commissioners advise me that they have a dedicated enquiry line for members of the Houses of the Oireachtas, which can be reached on (01) 6795852.

The requirements for the Award of the National Craft Certificate are as follows. Those who completed an apprenticeship from 1st September 1986 must provide proof that they have: documentary evidence of registration with AnCO/FÁS; acceptable documentary evidence of having completed the appropriate period of apprenticeship; proof of having been awarded the Department of Education Senior Trade Certificate.FÁS can facilitate those who do not meet the educational requirements above to validate their competence through the Standards Based Apprenticeship Programme. Applicants must undertake the Phase 6 examinations in lieu of the Junior/Senior Trades Examinations.Applicants who do not fulfil the above requirements and wish to have their competence validated are required to sit and pass the final off-the-job Phase examination of the Standard Based Apprenticeship Programme.  FÁS Apprenticeship Services has not received an application from the person in question for either of these facilities.

The disbursement of funds is a matter for each VEC, which, subject to its budget, decides the nature and extent of the adult and community education courses to be provided in its area. The organisation and location of courses are also matters for  decision by the VECs.

The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September. The staffing schedule for the 2011-2012 school year was published on my Department's website in March 2011.The staffing schedule also includes an appeals mechanism for schools to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeal Board. It is open to any Board of Management to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeal Board. Details of the criteria for appeal are contained in the staffing schedule, Circular 0019/2011. The final staffing position for all schools will ultimately not be known until the Autumn. At that stage the allocation process will be fully completed for mainstream classroom teachers and any appeals to the Staffing Appeals Boards will have been considered.

I have been advised that the State Examinations Commission (SEC) is satisfied that the questions asked on the Mathematics paper are within the parameters of the syllabus. In respect of specific queries which have been raised the SEC has confirmed that Question 7(b) as presented is correct and that the material examined in Question 8(c) is within the syllabus.Comments and observations regarding test instruments are an intrinsic part of the feedback that SEC would expect to receive in any year. The well-tried methodology in place to deal with issues that arise in the course of the examination process is the development of the marking scheme by the Chief Examiner and his college of examiners in light of the circumstances of that year's examinations. All observations received in relation to a subject are reviewed by the Chief Examiner in the context of preparing the marking scheme for that subject.  I am satisfied that the SEC has well-established procedures in place to ensure that assessment procedures operate in accordance with the principles of fairness, equity and quality assurance.

My Department is committed to providing a permanent building for this school and in this regard, officials in my Department have conducted technical inspections of two properties at the request of the school authority. The site referred to by the Deputy is the preferred option identified and a proposal has been forwarded to the land owner for consideration. My Department is currently awaiting a response to this proposal.

The school subsequently sought additional funding and permission to increase the scope of the works beyond that approved. My Department sought additional information from the school authorities and this has now been submitted. My Department is currently liaising with the school authorities relating to the matter.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	508	I propose to take Questions Nos. 114, 115 and 116 together.I wish to advise the Deputy that Circular 37/2011 provides information to schools regarding the arrangements which are being put in place for the 2011/12 school year for the allocation of Resource Teaching hours for children with assessed special educational needs.The main elements of the arrangements outlined in the Circular are that for the coming 2011/12 school year, an allocation of 90% of valid identified resource teaching allocations will be made to schools, in the first instance, to provide schools with the majority of their allocation, while also preserving enough capacity to deal with late applications and ensure that the Department of Education and Skills can remain within Employment Control Framework obligations.The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) have now notified schools of their allocations for the coming school year, which allows schools to manage and organise staffing arrangements.  Schools have also been asked to forward as soon as possible any outstanding applications, or additional outstanding materials to support incomplete applications, to the NCSE for consideration, but in any event by no later than 16th September 2011.  Following consideration of all of the applications received, if the level of demand permits, the initial 90% allocation may be revisited and increased.
#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	509	The Irish authorities submitted the application for EGF co-financing support for redundant workers at the SR Technics aircraft maintenance facility at Dublin Airport on 9 October 2009. The European Commission subsequently sought further information on the application in January 2010 and this information was supplied by the Irish authorities in April 2010.Under the European Commission decision of 8 December 2010 approving the Irish application submitted on 9 October 2009, measures provided in conformity with the application can be co-financed from 25 March 2009, the date when EGF supports commenced nationally in support of redundant SR Technics workers, and must cease on 9 October 2011.As I have previously stated in the House on a number of occasions in recent weeks on this issue, the end date of EGF co-financing of relevant supports for these redundant workers must cease on 9 October 2011 in accordance with the European Commission decision. This end-date has always been made clear to both the providers of supports to the redundant workers including in written correspondence and to the redundant workers wishing to avail of those supports including at public meetings and at meetings with worker representatives.In this context, it was always made clear to the former SR Technics workers and their representatives including at public meetings and at requested meetings with officials, that the full duration of the specific education course in question would not be funded through the EGF programme and that funding would end before accreditation is achieved. It was on this precise basis that what was originally a part-time course, was under the EGF programme offered by the relevant private college on a full-time basis in order to accelerate students' progress on a modular basis and maximise the scope for them to benefit from the EU funding available.   Under the EGF Regulation governing the Fund, EU co-financing under the EGF programme is available for a maximum of 24 months from the date of submission of an application by a Member State. It is therefore not possible for a student to complete a four year course under any EGF programme.As stated previously, no additional Exchequer funding is available to fund continued study on this course in this private college after 9 October 2011.  It is open to the relevant students to engage with the private college to seek a reduced course fee for continuance of the course full-time but at their own expense. Alternatively, the relevant students could potentially transfer to other full-time courses in the public system which are part of the Free Fees Scheme without losing their Back to Education Allowance.   In this context, in the case of a student with a higher certificate or an ordinary bachelor degree wishing to transfer onto a degree programme, procedures are not standardised between individual colleges. Students are advised in each case to make detailed enquiries at the college they are interested in entering regarding the specific transfer mechanisms. In many instances, applications are assessed individually and an interview may be required. Students are advised that the attainment of any of the qualifications outlined does not oblige a college to accept applications for entry. As the number of places is limited in many cases, intending applicants should consider applying to more than one institution. A full list of courses in higher education is available on www.qualifax.ie.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	510	I propose to take Questions Nos. 119 and 127 together.I take it that the Deputies' questions relate to these schools in the context of the value for money review on small schools which is under way at present. The value for money review on small schools is part of the normal review processes undertaken by all Departments on an annual basis on selected areas of expenditure and is being conducted in line with the standard procedure for value for money reviews. These procedures require that the views of stakeholders be obtained and the public consultations were designed to achieve this aim. This was done by issuing a direct invitation to relevant interest groups to provide a submission. The interest groups included the school patron bodies, management bodies, teacher unions, national parents' council, Irish language groups and other groups who operate in the area of social inclusion.The review will attempt to explore the general policy options for re-organisation of small schools including the sharing of resources and clustering arrangements towards small schools. I think it is important to clarify that this study is part of an overall requirement across all Government Departments to have a rolling programme of such studies.  This review was initiated last October by the previous Fianna Fáil — Green Party Government and is not driven by any ideology. The study is simply about ascertaining the facts to inform future policy. It does not mean that any policy decision has been taken at this point or that any particular outcome is sought. Given that the Government has recently announced a Comprehensive Review of Expenditure, all Government expenditure and programmes will come under similar scrutiny.The terms of reference acknowledge the important role primary schools play in their local communities. In considering any policy change in relation to small schools, the Department of Education and Skills is conscious that there is a wider dimension to be considered in addition to the cost of maintaining small schools.  Among the issues that will need to be taken into account are questions such as availability of diversity of provision, ethos of schools, parental choice, language of instruction, travel distances, transport costs and the impact of schools on dispersed rural communities. The review will examine the locations of small schools relative to each other and to other schools of a similar type. It will also examine the costs of running small schools and the educational outcomes associated with small schools.Educational quality for the students must be one of the main criteria in any consideration of primary school size. We must also consider the needs of local communities and wider social and cultural factors. Decisions on school provision and reorganisation must be widely perceived to be cost-effective, equitable and reasonable. These decisions need to be based on a rigorous evaluation of requirements and needs, not just at a local level but also at both regional and national levels.  With regard to the specific schools referred to by the Deputies the existing rules and current sustainability limits will continue to apply and there are no plans at this time to close either of these schools.

In the context of progressing these projects, officials from my Department's Planning and Building Unit recently carried out technical assessments of both schools. The next step is to finalise the Schedules of Accommodation and this process is currently under way.  My Department will continue to liaise with the school authorities in the context of progressing the projects to the next stage of the architectural planning process.

#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	518	The curriculum in schools is devised on the basis that ICT is not a curriculum area or syllabus but rather a tool to be integrated into the teaching and learning of all subjects. The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) has developed an ICT framework which sets out a structured approach to ICT in curriculum and assessment. The Framework provides a guide to teachers for embedding ICT in curriculum and assessment across curriculum subjects. It is supported by exemplars on the NCCA Action website, and by the ongoing work of the National Centre for Technology in Education. The Scoilnet website includes a comprehensive range of digital content for use across the curriculum in schools.Under the ICT in Schools Programme, which addresses the integration of ICT into teaching in learning in first and second level schools, the Department spent €35.172m in 2009 and €81.253m in 2010.  The investment is targeted at provision of ICT infrastructure,  training of teachers, the provision of curriculum-relevant digital content and a national broadband service for schools. One of the objectives of junior cycle reform is to promote increased creativity and innovation, to create space for active learning, and to better embed key skills such as ICT, teamwork and communications. I expect the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment to advise me later this year on the direction of reform.

The main conditions of the scheme are that students must be first-time undergraduates, hold inter alia EU/EEA/Swiss nationality in their own right, and have been ordinarily resident in an EU/EEA/Swiss state for at least three of the five years preceding their entry to an approved third level course.Where undergraduate students, such as non-EU students, do not meet the eligibility criteria of the free fees schemes, it is the higher education institution concerned that determines, in accordance with its criteria, the appropriate tuition fee payable by such students. Funding has not been allocated to the Royal College of Surgeons in respect of fees for students from non-EU countries.

A call for competition for the design of a scheme was published on e-tenders on 15 June.The design of the scheme will draw from international experience to support new lending that would not otherwise have been extended by the banks.  In this way, the scheme will be limited in its scope and will complement, rather than be a substitute for, existing lending activities by the main financial institutions.  It will be designed to encourage banks to lend to these new or expanding commercially viable SMEs so that they can grow their company, develop new products or expand into new markets.The Government's commitment will be for an initial period of one year.  Specific performance criteria will be set down that allow for review and revision of the scheme at the end of that initial period before committing to a roll-over of the scheme for subsequent years.  It is intended that the Scheme will be in place in the autumn.

It was asked also to assess the implications for Irish consumer rights and Irish consumer law of the EU Commission proposal for a Directive on Consumer Rights published in October 2008.  An interim report on the proposed Directive prepared by the Review Group was issued in June 2009.The time frame set for the Review Group originally envisaged that its work would be completed by mid-2010.  In September 2010, the Group's Chairman, Professor Robert Clark, wrote to the then Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation advising him that, while the Group's conclusions and recommendations were substantially complete, it proposed to defer finalising and submitting its report pending clarification of the final contents of the proposed Directive on Consumer Rights. The then Minister agreed to accept this deferral given the extensive overlap between Irish and EU law in this area.Agreement has now been reached on the Consumer Rights Directive by the European Parliament and Council, and the proposal is set to be formally adopted in the near future. The Sales Law Review Group held a meeting yesterday to finalise its recommendations and I expect to receive its final report shortly.

The commencement of the trilogue talks followed the adoption of the Directive by Member States in Council on 24 January 2011, and a plenary session of the European Parliament on 24 March at which MEPs decided to postpone a final decision on the proposal with a view to reaching agreement with the Council.Agreement has now been reached on a compromise text of the proposed Directive.  This text was endorsed by Deputy Permanent Representatives in Brussels at COREPER on 15 June 2011, and was approved by the European Parliament's Internal Market and Consumer Protection Committee on 16 June with 28 votes in favour, none against, and three abstentions.  The compromise proposal is scheduled to be put to a plenary vote of the European Parliament on 23 June.  If accepted by parliament, the proposed Directive will then have to be formally approved by the Council of Ministers, following which Member States will have two years in which to implement it.

When the information has been provided a decision will then be made on his claim.

There has been a very significant increase in the number of appeals received by the Social Welfare Appeals Office since 2007 when the intake was 14,070 to 2010 when the intake rose to 32,432.  This has significantly impacted on the processing time for appeals which require oral hearings and, in order to be fair to all appellants, they are dealt with in strict chronological order.  In the context of dealing with the considerable number of appeals now on hand, the Department has made a further 9 additional appointments to the office in recent weeks.While every effort is being made to deal with the large numbers awaiting oral hearing as quickly as possible, it is not possible to give a date when the person's oral hearing will be heard, but she/he will be informed when arrangements have been made.  The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions on social welfare entitlements.

It will provide up to 5,000 places for those seeking employment with an internship opportunity of 6 to 9 months in an organisation in the private, public or community and voluntary sectors. During this time participants will receive an allowance, which will consist of a €50 per week top up on their existing social welfare entitlements.The Internship scheme will assist in breaking that cycle whereby unemployed people cannot get a job without experience, either as new entrants to the labour market after education or training or as unemployed workers whose existing skills will not be appropriate to the types of jobs that will emerge in post- recession Ireland.  The scheme will give young people a real opportunity to gain valuable experience to bridge the gap between study and the beginning of their working lives.Work is being finalised on the development of the National Internship Scheme so that it will be ready for launch by the beginning of July.  The National Internship Scheme will have its own website which will facilitate organisations applying online when they have internships to offer. However, in the interim further information is available through the following web link: www.fas.ie/en/internship.

It is also available to people under age 66 who are in receipt of certain disability type welfare payments, such as disability allowance, invalidity pension and blind person's pension.  In the majority of cases, persons who are being cared for will be in receipt of a payment in their own right (for example a State pension or disability allowance) and will be entitled to have a free travel pass.  This includes anyone aged over 16 who qualifies for disability allowance.For a child requiring full-time care who is under age 16, a domiciliary care allowance of €309.50 per month may be paid to the parent or guardian.  This payment is not means tested and is to provide for the additional costs involved in providing care and supervision that is substantially more than that normally needed by a child of the same age.  This may include additional travel costs.  The Health Service Executive (HSE) may also assist with transport costs in certain circumstances.With the exception of those over 66 years of age, free travel passes are only provided when the person is in receipt of a qualifying payment from the Department.  All of the Department's disability and invalidity payments carry an entitlement to a free travel pass with the exception of illness benefit which is regarded as a short-term scheme.  I have no plans to extend the scheme further to provide travel passes to those who are not in receipt of a qualifying payment.

Participants will, in the first instance, be identified by the Department of Social Protection by applying the following conditions.  A person must be unemployed and in receipt of a jobseeker's payment for at least 12 months, currently be in receipt of jobseeker's allowance, and be fully unemployed.These provisions are to ensure a targeted approach to those currently affected by long-term unemployment.

Humanitarian Aid payments were made, both in the immediate aftermath of the flooding and subsequently to enable eligible households to resume living at their home. Flood relief works were also undertaken in some of the affected areas and other works are at an advanced state of preparation. Discussions took place with representatives of the insurance industry regarding giving households access to appropriate house insurance at a reasonable cost.The Government is aware that for various reasons, a small number of people have been unable to resume living at their home and others, while they have resumed living at their home, are still faced with significant problems arising from the flooding. The Government is also aware that some householders who are continuing to experience significant housing problems as a result of the November 2009 flooding are considering the possibility of relocating rather than resuming living at their original home.In light of this, the Government has decided that support may be available in such cases where:1. Serious and permanent damage has been caused to the family home by the November 2009 flooding;2. There is a high probability of a recurrence of serious flooding because of flood depth, duration or frequency on a scale that could further damage the family home;3. The house cannot be protected from flooding at an economically feasible cost;4. The household is unable to secure insurance against flooding as a result of the November 2009 floods.Support will only be considered for relocation in cases where the cost of remedial works would exceed the cost of relocation, as determined by the Office of Public Works (OPW). The following considerations will also apply:1. The gross cost of relocation underpinning the level of support provided will not exceed the cost of providing a reasonable home in the area in question, as determined by the local authority;2. The existing house must be demolished and the site must be rehabilitated , which may require planning permission from the local authority;3. If the household has settled a claim with their insurance company, the funds provided in settlement of that claim will be taken into account in determining the amount of funding, if any, provided for relocation. Beneficiaries will be required to instruct their insurance company to provide information in that regard;The households in question have been visited by officials from the Department and a report of their individual circumstances has now been completed. The OPW were requested to provide a detailed report for each household outlining the problems in the areas in question, what works if any have been completed in the area or are planned for the area and to provide an assessment of the likelihood of future flooding having regard to the works that have already taken place or are scheduled to take place. Following a recent meeting between representatives from my Department and the OPW reports on further households have now been received from the OPW. These reports are being considered in my Department at present and any outstanding matters relating to the reports are being pursued with the OPW. When all of this information is received my Department will be in a position to make decisions on the affected households.

This reflects the need for coverage for various contingencies, the rate of contributions that self-employed persons pay, the practicalities of administering and controlling access to short-term payments and the annualised system of contributions applicable to self-employed contributors.  A system of separate arrangements for employed and self-employed workers within a social insurance context is common in other European social protection systems.There are no plans to extend cover for short-term benefits to this group of insured workers.  Any such measure would have significant financial implications and would have to be considered within a budgetary context.  Consideration would also have to be given to an appropriate increase in the rate of the PRSI Class S contribution.Self-employed workers who do not qualify for an insurance-based benefit may establish entitlement to assistance-based payments such as Jobseeker's Allowance.  They can apply for the means-tested Jobseeker's Allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  In general their means will take account of the level of earnings in the last twelve months in determining their expected income for the following year.  In the current climate account is taken of the downward trend in the economy.  It is accepted that future earnings may be lower than those of previous years and this is factored in projecting future earnings, with account being taken of the potential for significant upward or downward variations in income from one year to the next.

As part of the ongoing review of its services the Board have put a new organisational structure in place, since April 2011, which enables CIB regional managers to get a greater insight into the nature of supports required by MABS companies on the ground to deliver an effective service.The focus is in ensuring clients get the level of support they need and as such client assessments and effective case management are important components of the overall approach.  During any waiting period, clients are assessed and those in need of immediate assistance are given a priority appointment, others are provided with assisted self-help to ensure that they have taken steps to assess their situation and if appropriate they are supported to take holding action with their creditors.In 2010, the Citizens Information Board (CIB) allocated a total budget of some €18.2m for the delivery of money advice and budgeting services and this figure was increased to €18.3m in 2011.  The Board monitors funding allocations across all its companies, MABS and CIS, and any company experiencing difficulties will be supported from within the current overall allocation to CIB to deliver on its commitments.The waiting times of MABS clients for a face-to-face meeting with a money advisor and the staffing issues for individual MABS companies are monitored on an on-going basis by the Board.  The review referred to in my last response is looking at the processes being used by MABS companies with a view to a consistent approach being taken to managing waiting times, taking account of service capacity across the network of companies, and in the context of the overall existing budget allocation.   It is expected that this review will be concluded by the end of July 2011 and any efficiencies will be initiated before the end of the year.I am satisfied that the CIB will continue to closely monitor the position in relation to the resources available to individual MABS companies to ensure that effective services are delivered to customers requiring assistance.

The order was made on the grounds that No. 16 Moore Street is a monument, the preservation of which is of national importance by reason of its historical significance as the site of the final council of war and final headquarters of the Provisional Government, which included five of the Proclamation signatories — Pearse, Connolly, Plunkett, Clarke and McDermott.The purpose of the preservation order is to ensure the preservation of No. 16 Moore Street in the context of wider redevelopment proposals centred on the former Carlton Cinema site. To achieve this objective, the order also covers Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street and includes the yards to the rear of Nos. 15 and 16 Moore Street, extending to Nos. 8 and 9 Moore Lane. The effect of the order is that works affecting these properties, including any excavation or ground disturbance within, around or in proximity to them, will require my prior written consent.In relation to the question of my plans for development work at Nos 14—17, I must point out that the buildings are in private ownership. The preservation Order does not confer on the Minister the power to carry out works to such a privately owned National Monument. The purpose of the Order is to protect the monument from any danger of being destroyed, injured or removed. In that regard any works affecting the monument will require my prior written consent under the National Monuments Acts.The proposed development of the Carlton Cinema site, in accordance with the permission granted by An Bord Pleanála, envisages the retention of Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street and, subject to ministerial consent under the National Monuments Acts, the development of a commemorative centre at the site. Detailed proposals in this regard were submitted to my Department last Friday. The proposals will now be carefully considered by me and by officials of my Department and my written consent will be required prior to the commencement of any works.

It is responsible for the management, maintenance, development and restoration of the inland navigable waterway system throughout the island, principally for recreational purposes.  Waterways Ireland has responsibility for approximately 1,000 km of navigable waterways, comprising the Shannon-Erne Waterway, the Shannon Navigation, the Barrow Navigation, the Grand and Royal Canals, the Erne System and the Lower Bann Navigation. In 2007, Waterways Ireland's remit was extended by the North South Ministerial Council to include responsibility for the restoration of the Ulster Canal between Clones and Upper Lough Erne.The 2011 budget for Waterways Ireland is the subject of ongoing discussions with the co-sponsoring Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure in Northern Ireland and will require formal approval by the North South Ministerial Council.  My Department has an estimated funding provision of €30.3m for Waterways Ireland for 2011, made up of €6m capital and €24.3m in current funding. Funding in future years will also require formal approval by the Council.In accordance with procedures in place, Waterways Ireland reports regularly to Ministers from this jurisdiction and Northern Ireland in the Inland Waterways Sectoral meetings of the North South Ministerial Council.  Such a meeting is scheduled to take place on 7 July next.Waterways Ireland is also subject to regular monitoring by a monitoring committee comprising officials of my Department and the co-sponsoring Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure in Northern Ireland.  This committee monitors expenditure and progress against the Waterways Ireland annual business plan.   The body also complies with the provisions of the Financial Memorandum agreed for it by the two sponsor Departments and the Finance Departments, which prescribes detailed financial arrangements for the body.

Processing of applications on hand has been slower than anticipated due to capacity constraints in undertaking the conveyancing work involved.The Government recently announced a number of decisions regarding the future management of peatlands in Ireland and, in particular, the protection of bogs designated as Special Areas of Conservation and Natural Heritage Areas.  In addition to the establishment of an independent Peatlands Council, the Government has announced a compensation package for turf-cutters in sites where continued turf cutting is no longer possible for reasons of environmental protection. My Department will be writing to all remaining applicants under the voluntary purchase scheme in the coming weeks to outline their options in light of the availability of alternative compensation arrangements.

Once designated, Ireland is obliged to monitor, protect and where necessary, restore those habitats which are under threat.  In addition, Ireland, under national law, has also designated Natural Heritage Areas (NHAs) for protection under the Wildlife Acts.  A total of 130 sites have been designated as SACs and NHAs for the conservation of raised bog habitat.The effective cessation of turf-cutting on 31 SAC sites was confirmed by a decision of the previous Government in May 2010 and had immediate effect.  This year was also the last season of turf-cutting on the remaining 24 raised bog SACs.  On the 5th April this year the Government made a number of decisions in relation to turf cutting in Ireland, including the putting in place of a compensation package for those who are required to cease cutting, the establishment of a Peatlands Council and the drawing up of a national strategy on peatlands conservation and management.  In the context of the national strategy, the position regarding raised bog NHAs, which are protected under national legislation, and the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive will be examined in advance of the 2014 cutting season.The following tables set out the names of the bogs affected by these decisions.No.Site CodeSite NameCounty1000006Killyconny Bog (Cloghbally)Cavan and

A small number of raised bogs are on sites that are designated as Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) or National Heritage Areas (NHAs).  Raised bogs have almost vanished due to land reclamation, drainage and turf extraction and these designated sites are among the best examples of the small proportion of such habitats left in Europe.There are over 1,500 raised bogs in Ireland and 139 of these have been designated for nature protection within 130 sites.  In area, they comprise less than 5% of the peatlands in the State where turf-cutting is feasible.  My Department estimates that there are up to 2,600 active turf cutters on these bogs.Almost all raised bogs outside these sites would not now meet the criteria for designation or restoration due to drainage, exploitation and land-use change.  However, many of these bogs are suitable for turf-extraction and relocation of turf-cutters to such areas is likely to be feasible in many cases.  As such, the measures announced recently announced are not incompatible with the continuation of traditional activities, but will necessitate a relocation of such activities to non-designated bogs.Traditional activities in Ireland and across the EU, encompassing a range of activities such as agriculture, fishing, hunting, forestry, land use and industry, have all had to adapt to the requirements of EU Directives, including those aimed at environmental protection.  Turf-cutting is no different in this regard.My attention has not been drawn to other countries that have sought derogation from EU Directives when national tradition came into conflict with EU policy.  Once adopted, Directives are binding on all Member States in accordance with the provisions of the individual Directives.

Responsibility for the regulation of the electricity and gas markets is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), which is an independent statutory body.The electricity retail market is now fully deregulated.  CER has announced that the small to medium business segment of the gas market will be de-regulated from 1 October next.Business and domestic customers can increasingly avail of the competitive offerings from a number of electricity and gas supply companies.  The first step that business customers should take to reduce their energy costs is to work actively in securing better value offers in the market and in switching to suppliers delivering lower prices.I acknowledge the actions taken over the last two years to bring Ireland's energy prices into line with, or below, European averages.  This is resulting in positive outcomes as is evidenced by improved competitiveness in the gas and electricity sectors when compared with other European countries.Eurostat data for the first half of 2010 showed convergence to the EU average for many categories of Irish business and residential consumer, in both electricity and gas.  The data showed that in the year to June 2010, Ireland experienced the largest fall in business electricity prices in the EU for medium to large consumers.  Prices fell by 20% to 36%, depending on consumption levels.Electricity prices in Ireland were below the EU average for medium to large business customers for the first half of 2010.Competition helps to put downward pressure on energy prices.  But the focus must be kept on all possible additional actions to mitigate costs where possible for business and for domestic customers.  This is essential for competitiveness, for employment and for economic recovery.I am committed to working with enterprise and with the energy sector to ensure that the costs of energy for business are as competitive as possible through those measures at our disposal including a sustained focus on energy efficiency.

This report will usefully inform the digital switchover programme.This report is also useful in helping to estimate the number of TV households reliant on the aerial TV network backed up by other research such as the TAM establishment survey.From the research, we can estimate that there are at least a quarter of a million households in Ireland reliant on the aerial network solely for television reception and an estimated 100,000 of these are classified as DE homes from a socio-economic perspective.  That is, the Head of Household or Chief Wage Earner in 100,000 Analogue homes is either unemployed, working as an unskilled manual worker, or wholly dependent on state benefits for income.All households reliant on the aerial TV network will need to upgrade to digital TV by the end of 2012 or they will lose access to television.TV households can choose to upgrade to digital TV by moving to a pay TV service or by upgrading to Saorview, Ireland's national digital TV aerial network.  This network was built by RTE and launched on 26th May 2011.To upgrade to Saorview, TV households will need to purchase either a set top box to connect to their existing TV or a new Saorview digital TV.  In some cases, depending on the type of aerial and the orientation and age of the aerial, TV households may also need a new aerial.  The number of TV households who may need a new aerial or aerial adjustment is difficult to estimate and is expected to be at least 20,000 TV households.Experience from other European countries indicates that the cost of set top boxes and other digital receivers reduces as the date for digital switchover approaches, and there is increased competition in the market.  I look forward to RTÉ and RTÉNL working intensively with manufacturers and retailers to ensure that there is a plentiful supply of simple to use, accessible and affordable set top boxes available on the market as well as a wide range of digital televisions and digital video recorders.To overcome the challenges that digital switchover brings, we must also assist people with information and practical assistance to ensure that no one is left behind as Ireland goes digital.For my part, as Minister, I have promised to deliver a substantial information campaign providing households with information on the digital switchover and on their options for going digital.  This information campaign will start later this year.In conjunction with this, my Department is currently developing plans to ensure that a range of practical assistance is made available, in particular, to address the particular needs of vulnerable households as they prepare to go digital.  In this context, the expertise and local knowledge of the many voluntary and charity organisations around the country will be of critical importance to ensuring the success of the switchover process.  I have asked my Department to ensure that, to the greatest possible extent, these organisations play a major part in our information and assistance campaign.

Targeted interventions, such as the National Broadband Scheme (NBS), were introduced by my Department to deliver broadband services in areas not otherwise served due to reluctance on the part of commercial operators to invest because of inadequate financial returns.  The NBS network provides a widely accessible broadband service in all of the 1028 Electoral Divisions that were identified as needing intervention.  The Rural Broadband Scheme (RBS), which I announced recently, aims to provide a broadband service to a relatively small number of remaining individual unserved rural premises.  Completion of the RBS will provide widespread access to broadband services across the country.The NewERA proposals in the Programme for Government aim to deliver higher broadband speeds.  There is a commitment to co-invest with the private sector and commercial Semi State sector to provide Next Generation Broadband to every home and business in the State.  Specifically the Next Generation Broadband Taskforce (NGBT), which I chair, is now considering how best to roll out Next Generation Broadband network access.  The NGBT, which includes representatives of large network owners and smaller telecommunications services providers, held its first meeting on 13 June 2011.  I expect that the NGBT, which will conclude its deliberations by the end of the year, will be helpful in terms of identifying the optimal policy position to deliver wider customer access to high-speed broadband.

Prices for these consumers fell by 20% to 36%, depending on consumption levels.Electricity prices for business in Ireland were below the EU average for medium to large customers for the first half of 2010.  For the group of businesses consuming the largest amount of electricity and for which we have data, Ireland was 27% below the Eurozone average.  For business customers consuming smaller amounts of electricity Ireland was ranked between 5th and 12th in Europe out of 27 countries for the same period.Competition helps to put downward pressure on energy prices.  But the focus must be kept on all possible additional actions to mitigate costs where possible for business and for domestic customers.  This is essential for competitiveness, for employment and for economic recovery.This convergence to the EU average has been an important factor in supporting greater competitiveness for Irish enterprise and foreign direct investment.  Global gas and oil prices have risen sharply since the start of the year driven by events in North Africa and Japan and high demand from the emerging economies of China and India.Markets and analysts are forecasting that international oil and gas prices will rise further over the coming months.  The Energy Regulator, Bórd Gais Eireann, ESB and other energy suppliers consider that such increases will have an impact on domestic gas and electricity prices.  Ireland is a price taker in the global fossil fuel market and the economy is therefore vulnerable to energy price fluctuations and price rises.  Competitor countries are in many instances facing the same prospect and the objective in the context of higher global prices must be that we retain or improve our competitive position.Ireland's concerns about high oil and gas prices are shared at EU level and fellow Member Countries of the International Energy Agency (IEA).  The EU and IEA agree that high fossil fuels prices which pose a threat to economic recovery underline the need to reduce dependence on fossil fuels by radically enhanced energy efficiency measures and the development of renewable energy.I am committed to working with the energy sector to ensure that the costs of energy for are as competitive as possible through those measures at our disposal including notably a sustained focus on energy efficiency.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	598	The enhancement of regional co-operation, including improved interconnectivity between Member States, is a key objective of both the EU Energy Third Package and the EU Regulation on Security of Gas Supply.The vast bulk of Ireland's gas demand is supplied from Great Britain through two interconnector pipelines between Ireland and Scotland.  The Scotland Northern Ireland Gas Pipeline (SNIP) brings gas from Scotland to Northern Ireland.  In addition, the South-North interconnector, running from Gormanstown in County Meath to Ballyclare in County Antrim, provides security of gas supply to Northern Ireland customers in the event of a gas supply disruption.My Department and the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) are currently working with their counterparts in Northern Ireland to put in place an all-island gas market by October 2012.  The primary objective is to ensure that all stakeholders on the island can buy, sell and transport natural gas and that the market can be operated effectively on an all-island basis for the benefit of consumers.At the Government's request, EirGrid the State owned transmission system operator, is building the East West Interconnector between the electricity grids of Ireland and Britain.  The construction and operation of the East West Interconnector is the responsibility of EirGrid.  This national strategic project is on schedule and on budget for delivery by 2012.  The full cost of the Interconnector is underwritten by all electricity customers under the regulatory model implemented by the CER.Electricity interconnection between Northern Ireland and Scotland is provided by the Moyle Interconnector which has a capacity of 500MW.The European Commission is giving particular strategic priority to strengthening electricity interconnection across Europe.  The strategic importance of the East West Interconnector project was recognised by the Commission with the granting of aid of €110 million for the project in 2009 as part of the economy recovery support package for European interconnection and energy infrastructure.  The East West Interconnector will enable the import and export of electricity between Ireland and Britain.  It will underpin the progressive integration of the two electricity markets and will support the further integration of wind onto the Irish energy system.  It will also bring improved security of supply and increased competition in the single electricity market.My Department and the CER will continue to work with counterparts in Northern Ireland and Great Britain to foster greater physical connectivity in electricity, improved security of supply and increased competition in the electricity and gas markets on the two islands for the benefit of consumers.  Greater competition should help to keep downward pressure on generation costs and prices.  Interconnection in the appropriate market and regulatory framework may also assist in this process, depending on how the relative prices in both jurisdictions compare over time and on how they incentivise trading in either direction.

Pending such completion, it is not possible to state a date for when gas from the Corrib gas field will become available.In terms of the potential economic impact, there will be a substantial yield of corporation tax payable to the State at the rate of 25% over the lifetime of the project once production goes into profit.It should also be noted that the Corrib Gas development is a critical driver of investment, job creation and economic growth.  In the immediate vicinity of the development and in the region generally, it is estimated that some 120 to 140 direct jobs will be created during the onshore construction phase of the pipeline with an approximate additional 200 support jobs.  There will also be 130 high quality permanent jobs ultimately created in Erris once the development comes into operation.  Indirect employment opportunities such as building suppliers, general caterers and accommodation are not accounted for in this estimate.

The PSO also supports the output of two gas fuelled power plants built in 2005 to secure much needed generation capacity at the time.  The levy is designed to compensate electricity suppliers for the additional costs they incur by purchasing electricity generated by the three peat stations and renewable energy sources.  The levy has supported the connection of more than 1,400 MW of renewable energy, mostly wind, to the electricity grid over the last decade. The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) determines the PSO levy which is a charge on all electricity customers without exception.  Its legal basis and method of calculation are set out in the regulations made under the Electricity Regulation Act 1999.  The scheme sets outs that it applies to all electricity customers.  Each year the PSO Levy is calculated by CER according to the method set out in the regulations and this process is currently underway for the next PSO year starting on 1st   October 2011.The PSO levy for the current year (exclusive of VAT of 13.5%), is €32.76 for residential customers and €99.03 for small to medium sized business customers.  On a VAT exclusive basis, this roughly equates to €2.73 per month or €5.46 every two months for residential customers and €8.25 per month or €16.50 every two months for small to medium sized business customers.In general terms, the cost of the PSO levy to the consumer tends to be low or zero when gas and oil prices are high, as in these cases the market adequately rewards renewable and conventional generation including the peat stations.  However, when fossil fuel prices are low, peat and renewable generators become less competitive and suppliers need to be compensated for purchasing their output.  The fall in gas prices in recent years gave rise to the re-emergence of the PSO levy on all customers' bills from October 2010.Global gas and oil prices have risen sharply since the start of the year driven by events in North Africa and Japan and high demand from the emerging economies of China and India. Markets and analysts are forecasting that international oil and gas prices will rise further over the coming months.  The Energy Regulator, Bord Gáis Éireann, ESB and other energy suppliers consider that such increases will have an impact on domestic gas and electricity prices.

These targets are commensurate with the overall mandatory target set for Ireland under Renewable Energy Directive of 16% penetration of renewable energy across the three sectors by 2020.Schemes to date administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) including the Greener Homes Scheme, Renewable Heat Deployment Programme (ReHeat) and the Combined Heat and Power (CHP) Deployment Programme, have contributed to increasing the level of renewable heat deployment.  Attainment of the national target is acknowledged to pose considerable challenges.My Department together with the Department of Agriculture, Marine and Food is progressing a national Bioenergy Strategy, which will include proposals on how best to encourage the use of renewable heating technologies in the public and private sector in the most cost effective way possible.In that context my Department together with SEAI, will assess the cost and benefits of a scheme similar to the proposed UK Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) Scheme.

I have no statutory function regarding the planning and construction of energy networks.The Government fully endorses the strategic national importance of investing in Ireland's electricity transmission infrastructure.  In that context the Meath-Tyrone 400KV Interconnector is a key strategic project for the economies and consumers both North and South.  It is also critical to ensuring energy supply adequacy on the island of Ireland.The Programme for Government commits to the establishment of an independent international expert commission to review within six months the case for, and cost of, undergrounding all or part of the Meath-Tyrone line.  The review will not consider whether the Meath-Tyrone Interconnector should be built.  It will consider the case for and cost of undergrounding and will take account of the significant corpus of analysis already commissioned into the undergrounding option.EirGrid has begun a new round of non statutory public consultation in relation to the Meath-Tyrone Interconnector preparatory to a formal new application to An Bord Pleanála.  This preparatory work by EirGrid does not in anyway pre-empt or undermine the Programme for Government commitment.  There is no requirement in the Programme for Government that EirGrid should halt all preparatory work and EirGrid has publicly stated that it will fully cooperate with the review and have due regard to its findings.As soon as I am satisfied with arrangements for the proposed expert commission I will be announcing its establishment.  I have asked my Department to expedite those arrangements with a view to an announcement shortly.

Broadband services are provided by private service providers over various platforms including DSL (i.e. over telephone lines), fixed wireless, mobile, cable, fibre and satellite.Details of broadband services available in each county can be found on ComReg's website at www.callcosts.ie .In cases of market failure the Government will intervene, where it is appropriate and possible to do so.  The National Broadband Scheme (NBS) and the recently-launched Rural Broadband Scheme (RBS) represent such interventions.EU State Aid and competition rules govern how states can intervene in areas where there are existing service providers operating.  Accordingly, Government sponsored interventions are prohibited from providing a service in served areas where to do so would give rise to an unacceptable level of market distortion.It continues to be a priority of the Government that there will be broadband coverage across the entire country.  I am aware that there continues to be a small percentage of premises throughout the country that are not currently capable of receiving broadband services.  This is primarily due to technical and other reasons (suitability of a telephone line, distance from an enabled exchange, no line of sight etc.).The European Commission has set aside a portion of the European Economic Recovery Programme (EERP) funding for rural broadband initiatives.  Using this funding, which will be augmented by an Exchequer contribution,   I have recently launched a Rural Broadband Scheme.  This scheme aims to identify the remaining individual premises in rural Ireland, outside of the NBS areas that are unable to obtain a broadband service and to provide a basic broadband service to those premises, where requested.Information in relation to acceptance of applications and the process of qualification under the scheme is available on my Department's website (www.dcenr.ie  ) or through contacting my Department on lo-call 1850 678100.In addition, under the NewERA proposals in the Programme for Government, there is a commitment to co-invest with the private sector and commercial Semi State sector to provide Next Generation Broadband to every home and business in the State.On 13th   June, I convened a meeting of the Next Generation Broadband Taskforce (NGBT), which I chair. The Task Force comprises the CEOs of all of the major telecommunications companies currently operating in the Irish market and CEOs of some Internet Service Provider companies.  Its purpose is to discuss how best to deliver the optimal policy environment and to identify a roadmap for the speedy delivery of high speed broadband across Ireland.  The Taskforce will consider issues such as appropriate targets, investment plans, and the role of Government policy and actions in driving and facilitating investment.I expect that the NGBT, which will conclude its deliberations before the end of March 2012 will be helpful in terms of identifying the optimal policy position to deliver wider customer access to high-speed broadband.

The scheme provides energy efficiency improvements to homes in, or at risk of, energy poverty.  The scheme is delivered through a combination of community based organisations (CBOs) and a panel of private contractors.  It was successfully delivered to over 24,000 homes across the country in 2010.  The scheme has addressed over 64,000 fuel poor homes since 2000 and the extra funding allocated under the recent jobs initiative will deliver up to an additional  20,000 homes in 2011.The success of the scheme in 2010 and the roll out on a national basis has led to increased awareness and demand.  It is the case therefore that there has been an increase in waiting times.  The SEAI are working to establish a national waiting list, which will assist in prioritising those homes which have been waiting for the longest periods of time.  Within the existing mixed model, Donegal is currently serviced by three CBOs augmented with delivery through private contractors.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	609	The recently-launched Rural Broadband Scheme (RBS) is specifically aimed at making a basic broadband service available to the small number of premises in rural Ireland that for a number of mainly technical reasons are unable to avail of a service from a commercial operator.The EU Commission approved this State intervention on the basis that the premises in question had to be located in a rural non-National Broadband Scheme (NBS) area and could not currently avail of a commercial service.  In those circumstances, it is not possible to extend the reach of the RBS to include NBS areas.Under the terms of the NBS, all residents within that area are entitled to a service from the NBS service provider "3" at contractually set minimum speeds.  Where customers are not receiving the contractually agreed terms and conditions they should, in the first instance, raise the matter with "3" through the company's customer service channel. If this fails to satisfactorily resolve the matter, they can contact my Department's NBS section who will provide assistance in having the matter settled (details of relevant contact points are available on my Department's website  www.dcenr.ie).It is a fundamental part of the NBS contract that all of the contractual obligations are fully met by the NBS service provider.  Where my Department receives a formal complaint from a customer it is immediately taken up with "3" with a view to resolving the matter as quickly as possible.I would therefore urge NBS customers who are not happy with the quality of the service they are receiving to pursue the matter with "3" and, if necessary, my Departmental officials.

In addition, Ireland makes an annual contribution to the cost of the International Transaction Log, which verifies transactions by National Registries in order to ensure consistency with the rules of the Kyoto Protocol.  The amount of these contributions is based on a biennial programme budget adopted by Conferences of the Parties. Ireland's contributions in the current biennium (2010-2011) to the Convention, Protocol and Transaction Log are €126,651, €94,443 and €45,656, respectively.

The total available in 2011 is €4m.A comprehensive review of the scheme was carried out by the Department of Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs in 2010. A new Funding Scheme was advertised in December 2010 which set down amended assessment criteria for applications received under the Scheme. These criteria did not change in 2011. 149 applications were received and 63 organisations were approved for funding under the Scheme, of which 46 had been funded under the previous Scheme.The criteria used to assess applications and the markings under the Scheme were as follows:CriteriaMarksExtent to which proposal focuses on disadvantage;20Deliverables and impact of the Funding;25Level of added value within sector;20Viability, value for money and governance20Level of co-operation/integration/consolidation with similar/allied organisations.15In order to be awarded funding successful applicants had to achieve a qualifying score of at least 60.  The total mark achieved by the Community Workers Cooperative did not meet the qualifying score.The table gives details of the 63 successful applicants.

Between 1992 and 1999, the RPII carried out a comprehensive National Radon Survey to measure radon concentrations in Irish homes. The principal objective was to assess the scale of the radon problem and, in particular, identify areas at higher risk of radon contamination above the National Reference Level of 200 becquerels per metre cubed (Bq/m3).Through the RPII's radon advice and awareness work, my Department supports efforts to raise public awareness of the risks posed by radon in the home. Householders, particularly those in known high radon areas, have been strongly encouraged by the RPII to have their homes tested for radon and to undertake remediation works where necessary. However, I have no plans to make it mandatory to have dwellings here tested for radon as a condition of sale when buying or renting a dwelling.  If a dwelling is found to have a high radon level, remediation work may be recommended. Technical guidance on radon remediation techniques is available in a booklet issued by my Department, Radon in Buildings — Corrective Options, which is available on my Department's website at www.environ.ie. The RPII has also issued guidance, Understanding Radon Remediation — A Householders Guide, which is available on the Institute’s website at www.rpii.ie, together with a a list of companies who can provide a radon remediation service and offer specific advice and recommendations. In addition, the RPII can be contacted for radon advice on freephone 1800 300 600.There is no grant scheme available through my Department for household radon testing or remediation. The cost of a household radon test is typically around €55.

To date almost half of local authorities have made applications and funding has been made available in respect of 44 applications.  The amount being allocated to each local authority is dependent upon the scale of the works to be undertaken.No application for funding has been received from Roscommon County Council, but should one be submitted it will be evaluated as soon as possible.

The Environment Section of the relevant City or County Council is the appropriate contact point for reporting a noise nuisance in this regard.  In addition, under section 108 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992, where any noise is so loud, so continuous, so repeated, of such duration or pitch or occurring at such times as to give reasonable cause for annoyance, then it is open to any person, or group of persons, to bring a complaint to the District Court.  The Court may order the person or body making, causing or responsible for the noise to take the measures necessary to reduce the noise to a specified level or to take specified measures for the prevention or limitation of the noise and the person or body concerned must comply with that order.The procedures involved have been simplified to allow action to be taken without legal representation.  A public information leaflet outlining the legal avenues available to persons experiencing noise nuisance is available to download from my Department's website at the following address: http://www.environ.ie/en/Environment/Noise/PublicationsDocuments/FileDownLoad,1319,en.pdf
The Court may take into account whether the person alleged to have caused a noise nuisance took all reasonable care to prevent or limit the noise by using facilities, practices and methods of operation that are suitable for that purpose.The Private Security Authority (PSA), under the aegis of the Department for Justice and Equality, is responsible for the licensing, control and supervision of all installers of security equipment. The PSA has powers to maintain and improve standards in the provision of services, including standards for intruder alarms. As of 1 August 2006, alarm installers cannot legally operate without a PSA licence, the granting of which will require that the installer is compliant with the Irish Standard for intruder alarm systems, IS EN50131.IS EN50131 does not specify a maximum decibel level but does specify a maximum duration of 15 minutes for the sounding of external alarms on buildings, which must cease automatically after this maximum duration. This applies to all external alarms installed after 1 August 2006.

The Programme reflects the need, in the context of the State's overall financial position, to put the funding of locally delivered services on a sound financial footing, improve accountability and better align the cost of providing services with the demand for such services.In light of the complex issues involved, a property tax, requiring a comprehensive property valuation system, would take time to introduce and accordingly, to meet the revenue measure in the EU/IMF Programme, I have already indicated my intention to introduce a household charge in 2012.I will be bringing proposals to Government in the near future on the legislative and administrative requirements necessary to implement the household charge. The level at which the charge will be set and the applicability of exemptions to the charge will be considered by Government at that time and will be announced in due course. It is my intention that the revenues from the charge will support the provision of locally based services.The Programme for Government provides for the introduction of a fair funding model to deliver clean and reliable water. The objective is to install water meters in households and move to a charging system based on usage above a free allowance.

This latter provision is, however, subject to the following qualifications -that the planning authority is satisfied that there have been no significant changes in the development objectives in the development plan or in regional development objectives in the Regional Planning Guidelines for the area of the planning authority since the date of the permission such that the development would no longer be consistent with the proper planning and sustainable development of the area,that the planning authority is satisfied that the development would not be inconsistent with the proper planning and sustainable development of the area, having regard to any guidelines issued by the Minister under section 28, notwithstanding that they were so issued after the date of the grant of permission in relation to which an application is made under this section, and/orthat the planning authority is satisfied where the development has not commenced, that an environmental impact assessment, or an appropriate assessment, or both of those assessments, if required, was or were carried out before the permission was granted.In extending the duration of permission under the new provision, a planning authority may attach conditions requiring the giving of adequate security for the satisfactory completion of the proposed development, and/or may add to or vary any conditions to which the permission is already subject under section 34(4)(g  ).Planning authorities are required to implement section 42, as amended.  I am not aware of any instances of their not doing so.

It is their duty to ensure, as far as possible and with the cooperation of the public, the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the Register. While there have been improvements in these regards in recent years, I am satisfied that further improvements can be made.The Programme for Government contains a commitment to establish an Electoral Commission to subsume functions of existing bodies and my Department. An Electoral Commission will be an important element in a reformed and revitalised electoral system and I am currently giving consideration to how the necessary measures to establish such a Commission can be advanced, including its structure and functions.  I will, in that context, give consideration to issues raised concerning the electoral register.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	628	The Forum on Philanthropy was established by Government in 2006 with the core objective of developing a culture of philanthropy in Ireland.  The Forum comprises representatives from a range of private philanthropic organisations, and from a number of Government Departments.In June 2010 the mandate of the Forum was renewed by Government for a further two years.  The Forum was asked to prioritise the following areas of work:Improved data gathering — the Forum should ensure that there is valid, timely and comparable data on philanthropy in Ireland. This will identify roles and responsibilities for private philanthropic organisations and the State;Mapping out an appropriate infrastructure for giving for Ireland;Looking at the possibilities for an Irish Giving Campaign;Telling the story of philanthropy — there is a need to increase public understanding and awareness of the contribution of philanthropy, to identify and implement the best way to develop case studies of philanthropy in an Irish context.Since 1 May 2011 this area has come under my remit within the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government. I will be holding a meeting of the Forum very shortly and I intend to extend its membership and its remit. I believe there is untapped potential to increase philanthropic giving within this country.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	629	The Local Government (Charges) Act 2009, which introduced the non-principal private residence charge, places the onus on individual property owners to assess their liability for the charge in the first instance. There is no obligation on local authorities to issue demands or invoices.  The charge is set at €200 per dwelling and is being levied and collected by local authorities.  A late payment fee of €20 for each month or part of a month the charge remains outstanding is provided for in section 6 of the Act.A person who is ordinarily resident abroad and owns a property in the State which is not his or her main residence would be liable for the charge in the same manner as a person resident in the State.Nationwide advertising took place in both 2009 and 2010, and is underway again this year, to ensure general awareness of the charge and the liability dates.  In tandem, local authorities have undertaken their own advertising campaigns locally.  In addition, local authorities have separately sent reminders to property owners registered with the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB).  In this regard, every effort has been made to ensure that property owners are aware of the charge and any potential liability arising therefrom.

The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority.I recognise that these are difficult economic times for many businesses and I will continue to keep all matters relating to rates under regular consideration in my Department. However, I have no immediate plans to conduct a review of the rating system generally.Local authorities play a central role in supporting economic development and enterprise at local level. They do this in a number of ways including through their capital and current budgets, economic planning and development and the provision of goods and services as well as community infrastructure.Business Support Units or similar arrangements have been put in place in all county and city councils. These Units provide a dedicated one-stop-shop approach for businesses in areas such as planning, water services and roads. In addition, the local government led County/City Development Boards are engaged in economic development and the promotion of enterprise in their areas.The Programme for Government provides for an expanded role for local authorities in local enterprise and community development. This in turn will assist in maximising the impact of investment to produce jobs at local level.

The Directive will be implemented in stages with the INSPIRE "roadmap" setting out target dates for implementation of these stages: full implementation is required by 2019.  My Department has prepared an INSPIRE Directive Implementation Programme to meet the roadmap deadlines and to manage the work required to develop an Irish Spatial Data Infrastructure that is both INSPIRE Directive compliant and effective.

The Planning and Development Regulations 2001 prescribe the current planning fees.  Any proposed changes to planning fees, including those payable to planning authorities in relation to the making of objections in respect of planning applications, would require the prior approval of the Oireachtas to regulations made under section 262 of the Planning and Development Acts 2000-2010.  I have no plans to amend the planning fees regulations at this time.

It is a commitment under the EU/IMF Programme for publication in Q1 2012, however, it is my objective to publish the measure ahead of the EU/IMF deadline, if possible.  In developing the Bill, account is being taken of the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission in its recent Report on  Personal Debt Management and Debt Enforcement.  That report provided an in-depth review of the personal debt regime.  The economic and financial effects of certain of the new arrangements are being carefully assessed to ensure that all relevant issues are addressed and their impact is fully anticipated and understood.”  I have nothing further to add to that reply other than to indicate that the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, that I expect to be in a position to publish very shortly, will contain some interim measures in relation to reform of the law on bankruptcy.

I have been informed that as of Wednesday 15 June 2011, there were 41 males aged 16 and 17 years old residing in St. Patrick's Institution.  Responsibility for the development and provision of safe, secure accommodation for all children ordered to be detained by the Courts rests with the Irish Youth Justice Service, and this service will shortly come under the remit of my colleague Ms. Frances Fitzgerald TD, Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.Designs for the new National Children Detention Facilities to be constructed on the Oberstown campus are well advanced and Government approval to tender for the construction of the project will be required.  The construction of the facilities is to take place on a phased basis.  Phase 1 of the project will prioritise the provision of sufficient safe, secure detention places to allow for the transfer of responsibility for 16 and 17 year old boys from the Irish Prison Service.

This is to enable management to best utilise available skills and experience. The staffing needs of the children detention schools are kept under review and there are no plans to redeploy staff outside the schools at this time.As the Deputy is aware the Croke Park Agreement provides the backdrop as to how staff redeployment within the public sector can be facilitated.  The Deputy will note from the first progress report on the Croke Park Agreement published last week by my colleague Minister Howlin that flexible redeployment is critical to the Agreement's capacity to supporting the maintenance of essential services where significant reductions in staff numbers are to be achieved.

Security audits have shown no evidence of breaches of my Department's website security.In relation to the broader issue of a cyber security strategy for Ireland, I am aware that the Department of Communications has undertaken some preliminary work in this regard.Insofar as my Department is responsible for the development of legislation on cybercrime, the Criminal Justice (Cybercrime) Bill, which is currently being prepared, will create a range of offences relating to information systems and data, including illegally accessing a system, interference with systems or data and illegal interception of data.  Offences will also be created in relation to hacker tools used for the commission of these offences.  This measure will enable Ireland to ratify the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime.  It is also intended to incorporate any legislative requirements arising from the new EU Directive on Attacks against Information Systems, which is currently being negotiated, into the Bill.

There are currently three County Registrar vacancies (Monaghan, Sligo and Tipperary) whose functions are being covered by neighbouring Registrars under the provisions of Section 30 of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2008. I am informed by the Courts Service that this arrangement is working well and has resulted in savings of over €700,000 to date.The Courts Service established a Working Group in 2009 to conduct a detailed review of the role of the County Registrar.  The group, which included a number of Registrars, found that with a reorganisation of management responsibilities (which is currently underway), there was sufficient capacity and expertise to take on a range of additional functions with a view to speedier and more efficient administration of court business.  I propose to include enabling provisions for a number of these functions in the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill which will be published shortly.  Proposals for other functions continue to receive consideration in consultation with the Attorney General.When these additional functions have been introduced it will be possible to fully assess what the level of business is and the optimum future numbers.  Pending that, I do not propose to seek to fill the three vacancies whose functions are being administered satisfactorily at present.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	654	Over the past few years strong legislative, administrative and operational measures have been put in place to combat and prevent trafficking in persons for both sexual and labour exploitation purposes.  The Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 with penalties of up to life imprisonment for human trafficking has greatly strengthened the law in this area.  Section 5 of the Act makes it an offence to solicit or importune a trafficked person, in any place, public or private for the purposes of prostitution.  A dedicated Anti-Human Trafficking Unit was established in my Department in 2008 with the purpose of ensuring that the State's response to human trafficking is coordinated and comprehensive.  This led to the production of a National Action Plan to Prevent and Combat Trafficking of Persons for the period from June 2009 to December 2012 setting out 144 Actions of which 92 were completed or significantly progressed at the end of 2010 with a further 52 on-going.  A mid-term review of that Plan is currently taking place and I will consider what further steps should be taken both on completion of that review and on the expiry of the term of the National Action Plan.   In addition to the dedicated Unit in my Department there are 3 other dedicated Units in State Agencies dealing with the issue — the Human Trafficking Investigation and Co-ordination Unit in the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB); the Anti-Human Trafficking Team in the Health Service Executive (HSE) and a specialised Human Trafficking legal team in the Legal Aid Board (LAB).  Dedicated personnel are also assigned to deal with the prosecution of cases in the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) Office.  There are a wide range of training and awareness raising activities on-going and extensive consultation structures exist with Non-governmental Organisations, International Organisations and State Agencies.The Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2010 has been restored to the Dáil Order Paper.  The Bill, once enacted, contains statutory protections for victims of trafficking and also provides for recovery and reflection periods and temporary residence permission for persons whom a member of the Garda Síochána, not below the rank of Superintendent, considers that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the person is a victim of human trafficking.  These provisions are reflected in Administrative Immigration Arrangements for the Protection of Victims of Human Trafficking which have been in place since the enactment of the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act, 2008.  The EU Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings and protecting its victims was adopted by Member States on 5 April 2011.  Member States (including Ireland) who opted into the Directive are obliged to bring into force any laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with the Directive.  The legislative implications of transposing this Directive in Ireland is currently being examined.  The law in relation to human trafficking and prostitution is kept under continuing review in my Department.The Garda authorities have conducted a number of operations to combat human trafficking and prostitution and will continue to do so in line with intelligence available to them.  In respect of the number of prosecutions that have taken place within the past three months in relation to offences for human trafficking and prostitution, it has not been possible for the Garda authorities  to supply the details requested in the time available. I will be in contact with the Deputy directly when the information is to hand.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	657	I am informed by the Garda authorities that as the current Strategy and Implementation Plan for Neighbourhood Watch, covering the period 2007 — 2011, is in its final year of operation, it is now being reviewed.  Future strategies to develop Neighbourhood Watch, and similar programmes such as Community Alert, as effective crime prevention initiatives will take account of the overall policing environment.Neighbourhood Watch is currently promoted in a variety of ways, including the Garda National Model of Community Policing, regular community safety campaigns, regional public crime prevention days, local community policing crime prevention initiatives, the Crimecall television programme and in conjunction with national events such as the National Ploughing Championships and the Ideal Homes Exhibition.  Depending on policing needs at particular times, each of these promotion methods is developed and utilised to emphasise different aspects of Neighbourhood Watch with the goal of combating crime and promoting crime prevention awareness in the most effective ways.The assistance of the public is crucial to reducing and preventing crime in our local communities, and An Garda Síochána has long experience in developing and carrying out cooperative initiatives with the public.  Neighbourhood Watch is an important example of such processes.An Garda Síochána will continue to deepen the involvement of the public in preventing crime through Neighbourhood Watch and Community Alert and to provide assistance in achieving this.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	658	Applications for refugee status in the State are determined by an independent process comprising the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC) and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal (RAT) which make recommendations to the Minister for Justice and Equality on whether such status should be granted.During 2010, the median processing time for asylum applications by the ORAC was 6 to 7 weeks from the date of application in the case of prioritised applications, and 9 weeks from the date of application in the case of non-prioritised applications.The median processing times for RAT appeals in 2010 was 33 weeks in the case of substantive appeals (cases involving an oral hearing) and 9 weeks in the case of accelerated appeals (appeals on the papers).I would point out that some cases can take significantly longer to complete due to, for example, delays arising from medical issues, non-availability of interpreters or because of judicial review proceedings.  All asylum applications and appeals are processed in accordance with the Refugee Act 1996 and high quality and fair decision-making in all cases continues to be a key priority at all stages of the asylum process. Without getting into the specifics of individual cases I would say that the length of time spent in the direct provision system cannot be attributed to any inaction or unnecessary delays on the part of the statutory independent agencies involved in the refugee status determination process or by my own Department.For the sake of completeness, I should also state that persons who are refused a declaration under Section 17 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) enter what is commonly referred to as the "leave to remain" process which generally has two elements to it; an application for subsidiary protection and further consideration to be given under Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended). This is separate to the asylum or refugee status determination process.The processing of cases at this point is also complex and extremely resource intensive given that where an application for subsidiary protection is lodged in addition to representations for consideration under Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the subsidiary protection application must be considered first to assess whether the applicant has an identifiable need for international protection. The investigation of such applications requires a fresh examination of the entire asylum file, the documentation and country of origin information submitted in support of the application, as well as an examination of objective, reputable, up to date country of origin information before a conclusion can be arrived at as to whether or not the applicant is likely to be exposed to ‘serious harm' if returned to his/her country of origin. Where such an application is refused, consideration must then be given to the case in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), at which point the Minister must make a decision whether or not to make a deportation order in respect of the person. All of this must be done in strict compliance with the Constitution, together with relevant international law including the European Convention on Human Rights.It will be seen that these are not quick or easy decisions to make and, given the life changing consequences for the persons involved, these are decisions which must be taken with the most scrupulous care and attention.The Deputy might like to note that I have taken steps to speed up the processing of these applications by redeploying staff from the refugee determination bodies primarily.The Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2010 which provides for the introduction of a single procedure to determine applications for protection and other reasons to remain in the State, should substantially simplify and streamline the existing arrangements.  This re-organisation of the protection application processing framework will remove the current multi-layered processes and provide applicants with a final decision on their application in a more ‘straight forward' and timely fashion. The Deputy is probably aware that I am currently developing a number of amendments to the Bill before commencing Committee Stage which I hope to be in a position to do in the near future.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	659	Following the coming into force of the Lisbon Treaty the legal basis for Council Directive 2003/9/EC laying down minimum standards for the reception of asylum seekers is Article 78(2)(f) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  Accordingly, the provisions of the EU Treaty Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice applies.  The Protocol provides that Ireland may opt-in to a measure to which the Protocol applies. Ireland did not participate in the adoption and application of the 2003 Directive and there are currently no plans to exercise an opt-in in relation to it.The principal reason for Ireland's position is the provisions of Article 11 of the 2003 Directive which deals with access to the labour market for asylum seekers. Article 11 provides that if a decision at first instance has not been taken within one year of the presentation of an application for asylum, and this delay can not be attributed to the applicant, Member States shall decide the conditions for granting access to the labour market for the applicant.This is contrary to the existing statutory position in Ireland which provides that an asylum seeker shall not seek or enter employment. This prohibition in Irish law is maintained in the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2010, which was recently restored to the Dáil order paper.Any change in public policy in this area would have to have regard to the very large numbers of people unemployed in this country.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	660	The Deputy refers to Ireland's first instance recognition rate as computed by Eurostat (the EU Statistical Agency). It should be noted that this calculation is based on positive decisions as a proportion of all decisions made at first instance. This is important as the calculation for Ireland differs from that of almost all other EU Member States. The reason for this is that Ireland does not operate a single procedure. Therefore the calculation of our recognition rate at first instance does not include subsidiary protection decisions and decisions made for humanitarian reasons. When these elements are excluded, the recognition rate for other EU states at first instance is also low. Poland for example has a rate of just 6.3%.There are a number of other reasons for Ireland's apparently low recognition rate. Firstly, the profile of our asylum applicants differs to many other EU Member States. This is likely to be due to our geographic location and the fact that access to Ireland by persons fleeing persecution is less direct. For example, using the Eurostat figures Afghanistan and Somalia accounted for 13.6% of asylum applications across EU Member States in 2010 but less than 6% of applications in Ireland. In contrast, our largest source country historically for asylum applications is Nigeria which accounted for 20% of all asylum applications in 2010 but only 2.6% of all applications to EU Member States. The recognition rate for applications from Afghanistan and Somalia are high (44% and 66.7% respectively) across EU Member States while the recognition rate for Nigerian applications is low running at just 6.5%.Many EU states also have particularly low numbers of decisions. For instance Portugal had just 130 decisions in 2010 with a recognition rate of 42.3%. In such cases involving low numbers of decisions it is difficult to make a meaningful comparison of recognition rates.It must also be noted that a large proportion of Ireland's asylum applications are also processed under the Dublin II Regulation; are withdrawn or deemed withdrawn; or are made in respect of children under 3 years of age by parents who may have failed the asylum process. In total, determinations in relation to these three categories of applicant accounted for over half of all refused applications at first instance in 2010.Finally, I might add that the investigation of asylum applications is conducted by trained officials authorised by the Refugee Applications Commissioner under the provisions of the Refugee Act, 1996. These officials are trained according to United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) programmes and are given refresher training delivered by specialist trainers from the UNHCR.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	661	I am committed to Ireland fulfilling its international obligations under the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and the 1967 Protocol. The Convention provides for a system of international protection for persons who are unable or unwilling to avail of the protection of their country of origin owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted.Ireland's asylum system is based on a number of key principles which are common to all EU Member States. These principles are also in keeping with the highest standards as enunciated by the UNHCR. There is no question, therefore, of Ireland not protecting the human rights of asylum seekers. These principles include:meeting our obligations under international law such as the 1951 Convention;a fair refugee status determination process which includes a right of appeal, legal advice if required, personal interview and the possibility of judicial review.ensuring that we have robust systems in place to prevent abuse of our asylum system by persons who enter the State for purposes other than seeking protection from persecution and;ensuring that persons who are found, after a fair and efficient determination process, not to be in need of protection are returned to their countries of origin as quickly as this can be arranged.The Government policy of Direct Provision for asylum seekers ensures that a suitable standard of accommodation, food, medical and other services is maintained. This is a fair system for meeting the needs of asylum seekers in a cost-effective manner. It is line with asylum seeker reception arrangements in other EU countries and indeed, in some cases, it is of a much higher standard.I recently decided to restore to the Dáil order paper the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill. The Bill, which was published in 2010, comprehensively reforms and simplifies the current refugee status determination process. It proposes, inter alia, the introduction of  a single procedure for the investigation of all grounds for protection presented by applicants. This change of the processing framework will remove the current multi-layered and sequential process associated with the existing system. This will allow an applicant to get a final decision on their application in a more efficient manner. Together with other provisions of the Bill, it is anticipated that the time required to reach a final decision in a given case will be reduced, which can only be in the interests of the applicant and indeed the integrity of the refugee status determination process.I am currently developing a number of amendments to the Bill before commencing Committee Stage, which I hope to be in a position to do in the near future.

The position is unchanged since then.Arising from the refusal of his asylum application, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was notified, by letter dated 30th September, 2005, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against him.The person concerned was subsequently notified of his entitlement to submit an application for Subsidiary Protection in accordance with the provisions of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006. The person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection. When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.In the event that the application for Subsidiary Protection is refused, the position in the State of the person concerned will then be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  All representations submitted will be considered before the file is passed to me for decision. Once a decision has been made, this decision and the consequences of the decision will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned.I should remind the Deputy that queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by Email using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

Following consideration, the application was rejected for a number of reasons and the person named was informed accordingly.  As officials in my Department were not aware at that time that the person named had let land for a nine-month period in two of the years before the application was submitted, this was not among the reasons for rejection of the application. Had this point been considered, it would have been an additional reason for rejecting the application.

The funding for the scheme had to be found within the expenditure ceilings for my Department as set out in the National Recovery Plan, 2011-2014 and I was faced with very difficult choices in deciding between competing priorities in the allocation of funds to AEOS. In the circumstances and in order to maximise the number of applicants who could be accommodated in the scheme, I decided that the rate of payment for Natura or designated land would be €75/ha.The AEOS applications received are being evaluated at present and the numbers of participants that can be accepted and the overall cost of the scheme in 2011 and subsequent years have yet to be determined. Irrespective of the final outcome in relation to the 2011 applications, the budgetary constraints and pressures remain and, in aggregate terms, the demands will continue to exceed the funds available. Nevertheless, I am conducting an extensive review of all expenditure by my Department and once this is completed, I will review issues associated with AEOS, including the matter of the payments to farmers with designated land.

This process is ongoing and significant progress has been made.  This comprehensive data collection programme, together with the setting of appropriate conservation objectives by the NPWS, will enable all new, renewal and review applications to be appropriately assessed for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the EU Birds and Habitats Directives.  This work represents a significant financial, administrative and scientific investment by the State in resolving this issue.  The Appropriate Assessment of aquaculture applications will be dealt with on a bay-by-bay basis.My Department continues to make every effort to expedite the determination of all outstanding cases having regard to the complexities of each case and the need to comply fully with all national and EU legislation.It is estimated that there are in the region of 2,800 people employed in aquaculture and support services.

The Attorney General has responded with a detailed advice on the issue which I am currently examining.  The advice highlights the difficulties in relation to the Constitution and in relation to the laws of the European Community relevant to the question of implementing a system of administrative sanctions for fisheries.There are many significant differences between the legal systems in Ireland and that of other EU Member States. Ireland's constitutional and legal position provides certain basic rights which must be respected within our system of justice.Furthermore, European Union legislation requires that penalties for fisheries offences must be "effective, proportionate and dissuasive  “. That is, they must act as a deterrent and they must also ensure that there is no benefit gained by infringing the rules.Given the nature of the penalties involved, there is a general requirement under the Constitution that alleged breaches of fisheries control regulations must be tried in a court of law.  I am continuing to actively examine the issue in the context of the Attorney General's advice in relation to the Programme for Government commitment.Irrespective of the outcome of the administrative sanctions situation, it will be necessary to bring forward legislation to amend the Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act, 2006 in relation to the implementation of a penalty points system for serious fisheries infringements as required under  EU Regulation  1224/2009, which establishes a community control system for ensuring compliance with the  rules of the Common Fisheries Policy. In addition to this requirement, a number of minor amendments of a corrective nature are necessary. It is my intention to introduce an amendment to the Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act, 2006 in autumn 2011 in this regard.

The Trading Scheme is run twice annually in respect of each Co-op collection area, and is comprised of a priority pool and a market exchange. A maximum of thirty per cent of the quota offered for sale is sold into the priority pool at a maximum price set by the Minister, and the remainder is traded through an exchange at prices set by sellers and buyers themselves. The next Trading Scheme will take place in the autumn, and will be followed by a further Scheme in early 2012, both of which will make quota available to buyers with effect from 1 April 2012. I hope to announce the Scheme details in the second half of August.Under the recent Scheme for the Allocation of Milk Quota to New Entrants, the eligibility criteria for brand new entrants to dairying required that each applicant must:satisfy certain education and training qualifications,have no milk quota, nor have been a producer previously,have/will have a holding comprised of lands owned and/or leased,have/will have a separate independent herd number in which the dairy animals will be registered,have/will have separate milking and milk storage facilities.Further schemes are planned for 2012 and 2013, and I hope to announce details of the 2012 Scheme early next year.The other means by which milk quota may be acquired are through the purchase of land and quota on the open market or through the leasing of land and quota from a qualified relative.

The Department of Children and Youth Affairs has commenced discussions with the Attorney General, with a view to preparing a draft wording which will more closely reflect the work of the Committee, than that which the previous government approved in draft form. Following these deliberations, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs intends to bring the matter to Government for approval to draft a bill and hold a referendum.A small team within the Department is working on this issue.  Arrangements for holding a referendum will be primarily a matter for the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, and staff from my Department will liaise with that Department as appropriate.The Referendum will not take place on the same day as the presidential election as to do so may unnecessarily and unhelpfully politicise children's rights.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	701	I propose to take Questions Nos. 340 and 341 together.Preschool services can apply to participate in the free Preschool Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) scheme, which was introduced by my Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs in January 2010.  Under the scheme, in return for providing the free Preschool Year to eligible children, a preschool service will be paid an annual capitation for each eligible child enrolled.  The standard capitation rate is €2,450 per annum and a  higher capitation rate of €2,850 per annum is payable to services with more highly qualified staff.Children are eligible to participate in the scheme when they are aged between 3 years 3 months and 4 years 6 months in September of the relevant year.  At September 2010, some 4,300 preschool services, or 95% of all such services, are participating in the scheme.  63,000 children, or 94% of all eligible children are availing of the free Preschool Year.  The ECCE scheme cost approximately €154 million in 2010 and is expected to cost €166 million in 2011.  Applications for new services to enter the scheme from September 2011, will be available shortly from the local City or County Childcare Committee.The Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme was introduced in September last year and is also implemented by my Department, on behalf of FÁS and the Vocational Educational Committees (VECs).  Under this programme, which is open to full day-care and part-time services, qualifying students and trainees can avail of childcare places free of charge, with my Office paying providers a weekly capitation rate of €170 for each full-time childcare place contracted in their service, €95 for each half day care place and €50 for an after school place.My Office also has responsibility for the implementation of the National Childcare Investment Programme (NCIP) which includes a capital grant programme to develop childcare facilities.  However, as this programme closed to new capital grant applicants in 2009, I regret to advise the Deputies that capital expenditure in 2010 and 2011 is confined to existing capital grant commitments.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	702	The free Preschool Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme was introduced in January 2010 and provides a free  preschool year to all eligible children.The standard capitation fee  paid to childcare services participating in the ECCE programme is €2,450 per annum or €64.50 per week over 38 weeks, or €48.50 per week in the case of full day services open 50 weeks per annum.  A higher capitation fee of €2,850 per annum or €75 per week is available to sessional playschool services with more highly qualified staff.   Participating services may charge parents for additional services provided they are clearly optional and children not availing of such services continue to receive an appropriate programme based provision.Services participating in the scheme are required to provide the preschool year provision to the parent free of charge.  A full day-care service which operates for 50 weeks of the year must provide 2 hours 15 minutes per day free under the scheme but can charge parents for the additional hours availed of.  A sessional playschool providing the preschool provision for 3 hours each day over 38 weeks can offer parents, on a strictly optional basis, an additional 30 minutes per day in return for an additional fee.  Each participating service is required to provide a fee policy to its local City or County Childcare Committee (CCC) including details of fees charged in respect of non-qualified children and details in regard to optional additional fees.  This information is required to ensure that services are compliant with the terms and conditions of the scheme.It is a fundamental  principle of the ECCE programme that the preschool year is provided free of charge to the parent whose child qualifies under the programme. Any additional services or time provided  to ECCE qualifying children must be clearly optional and the overall cost of the child's attendance must not exceed the cost of providing the same service to a parent whose child does not qualify under the scheme. While the ECCE programme does not set maximum and minimum levels of fees for additional services, in some cases services have tried to vary their fees for qualified and non-qualified children, in order to reduce the economic benefit of the programme for parents, and to increase their benefits in respect of children qualified under the programme. For example, if the price of a daily 5 hour place is €120 per week and ECCE capitation amounts to €48.50, the price for an ECCE qualified child in such a place should not exceed €71.50.In order to ensure the programme benefits parents as intended, the City and County Childcare Committees (CCCs) verify the Fees Policies of participating services, to ensure that the full benefit of the capitation paid is reflected in the price of additional hours provided.   I can confirm, however, that there is no €92 cap and many crèches charge a higher top-up in the context of Full Daycare places, where the top-up would often exceed €100.

To date payment to the value of €66,946  has issued in respect of 1,120 patients to date, an average payout of €59.77. The HSE advise that no payments issued during 2010. The identification of the total number of people to be refunded and the value of such refunds are yet to be established from records retained at each individual care centre, and is part of a significant workload involved in completing payments. There is no specific provision for administration. It is hoped to progress payments in 2011, including in the western region, but this is subject to resources being available to do so. Interest retained since 2005 is lodged in the Central PPP Fund for distribution and is managed and audited separately from all other HSE accounts. There is no requirement on clients or next of kin to make an application for this payment. The HSE have again expressed their willingness to provide full briefing on PPP related issues to the Deputy, or to meet with him to answer his queries, if he so wishes.

#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	712	The mental health services report all deaths of patients in Approved Centres.  When persons are discharged from an Approved Centre they may continue to avail of a range of community-based mental health services.  All sudden, unexplained deaths of persons attending a day hospital or a day centre, or other mental health service (including out-patient departments, resource centres, group homes, out-reach teams and other service types) or living in 24 hour staffed community residences are required to be notified to the Mental Health Commission within 7 days of the death occurring.In 2010, the Commission was notified of 75 deaths in this category, however, based on the information provided, it was not apparent in all instances that a sudden unexplained death had occurred.  The Inspector of Mental Health Services examines all death notifications and in cases suggestive of suicide or violent death requests a review be carried out by the service concerned and a copy of the review is sent to the Inspectorate.  These reviews are analysed to identify opportunities for improvement in patient safety, care and treatment and form part of the ongoing dialogue between the Inspectorate and services.The admission and discharge of service users to and from an acute in-patient unit is a clinical decision by a consultant psychiatrist and follows a clinical assessment which includes a risk assessment for self harm prior to discharge.  Service users are offered a follow up service in the community and many will have had an opportunity for home leave to prepare for discharge.  Internationally, the first 48 hours post discharge from acute in-patient care is recognised as a time of elevated risk and the mental health services will work with family members and community supports to continually assess and support the individual and to ameliorate the risk.  I am satisfied with these procedures.

The programme is due to establish referral guidelines and encourage the increased use of neurolink. The second programme deals with epilepsy services and aims to introduce rapid access clinics to assist with admission avoidance and reduce the number of attendances to emergency departments.  The third programme deals with stroke services and aims to establish robust clinical governance systems for stroke care, including local stroke teams and regional stroke networks.I welcome the action plan for neurological care by the Neurological Alliance of Ireland, which emphasises the importance of neurological care and raises many issues that these Neurology programmes will address, including a comprehensive plan for improving neurological care including acute services and increasing staffing.The HSE has emphasised to my Department that all national programmes, including those concentrating on neurology, will have a focus on patient advocacy. These inter-related programmes aim to improve service quality, effectiveness and patient access and to ensure that patient care is provided in the service setting most appropriate to individuals' needs.  I believe that the clinical programmes being developed by the HSE are vital to ensuring the most appropriate organisation of acute services.

These include the clinical programmes developed by the HSE's National Directorate for Clinical Strategy and Programmes.The SDU's priorities will encompass:Emergency Departments — waiting times for admission have been unacceptably high in a number of hospitals, often breaching the current 6-hour maximum waiting time targetIn-patient waiting times — the trend has been upwards recently, despite the work of the NTPFOut-patient waiting times — the time from GP referral to an appointment with a consultant is unacceptably long in many specialtiesAccess to diagnostics — this forms an essential part of the patient journey for all of the areas of access aboveThe SDU will be a crucial "agent for change" allowing for a transformation in the operation of structures across the system. Its success will allow for an alteration in the current role of the NTPF.  Its resources will be re-focused to align closely with the work of the SDU, and crucially will allow for a progressive improvement in the performance of the nation's hospitals.  The NTPF has welcomed the new initiative and has confirmed it will work proactively with the Unit to achieve the best possible result for patients.In the interim the NTPF will continue to operate as normal accepting applications from persons who have been waiting for over three months for treatment.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	724	I propose to take Questions Nos. 367, 370 and 371 together.I have stated many times that the waiting times for admission for patients attending Emergency Departments in many hospitals are unacceptable.  I am determined that this situation should be addressed.  In this regard the Deputy will be aware that I have recently established the Special Delivery Unit and assigned to it as a priority the task of addressing the issues arising in Emergency Departments.The difficulties in Emergency Departments cannot be resolved solely within the EDs themselves and must be addressed on the basis of a health-system wide approach. In particular, overcrowding in the Emergency Department is multi-factorial in origin and any solution to problems that may arise from this issue must reflect this reality.  Any solution must start with ensuring that patients are treated in the most appropriate way in the most appropriate location.  This means that where and whenever possible patients who can be treated in the primary care setting receive that treatment in a timely manner.  This will ensure that patients can be confident of receiving the necessary treatment on time and that there is less need for patients to attend at EDs.The issue of staffing levels in Emergency Departments, as in other areas of hospitals, is a matter for the management of the hospitals and the HSE in the first instance.  I am aware that concerns have arisen in relation to certain hospitals in advance of the next rotation of Non-Consultant Hospitals Doctors (NCHDs).  My officials are in contact with the HSE and relevant authorities to ensure that the necessary steps are being taken to ensure ongoing safe delivery of service in hospitals and in Emergency Departments in particular.I am confident that with careful planning, with leadership from the Special Delivery Unit, the implementation of the HSE's Emergency Medicine Programme and related clinical programmes and the roll-out of Acute Medicine Units we will be in a position to reassure patients that the difficulties in Emergency Departments will be addressed.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	725	I propose to take Questions Nos. 368 and 369 together.Healthcare Association Infections (HCAIs) continue to be a challenge for healthcare systems worldwide.  Ireland is not unique in this regard and tackling HCAIs here continues to be a priority for the Government and for the Health Service Executive (HSE).Healthcare associated infection, including MRSA, is a challenge for all health systems across the world as healthcare becomes more intensive, complex and invasive.  In 2007, the HSE launched its strategy "Say No To Infection" for prevention and control of healthcare-associated infection.  A HSE HCAI Governance Group was established to lead on the implementation of this strategy and to monitor progress.  Local implementation teams were also established to drive change at a local level.As part of the governance and performance management regarding this issue the HSE is committed to ensuring that infection control is an integral part of clinical and corporate governance within every healthcare institution and hospital in Ireland and an acceptance that the prevention of infection is every healthcare worker's responsibility.Overcrowding in the Emergency Department is multi-factorial in origin and any solution to problems that may arise from this issue must reflect this reality.  The recently established Special Delivery Unit is the primary way I have chosen to address this.This can be achieved by improving options for patients to avoid hospital attendance and facilitating hospital discharge.  The HSE clinical care programmes including the chronic disease programmes, elective surgery, emergency medical care and acute medical programme when implemented will facilitate many aspects of this.In addition the focus of the HSE prevention of healthcare-associated infection clinical programme is to prevent cross infection by improving hand hygiene, antibiotic prescribing and indwelling device care (e.g. prevent urinary catheter and IV line infections) and monitoring compliance with National Infection Prevention and Control Standards.I have been in touch with the Health Information Quality Authority (HIQA) on this important issue of the risk of cross-infection resulting from overcrowding in accident and emergency departments in our hospitals.  The Authority's National Standards for the Prevention and Control of Healthcare Associated Infections and National Standards for Safer Better Healthcare are available to support and guide providers on the quality and safety of care they provide. These standards outline what a good, safe service looks like and what the public can expect in terms of standard of care.However, I remain concerned at the potential risk to patients if in overcrowded Emergency Departments and have discussed this with my Department and the HSE to see what further immediate action can be taken to reduce this potential risk.

Of these, almost 12,800 people were in receipt of financial support under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme.The Nursing Homes Support Scheme encompasses a Care Needs Assessment which identifies whether the individual has sufficiently high care needs to warrant nursing home care or whether their care needs can be met in the community. The purpose of the assessment is to ensure that long-term nursing home care is the most appropriate option for that particular individual.   The Care Needs Assessment is carried out by appropriate healthcare professionals appointed by the HSE. An assessment may be completed in a hospital or community setting and includes consideration of the following:the individual's ability to carry out the activities of daily living, e.g. bathing, shopping, dressing,the medical, health and personal social services being provided to the person or available to the individual at the time of the assessment and generally,the family and community support available to the individual, andthe individual's wishes and preferences.It is not possible, based on the information available, to estimate with any degree of certainty the percentage of people in nursing homes prior to the introduction of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme who may have been capable of independent living.

The HSE is not is a position to break this down further. The money in respect of Ancillary Services will be transferred to subheads B1 to B4 (the Regional subheads) and, in future, such services will be charged to these subheads. The examination of funding did not extend to the level of requirement for therapies. Therapy services are allocated having regard to demand, availability of resources and on a priority basis based on clinical need.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	730	The cost estimates for the Nursing Homes Support Scheme are underpinned by a number of assumptions, i.e. the number of people that will require long-term nursing home care during the year, the average weekly price of long-term nursing home care, the average income of older people, home ownership rates for older people, the level of married and single applicants and an average length of stay.When the scheme was originally drawn up and costed, the average length of stay, based on information available at the time, was three years. During 2010, the Department was informed that this now appeared to have increased to five years and costings were prepared on that basis for 2011. However, we are now informed that the average length of stay is approximately four years.    The Minister for Health is anxious to identify the reasons behind increase in the average length of stay in nursing homes. He is, therefore, requesting that the HSE undertake a clinical audit on the appropriateness of care and admission. The Minister is also requesting that the HSE commission an audit of circa 300 residents in public and private nursing homes to ascertain if there are differences in dependencies and in the average length of stay between both, and reasons for same. The results of these audits will inform cost estimates going forward.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	732	Following the January 2011 rotation, there are approximately 150 Non-Consultant Hospital Doctor (NCHD) vacancies. While these vacant posts include both training and service posts, the large majority of vacancies are in purely service settings in small to medium size hospitals.The HSE has taken a range of actions to address Non-Consultant Hospital Doctors (NCHDs) vacancies over the past two years, to ensure that any resulting impact on services is minimized and patient safety maintained.  In many instances these vacancies are filled by locums or by other short-term contractual arrangements. In addition, the full extent of NCHD vacancies has changed as a number of NCHD posts have been suppressed to allow introduction of additional Consultant posts as provided for under the Employment Control Framework.Approximately 450 posts will need to be filled shortly  in the context of the July 2011 rotation. This represents a significant challenge and my Department is currently engaged in discussions with the HSE and Medical Council in relation to the recruitment issues involved.I will revert to the Deputy as soon as the detailed information he has requested is received from the HSE.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	733	I propose to take Questions Nos. 380 and 400 together.I have made it clear that I expect to be briefed by the HSE regarding proposals to withdraw services from individual hospitals.While there is no plan to cease any of the current services at St. Columcille's Hospital, the configuration of services is constantly reviewed and from time to time re-arranged to improve access and quality of service and minimise risk to patients. In relation to Accident and Emergency Services, a trauma by-pass arrangement was introduced in recent years which allows for such patients to be brought directly to St. Vincent's University Hospital to ensure the most appropriate treatment.This programme of realignment of services has received recent impetus from HIQA in relation to the need to implement the recommendations from the Ennis and Mallow reports. The reports deal in particular with the type of services that can safely be provided in smaller hospitals, and with the structures required for good governance and accountability. The HSE must ensure that this happens and I will be monitoring the situation closely in conjunction with HIQA.  I can clearly assure the public that no hospitals will close, regardless of the difficult economic situation we find ourselves in. However, ongoing reform of the system may result in some changes in how care is delivered in any particular location across our health system.With regard to the Emergency Department at St Columcille's Hospital, I am in ongoing discussions with the various stakeholders in order to identify a solution to the recruitment of NCHDs nationwide.  I will have greater clarity on this issue in the next few weeks.

In addition, the Comptroller and Auditor General may undertake in-depth examinations of specific issues or general matters arising from audits, inspections or examinations carried out by his Office.However, notwithstanding the Comptroller and Auditor General's role, I have previously indicated, in the context of the recent issues surrounding the Nursing Home Support Scheme, that I will consider whether external auditors should be used to bring greater clarity in respect of that particular situation.  Further inquiries are now being made as to whether it is necessary to appoint an external auditor for this purpose.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	737	As the Deputy will be aware, the National Disability Strategy, launched in September 2004, supports and reinforces equal participation in society of people with disabilities. The Strategy comprises of a number of elements, including the Disability Act 2005; the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act 2004 and the Citizen's Information Act 2007.Under the terms of the Disability Act, six Government Departments, including the Department of Health, are required to prepare and publish Sectoral Plans, setting out the actions they will take to meet their obligations under the Act. The Department of Health and Children's Sectoral Plan was published in 2006 and was the first step in a complex process to establish a baseline for access to health services and for service delivery. In December 2009, following an extensive stakeholder consultation process, the Department finalised a Year 3 progress report. This progress report was published in February 2010, in conjunction with those of the five other Departments required to publish sectoral plans.This report comes ahead of the finalisation of a very significant strategy and policy review currently under way in my Department — the Value for Money and Policy Review of Disability Services. This review will inform the development of my Department's approach to fulfilling its commitments under the Strategy going forward. It is expected to be completed by the end of the year.

Any decision in relation to re-employment/reinstatement is a matter for the HSE once all the necessary registration requirements are complied with. The HSE have confirmed that procedures are in place in relation to the registration of health professionals who are subject to statutory registration and that these arrangements are currently under review.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	739	The key focus of the Minister for Health is to ensure that those who require nursing home care will be able to access it and, to this end, the Department estimates that almost 24,000 people will be in long-term nursing home care by year end. This would mean a net increase of around 1,700 people between now and the end of the year.In order to fund this increase, and to offset other pressures on the subhead such as increases in average length of stay, cost increases etc., the Minister identified a range of savings and income sources, one of which is a potential saving of up to €30 million in non-service related spending. This funding will come primarily from capital spending which is running significantly behind budget so far this year.

Acute bed numbers in public hospitals are counted as an average of beds available over each year, given that the number of beds available in each hospital can vary over any year for operational reasons. This data  includes acute psychiatric beds.The HSE has indicated that the latest year in respect of which national data on the average available acute hospital beds and day places has been compiled is 2010.  The data for 2010 is provisional and is subject to validation.The emphasis for the HSE in 2011 continues to be to make the most effective use of acute bed capacity through shorter length of stay, increased rates of day-of-surgery admission and more day surgery.  In this way the acute hospital system can ensure that, within the level of resources available, it facilitates the maximum number of patients with safe, effective and efficient care.YearTotal #200612,110200712,123200811,8472009*11,5382010*11,335YearTotal #20061,41820071,54520081,7372009*1,7722010*1,845# Data for 2006, 2007 and 2008 — Health in Ireland Statistics — Key Trends* Data for 2009 and 2010 supplied by BIU —  HSE  (Data for 2010 is provisional)

This includes residential care settings for older people.   Since 1 July 2009 all nursing homes, public and private, are registered under the Health Act 2007 (Registration of Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2009, as amended, by the Chief Inspector.  All nursing homes (public and private) are inspected under the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2009, as amended, and must meet the National Quality Standards for Residential Care Settings for Older People in Ireland.
The Chief Inspector has the power to refuse to register, attach conditions to a registration or cancel the registration of a designated centre in the event of non-compliance with the regulations or the standards.  There are separate criteria for designated centres which were in operation when the new regime commenced on 1 July 2009 and for new centres that have opened since that date. Designated centres which were in operation at the commencement of the new regime have up to six years from that date to meet the criteria for new centres.Any capital development, including grants for the refurbishment of nursing homes, must be considered in the context of the overall HSE Capital Plan.   In drawing up its multi-annual capital programme for the current 2011-2015 period the HSE is required to prioritise capital infrastructure projects within the overall capital funding allocation.   The HSE has submitted its draft capital plan.  This draft plan is under consideration and requires my approval together with the consent of the Minister for Finance. Details of the plan will be published by the HSE following its approval.Details of the capital investment that will be required to upgrade community hospitals and nursing homes to ensure compliance with the legal provisions on residential care will be provided by the Health Service Executive.  I have requested the Executive to reply directly to you.

#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Prelude	751	The number of referrals of elder abuse received by the HSE Elder Abuse Service in the last three years were as follows:YearsNo. of referrals2008:1,5082009:1,9162010:2,110Policy in relation to elder abuse is derived from Protecting our Future, the Working Group on Elder Abuse Report 2002, which defined and set out a framework and programme of work to address elder abuse, and the 2009 Review of that Report. The HSE's Elder Abuse Service is comprised of a dedicated staffing structure throughout the country, unified data collection, national and regional oversight mechanisms, a research facility based in UCD and awareness and training programmes. The staffing structure provides for 32 Social Workers (Senior Case Workers) and 4 Dedicated Elder Abuse Officers. 30 out of 32 Senior Case Workers (including one temporary agency officer) are in position and HSE plans to fill the remaining vacancies are well underway. Systems to manage elder abuse referrals have been set up in areas where Senior Case Worker vacancies exist. Among the responsibilities of the Senior Case Worker, in conjunction with the appropriate health service providers, is the assessment/investigation and provision of supports where necessary, in relation to suspected cases of elder abuse. The duties of Dedicated Elder Abuse Officers include overseeing, reviewing and development of policies at local and national level.At national level, the HSE publishes an annual report of the activities of the elder abuse service. The most recent report, concerning activities in 2010, was published on 15 June 2011 to coincide with World Elder Abuse Awareness Day. The report contains comprehensive information in relation to the wide range of activities undertaken by the HSE to address elder abuse in all its forms and outlines in detail the nature and scope of referrals received by the service during 2010. The report and a number of other relevant resources are available on the HSE website at http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/Find_a_Service/Older_People_Services/Elder_Abuse/ .While it is evident that those over 80 are three times more likely to experience abuse, this is a function of the increased vulnerability, diminished capacity and increased reliance on others experienced by some people over 80. As the most recent HSE Report on the Elder Abuse Services points out, elder abuse and neglect are the potential outcomes of complex interactions between a multiplicity of social, economic, health, social isolation, education, environmental and individual characteristics.The complexity of elder abuse underlines the need for a multi-agency, multifaceted approach that makes the prevention of such abuse a primary focus. It also emphasises that the responsibility for tackling elder abuse must be shared across the whole of society amongst all who are concerned with the well-being of older people in Ireland and particularly with those that are most vulnerable.  The HSE, in partnership with many statutory and non-statutory organisations, is engaged in a wide range of activities to combat elder abuse and to respond to allegations in an appropriate and sensitive manner. The National Elder Abuse Steering Committee has multi-agency and multi-disciplinary representation in order to address complex issues often beyond the scope of the HSE. Further details are available in the report referred to above.

The Deputy will be further aware of the necessity of such a review, given the poor fiscal position this State was left in due to the mismanagement of the State's finances by the outgoing Fianna Fáil led government. This position means that there will be, over the coming years, a substantial reduction in the finance available to fund capital projects. As such, the comprehensive review will examine all future capital projects and establish a set of priority projects and programmes that will support economic recovery and provide new employment opportunities. The results of this will form the basis of a new National Development Plan.The preparation of the new framework requires that my Department review all existing projects and programmes. The review will also need to take account of new funding realities. A major priority will be to ensure funding to protect and maintain investment made to date and to maintain high safety standards. This will of necessity restrict the funding for new projects with only those offering the highest return having any prospect of being prioritised.  No decision will be made on funding the design of the second phase of the western rail corridor until the capital review is complete. A new National Development Plan arising from the capital review is expected to be published in September.

The NTA is currently reviewing the small public service vehicle standards and will commence a public consultation on proposed measures this year with a view to advancing new regulations to come into force in early 2012.  As part of the review of the taxi sector announced by me on the 8th June last, the current  NTA examination of appropriate vehicle standards including the nine year rule will be taken into account in the course of the wide ranging issues to be addressed in the review.

The volume on site can vary on any given day.  The port does not accept chemicals in bulk and has advised that there are adequate procedures in place for the transportation of hazardous chemicals through the Port.Dublin Port currently has in place an Emergency Management Plan.  This plan is publicly available on Dublin Port Company's website www.dublinport.ie.  The plan covers a major fire within the port, a major oil spill, a major spill of hazardous material, a vehicle accident involving hazardous material, chemical incidents (e.g. toxic cloud) and major incidents in storage areas.  Plans for evacuation in the event of an accident are an integral component of the Emergency Plan and training is conducted annually to ensure all staff receive training in relation to their role in an emergency situation and that they are familiar with the plan.  It is the responsibility of each tenant company in Dublin Port to have in place an emergency plan for their own facility.Dublin Port is located within the Dublin City Council administrative area.  The Framework for Major Emergency Management 2006 details the emergency management process for co-ordination of response to any major incident by the Principal Response Agencies (An Garda Síochána, the Health Service Executive, and the local authorities, including fire brigade).  In September 2008 all Principal Response Agencies adopted new major emergency plans in accordance with the Framework.  The emergency services regularly carry out exercises with the Dublin Port Authority and Port Companies to test preparedness measures.

The safety standards applied are in line with International practice and deal with and all aspects of fishing vessel safety.  Specifically, it requires all fishing vessels to carry an Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon (EPIRB) in compliance with International standards in order to notify the Coast Guard of a distress situation and activate an emergency response.  Should a notification be received from a commercial supplier of a man overboard system (MoB) that an event has taken place, the Coast Guard will respond as if it has received an emergency 112 call.  Tracking information from the Guardian MoB system will not be supplied directly to the Irish Coast Guard but will be relayed by the commercial provider directly to the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) Headquarters in the United Kingdom and onwards to the Irish Authorities.  This is not considered the optimum approach in responding to an emergency situation here.The Department has been engaged in discussions with the RNLI regarding their Guardian MoB system.  This system was developed by the RNLI and two commercial companies, McMurdo and AWS.  Internationally, concerns have been expressed about such MoB systems as there is no recognised standard for them to comply with.  Without recognised standards the Department is unable to approve any such systems nor can it recommend any one supplier over another.  In accordance with International recommendations the Department has issued a Marine Notice No. 33 of 2010 — Commercially Available Locating, Tracking and Emergency Notification Devices — advising of the issues associated with such systems.The Department has no objection in principle to the voluntary carriage of non-statutory equipment like the Guardian MoB system so long as fishing vessels carry all of the legally required statutory equipment and that the voluntary carriage of non-statutory equipment does not interfere with the safety of vessels.

Under the same commencement order, Statutory Instrument No. 253 of 2011, mandatory breath testing now also applies where a member of the Gardaí is of the opinion that a driver has consumed intoxicating liquor.In addition to the breath testing provisions, the Medical Bureau of Road Safety carries out analyses on specimens of blood and urine provided by the Gardaí to determine the presence of alcohol or drugs. Since 1 July 2008, all samples found under the legal limit for alcohol were automatically tested by the Bureau for the presence of a drug or drugs. In addition, Gardaí can also request that a test for drugs be undertaken where the alcohol level is above the legal limit.

Previous to that the functions were undertaken by the Department of Transport and the Department of Tourism, Culture and Sport. The estimates and expenditure relating to these functions is set out in two publications — the Revised Estimates Volume for Public Service Expenditure (REV) and the Appropriation Accounts. The REV sets out the estimated expenditure for the current year and the provisional outturn for the previous year and is usually presented to the Dáil and published early in the year. The Appropriation Account sets out the Department's previous year's actual spend alongside the final estimate and is usually published in August.A REV has been published for the years 2007 to 2010, with the 2011 REV due to be published shortly. The Appropriation Account has been published for the years 2007 to 2009. I will arrange for my Office to forward copies of the relevant extracts to you.

It should be noted that this represents a considerable departure from previous practice. The practice of my predecessors with regard to the state agencies was to seek the disallowance of questions relating to areas for which government agencies have been delegated authority by primary legislation. This was incredibly frustrating for deputies who were seeking to hold the Government to account.The Programme for Government explicitly recognises this and contains the following commitment:"We propose a radical extension of the parliamentary question system, so that it shall be a statutory duty on any body established by or under statute, or with a majority ownership or funding by the State, to submit to the same parliamentary questions regime as applies to Government departments.  This will involve a liability to provide answers to written questions within a specified number of Dáil sitting days.  (We will however recognise the special position of bodies with a commercial mandate operating at arm's length from Government.)"I understand that this proposal is currently being advanced.  However, rather than wait for these changes to be implemented I sought to be proactive on this matter.  Given the framework of legislation that underpins the relationship between departmental agencies, the Department and myself as Minister, it would not be appropriate or possible for questions directed to an agency to be answered by myself as Minister.  Rather, I brought in a system whereby any questions directed to such an agency would be responded to noting that the question was a matter for a government agency, stating that the government agency was being forwarded the question and that if no answer was received within ten working days, to inform my office of such.  I understand that questions being directed to agencies are being responded to within that timeframe in the vast majority of instances.If the Deputy has any suggestions to make with regard to how this interim process is working, I would be grateful if she could make them known to myself or my office.  I am keen to facilitate Deputies to the greatest extent possible in seeking to hold the Government and its agencies to account.
