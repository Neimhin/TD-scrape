          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2">The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to review, on compassionate grounds, the decision to refuse visitor visas to persons (details supplied) and if he will outline the further requirements which must be met to achieve a positive decision in this case.</p>
          <p eId="para_3">I have also received notice from Senator Feighan of the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to indicate whether the function of the interim registrars who register births, marriages and deaths, especially in the Western Health Board area, will continue to operate in the future and if not, to outline the redundancy package that will be afforded to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_5">I have also received notice from Senator McHugh of the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_6">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to outline what plans are envisaged in the case of St. Eunan's College, Letterkenny, County Donegal, which is currently at stage one, under the 2004 schools building programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_7">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</p>

          <p eId="para_9">It was remiss of me yesterday not to formally thank Senator Brennan for his excellent initiative some weeks ago which led to the visit to the House of the distinguished visitor, Mr. John Hume, MEP. I formally thank Senator Brennan on behalf of this side of the House for the proposal which received all-party support.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_11">Yesterday's proceedings were an excellent example of the work of this House. It was a great honour to hear John Hume's contribution to the House. We were all enriched and benefited as a result of the process.</p>
          <p eId="para_12">Will the Leader agree that wiser counsel should prevail in respect of the ongoing row and stand-off in Ballinamore concerning the local farming community and the Teagasc authorities? Will she agree it is now time for the Minister for Agriculture and Food to intervene in the dispute? Leitrim has suffered greatly in recent years. It is a small county, with a small population. Only recently we saw that the electoral commission wants to divide the county in two, in preference to the whole notion of balanced regional development and ensuring that facilities like the centre in Ballinamore, which I understand is a research facility for the whole region, should remain there. It is important to put on record that the farming representatives were against moving from Ballinamore. They made that point known vociferously and repeatedly when Teagasc made the decision. There is an argument here for balanced regional development and for ensuring that peripheral parts of the country, which have these services, should keep them in their community. We should support the farmers on this occasion.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_14">I make that point as someone who comes from an urban background. I saw the scenes that occurred in Ballinamore yesterday. Teagasc should stand back from this and support the farmers and their communities because we want to ensure that farming communities have the support of the entire country in terms of the difficult industry they are trying to prosper throughout the country.</p>

        <speech by="#JoeOToole" eId="spk_8">
          <from>Mr. O’Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_15">I agree fully with the points made by Senator Brian Hayes, and I want to raise a related issue. IBEC, with which I do not normally agree, produced an excellent report recently about the lack of investment in industry in the west and mid-west. I ask the Leader to make time available to discuss that report.</p>
          <p eId="para_16">I have raised in this House many times before the importance of the rail link between Sligo and Limerick, via Galway, and the need for a rail head at Shannon. These matters are crucially important to the communications of the area. Regional development is only a joke if we simply discuss it in this House, if the investment is not made where it should be made and if the west and mid-west do not have priority. I raise such issues because if they do not fit neatly into anyone's constituency, they tend not to be raised.</p>
          <p eId="para_17">There is a broader issue here at which I ask people from all sides of the House to look. It affects everyone's constituency to some extent, and also affects all rural community development. This crucial matter relates to the document on rural housing to be published today by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. We have previously expressed our views on this matter in the House. An excellent document was circulated to Members of both Houses over the past week. It came from the rural housing group in Clare and pointed out that there seems to be a conflicting stance by the architects' groups in Ireland who on the one hand object to one-off housing and, on the other, are advertising their services in order to encourage it. I would like to know where we stand and where they stand on this matter. This House should discuss these matters together. The denuding of the countryside and the lack of investment in those areas are connected.</p>

        <speech by="#BrendanRyan" eId="spk_15">
          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_24">I would welcome a debate on regional development. All of these issues — the gradual closing by Teagasc of the smaller stations, the closing of rural post offices and the decline in so many areas — relate to regional infrastructural development. We have a problem in this country in that the major funding body, or determining body, will always say that certain things cannot be justified because the demand does not exist. They say that infrastructure should follow the market, but once the market has decided to do something, they say they cannot do it. One example is the Dublin metro project, which has become too expensive. We must accept the need to invest in infrastructure in order to guide the market rather than to follow it. That extends from Teagasc maintaining smaller support services in more rural areas, to the western rail corridor, and to other aspects. We need to debate seriously our attitude to infrastructure, which leads the market rather than follows it. Perhaps there is a fundamental difference between us.</p>
          <p eId="para_25">Given some of the remarks I have made here, I suppose I should be grateful that nobody has threatened me with ending up in the Liffey.</p>

          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_27">Am I that ineffective? I am not sure. Yesterday,  ICTU and a number of voluntary organisations launched a sportswear campaign in an effort to get all the major sporting equipment multinationals to agree to a code of practice which would not involve child labour or the exploitation of labour in developing countries in the run up to the Olympics, when the market for such goods will be huge. I ask the Leader to allow us time at some stage to debate the issue of international trading standards, in particular child labour and the so-called free trade zones in many developing countries where nobody can investigate what rights workers have. China is a particular example. As a contribution to the overall issue of development, a debate on minimum labour standards would be useful.</p>

          <from>Mr. Mooney</from>
          <p eId="para_31">I am also encouraged by the comments of Senator Brian Hayes because I wanted to bring to the attention of the Leader what is happening. I stand by the farmers of Leitrim and applaud what they are doing. We have been involved in this debate for the past 18 months. It is not about any sense of victimhood on the part of the people of County Leitrim and the west. We do not want a hand-out but a hand up. This is what the call for a debate on the spatial strategy and regional development is all about. There is a sense of disconnection, and that is what the demonstration in Ballinamore is about. People feel helpless in the face of this increasing globalisation, and decisions being taken far away by people who could not care less.</p>
          <p eId="para_32">The division of the county is another example of that. I do not want to come into this House crying, because what is happening in County Leitrim over the past ten years has been remarkable. We have achieved a great deal and are advancing on various fronts. We have a young, vibrant population who are no longer leaving the country as I had to do.</p>

          <p eId="para_34">I may seem passionate and emotional about this, but it is an opportunity for the House to hold a debate about what is happening in rural Ireland, about a disconnection, a split and a division between east and west, about a proud people who will no longer accept what is going on.</p>

          <from>Mr. Finucane</from>
          <p eId="para_38">I support Senator O'Toole in his call for a debate following the IBEC report on the mid-west region. Speaking on the Aer Lingus Bill last night, I touched on many of the relevant areas. I also welcome the Government decision to proceed with guidelines regarding rural one-off houses. If one talks to the planners, one learns that in every county there has been a dramatic escalation in planning applications, mainly because people are trying to avoid the planning and development fees being introduced, which is understandable. In many counties, however, there are inconsistencies. In Kerry, section four motions operate. In Limerick, there is thankfully no policy regarding such motions. There will have to be consistency in the guidelines, and uniformity throughout the country. The guidelines being laid down are extremely important, and we will assess the benefits they bring and the impact they will make on rural housing in Ireland in the future.</p>

          <p eId="para_39">As a co-founder of the Irish Rural Dwellers Association, I think this is a good and historic day for rural Ireland. The new guidelines the Minister has announced are in many ways a triumph of democracy over uncontrolled bureaucracy. Those people who live in an ivory tower, handing down dictates without a mandate to the ordinary people of Ireland, now have their answer. They seem to view rural Ireland as some kind of primitive reservation, a picnic venue they and their friends visit on a warm Sunday afternoon.</p>

          <p eId="para_60">I join Senator O'Toole and others in calling for a debate on the IBEC report. The title for such a debate should be "balanced regional development". Some concerns have been raised, particularly in regard to the level of job losses. Not only have jobs been lost, but no job creation has taken place in tandem with that in the mid-west region. The numbers are quite staggering. There is great concern in the region, particularly in regard to some of the changes taking place in aviation policy which we discussed yesterday in the context of the Aer Lingus Bill. Some of the job losses expected in Aer Lingus in Shannon will have an impact together with the advent of open skies. It is important we have a debate as soon as possible and perhaps invite the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to the House to discuss this matter because it relates to her Department. There is a concern about State agencies as well.</p>

There were two cases recently where two companies used psychiatric illnesses in a derogatory way to promote the sale of their goods.

The television company advertised plastic surgery as a way of overcoming depression and the telephone company advertised a gentleman in a strait-jacket in regard to Eircom's call increases.

In addition, the section 23 allowances have renewed urban areas, while the urban renewal scheme has also played a part. The dock site is an example to the country and to Europe generally.</p>

          <p eId="para_120">The visit of Mr. Hume to the House yesterday proved to be a very good occasion. I was particularly delighted by the presence of so many Members.</p>
          <p eId="para_121">I understand that the board of Teagasc took the decision to close the research facility at Ballinamore and relocate it elsewhere. That is not good for the people in Leitrim who wanted it left in their area, but we must face the reality that the Teagasc board has taken a firm decision on the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_122">Senator O'Toole mentioned the IBEC report on the mid-west region, which I have not had a chance to read. I will endeavour to arrange a debate on that report. The Senator suggested that it could be combined with a debate on the initiative concerning one-off rural housing but the difficulty is that two separate Ministers are concerned. Many Senators have sought a debate on the one-off housing issue, so we can discuss the IBEC report on the mid-west on another occasion.</p>
          <p eId="para_123">Senator Ryan mentioned regional development and, in particular, separate parts of infrastructural development, such as the western rail corridor, which should receive due recognition. In the run up to the Athens Olympics, ICTU has done well to highlight the use of child labour in the manufacture of sports apparel. We blithely purchase many such items and find later that they have been produced by people living in very deprived communities. It would provide the subject matter of a very good debate in the context of international trading standards. The global economy is all very well, but all too often the well off prosper while the poor get poorer.</p>
          <p eId="para_124">Senator Mooney exhibited his passion, quite properly, for his own county of Leitrim, and the sense of disconnection that people feel. I do not deny that is the case. When decisions are taken outside one's ambit, it can lead to a sense of disconnection given the language that is used to convey such decisions. I understand that the decision has been made, however, and I do not see how it can be changed.</p>
          <p eId="para_125">Senator Finucane spoke about the IBEC report on the mid-west region and he welcomed the proposal for one-off rural housing, as we all do. The difficulty will be to get the balance right on that matter. We could all pursue the issue of one-off housing and then find that some damage has been done as a result. It will be difficult to strike a balance. I will invite the Minister, Deputy Cullen, to attend the House next week, if we can arrange a slot for him. That issue appears to be the one most immediately requiring our attention. Senator Norris has the opposite point of view to all that.</p>

          <p eId="para_142">He spoke about staff problems but there is no need for additional local authority responsibility in this matter because the Minister is providing the guidelines. A change of heart is needed in the minds of many of those officials, but that will be much harder to bring about because they have become the new kings of the counties.</p>
          <p eId="para_143">Senator McCarthy rightly deplored the use of psychiatric illnesses to promote particular products in advertising. That is just appalling. Imagine if one suffered from such an illness to see it portrayed as promoting a positive aspect of a product.</p>
          <p eId="para_144">The Senator referred to county development plans. They will vary but local authorities should not wait. For example, Westmeath County Council will not adopt a new county development plan for another three years and officials will try to wait until the next plan is agreed. Local authorities adopt such plans at different times but the officials will have their way in the intervening period. The Senator believes they should be updated immediately to encompass the take-up of one-off rural housing.</p>

          <from>Mr. P. Burke</from>
          <p eId="para_167">I welcome the Minister back to the House. On Tuesday I mentioned that the Minister might encounter problems with the GAA if gardaí joined the Police Service of Northern Ireland. However, the GAA held a special congress in 2001 which changed the rule in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_168">The Minister stated local authorities would have a say through county development boards under chapter 4. That is not the right approach to take. The local authority itself should have a say. If the Garda Commissioner attended a public meeting with local authority members, a worthwhile and useful debate on policing issues could take place. I would welcome that. Most county development board members are not elected and those who are may not be from populated areas in which controversies arise. Using the local authority itself may be the better option and I hope that will be the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_169">The Minister has promised 2,000 extra gardaí but we have not seen them yet. Under section 13, the Government can appoint such numbers of persons as it sees fit to the ranks of superintendent and chief superintendent of the Garda Síochána. I am disappointed the Minister is politicising the Garda by providing that positions, other than the Garda Commissioner, will be filled by ministerial appointees. Commissioners and superintendents sit on internal interview boards for promotions to sergeant and so on and such politicisation could filter through the ranks.</p>
          <p eId="para_170">The section also provides that "The Garda Commission may appoint, subject to and in accordance with the regulations, such numbers of persons as he or she sees fit to the rank of Garda Sergeant and Inspector." Does that mean he or she will have sole responsibility for deciding the force's strength? According to section 13(2), that appears to be the case. I seek clarification on those few issues.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaschalMooney" eId="spk_131">
          <from>Mr. Mooney</from>
          <p eId="para_171">I welcome the Minister. As an amateur student of history, it is significant that the Minister is taking this legislation. I am indebted to Gregory Allen for a number of extracts in my contribution from his book, <i>The Garda Síochána</i>. The Minister’s grand uncle, Eoin MacNeill, was the first Minister for Education but he had a central role in the structure and establishment of the Garda. He was involved in agreeing the insignia on the cap badge of the Garda uniform and the name of the force as the civic guards. On the transfer of power it was suggested that the force be referred to as the people’s force, which was a banal and nondescript title. The other two giants of that era who were mainly responsible for providing and creating the force as it is today were Arthur Griffith and Michael Collins.</p>
          <p eId="para_172">Some of the ideas contained in the Minister's Bill, specifically in relation to the involvement of elected representatives at local level, are not new concepts but go back as far as Grattan's Parliament. During the riots which followed the declaration of independence by Grattan's Parliament in 1782, when there was an <i>ad hoc</i> policing arrangement in the city of Dublin, Grattan made the following comment on the ramshackle system of unpaid parish constables and night-watchmen charged with keeping the peace in Dublin:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_173">If ever a city entertained an odium capable of being ascertained by numerical calculation the city of Dublin entertains such a hatred for this institution. No measure, no expense, no enormity of administration has ever excited discontent so strong or so general as this abominable establishment.</p>
          <p eId="para_174">As the abominable establishment was rejected by the population it was replaced, in 1795, by an unarmed civic guard under the supervision of the Lord Mayor and the Corporation of Dublin. Control by the local authority, however, was short lived but the principle of unarmed police in the capital city survived as a benefit of Grattan's Parliament to be enjoyed by the citizens of the modern Irish State. It goes back that far.</p>
          <p eId="para_175">The symbolic importance of Grattan's Parliament has not always been acknowledged. It was an all island parliament, despite its limited franchise. I am particularly pleased by these linkages with history and that we now have legislation which updates all the legislation going back to the foundation of the State. This is the most significant legislation relating to the Garda, its management, its structures, its political obligations and the Minister's political obligations. As it is being taken through by the Minister, Deputy McDowell, whose family has had such an important and significant role in the formation of the State, those aspects of this Bill, irrespective of its legislative dimension, should be recorded. I applaud the Minister and I know that he too has a sense of history and is aware of much of what I have said.</p>
          <p eId="para_176">One aspect of the policing issue bothers me. All public representatives, in the course of our work, come in contact with the Garda Síochána at all levels. My experience of the Garda through childhood, adulthood and in the political process has been of courteous and diligent men and women of the utmost integrity who have a real vocation for the job they do. I do not know how they sustain such a level of excellence and professionalism in the face of the enormous changes which have taken place in society.</p>
          <p eId="para_177">The Minister is aware that the media recently focused on a drug problem in Longford. Gardaí working in the midlands in recent weeks expressed to me a sense of great frustration. They have been able to identify drug pushers and criminal elements who are exploiting young people. They have arrested these people and brought them before the District Court. However, in a significant number of cases these people immediately apply for, what I believe is called, High Court bail. Having been sentenced in the lower courts they engage expensive lawyers, come to Dublin, immediately apply to the High Court and a judge based in the city automatically grants them bail. Surely there is something inherently wrong in this system. I will be grateful if the Minister will clarify his views on this practice and tell us if there is anything he can do, as the political master. I appreciate that this is a judicial matter, that there is a separation of powers and that the Minister's actions may be somewhat limited. In championing due process and taking actions which were not always seen as popular, the Minister has been courageous above and beyond the call of duty. I applaud him for that. Irrespective of political views, the legacy he will leave as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is one of which we will all be proud.</p>
          <p eId="para_178">Surely it is wrong that gardaí are being thwarted and frustrated in their efforts. Gardaí are successful in detecting criminals on the ground, due process is being carried through by the judges on the ground and yet a legal loophole allows criminals to abuse the system and be back on the streets and feeding young people with drugs. This loophole is used by other criminals; it is not confined to drug dealers. There is a sense of frustration among Garda officers across the country and I hope the Minister can do something about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_179">The Minister's initiative in adding an extra dimension to policing at local level by the establishment of committees which will involve locally elected politicians and the Garda is welcomed by me and my colleagues in public office. This is not a new concept but one which fell into disuse. We are an extremely centralised bureaucracy. This was noted recently when communism and the Stalinist ethos collapsed in the east. In Irish governance decisions are taken by the Executive, proposed to Parliament and passed by Parliament because the Executive Government has a parliamentary majority. We have a very centralised form of Government. The Minister is shedding light into that dark area. This issue should have been addressed decades ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_180">This new system has been operated successfully by our neighbours in the United Kingdom. In the United States police officers are publicly elected officials, at all levels up to the Attorney General, the highest law officer in the state. In Ireland, we are in the icy grip of a centralised bureaucracy. The Minister has loosened these bonds and his action will result in better policing.</p>
          <p eId="para_181">Greater commitment and loyalty to the work of policing will be generated if ordinary citizens know that a process of redress is being established and that complaints will be investigated. The existing complaints procedures are not incorrect but they are flawed. The Minister has made that point repeatedly and I will not labour it.</p>
          <p eId="para_182">The public dimension the Minister has added to this legislation is vital. I hope local authorities will grasp this opportunity and involve themselves in policing, now that the guidelines have been placed on a statutory footing. This is not an opportunity for local politicians to have a go at the gardaí or to grandstand in the local media. I hope there will be a sense of partnership, as in the philosophy which guided the founding fathers of this State.</p>
          <p eId="para_183">The Prendeville committee of 1922, anticipating the exemplary role the Garda Síochána was to play in the life of the nation, said the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_184">Above all, the recruit had to be taught that he was the servant and not the master of the people. He must also be made fully to understand that he is now enforcing laws made by his own countrymen, who have the welfare of their country at heart and that the utmost loyalty, obedience and devotion to duty will be demanded.</p>
          <p eId="para_185">The Garda Síochána has responded magnificently to that challenge during the past 80 years and I hope that those who will now be given the task of entering a partnership at local level will rise similarly to the challenge. I commend the legislation to the House.</p>

          <from>Mr. O’Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_186">I welcome the Minister and compliment him on introducing a Bill that is creative and goes into new areas. I hope it works. The Minister was present throughout the Second Stage debate to hear the very interesting points made in Members' contributions and I look forward to his reply. However, let me apologise at this stage because I will not be present for it, but I will look very closely at it.</p>
          <p eId="para_187">I would like to hear the Minister's views on the following points. The decision to root the force in local communities is a brilliant idea. Many spoke of the importance of the Garda presence in the local community when they were growing up. I remember in the old days it was a requirement of the Garda Síochána, and it still is, that a crucial aspect of its work was to improve its local knowledge. The minute by minute engagement of the garda on the beat with the community was lessened with the introduction of patrol cars. Murders are very few and far between but, in the old days, the local garda would have known all the information required, although he may not have been able to get a conviction. The world has changed in that sense, but this Bill brings it back to the local community and the local authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_188">However, it would be a worry if the wrong people became involved, for example, people who would try to make political capital from it or others who do not have a clear view of the world. I do not have an answer, but it should be absolutely stressed, and I accept the Bill provides for this, that the policing committee has an advisory role. The only proactive word in section 32 is in subsection (2)(<i>d</i>) — “co-ordinate the activities of local policing fora.” There is nothing wrong with that, but it should be made absolutely clear that the role is analogous to a school inspector, who is not entitled to give direct orders. That is the sense of what is in the Bill, but it is important that it is understood. The intelligence that the local fora will provide will help hugely. The involvement of local authorities, which is not new in Europe or in the US, is also very positive.</p>
          <p eId="para_189">A garda is obliged to take an oath that he or she will not belong to "any political party or secret society whatsoever". Is that word used in the reflexive and intended to reflect on political parties? I wonder do we need the word "whatsoever", as it seems to give a poor impression of political parties. I am not a member of one, so I can speak from a disinterested point of view. What is a secret society? Will the Minister deal with this in his reply? Can one say for definite that the local garda will not be a member of the Knights of Columbanus?</p>

          <from>Mr. O’Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_191">I am sorry to upset a Member on the far side and on my own side as well. I would be reassured to know that gardaí were not members. I know that there is a connection between police forces in Europe and the masons, which has bothered many people and has been stopped in some countries. Will the Minister confirm that it would be inappropriate for a garda, having taken this oath, to be a member of the Knights of Columbanus also? Should we simply insert a definition of a secret society? I am not sure what a secret society is; we may all have different views.</p>

          <from>Mr. O’Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_193">Let us think about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_194">The Bill provides for the appointment by the Government of persons to the ranks of deputy commissioner and assistant commissioner and chief superintendent and superintendent. It is valid that the Government may do this and I do not have a difficulty with it. If one reads the Civil Service legislation, one will see that until recently, a civil servant at the lowest level effectively could not be sacked without a Government decision. There is nothing new in this provision, but I would like to see the clause that applies to appointments by the Garda Commissioner inserted so that appointments by Government would be "subject to and in accordance with the regulations". The legislation should require that the Government go through a process and then take a decision. The Minister is indicating that he will take that on board. I compliment the Government and the Minister on the appointment of the Garda Commissioner, who is a superb person for the job, as he is utterly committed and inspires trust and confidence without being in front of the cameras every second day.</p>
          <p eId="para_195">Section 35 provides that the Garda Commissioner shall be the Accounting Officer. My recall of the Ministers and Secretaries Act 1924 is that the Secretary General of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is the overall Accounting Officer and is also the Accounting Officer for the funding of other bodies, including the Garda Síochána. The Minister indicates that this represents a change. In other words, the Garda Commissioner will account for the funding directly to the Minister. That is very helpful and is a cleaner and more controlled process. I welcome the proposal of an audit committee. There is a vagueness — perhaps that is as it should be — about who should be a member of the audit committee. I am not sure whether it needs more discussion. It is crucial that there is an audit committee and Members would feel more secure if they were made more aware of the operations of the audit committees in different Departments.</p>
          <p eId="para_196">There are inherent contradictions in section 17 which prohibits membership of a trade union by a member of the Garda Síochána and I have looked at this provision in all sorts of ways. I see Senator Mansergh smiling to himself, thinking, "He would, wouldn't he?" In many European countries, it is not unusual that the police are trade union members, for example, in Denmark and Holland. Section 17(3) states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_197">A member of the Garda Síochána shall not be or become a member of any trade union or association (other than an association established under this section or section 13 of the Garda Síochána Act 1924)</p>
          <p eId="para_198">A garda cannot become a member of an association on the one hand, though he or she can if it is one which accords with the provisions here. The Bill provides that an association must be independent and not associated with any body or person outside the Garda Síochána. My father was a founder member of the initial Garda representative body, the predecessor of the GRA, and I have had a lifelong interest in this.</p>

          <from>Mr. O’Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_200">I have no problem with the GRA and my comments are not meant critically. The GRA is a member of the ICPSA which is a nominating body for the Seanad's labour panel. While I see nothing wrong with the active role the GRA has always played in the ICPSA, I cannot see how it is amenable to the legislation.</p>

          <from>Mr. M. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_201">It does not have as its object the control or influence of pay, pensions or conditions of service in the Garda Síochána.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeOToole" eId="spk_140">
          <from>Mr. O’Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_202">That is the second element which refers to trade unions of which gardaí cannot be members. The subsection above means the GRA itself must be independent of and cannot be associated with a body or persons outside the Garda Síochána. At the moment, the GRA has full membership of the ICPSA which is not amenable to the provisions of the Bill. I would be happy to hear the Minister tell me that is not the case, but I do not expect he will. It is an issue to be examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_203">I do not understand the difference between the various bodies. I was a member of a trade union which is called the Irish National Teachers Organisation rather than the Irish National Teachers' Union. Another well known teaching union is called the Association of Secondary Teachers, Ireland. I presume the term "trade union" in the Bill refers to a clear definition of "trade union" in other legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_204">I welcome this positive, progressive and creative Bill. It has the potential to restore confidence in the police force. The connections it seeks to make between the Garda and local communities and local authorities is very welcome. I hope the legislation works. We should all try to ensure it does. I was delighted to listen to a positive debate in which Opposition Members complimented the Minister. It is what the House is best at. I have raised a number of issues and I have no doubt the Minister will consider them. If changes need to be made, I look forward to seeing the Minister's amendments.</p>

          <from>Dr. Mansergh</from>
          <p eId="para_205">I welcome the Minister and this important and enlightened legislation in which he is entitled to take some pride. It is a tribute and a positive reflection on the officials of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform who are sometimes unfairly impugned in this House. The Department has changed a great deal since the 1960s and 1970s. I had the privilege of working with many of its officials during negotiations on the peace process. I hold the Department in high regard as, if I may be parochial, do the people of Tipperary who look forward to welcoming some of its staff and branches in due course.</p>

        <speech by="#JoeOToole" eId="spk_142">
          <from>Mr. O’Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_206">That is parochial.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DrMartinMansergh" eId="spk_143">
          <from>Dr. Mansergh</from>
          <p eId="para_207">A few specific points arise from reading the Bill. Obviously, section 7 is very important in that it provides an overall definition of the functions of the Garda Síochána. I query the wording of section 4 which provides that in performing its functions the Garda Síochána shall have regard to the importance of upholding human rights. Why does the section not provide simply that the Garda Síochána shall have a duty to uphold human rights? The provision as drafted strikes me as a little mealy-mouthed and cautious. To be historical, the concept of human rights goes back to the late 18th century and the Declaration of the Rights of Man at the beginning of the French Revolution. At that time, rights were seen very much in the context of the executive power of the state, the conditions under which it could detain people, try them and, possibly, put them to death. While the last of these is not relevant here, I wonder, nevertheless, why the provisions of section 4 are not more straightforward.</p>
          <p eId="para_208">Senator O'Toole referred to section 17 and raised the issue of trade unions and the Garda Representative Association. It is important to place the Garda and the Defence Forces in a separate category in this instance. Members of these organisations do not have the right to strike in the way others do, though that has been subverted to a degree through what is termed "blue flu". The law in this area has not prevented spokesmen for Garda and Defence Forces representative associations from being, on occasion, as forthright in their public comments as any trade unionist. It does not detract from the rights of the organisations given their specific circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_209">Section 15 makes provisions in respect of secret societies. The term "secret societies" always conjures up for me 19th century Italian nationalism and the <i>Carabiniere</i>. Is there a legislative definition of “secret society”? Has the further complication of transfers with the Police Service of Northern Ireland been considered? In my understanding of the PSNI, membership of societies must be registered. The force includes masons and I do not know whether the Orange Order counts as a secret society. Probably, it does not. If members of the PSNI are transferred to the Garda, it is possible that some of them will belong to a secret society, albeit with registered membership. Does this create any difficulty in terms of the legislation? Perhaps the matter should be examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_210">The roles of the Minister and the Garda Commissioner are very well defined in the Bill. It is important in a democracy to ensure the Government has the right to point out priorities. This should be done in consultation with the police force to avoid practical difficulties. It is a welcome step forward to provide in the Bill that the Commissioner is the Accounting Officer of the Garda Síochána. There was a period in the Defence Forces and the Garda when every minor decision which involved the spending of money had to be double-checked by a junior or middle ranking official of the relevant Department. I am glad that is no longer the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_211">Section 39 of the Bill relates to statistics. Without suggesting the Minister has a different view, it is important that statistics are trusted and released on an automatic basis. It has been the case here and in other jurisdictions that crime statistics have been used to make political points. Crime statistics must be as trustworthy as the economic data we receive from the Central Statistics Office. That is not to suggest that is not case currently.</p>
          <p eId="para_212">An important element of the legislation is the provision resulting from the Good Friday Agreement and the Patten report whereby members of the Police Service of Northern Ireland can serve in the Garda and <i>vice versa.</i> It is a positive and welcome development.</p>
          <p eId="para_213">Section 55 has given rise to some comment such as what information members can release. This seems to be an aspect informed by experience of the incidents that gave rise to the Nally report. I declare an interest in that I was one of the people impugned by certain allegations. It is right that that situation be straightened out because there is no doubt that allegations which have no foundation have caused great distress and concern to relatives in a situation where the people involved have had to answer certain claims of their own. I do not want to go into any more detail but it is right that that situation be corrected.</p>
          <p eId="para_214">The section dealing with the ombudsman is an important part of the legislation. The Minister was right, after some hesitation, to adopt the name, otherwise there would be much fruitless debate about terminology and not about the substance. It is good to have a three person ombudsman commission. It is not modelled exactly on the position in Northern Ireland but the background and the position in Northern Ireland is very different. Essentially, we have a society where there is, broadly speaking — I do not want to over-generalise — a consensus behind the Garda Síochána although this does not detract from the fact that there may be difficulties with the Garda Síochána in certain communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_215">I warmly welcome the provision for committees between the Garda and local authorities. That ought to include town councils as well as county councils. To take my home county as an example, the situation in Tipperary town may be quite different from that in Carrick-on-Suir or Clonmel. There should be an opportunity for a town council to have a formal system of liaison from time to time with the Garda Síochána. That provision is enormously beneficial and, perhaps, takes a leaf from the Patten report although it is not as formal as policing partnerships. We have our own needs and culture.</p>
          <p eId="para_216">My colleague, Senator Mooney, referred to history. Some people date modern policing in Ireland not to Grattan's Parliament but to 1813 in the troubled barony of Middlethird in County Tipperary.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulCoghlan" eId="spk_144">
          <from>Mr. Coghlan</from>
          <p eId="para_217">I will not be as ordered as Senator Mansergh who went through the Bill sequentially. I agree with his latter point about town councils and I am sure we will hear more on that issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_218">I welcome the Minister. I agree with the Bill's two main objectives, namely, reforming the law relating to the administration and management of the Garda Síochána and providing for the establishment of an independent body, to be known as the Garda Síochána ombudsman commission. I am glad the Minister opted for a commission rather than an inspectorate which he was toying with earlier. As Senator Mansergh said, that has removed all the red herrings from the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_219">I compliment the Minister on the painstaking work he and his officials have put into the Bill and for coming before the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights last September. I was substituting for another member of the committee on the day when the Minister outlined his thoughts and plans as they existed at that time. From what I recollect of that meeting, a considerable amount of further work has been put into improving the Bill. I appreciate that further refinements, if necessary, can be made on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_220">I compliment the Minister on introducing this Bill in the Seanad. I recognise it is a major legislative measure, given that the last major enactment in this area was in 1924. The Minister's predecessors gladly allowed this cup to pass their lips. Obviously it is long overdue.</p>
          <p eId="para_221">We live in the age of OTA — openness, transparency and accountability — which is now the new god. It is of paramount importance that the public has trust in the Garda Síochána and also that the process by which complaints against members are investigated is trusted. In common with most Members, I have had agreeable relationships with the local Garda and I have the height of praise for the vast majority of the force. Not only are they law abiding citizens but, by and large, they do their jobs well.</p>
          <p eId="para_222">This Bill, once enacted, will be the new bible for the force. I appreciate everyone's desire, starting with the Minister who has taken this important initiative in bringing forward this comprehensive measure, to get everything right. The Minister deserves our thanks for his attempt to bring clarity to the roles and functions of both the Minister and the Garda Síochána. That operational responsibility, including financial control, should be assigned to the management of the force, is welcome. It is important that there be democratic accountability. That the Commissioner will appear before the Committee of Public Accounts is welcome. I am not sure if that is a requirement or if he will appear as Accounting Officer of the force. I appreciate the Minister and his officials spent much time in examining the police complaints models in other jurisdictions. Like other jurisdictions, the Minister reminds us that the Garda Síochána functions also as our intelligence service, a matter about which we are not used to thinking.</p>
          <p eId="para_223">The Minister stated that the Human Rights Commission submission deserves particular mention. I am glad he has weighted carefully the additional points it raised in broadly welcoming the Bill. The Minister is accountable to the Houses of the Oireachtas and on that basis is entitled to set policing priorities. I welcome the fact that comprehensive reporting requirements will be put in place, including the plans of the Commissioner, and the assessment he or she will make. That every directive issued by the Minister will have to be approved by the Government and laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas is welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_224">As I did at the joint committee in September when the Minister appeared before it, I welcome the initiative which provides for co-operation with local authorities and the necessary arrangements for obtaining the views of the public. Joint policing committees with the Garda Síochána and local authority representation will prove invaluable. I trust this will strengthen policing at local level. I welcome the statutory basis provided for in the Bill for the appointment of volunteer members of the Garda Síochána. Many committed members of the public would appreciate, if circumstances warrant, the opportunity to play their part in such a force. I welcome the provision to provide a statutory basis for such a force.</p>
          <p eId="para_225">The Minister has properly laid great stress on ensuring openness, transparency and public confidence in the investigation of complaints.</p>
          <p eId="para_226">Members would agree with him on that and with his provision for an ombudsman commission to replace the existing Garda Complaints Board.</p>
          <p eId="para_227">There have been too many instances of complaints against individual members of the force, which is why it does not command public confidence, although I have already paid tribute to the force. I am glad the ombudsman commission will retain ultimate control over every investigation and that its statutory powers will be the same as those applicable in Northern Ireland. In their daily policing duties, most members of the force perform in a highly admirable and commendable way. It is always a pity when a few bad apples tarnish the image of the force. There is, by and large, huge goodwill towards the Garda Síochána and the Bill will help to strengthen the public support and trust which is so necessary in our democracy.</p>
          <p eId="para_228">Consultation takes place on an informal basis between the Minister and the Garda Commissioner, although I am not sure how this will continue. All sorts of arrangements are built into the Bill and I look forward to hearing more on this. There is a feeling, accurate or not, that issues in this regard have led to some of the past abuses — I am thinking of the Dowra incident, and Allihies in my area was mentioned in connection with another incident.</p>
          <p eId="para_229">Senator Terry raised several questions on individual sections and I look forward to the Minister's response. I note that the Minister recently agreed in the Dáil with the Fine Gael survey which suggested that many people do not bother to report crime. I hope that will improve as a result of this measure.</p>
          <p eId="para_230">The involvement of local authorities is to be welcomed, and is one of the issues to which the Minister received a positive response when he appeared last September before the Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights. The change will lead to greater public support. Some Members have suggested further refinement be made on Committee Stage and, if it is needed, I am sure the Minister will give it due consideration.</p>
          <p eId="para_231">In many areas, meetings are already held, perhaps annually, between members of the Garda, local authorities and others to review local traffic arrangements and so on. As a result of the provisions in the Bill, gardaí will be better able to liaise with local residents' associations and public representatives. This is what the Minister had in mind and I hope it will be the result. In this way, anti-social behaviour can be dealt with in particular areas and on particular housing estates, because local councillors are very well informed. It is important, as Senator Mansergh noted, that town councils are involved. County councils would often not have the necessary insight into particular estates and areas on the fringes of towns. As a result of this measure, the issue will be better tackled and gardaí will have a better flow of information, which is the name of the game for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_232">Another important issue which will be dealt with by the involvement of local authorities, councillors and, through them, local associations, is the reporting of crime. It is frightful, if it is true, that one in five crimes is not reported. With greater community involvement, which will be brought about by the provisions the Minister has built into the Bill, I foresee an improvement in this area and the overcoming of many of our difficulties.</p>
          <p eId="para_233">I referred to the accountability of the Garda Commissioner, as the Accounting Officer for the force, to the Committee of Public Accounts. This will improve the image of the Garda Síochána with citizens among the wider community, particularly groups within certain housing estates. I am glad Garda appointments are covered by regulation. I welcome the Minister's decision to opt for the ombudsman model rather than another model which would have involved great waste of time, as Senator Mansergh pointed out. I also welcome that the Bill allows the ombudsman to investigate matters on his or her initiative, or when the Minister refers matters to the ombudsman.</p>
          <p eId="para_234">There is concern with a number of sections which, in the minds of some, effectively turn the Minister into a chief of police. I do not believe this is the Minister's intention and I am sure he will address the point in the Houses and outside. An image remains of a former Minister acting as a kind of chief of police, which perhaps led to some incidents we would prefer had not happened. I am sure the Minister would not intend anything like that to happen on his watch.</p>
          <p eId="para_235">The Garda annual report for 2002 was published at the end of December 2003, which suggests it took nearly one year to compile. This was rather inefficient and I look forward to improvement. In the age of accountability, the Minister should not regard such a delay as acceptable. Section 38 requires the Garda to publish the annual report four months after the year's end, which is a vast improvement.</p>
          <p eId="para_236">Section 39 would seem to allow the Minister to avail of provisional statistics as soon as they become available. Since taking office, the Minister has made such statistics available, which is to be welcomed. While some think that certain matters were buried and that a cynical public relations exercise was involved, I do not intend to go down that road.</p>
          <p eId="para_237">There is major concern that Garda crime statistics do not provide us with the full picture. By their nature, crime statistics give no indication of unreported crime. Some weeks ago, Fine Gael highlighted that as many as one in five crimes is not reported. A black hole clearly exists in the Government's crime statistics. Only when the Minister publishes his crime and victimisation survey will we discover the true extent of the breakdown of law and order.</p>
          <p eId="para_238">Nonetheless, the Bill represents a great step forward in revising and, in some instances, reforming the structures of our police force. It is more than 80 years since the force was first set on a statutory footing and, therefore, the Bill is long overdue and I compliment the Minister on tackling the issue. As outlined, I have some concerns with the Bill which I hope the Minister will address. I look forward to further debate.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DonLydon" eId="spk_145">
          <from>Mr. Lydon</from>
          <p eId="para_239">I welcome the Minister to the House. While Senator Kett said the Minister is appearing here often, he meant it as a compliment not a complaint.</p>
          <p eId="para_240">I welcome the Bill, in which two main objectives are addressed. The first objective concerns the management of the Garda Síochána and the second concerns the issue of complaints and the restoration of public confidence, which has not been lost as much as is suggested. The Garda Síochána is a large organisation and, like any other, whether the Army, Judiciary, a church of any denomination, political party or trades union, it is bound to contain a few bad apples at all times. When members of an organisation are attacked, the organisation tends to close ranks and it is at that stage that public confidence is lost. An "us and them" attitude develops, a natural phenomenon in any organisation, and this is where difficulties arise because the organisation tends to defend the indefensible.</p>
          <p eId="para_241">The Garda Síochána has been in existence for 80 years. We should remember the many members of the force who gave their lives in terrible situations. Although the force is unarmed, its members must often tackle thugs dealing in drugs, trying to free Ireland and so on, and must tackle armed people who shoot at them for no reason. They are faced with appalling situations and we must compliment the Garda Síochána on the bravery of so many of its members over the years. In general, it is a very good force.</p>
          <p eId="para_242">There is now an armed response unit, a sad but necessary development due to changing times. It is all the more important at this time that public confidence in the Garda is restored. It is easy to criticise gardaí when one is pulled up for speeding or a similar offence. However, when one's house is broken into and gardaí appear in minutes, one forgets that they are the same gardaí who may have held one up previously. It is often forgotten that the duty of the Garda Síochána is to uphold the law. They are, after all, guardians of the peace. We make the laws while they simply uphold them, and they often come in for unfair criticism in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_243">The Minister mentioned the Garda intelligence services, which are often forgotten, but the Bill deals with that aspect of policing adequately.</p>
          <p eId="para_244">It is absolutely essential to maintain the ministerial directive to the Commissioner because overall control must always be vested in the democratically elected Government and the Minister who is part of that Government. It is the same regarding control of the Army. We should remember that this country, apart from a bout of "blue flu", has never had a mutiny in either the Army or the police. This is a democracy and that should not happen, but there are many democracies where such things happen. It has not happened here because of the calibre of the forces and the way successive Governments have handled them. It has been a delicate balance at times, but it has worked.</p>
          <p eId="para_245">I urge caution with the joint policy committees. It is not that it is not a good idea, because it is great when the police work with local authorities, but I would not like to see an equal power base developing where the local authority or another body would have the same powers as the police force. I have great experience of the police in my local authority area, Stillorgan, through both community policing and gardaí working as juvenile liaison officers. The effect of having one garda walk around an area is phenomenal. People feel safe and there is a sense of well-being in the community. The Garda can do a great service in that way.</p>
          <p eId="para_246">Caution should be exercised with regard to volunteers. The Minister mentioned special constables in the UK and there are some special constables in Ireland also, patrolling Dublin Castle and St. Stephen's Green. I am not sure about these volunteer members as there is a proliferation of security forces in the country, with guards wearing helmets and padded gear, and some carrying batons. They are becoming more and more indistinguishable from the police, but policing is a job for policemen. Most gardaí know how to do the job efficiently. They know whether to give a person the odd thump or to guide him along gently. A person might not say that, but they should.</p>
          <p eId="para_247">If we do not have enough police, rather than having volunteers, we should hire more gardaí and train them properly. People can learn to respect a force but if there is more than one force they will ask if volunteers have the same authority as policemen and so on. We should not have a diluted Garda Síochána alongside the real force. That is very important.</p>
          <p eId="para_248">Yesterday there were three gardaí on the N11 dual carriageway at Stillorgan, trying to catch someone doing 45 mph in a 40 mph zone, even though the Minister for Transport said people should be able to drive at 60 mph on that road anyway. Surely there is a better way to use Garda manpower.</p>
          <p eId="para_249">The ombudsman idea is a very good one. The old adage <i>nemo judex in causa sua</i> applies to the gardaí as much as anyone else. However, the Minister also mentioned designated officers who will have the same powers and immunities as the gardaí. Are those the ombudsmen? How many such officers will operate? How will they be recruited and trained? Are they like private detectives? The Minister should explain whether they will operate for the extent of a particular investigation or if they will be permanent officers. Will they be in a police station for the duration of a particular case? How will the Minister know they are capable of the job they are employed to do?</p>
          <p eId="para_250">Also, the Minister has brought in a six-month limit on cases but evidence often arises years after a crime is committed. Will there be any redress or will the limit stay at six months? I am sure the Minister has thought this out and will address the point. Judicial oversight is also a good idea. It is essential to have someone looking over everything.</p>
          <p eId="para_251">I have a particular interest in the Bill because, like Senator O'Toole, my father was a policeman. My grandfather was a policeman, as is my cousin. Another cousin is married to a policeman, I mix with policemen and one of my best friends is a policeman. I know a lot about the police and I can relay the frustration some of them feel when a crime does not stick. They apprehend someone, investigate and prosecute. Someone goes to jail, but he or she gets out again. There is a revolving door operating and gardaí feel there is no end to it. Senator Mooney raised another issue on which I have some knowledge, the matter of people from the country coming to Dublin for redress they would not get in their own jurisdictions.</p>
          <p eId="para_252">Young gardaí can become very frustrated; they get horrible abuse at times, with people in flats throwing bricks at them and their cars being rammed. The public often does not realise the dangers those people put themselves in night after night. I dealt with a court case recently in which a female garda tried to help a man get his car keys. He thought she was trying to steal the car and he beat the living daylights out of her. That was not even mentioned in the newspapers but her jaw was swollen for months. We owe these people a tremendous debt of gratitude.</p>
          <p eId="para_253">The Minister made a very important point about secret societies. The IRA is a secret society and I cannot believe any policeman would join it. The masons are also a secret society, no matter what they say. There is a large number of masons in Ireland — there are approximately 50,000 in the North and 20,000 in the South. If anyone reads a book called <i>The Brotherhood </i>they will see the effect the masons have on the police and Judiciary in England, where nearly all police officers and most judges are masons. I do not know if that is wrong or right. I do not know if they do any wrong but there must be some element of “you scratch my back and I’ll scratch yours”.</p>
          <p eId="para_254">This is a very good Bill. It is a new charter for the Garda and the Minister has done a very good job. He has reached a balance. In fencing there was a lesson that a sword is like a bird. If one holds it too tight, one chokes it but if one holds it too loosely, it flies away. It can be easy to choke an organisation like the Garda so much that its members cannot break the law a little. That may be a strange thing to say but they must have a little leeway. If they catch a young man breaking into a house they must be able to grab him by the scruff of the neck and bring him to his parents. His human rights might be violated, but he will not break into a house again. At the same time, one cannot allow that kind of behaviour to develop as breaches of the disciplinary code can slip in.</p>
          <p eId="para_255">The Minister has managed to balance this well and his intentions are very good. The Bill is a good one and will be welcomed by the Garda, which is the most important thing. I congratulate the Minister on the Bill.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_146">
          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_256">I welcome the Minister and thank him for staying to hear the contributions of all colleagues. We appreciate him staying rather than making his speech and running out again.</p>
          <p eId="para_257">When I studied political sociology, the basis of the rational legal system of government was the notion that the State exists because the people want it to exist. The very first principle the State must deliver on is security. I am conscious of that, as is the Minister. It is vitally important that people feel safe in their homes and communities and that they feel a connection with a civilian police force to ensure that when crimes occur, those responsible are brought to justice. Public support for the Garda is absolutely essential but in recent years that has been eroded somewhat by events such as the Morris tribunal and other negative commentary on the Garda. As legislators we must respond to that erosion.</p>
          <p eId="para_258">I respect members of the Garda. They put their lives on the line day in, day out, for our liberty and to ensure the laws of the State are enforced. We should not forget the gardaí who have been murdered as a result of paramilitary activity since the foundation of the State. We should never forget those people who gave their lives for this country. We must also recognise the huge commitment of the family members of gardaí.</p>
          <p eId="para_259">It is also important to recognise that this is largely an unarmed force. I am not suggesting we change the policy in that regard but we need to be aware that we are sending young men and women on very dangerous tasks to apprehend criminals and frequently they come under fire. The incident which occurred recently outside Mr. Chawke's pub is a case in point. Two unarmed members of the force ran to apprehend suspects at the crime scene despite shots being fired over their heads. We must address this issue and ensure adequate protection is given to members of the force in those circumstances because they are putting their lives on the line.</p>
          <p eId="para_260">One of the great advantages of the Garda Síochána, unlike other EU examples, is that it is based in the community and is regarded as an essential part of it, whereas in places such as Italy, France and Germany, the forces are seen as an extension or arm of the state. It is important the Garda Síochána keeps the public support it has so jealously guarded and protected since the foundation of the State, while at the same time adapting to the new situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_261">One does not need to be Archimedes to realise there is a problem with a certain erosion of public support in recent years, given the events about which others have spoken. There is a real problem when it comes to bad attitudes between young people and the Garda, which works both ways, and it must be addressed in the context of Garda reform. We must update the performance of the force and make it more accountable. In that regard, I welcome the Bill's proposals for the ombudsman.</p>
          <p eId="para_262">The people we select to go on the board of the ombudsman will be able to distinguish between genuine complaints and frivolous ones made in the heat of the moment. However, it is important the board has powers of discovery and the full co-operation of the force in respect of complaints which are to be investigated and may lead to charges coming before the courts.</p>
          <p eId="para_263">I also welcome the sections dealing with the new local committees which are to be established. It is very important that the police are accountable locally and are seen and heard locally. I defend the role of local authorities in this regard. We have developed a good system of local government where the police, working in tandem with local authorities and local politicians in a public forum, can address the issues about which people talk to us on a regular basis. While it is important there is an opportunity for these meetings to be held in private, if it is the wish of the committee, the vast majority of meetings should be held in public and reported by the press so that people can see a follow-through on issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">Simple issues are brought to my attention on a regular basis such as the attitude of the police when incidents are recorded and the telephone manner of gardaí. It is important that when a person telephones a Garda station, he or she receives a good hearing and is not fobbed off or left on hold for ten minutes waiting for a response. We need to see those kinds of efficiency improvements in the force and they will flow from some of the measures proposed in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_265">Although it is outside the scope of the Bill, I am glad of the opportunity to address the issue of recruitment while the Minister is here. The problem in this regard in Northern Ireland was that not enough members of the Roman Catholic Nationalist community joined the RUC, which led to a complete undermining of the force because it was not seen to be of all the community. The same argument applies to some parts of this city, Cork and Limerick, where there are well-known areas of disadvantage in which there is a complete disconnection between the police and those communities. These communities are not massive in number by comparison to the total population but they are well-known such as, for example, the CODAN areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_266">The Minister has an opportunity to have the Garda go into those communities and institute an active policy of recruitment within them. Part of my constituency is an area of 10,000 local authority, low cost and tenancy housing lumped together, from which I suspect not one person has become a member of the force in recent years. This is astonishing. If one suggested that not one person from a comparable-sized town such as Navan joined the force, one would be laughed out of court. However, there are parts of this city from which no recruits are coming because of the bad attitude to which I referred. There is a bad attitude in the community which is equal and comparable to the bad attitude within the police. However, because of the tension between the community and the police, they are not getting the recruits.</p>
          <p eId="para_267">Many young men and women who might like to join the force from these communities might feel they would be hounded out and would not receive public support. I recently met a woman whose son is a member of the force and who is being hounded out of her house as a result. He does not live in the local community but she is being victimised simply because she is the mother of a member of the force.</p>
          <p eId="para_268">We must have a radical policy of recruitment. Although I do not like using words such as "targets" or "quotas", we need to go into those communities and recruit young men and women to the force who will live in those communities. The best protection one ever has is to know that a member of the force lives up the road or across the street. Where I live, in a housing estate of 1,700 houses, I know of at least 30 members of the force who live locally. That adds to the sense of protection and comfort people feel locally, despite the fact that these people may be off duty.</p>
          <p eId="para_269">It is unhealthy that in large urban areas, not just council estates, there is no physical presence of the force on the streets because no one lives there or comes from the community. We need to radically increase the number of recruits coming from these areas. I understand a parliamentary question was tabled to the Minister asking whether he could ascertain the number of recruits coming from these well-described CODAN areas of Dublin city and county. In his reply, the Minister stated he did not have the capacity to do that. I ask the Minister to raise this issue with the Garda Commissioner because we need a radical policy of recruitment in these areas. It is the biggest single step which could be taken to improve confidence in the force and help it understand the kinds of sub-cultures which exist in some of these communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_270">Sections 52 to 55, inclusive, deal with the controversial issue of offences in regard to the disclosure of information. I fully accept that if a member of the force touts information to journalists for his or her own personal gain, it is wrong and action should be taken to deal with it. Are we putting this provision in place for the Army? I suspect not. We are not putting this provision in place for existing civil servants, who are obligated under the Official Secrets Act in the same manner as members of the force, nor are we putting it in place in respect of the Minister's own press office. God help us and protect us from a Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who gives information to crime journalists. Are we sure it has never happened? Are there no embedded journalists to whom the Minister speaks? What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.</p>
          <p eId="para_271">If this provision is being put in place for members of the force, let us be consistent — let it have the same jurisdiction in respect of the Minister's office, his press office, his Department, members of the Army and everyone else. Let us have the same principles apply. A great deal of bluff and bluster has been spoken on this matter, although I do not refer to the Minister. Allegedly, many of the Minister's predecessors gave information to certain journalists who then wrote stories with those Ministers' slants. It was not uncommon for Ministers of Justice to give information so that the Government is tipped off. If we are asking members of the force to be obliged to perform their new functions under sections 52 to 55 inclusive, let us have the same consistency for every other person who is responsible for security in the State, from the Minister down.</p>
          <p eId="para_272">We hopefully will spend a great deal of time on Committee Stage of this Bill. There are many welcome provisions in it and I know the Minister will take seriously the points raised in the debate.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnMinihan" eId="spk_147">
          <from>Mr. Minihan</from>
          <p eId="para_273">I join previous speakers in welcoming the Minister, Deputy McDowell, to the House and thanking him for introducing the Bill here. He has spent a lot of time approaching the Bill in an open and consultative manner, and the fruits of those endeavours are seen in the cross-party support for the initiative he has taken.</p>
          <p eId="para_274">Two main objectives of the Bill are to reform the legislative structure through which the Garda is managed and to put in place a mechanism to deal with complaints against gardaí. Both of those objectives have been achieved in the Bill. When we get into the tedium of going through the Committee Stage, we may have minor amendments to make or might get a clearer understanding of the Bill, but no one can disagree that the overall thrust has been achieved.</p>
          <p eId="para_275">I will not let this occasion pass without paying tribute to the Garda and the long service it has given to the State. It saddens me that we still have elements within the State who continually undermine the Garda, fail to recognise it and have taken paramilitary action against a primarily unarmed force. The Garda underpins the democracy we all cherish. A democracy must be based on law and order, and there is an onus on all citizens to respect that if they truly cherish the freedom and democracy in which we live. However, I am somewhat concerned that, at times, some people seem to feel it is acceptable for them to have their own, private way of imposing law and order and support their own private armies or security forces. It would be remiss of us not to condemn that out of hand when we are discussing proposed legislation to support the one legitimate security force in the country, the Garda. When I hear about Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas referring to the shooting of a garda as a tragic event, it disappoints me and saddens me that we still have people in our society who are willing to subscribe to such views or give them any hearing. The reality is that the fundamentals of democracy must be enshrined in support of the institutions of the State and any other way of going about that is an affront to democracy.</p>
          <p eId="para_276">For any police force, public confidence is necessary. There have been occasions when the actions of a few have undermined public confidence in the Garda somewhat. At times, that effect is somewhat exaggerated. There is no profession in which a few people are not off side, but a whole profession should not be condemned because of the actions of a few.</p>
          <p eId="para_277">We seem to be abandoning personal responsibility in this country. We seem to think that numerous matters are the responsibility of the Government, the Garda and various other institutions of State, but what about personal responsibility? If people in Ireland were more aware of personal responsibility and took it on board, we would have no need or requirement for such Garda activity on our streets. Unfortunately, those who are quickest to condemn the Garda are probably those who lack personal responsibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">I will refer briefly to a couple of sections of the Bill. One is section 14, which provides for a volunteer force. I am passionate about that and I have spoken about it over the past several years. Other Members have got into the mechanics of the section, whereas my understanding is that the Minister is putting that provision on the Statute Book to be enacted at a later date and the mechanics of how that will happen are to be worked out in consultation between the Garda Commissioner and the Government. There is nothing unusual about a volunteer force, and for Members to try to muddy the waters by saying that the introduction of a volunteer force is a cop-out to avoid increasing the strength of the main force is wrong. The roles are complementary and can be to the betterment of policing in Ireland, as has been proven in many other countries throughout Europe and, indeed, further afield.</p>
          <p eId="para_279">I will make a few points on how I envisage the volunteer force will work. How many parents sit at home at night worrying about their children being down town, about their social activities and about them coming home? In my youth, parents volunteered to supervise the local disco and tennis club. I know parents who sit at home worrying about their kids coming home and about how safe they are on the streets and coming out of nightclubs, and many of those parents would be willing to contribute in some way to the policing of our streets. This participation could take many forms. A volunteer policeman or policewoman could achieve full powers after a period of time, but it would be possible to have volunteers with different levels of powers — volunteers who have no powers and work in purely administrative capacities; volunteers with limited powers who can work only under the direct supervision of a full member of the Garda; and, finally, volunteers who have full powers.</p>
          <p eId="para_280">A volunteer police force would also provide a greater link with the community and should be embraced positively; we should not look for the negative aspects of the proposal. With the change of our society to multiculturalism, there is a need for linguistic skills and for people to interact with people from different cultures. That is an area in which volunteer police with limited powers could be useful and beneficial to the main force.</p>
          <p eId="para_281">I will also address sections 30 to 34 on the Garda's interaction with local authorities. That interaction is fundamental, because it underpins community policing. When I was a member of a local authority, we set up a relationship such as the one proposed in the Bill between the Garda and the local authority. I have spoken about that. When gardaí were brought into the local authority to account for the numbers on the beat and various events in the city, they consistently told us there were problems with by-laws, for example. The obvious way to make positive progress is to make statutory provision for a formal relationship between the Garda and the local authorities. However, I would like that relationship to be confined to urban district councils, town commissions, city councils and county councils. I am not sure about including county development boards; I would prefer to keep it at the level of the other local authority organisations that I mentioned. Those organisations could in turn broaden the relationship to take in chambers of commerce, the vintners' associations and, I suggest, even student unions, which could all bring representatives to a joint policing committee and help to improve community policing, trust in the gardaí on the beat and the identification of problems in local areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_282">The establishment of the ombudsman commission is necessary, and I welcome it. Other Members have spoken about it, and I will go into the mechanics of the commission on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_283">I will take up one point that has been made about communications with the media. That is necessary and must be enshrined in legislation. We cannot allow criminal investigations to be undermined because some member of a force who has a limited amount of knowledge chooses for personal gain to get a scoop at the cost of the positive conclusion of an investigation. Senator Brian Hayes called for the provision to be introduced across the board for members of the Defence Forces and other public servants. As a former member of the Defence Forces, I assure Members it is enshrined in the Defence Act that it is an offence to communicate with the media. There is nothing unusual about this requirement because it is how it should be.</p>
          <p eId="para_284">I compliment the Minister on his initiative and on the way he brought forward the legislation in such an open manner. He set out his stall when he was appointed Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and no one can deny he has not brought about changes. People who will be critical of the legislation should remember the Minister has achieved in 18 months what has been 80 years in the making. He deserves our congratulations in that regard.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrendanRyan" eId="spk_148">
          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_285">I must make a confession here. I have always had a soft spot for the present Minister, even though I disagree with him on everything.</p>
          <p eId="para_286">This is worthy legislation. As a long standing Member of the House, I appreciate the fact that the Minister has chosen to be here himself for all of the debate so far. I hope he has heard a few things that added to his knowledge although it is not easy to persuade him he needs to have his knowledge added to.</p>
          <p eId="para_287">I have a very ambivalent view of the Garda Síochána based on personal experience. In 1969, I was at a housing demonstration in Dublin. We got a bit disorderly and what was described as the minimum amount of force necessary was used to clear the streets. I limped around for a week afterwards with a delicate part of the lower half of my anatomy somewhat bruised from a garda baton. Whatever about the rights or wrongs of the incident, what educated me was the fact that the then Minister for Justice appeared in the Dáil two days later and categorically denied that batons had been drawn. As I limped around with the evidence on my own person of the baton that had been drawn, I became very sceptical about categorical denials. Looking back at those days and the way the world has developed since, the level of force used was probably far less excessive than what I saw on an infamous video of the Reclaim the Streets demonstration. There was considerable discipline involved at the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_288">On the other hand, in my experience with the Simon Community, most members of the Garda Síochána showed an understanding and sympathy for and flexibility towards homeless people that would have been a model for people in what would be more appropriately described as the caring professions. They had an ability to be patient with people who were actually trying to take the head off them on occasions, and to be good humoured about it. It appears to me that they recognised the people they were dealing with. People were forever being charged with being drunk and disorderly, but most of them were being charged because it was the only way they could be detained for their own safety in a Garda station. They were usually fined for default. Most of them never quite ended up in jail, even though they never paid the fines. On a human level — this was 25 years ago — dealing with people on an individual basis, the gardaí with whom I came into contact were extraordinarily patient and flexible. I want to put that on the record because I may appear to have been poking fun at them earlier.</p>
          <p eId="para_289">However, incidents occur that need to go on the record. I do not want to say anything that would identify an individual but I had an unnerving experience at a meeting in Cork a considerable number of years ago. A senior member of the Garda Síochána in the city was present at the meeting relating to local issues. Towards the end of the meeting, the safety of teenagers walking home in the area was raised, which moved on to the issue of child abuse. The senior official, with the authority of the Garda, said, "We as members of the Garda Síochána know two things. One, that the vast majority of child abuse offences are carried out by homosexuals and, two, a huge part of the child abuse thing is an attempt by certain forces to undermine the sanctity of the Irish family".</p>
          <p eId="para_290">One cannot legislate to prevent people having opinions, nor would I wish to. The more public dialogue there is, in which people have to explain and justify the views they hold, the less likely one is to have opinions like that permeating at senior levels in any organisation. I am sure the Garda Síochána was not alone in having senior members who liked to believe the less pleasant parts of our history were being made up by people with an agenda.</p>
          <p eId="para_291">The lesson I would learn from these three anecdotes is the importance of openness and the necessity for a clear structure of accountability. I welcome the process of investigation which will now be set up under the ombudsman commission, even though I have reservations about some aspects of it. I hope members of the Garda will not see this as a threat. Many of us who work in the public service must live with forms of investigation and inquiry which are much the same as what is proposed here. I appreciate that gardaí are in a unique role, but members of the Garda must accept that with their unique role come unique powers, including, for example, the power to arrest.</p>
          <p eId="para_292">It is disturbing to see the annual report of the sums of money paid out as a result of legal actions taken against the Garda. Many gardaí believe that many complaints are malicious. Nevertheless, it is a fact that significant sums of money are being paid out. Greater transparency and accountability, including mediation processes, would help. I once had an interesting experience of going into a Garda station on behalf of the Simon Community in Cork to make a complaint that a member of the Garda had assaulted someone. One would not want to repeat the experience very often. The Garda station was full of gardaí, all sitting around the fire. I had to say at the counter that I wanted to make a complaint that a member of the force assaulted someone. One could feel the icicles descend and the attention of everyone in the station deflecting away from the afternoon's football match to what was being said at the counter.</p>
          <p eId="para_293">We need to move on from a position whereby a complaint is seen as a threat. It is one of the more regrettable facts in recent times that members of the Garda appear to feel, out of what I would regard as a misguided sense of loyalty, unable to co-operate fully with the Garda Complaints Board about the Reclaim the Streets event, when it was apparent no one was available to identify anyone else. I can understand this, as would any member of a profession. However, we are entitled to ask the gardaí for a commitment to proper operation of both administrative and statutory procedures. In this case it appears that did not happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_294">Some of us in this House are forever criticising the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Ever since I noticed in the IPA Year Book that the Secretary General of that Department until quite recently would not allow his photograph to be published, I began to believe there was a peculiar attitude to national security in the Department which was not replicated in the Defence Forces or the Garda Síochána. Is the Minister sure there is a need for this particular protection for Garda stations where he believes there are documents relating to matters of national security? What does he think would happen if people carrying out an investigation on behalf of the commission came across these documents? There is a very strict warning in the Freedom of Information Act, which I have no doubt was inserted at the behest of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, that judges who look at documents must be very careful that nobody else sees them. There seems to be an implied presumption in this that those in a certain area of the Department know better than anyone else. We all recognise the importance of national security, but national security is better secured by convincing people that what is being secured and kept secret in the name of national security is just that and not a convenient cover-up for assembling information that perhaps might have been acquired through circumstances that some people might suspect to be legally dodgy. I do not know. We will not know as long as we have this particular obsession. I would like the Minister, perhaps on Committee Stage, to elaborate within the bounds of national security as to precisely what sort of information might be jeopardised, or what might be jeopardised if these provisions or restrictions were to be removed.</p>

          <p eId="para_295">There is huge interest in this Bill and we are delighted that the Minister has attended this House first, allowing us such an extensive debate — so much so that the debate will not end at 1 p.m. today. That might not dismay the Minister but perhaps his officials, who like to move things along. We understand that. They are shaking their heads, so they want further debate here too. That is good to hear. I must say to the Department's Secretary General, a fine, good-looking Kerryman, that he might well have his photograph anywhere because people would simply sit and admire, rather than plot damage to him.</p>

          <p eId="para_299">The Bill is very interesting. The most interesting aspect is the clarity it brings to different functions of the Garda Síochána. That occurred to me when the Minister spoke recently, and on re-reading what he said and on listening to other people. It is the Bill's greatest asset that in a segmented, although not a fractured way, everyone within the Garda will know what are his or her duties and roles. That will bring enormous clarity to the duties of each component within what is a huge force for good in our community.</p>
          <p eId="para_300">I recall when the Minister began speaking of this Bill and I greatly admire the consultative process in which he engaged in forming it, drawing up the heads and then holding consultations. This is a practice I adopted in legislative areas and I found it enormously beneficial. It meant that when a Bill was finally formulated and brought to Second Stage in whatever House, there was a measure of support for it because of the consultative process. That is hugely important.</p>
          <p eId="para_301">I particularly welcome the fact that the Human Rights Commission has given the Bill a broadly positive response, which is good, and that there will now be a clear onus on the Garda to have regard to human rights in its daily dealings, strategic plans and objectives. That is an enormous force for good. I do not think that this would have been high up on the Garda agenda. That is not to fault the Garda or anyone else, but the concept of human rights is proper and at the heart of all one's dealings with other people, particularly with a powerful body. The Bill in this area confers an equality of dealings which the Seanad would greatly support.</p>
          <p eId="para_302">When the Minister initially announced his plans for this Bill, there was a general feeling of "them and us", a feeling of us possibly being "agin" them. Thankfully, because of public debate and consultation, that feeling has greatly dissipated, I have talked informally to some gardaí in my own area about the Bill and what it means. These talks did not take place in a structured way in terms of having a meeting, but there was general approval for the clarity and delineation in the Bill. That is good because it is certainly not a matter of "them versus us".</p>
          <p eId="para_303">We have a huge bulwark of enormous good in this country, namely the Garda Síochána. We all recognise that. The Minister paid a very generous tribute to the Garda in the closing stages of his speech on Second Stage. The Garda is there for us, to serve the community in a collective sense and to serve each community member in an individual sense. That is why the human rights element is so important. Some of the proposals adopted in the 1924 Act and in subsequent Garda Acts were embedded in the previous century and we inherited them when we got our independence. There was nothing wrong with that. They were good terms for those times, but times move on and it is coming close to a century since 1924. There is no question that all of us, the Garda and the community, would become like fossils, stuck in the one legislative ambit with one way of looking at things and not seeing the reason for modernising, which the Garda clearly does. All of this is interesting in a new century and in terms of how we view ourselves and our roles <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Garda.</p>
          <p eId="para_304">The Minister rightly paid tribute in the House to Senator Maurice Hayes for the role he played in the policing body in Northern Ireland. I take the opportunity to commend Ms Kathy O'Toole, who is a member of the PSNI board whom I know very well. Her people are from Athlone. She is now the head police commissioner for the whole of Boston, commanding 3,000 members of the force. She is an Irishwoman in her late 40s, a remarkable person with considerable administrative and people skills. I wish her well in the new role in which she was confirmed last week. She was on the PSNI board and since the Minister paid tribute to Senator Hayes, this gave me an opportunity to bring her into the equation.</p>
          <p eId="para_305">I have spoken of the clarity, delineation and the consultation involved in the Bill. Regarding the role of the ombudsman commission, I smiled when the Minister said that one member must be a man and another a woman. I did not know what the third person would be. The commission is a very fine concept. It is important that the Minster will have the right to give policing directives on occasion because we often hear it said that the Minister has nothing to do with anything and cannot respond on such a matter because it is the business of a particular State body.</p>

          <p eId="para_307">Yes, I know. Or one has the other side of the equation, with people asking why the No. 11 bus did not run at 7.10 a.m. instead of at 7.20 a.m. That is the sort of question I used to be asked as Minister. One cannot know at what time every bus goes. There are two sides to every argument. It is right to allow the Minister to issue directives.</p>
          <p eId="para_308">I point out to the Acting Chairman that I will be marking progress, not concluding the discussion on the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_309">The Garda Complaints Board was perhaps right for its time. It was hailed as revolutionary when set up, but it never lived up to its revolutionary hopes — revolutionary in a proper sense. Somehow, it got bogged down. One was seen to be in the wrong if one made a complaint. Generally, that was how the body was observed to operate. The new structure will enable complaints to be properly made, in a clear and properly delineated manner, and there will be people to deal with them. The Minister has introduced an oversight measure which is necessary. I have been thinking about it since the Minister spoke about it. It is a good idea, but it remains to be seen how it will work out. The statutory footing for bringing in local unpaid volunteers conjures up in my mind the English films one sometimes sees about old-fashioned deaf constables. I am sure that is not what is meant. If the volunteers are needed, the legislation will be there.</p>

          <p eId="para_314">I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gallagher, and apologise for not having been able to raise the following point, which is germane to this section, on Second Stage. I had other commitments and could not be here. It is an issue which cannot be rectified at this point but which I would like the Minister of State to urgently draw to the attention of the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, namely, the anomalous and unfair situation regarding older cars. I immediately declare a personal interest, but there is a principle involved. I have a fine motoring car, a Jaguar XJ6.</p>

        <speech by="#DavidNorris" eId="spk_161">
          <from>Mr. Norris</from>
          <p eId="para_316">It cost me €5,000 because it was ten years old when I got it two years ago. I have to pay approximately €1,300 in tax. That seems iniquitous. From a conservation point of view, people should be encouraged to retain older cars like that — good quality cars — which have not exhausted their usefulness. The taxation should, in some measure at least, be related to the value of the car. If one looks at other forms of taxation, one is taxed relative to value. I am taxed on my income. If I have an income of €100,000, I go into a particular tax bracket because I have X amount of money. In the old days, if I had a house which was over a certain value, I would be taxed on it. That principle goes right through the whole tax system.</p>
          <p eId="para_317">It is ludicrous that I and many other people in this situation are approaching a point where we pay more in tax than the market value of the car. That is absurd. I remember the give away budgets in which Fianna Fáil romped home because it did things like abolish car tax. However, it gradually crept back until we now have this absurd situation of these huge amounts of tax on cars which are not commercially valuable. That is wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_318">The French Government addressed this situation sensibly in the past couple of years. When this anomaly was drawn to its attention, it removed tax completely from cars and replaced it with one cent on petrol. That has the great advantage of minimising all the bureaucratic inconvenience, the muddle, the prosecutions, the delays, the Civil Service administration and so on. I could not table an amendment because, as the Minister of State knows, the Seanad is not trusted with the purse strings of the State. If I table an amendment which costs money, it will be immediately ruled of out order because of the way the Seanad has been established. I urge the Minister for Finance to look at this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_319">I will be cynical and say that by the time of the next election, this could be a popular issue. The Minister might meet resistance from people who want to sell new cars but there is also a substantial body in the motor industry which sells second-hand cars. Rather than litter the countryside with the corpses of perfectly useable cars, the Minister would make it financially possible for people to continue to drive them.</p>
          <p eId="para_320">I raise this issue because I have raised others in this manner with the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and have found him to be open-minded. If he does not agree, he will kick it out the window but if he thinks there is the slightest bit of sense or, as Sean O'Casey would say, tither of wit in it, he will look at it. That is all I ask. My proposal would save on wastage, scrappage and so on. It would also mean there was a little more rationale to the way tax is levied on cars. It should be related to age or it should be abolished altogether which would be popular, would minimise bureaucracy, would free up some of these civil servants who the Minister could then ask to go wherever he liked. They could be decentralised all over the place.</p>
          <p eId="para_321">The Minister for Finance has, or his predecessors have, in effect, already conceded this principle. There is provision for antique or classic cars; owners of cars in excess of 30 years old pay a marginal, notional tax. However, some of us cannot wait that long. I ask the Minister to consider this issue and I thank the Acting Chairman for allowing me to make this point.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Gallagher)</from>
          <p eId="para_322">The Senator will know that a car's cc, not its age, is the basis for taxation. On the principle about which he speaks, section 4 provides for new rates of motor tax for motorcycles and other vintage vehicles over 30 years old. I do not think anyone would describe a 12 year old Jaguar XJ6 as such. With the Senator living in the fast lane, I presume it is possibly 3000 cc. Of course, he cannot identify with many people in Ireland as far as cars are concerned because 60% of the national fleet is made up of cars under 1400 cc. He is among an elite group.</p>
          <p eId="para_323">I appreciate the point the Senator makes but I reiterate we are talking about 5% across the board. I do not believe he is complaining about the minor increase of 5% resulting in €34 million in additional funds for the country roads. The Senator will be as familiar with rural Ireland as he is with Dublin and the necessity to maintain record investment. I will bring the case he has made to the attention of the Minister for Finance but, in the meantime, a proposal to assess motor tax on the basis of CO2 emissions is under consideration. However, this cannot be done overnight and we want to be fair and balanced in this regard. For example, the Senator's car or an older car with a 1000 cc engine might generate more emissions than a modern 3000 cc car because of the advances that have been made. We are examining this proposal and there will be further discussions on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_324">It is paramount to ensure CO2 emissions are minimised over the next number of years given that national and international obligations must be met in this regard. Motor tax on cars with an engine capacity of more than 1400 cc and more than 3001 cc will increase by €64 per year, which equates to slightly more than €1 per week. Senator Norris is interested in the environment and vintage cars and his motive for making the proposal is more than financial. I will discuss his proposal with the Minister and perhaps we will have further discussions at an appropriate time.</p>

          <p eId="para_326">The hikes of 12% last year and 5% this year in motor taxation were discussed in detail on Second Stage. However, the millions of euro lost through people failing to pay motor tax must be addressed. The Government needs to get tough on motor tax dodgers. A survey published a number of years ago highlighted that the Exchequer loses millions annually and it is unfair on people who pay their taxes. This issue must be examined because it has resulted in inequity. A number of those who evade motor tax are also cheeky when they are on the road. Tough legislation must be introduced to deal with those dodgers and I would like the Minister of State to comment on this aspect. The penalties should be stiffer for those who evade motor tax and they should be imprisoned if they do not comply with the law.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">A related issue is the facility provided to motorists whereby they can skip the payment of motor tax for two to three months and then call to their local Garda station to have a declaration signed that the car had not been on a public road during that time. This should be addressed because local authorities lose significant moneys annually as a result of non-compliance with motor tax regulations. I would appreciate it if the Minister of State would examine this issue in detail in the not too distant future.</p>

          <p eId="para_328">A number of people think they should not pay taxes, no matter what tax is involved. Senator Bannon referred to declarations signed in Garda stations. When a declaration is signed that a car has been off the road, the garda witnesses the signature of the car owner and, therefore, he or she makes the declaration, not the garda. Penalties are in place to deal with car owners who knowingly enter a Garda station and make a dishonest declaration.</p>

          <p eId="para_329">I understand the law in that regard. Such people are guilty of making two false declarations. First, they have the cheek to go into a Garda station and declare the car is off the road and then they sign a declaration form in the presence of a garda. That is wrong and that law needs to be examined. It is unfair to the gardaí who sign the forms because they cannot be on everyone's back on a daily basis. The Garda is under resourced.</p>

          <p eId="para_330">I have received representations regarding the number people using the motor tax renewal form to declare their cars have been off the road. The Minister of State's officials should also examine the insurance implications of such declarations. If a motorist's car is off the road for three or six months, he will cancel his insurance. Gardaí should double check whether such motorists have insurance, never mind tax. There is a loophole in this regard, which needs to be addressed by the relevant Minister or body. This is a widespread problem.</p>

        <speech by="#PatTheCope" eId="spk_168" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Environment,_Heritage_and_Local_Government">
          <from>Mr. Gallagher</from>
          <p eId="para_331">I very much appreciate the issues raised by all Senators who are totally realistic about motor tax. Taxes must be paid, even if we do not agree with them. If they are levied, everybody should pay them. A greater burden is placed on those who pay by those who are not tax compliant.</p>
          <p eId="para_332">The last survey of compliance with motor tax and motor insurance law and national car testing schemes was carried out in June 2001. The survey highlighted that, typically, approximately 4.6% of vehicle owners persistently evade motor tax compared to 2.8% in the previous survey five years earlier. This represented a loss of approximately €30 million in motor tax receipts in 2003. This loss will increase by 5%, or €1.5 million, this year if the same evasion rate pertains.</p>
          <p eId="para_333">The British motor tax evasion rate is 4.5% according to a survey carried out in 2002. Enforcement and prosecution for non-payment of motor tax is a matter for the Garda and details of the number of prosecutions are provided annually in the Garda Commissioner's report on crime. Under powers to tackle motor tax evasion introduced in April 1995, the Garda may impound vehicles in respect of which motor tax has not been paid for a continuous period of three months or more. Following the publication of the nationwide survey of compliance with motor tax, the Garda Commissioner undertook to implement a number of measures such as the revision of existing enforcement initiatives and also the drawing up of comprehensive regional enforcement plans. The Commissioner has been requested to ensure the Garda policing plan maintains and expands on this enforcement action to vigorously pursue evasion.</p>
          <p eId="para_334">The evasion of motor tax is an offence and the funds raised through the tax are important to the development of a safe, good quality, non-national road network. As a result of the enactment of the legislation, an additional €34 million will be generated.</p>
          <p eId="para_335">Another €30 million on top of that would go a long way towards achieving the profile we have established for ourselves in the south and east and in the BMW regions. I hope, in the very near future, that officials of my Department who deal with tax will meet with officials from the Garda Commissioner's office to discuss how we can work together to address this issue and to ensure that we achieve the objective of almost 100% compliance. There is a duty on every individual to pay motor tax. We will be anxious to reduce the rate of non-compliance from 4.6% to a much lower rate. I do not think a zero rate is achievable but we will reduce the rate to as near zero as possible.</p>

Tá an Bille seo fíor thábhachtach ó thaobh na mbóithre nach bóithre náisiúnta iad ós rud é go mbeidh níos mó ná €34 milliún breise ag an Roinn agus ag na húdaráis áitiúla tríd an tír chun caitheamh ar bhóithre nach bóithre náisiúnta iad.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O’Malley)</from>
          <p eId="para_345">The battle against tobacco is one of the most important health challenges facing us. It is clear the Government has prioritised tackling the huge negative impact that tobacco products have on the health of the nation — be this an impact from active smoking or from exposure to second hand smoke.</p>
          <p eId="para_346">The impact of tobacco consumption on human health globally and nationally is well documented. Tobacco smoke is the leading preventable cause of death and disability in Ireland. Medical evidence has repeatedly confirmed tobacco as a cause of cardiovascular disease, including heart attack and stroke, common cancers, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthmatic attacks, low birth weight babies and sudden infant death syndrome. Approximately 7,000 deaths in Ireland each year are attributable to tobacco related illness. Smoking tobacco products is one of the unhealthiest things a human being can do.</p>
          <p eId="para_347">Life expectancy is lower in Ireland than the EU average and the diseases which contribute primarily to this are heart disease and cancer. Tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of these diseases. Smoking is a major causative factor in some 90% of the 2,000 deaths from lung cancer each year and increases the risk of other cancers such as cancer of the mouth and throat. Smoking is also a primary cause of cardiovascular disease, the greatest single cause of mortality in Ireland. Tobacco is a significant burden to individuals, families and society through death, illness and medical costs. Reduction in tobacco use will increase life expectancy in Ireland and result in happier, healthier and better quality lives for many Irish people.</p>
          <p eId="para_348">Evidence has accumulated year on year of the enormous worldwide threat to human health from consumption of tobacco products. Studies carried out internationally in recent years have also confirmed there is a significant risk to the health of the non-smoker from inhaling environmental tobacco smoke referred to as second hand smoke or passive smoking.</p>
          <p eId="para_349">The Public Health Tobacco Act 2002 was enacted in March 2002. The Act is the most comprehensive anti-tobacco legislation ever in this country and confirmed the commitment of the Government and the Oireachtas to the battle against the tobacco epidemic. The Act brought together a number of legal instruments and replaced two existing Acts, the Tobacco Products (Control of Advertising, Sponsorship and Sales Promotion) Act 1978 and the Tobacco (Health Promotion and Protection) Act 1988 and incorporated certain provisions of the Government's policy, Towards a Tobacco Free Society. Strong legislative measures are an important public health instrument in countering the tobacco threat.</p>
          <p eId="para_350">The main provisions contained in the Act are as follows — a comprehensive ban on tobacco advertising, including in-store advertising and displays, and on all forms of sponsorship by the tobacco industry; registration of tobacco retailers and tougher penalties for those convicted of under age sales; a ban on retail sales of packs of cigarettes of less than 20; tighter controls on sale of tobacco products from vending machines; a ban on the sale of confectioneries, normally intended for children, which resemble a tobacco product; public disclosure of all aspects of tobacco including toxicity and addiction; and a prohibition on the smoking of tobacco products in the enclosed workplace with limited exceptions.</p>
          <p eId="para_351">The tobacco industry and other related trades commenced legal challenges to the Public Health (Tobacco) Act in June 2002. During the judicial hearings, which involved three sets of proceedings, the court was advised by the State of a problem in regard to a requirement to notify the EU Commission at Bill stage of some of the measures enacted to comply with two EU Directives 98/34/EC and 98/48/EC. These directives, known as the transparency-technical standards directives, require draft technical regulations to be notified to the EU Commission and to other member states in advance of their adoption.</p>
          <p eId="para_352">The procedure is intended to provide transparency and control with regard to technical regulations which impose binding legal rules, regulating the characteristics required of a product such as levels of quality, performance, safety or dimensions, including the requirements applicable to the product as regards the name under which the product is sold, terminology, symbols, testing and test methods, packaging, marking or labelling and conformity assessment procedures. National measures of this nature could create unjustified barriers to trade between member states. Their notification in draft form and the subsequent evaluation of their content in the course of the procedure help to diminish this risk.</p>
          <p eId="para_353">The procedure was not followed at Bill stage with the 2002 Act and, as a result, 14 of the 53 sections of the Act are affected. These sections relate mainly to the sale and marketing of tobacco products. However, other important aspects of the Act such as the establishment of the Office of Tobacco Control and the power to regulate smoking in the workplace remain in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_354">As the Act is a public health measure, it was considered originally that it was not notifiable to the Commission as a technical regulation. It was also considered that the requirement to introduce commencement orders in the case of the Act would allow for notification of the commencement order in draft form, thereby meeting the requirements of the transparency directives.</p>
          <p eId="para_355">Following correspondence and discussions with EU Commission officials on this matter and having obtained legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General, it became clear that any attempt to commence the affected sections would result in considerable uncertainty as to the enforceability of the sections in question. The court was advised of the attempts made through the Commission to resolve the issue and each set of proceedings was discontinued. Accordingly, the Minister decided that the quickest and most appropriate way of resolving the issue was to repeal the affected sections and to reintroduce them by way of a new Bill which would then be notified under the transparency procedure and, on completion of this procedure, would be re-enacted.</p>
          <p eId="para_356">The Minister was advised by the Office of the Attorney General that with a view to assisting in the defence of any challenge brought to the re-enacted legislation, the amending Bill should be used as an opportunity to strengthen the Act in a number of areas. This is being done by, among other things, changing the Long Title of the Act to indicate that the Act is designed to give effect to as many of the EU and international measures as have been adopted at that date. The re-enacted legislation will include those EU measures relating to tobacco products to be transposed into national law.</p>
          <p eId="para_357">The Minister was also advised by the Office of the Attorney General that the provisions for smoke-free workplaces should be introduced by means of primary legislation — that is by way of a Bill — rather than by means of secondary legislation, namely regulations. This will strengthen the Bill in the context of a possible legal challenge.</p>
          <p eId="para_358">Since the enactment of the legislation, there have been many positive developments at European and global level. Directive No. 2001/37/EC of the European Parliament and Council was introduced on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of member states concerning the manufacture, presentation and sale of tobacco products. Among other provisions, the directive requires larger and more visible and effective health warnings on cigarette packs and provides for member states to make use of graphic warnings. The EU has also introduced Directive No. 2003/33/EC on the approximation of those laws, regulations and administrative provisions of member states which prohibit tobacco advertising and related sponsorship. The effect of the directive will be to deny the tobacco industry direct access to the public, particularly young persons, through print and other media. While Ireland has imposed a ban on tobacco advertising and sponsorship since July 2000, we have always recognised the need for strong measures at EU level in the area of advertising of tobacco products and sponsorship by tobacco companies.</p>
          <p eId="para_359">A Council recommendation on the prevention of smoking and initiatives to improve tobacco control was introduced on 2 December 2002 against a background of 500,000 smoking deaths annually in the European Union. There is concern among member states at the numbers of adolescents and children who continue to take up smoking. Smoking remains the biggest cause of preventable death in the European Union. The Council recommends that member states adopt appropriate legislative and other measures to reduce morbidity and mortality from tobacco. Reports on the measures taken should be provided to the Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_360">The World Health Organisation framework convention on tobacco control was adopted at Geneva on 21 May 2003. This historic and ground-breaking international treaty seeks to protect many millions around the world from the devastating impact of tobacco consumption and exposure to tobacco smoke. The treaty addresses all aspects of tobacco control, including the traditional health interventions on advertising and sponsorship, passive smoking and retail licensing. It addresses economic and trade issues including taxation policy, international trade and smuggling. Other elements of the convention include product specification and issues of compensation and liability.</p>
          <p eId="para_361">Ireland has always advocated strong international tobacco controls. Many countries have already signed the WHO convention including, in September of 2003, the Minister for Health and Children on behalf of Ireland. The convention will make a significant contribution to the protection of future generations from the predatory practices of the global tobacco industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_362">The section of the legislation dealing with indirect advertising is being removed as the EU directive on the advertising and sponsorship of tobacco products does not cover indirect advertising. Indirect advertising is often referred to as "brand stretching". The removal of the section will serve to insulate the Act from further legal challenge. The provision on the prohibition of smoking of tobacco products in specified places is being amended to include the principles and policies which will inform the making of regulations under the relevant section.</p>
          <p eId="para_363">During the Irish Presidency of the European Union, a major conference on tobacco control will be held in the mid-west region. Ireland has always recognised the need for a strong, unified EU approach to tobacco control and health. Many developing countries look to the European Union to initiate strong measures in this vital area of public health. The Irish Presidency is an opportunity to make further developments in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_364">Much has been achieved to reduce the incidence of smoking in our population. Through a combination of measures, which included legislation, regulation, health promotion and education, we were able to achieve in 2002 the 27% level for 2002 reported in last year's SLÁN survey. More recent surveys conducted by the Office of Tobacco Control indicate that smoking levels have dropped to almost 25%. This is welcome news. The reduction achieved will have many benefits, particularly for future generations which will come to accept non-smoking as the social norm.</p>
          <p eId="para_365">The smoke-free workplace provisions in the Bill will come into force from 29 March 2004. The primary purpose of the "smoke-free at work" initiative is to protect workers and the public from exposure to harmful, toxic tobacco smoke. The "smoke-free at work" initiative is based on emphatic independent advice from experts. The report, Health Effects of Environmental Tobacco Smoke in the Workplace, published in January 2003, was commissioned by the Office of Tobacco Control and the Health and Safety Authority. It was prepared by an independent expert scientific group. The report reaches blunt conclusions about the risks posed to health by tobacco smoke and the measures necessary to protect employees.</p>
          <p eId="para_366">The facts speak for themselves. Second-hand tobacco smoke is a cause of cancer, heart disease and respiratory problems. Employees require protection from exposure to second-hand smoke at work and current ventilation technology is ineffective at removing the risk to health. Legislative measures are required to protect workers from the adverse effects of exposure. A national public information campaign, "smoke-free at work", is under way across television, radio and print media. A series of print materials for workplaces, employees and the general public is now available on-line at the new "smoke-free at work" website. The campaign will provide guidance and information to all sectors of society in preparation for 29 March. Information will also be available on-line from the websites of the Office of Tobacco Control and the Health and Safety Authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_367">Monitoring of compliance with the smoke-free requirements in the food and hospitality sectors will be the responsibility of officers of the health boards and the Office of Tobacco Control. Health boards are in the process of filling vacancies in their established environmental health officer complements in the tobacco control area. The emphasis of the campaign will be on compliance building and harnessing widespread public support for a smoke-free environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_368">Adapting to the new measures will require some adjustment, particularly for those in workplaces which have not benefited from the existing statutory controls on the smoking of tobacco products. I am confident people will adjust as they did when cinemas, theatres, hair-dressing salons, aeroplanes and numerous other settings became smoke-free. The trade union movement is strongly supportive and I am encouraged by the willingness employers' organisations in various sectors have demonstrated in recommending that their members comply with the new measures. Most people are law abiding and responsible. I expect the vast majority of employers, employees and members of the public will respect these important new public health measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_369">Our success in improving health nationally is linked to further reducing the level of tobacco use. In particular, this involves preventing young persons starting to smoke. If the incidence of tobacco use can be reduced further, we can make considerable progress towards a tobacco-free and healthier society. No matter how comprehensive, legislation alone cannot create and sustain the environment necessary to prevent people starting to smoke or assist those who have already started to quit. Our anti-tobacco strategy will be multi-faceted. It will contain strong legislative controls and effective enforcement powers. It will include a fiscal element and the supports required by smokers to quit.</p>
          <p eId="para_370">The implementation of our comprehensive strategy will, in time, effect the necessary attitudinal changes in society to tobacco consumption. Attitudinal changes will be followed by the necessary behavioural changes. We owe it to ourselves, the younger generation, and, indeed, future generations to ensure we win the war on tobacco. We must ensure that the children and young people of today do not become future victims of the tobacco industry by being induced to smoke tobacco products or through exposure to and inhalation of environmental tobacco smoke. I commend the Public Health (Tobacco) (Amendment) Bill 2003 to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FrankFeighan" eId="spk_175">
          <from>Mr. Feighan</from>
          <p eId="para_371">I welcome the Minister of State and join him in saying that this is a battle against tobacco. It is one of the most important health challenges the country has faced. We in Opposition wish to lend whatever support we can to ensure the blight of tobacco will not be a threat to this or any other country.</p>
          <p eId="para_372">I once attended a conference on cannabis smoking. I was struck by a statistic which indicated that more people have died from smoking tobacco, since its introduction over 200 years ago, than in the First and Second World Wars. I found it difficult to understand how this drug has taken such a hold on western Europe, including Ireland, given its cost and damage to health. Any measure that can prevent the smoking of tobacco, which is harmful to children, workers in the workplace and customers, is welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_373">The 2002 Act brought together a number of legal instruments and replaced two existing Acts, one of which was the Tobacco Products (Control of Advertising, Sponsorship and Sales Promotion) Act 1978, which was welcome because at the time we used to have the Carrolls All-Stars. As a teenager I found it strange that icons of sport, GAA, football and hurling, could be associated with tobacco. That Act has helped those of us who aspired to sport to realise that smoking harms not only one's health but one's chances in sport. The Tobacco (Health Promotion and Protection) Act 1988 incorporated certain provisions of the Government's policy, Towards a Tobacco Free Society. The main provisions of the Act were a comprehensive ban on tobacco advertising, including in-store advertising and displays, and all forms of the tobacco industry. This is where I am confused.</p>
          <p eId="para_374">My family business is a newsagents. Tobacco sales was always a major part of a newsagent's trade. To get around the so-called ban where one had a tobacco stand in the newsagents, the tobacco companies have installed a form of vending machine. Legally, they are able to circumvent the law by installing these machines. There are photographs of all the tobacco companies on the machine, for example, Carrolls, Major and so on. When a customer comes into the newsagents, I have to turn around from the till and press a little button and the cigarettes come out. I do not believe that policy was thought out sufficiently. It is business as usual. One can say that, as a newsagent, I should not sell these products. Whatever legislation was brought in has been circumvented by the multinationals and it is business as usual. There are serious profits from the sale of tobacco because these machines do not come cheap and they are installed free of charge in every newsagents and every retail outlet in the country. I do not believe anything can be done about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_375">I agree with the registration of tobacco retailers and tougher penalties for those convicted of under age sales. I compliment the health boards, and particularly the Western Health Board, in that on five occasions in the past two years we have received a letter from the health board which had carried out on-the-spot checks. It sent a young teenager to the newsagents and thankfully my staff were vigilant and denied the teenager the cigarettes. I welcome these tough spot checks. If we had sold cigarettes to an under age person, I have no doubt the full rigours of the law would have been applied. I welcome the pro-active approach of the Western Health Board in ensuring cigarettes will not be sold to under age persons.</p>
          <p eId="para_376">The ban on the retail sale of packs of less than 20 cigarettes is welcome as are the tighter controls on the sale of tobacco products from vending machines. If teenagers could not get cigarettes in a retail shop, they went to vending machines and now they have to be located in an area which is visible to the public and the owner or manager. That is a welcome development. I also welcome the ban on the sale of confectionery, normally intended for children. It was crazy that children could have toy cigarettes or sweet cigarettes, copying the habits of their peers or their adult friends.</p>
          <p eId="para_377">Public disclosure of all aspects of tobacco including toxicity and addiction is welcome. We are all aware that tobacco kills. Countries, such as Australia, have gone much further in that their tobacco packs are very graphic. The UK has advertisements showing people who suffer from lung cancer saying they did not think "this little weed kills". It does kill.</p>
          <p eId="para_378">The reason the Bill is before the House is that procedures were not followed under the 2002 Act. As a result, 14 of 53 sections of the Act are affected. These sections relate mainly to the sale and marketing of tobacco products. I am concerned that, perhaps, we did not give sufficient attention to that Bill. The EU directive will deny the tobacco industry direct access to young persons. There will be a difficulty because the legislation ran foul of the European Commission. The words "control of the sale" and "control of the marketing" had implications and fell foul of EU competition law. This should be a warning to us that there are lawyers looking at the Bills we pass. We should be more vigilant and spend more time on these Bills.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">The legislation has provided for a change in penalties. It would not have been prudent to send publicans to prison. The prisons should be used for much more sinister gangsters — I am not saying publicans are gangsters. I was a publican. Although the financial penalty has been increased to €3,000, publicans can afford to pay it and would prefer to do so rather than go to prison. It is difficult to clarify the extent of the publican's responsibilities. Who is responsible? It is very difficult if a customer is in the pub — this is a separate issue — but I would never sell a ticket to a customer because it offended him or her. If one would not sell a ticket, one would not tell a customer to stop smoking because that custom would be lost. I wonder whether environmental protection agents or health board agents will have the backup of the law at a time of night when it would be difficult to deal with people with drink taken. While I welcome the Bill, I foresee difficulties ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_380">I am concerned with the issue of pub ventilation. A significant amount of money was spent installing proper ventilation equipment into pubs following the introduction of clean air legislation, and this was promoted by the health boards. While such measures cost pubs as much as €70,000, they are no longer useful. The equipment was installed to eradicate smoke and to protect customers and bar workers but is no longer necessary. A pro-active measure could have been introduced so that this money was not wasted. Many high-tech, smoke eradication units are now worthless, an issue we should consider.</p>
          <p eId="para_381">I support the Minister and any measure which protects people in workplaces and public areas from the ravages of smoke inhalation, which has killed many. The sooner we are rid of the scourge of tobacco, the better.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CamillusGlynn" eId="spk_176">
          <from>Mr. Glynn</from>
          <p eId="para_382">I congratulate the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, and the Ministers of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley and Deputy Callely, on the introduction of the Bill. I am glad Senator Feighan has firmly indicated his party's support for this imperative measure. All fair-minded people will acknowledge that the Minister and his Ministers of State have been pathfinders and have driven this measure to its current position. Nobody said it would be easy, and it will not be. However, it is never too late to do the right thing. What Minister for Health and Children worth his or her salt would not introduce a measure such as this in the long and short-term interests of the nation?</p>
          <p eId="para_383">The point of this prohibition has been lost in many of the arguments against it. In excess of 7,500 people die every year as a result of smoking related illness and many more are seriously ill. What impact does this have on our health services? We hear <i>ad nauseum</i> in this Chamber of the number of hospital units which need to be opened and made operable. Many hospitals would be redundant if smoking was stopped and this has been proven.</p>
          <p eId="para_384">This is a choice between saving lives or profits and we should choose lives every time, a point paramount in the mind of the Minister and every right thinking person. Given the expert opinion on smoking and its effects, it can only be seen as a long-term form of suicide. Over the years, smokers have asked what harm they are doing to anyone but themselves by having a cigarette. That myth has been exploded by increased knowledge of the effects of environmental tobacco smoke and the arguments of public health experts. The public and workplace employees are increasingly aware of the threat to their health from toxic tobacco smoke and of the necessity of the measures being introduced to protect them.</p>
          <p eId="para_385">It is important that this initiative is based on emphatic advice from health experts. As a member of the Committee on Health and Children, with Senator Feighan, I was interested to hear Dr. Howell tell the committee that tobacco addiction is greater than heroin addiction. There is proof that a famous world leader was able to kick a heroin addiction but not smoking, which speaks for itself. There is consensus within the international scientific community and the World Health Organisation about the damaging effects of tobacco smoke and that there is no safe level of exposure to this known carcinogen.</p>
          <p eId="para_386">It has been suggested that designated smoking areas should be allowed as a compromise. This ignores the fact that staff would still be required to work in such areas. Also, tobacco smoke is not stagnant. It permeates the entire atmosphere of a room regardless of where the smoking takes place and without regard to areas which are designated as "smoking" or "non-smoking". This is not a realistic or acceptable option.</p>
          <p eId="para_387">The suggestion has been made that improvements in ventilation technology, referred to by Senator Feighan, can deal with the problem of second-hand smoke. On 30 January 2003, a report, The Health Effects of Environmental Tobacco Smoke in the Workplace, was published by the Health and Safety Authority and the Office of Tobacco Control. The research, which included an examination of international research, was drawn up by an independent group of scientists including specialists in toxicology, epidemiology, occupational medical services, public health medicine specialists and a radiation-aerosol physicist. The group of scientists concluded there is consensus among the international scientific community that environmental tobacco smoke in the workplace increases the risk of lung cancer by between 20% and 30% and that involuntary smoking increases the risk of heart disease in non-smokers by between 25% and 30%. Given this evidence, it cannot be said that only the smoker is harmed and it indicates the degree of addiction associated with tobacco products.</p>
          <p eId="para_388">When representatives of some of the tobacco companies attended the Committee on Health and Children, they denied to hell and back that smoking was addictive. I told one of the representatives that if the facts jumped up and bit him on the nose, he would still deny them. Not alone did the tobacco companies withstand the reduction of the level of contaminants in cigarettes, they increased it to make smoking more addictive. When one considers that smokers staring death in the face will still continue to smoke, is it not the case that, in tandem with other substance addictions, smokers suffer serious denial and delusion?</p>
          <p eId="para_389">Reference has been made to smoking among the young and to peer pressure. I agree with Senator Feighan that the health boards have done a marvellous job in promoting the anti-smoking campaign. A survey was carried out among leaving certificate students in a number of secondary colleges in County Westmeath. A very high percentage of the boys and girls smoked, notwithstanding all the publicity about the risks associated with smoking. It is a social drug, which makes it all the more dangerous. We have drug squads trying to prevent people taking drugs like LSD, yet here we have a social drug killing people on a daily basis and sending many others to our care institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_390">The group drew particular attention to the 2002 decision of the International Agency for Cancer Research of the WHO to declare environmental tobacco smoke a known carcinogen. Research shows that ventilation technologies are inadequate to give workers full protection from the hazards of tobacco smoke. The Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration in the US and the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists have concluded that even proposed new technologies such as displacement ventilation systems, which may reduce environmental tobacco smoke exposure levels by 90%, still leave exposure levels which are 1,500 to 2,000 times the acceptable risk level for hazardous air pollutants. That is an important point and should settle the argument that ventilation systems are the answer, because they are not. Senator Feighan referred to this earlier.</p>
          <p eId="para_391">The expert group concluded that a smoking ban remains the only viable control measure to ensure that workers and patrons are protected from exposure to the by-products of tobacco combustion. It is very important to bear in mind that the majority of Irish people, 70% of the population, do not smoke. The smoking ban being introduced on 29 March does not come a minute too early. If the same level of discussion and effort applied to seeking loopholes in the legislation was focused on promoting the improved environment which workers and the public can look forward to, those now voicing their concerns would be able to look forward to an opportunity to substantially improve their business and work environments. The fact that the majority of people will benefit is surely the basis on which to plan for the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_392">Irish respiratory consultants have backed the proposed workplace ban on smoking, saying it would save many people from a debilitating killer disease. The Irish Thoracic Society annual conference passed a motion urging all politicians, employers, including publicans, and the general public to support the move. Their support coincides with World Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Awareness Day. The symptoms of COPD range from coughing and sputum production to shortness of breath. It affects well over 110,000 people in Ireland and accounts for almost 10,000 hospital bed days a year. The conference heard of World Health Organisation statistics which show that Ireland has the second highest COPD mortality rate of 28 industrialised nations, behind only Hungary. We have a place on this graph of which we should not be proud.</p>
          <p eId="para_393">Vested interests here may continue to try to divert the debate on the ban away from the core issue of health, but there is no arguing with the fact highlighted by lung experts that tobacco smoking is one of the major risk factors for death and disability in Europe. A recent report from the Office of Tobacco Control indicates that the cost of smoking to the State amounts to around €5 million per day. One does not have to be a rocket scientist to work out what that costs. We should think of all the projects we could bring on stream if we did not have to spend that money. Not only will this ban save lives, but it will also save our economy money that we can put into other areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_394">It is not right to expose workers in Ireland to a carcinogenic that is as dangerous as asbestos and I welcome the Minister's courageous and relentless determination to potentially save the lives of these workers. However, we must live in the real world. We cannot expect to impose the ban everywhere people live. People have rights, even though those rights may sometimes impinge on others.</p>
          <p eId="para_395">I welcome the Bill. As the Minister said, Ireland holds the European Presidency and should show the way by ensuring the ban is effective. People have asked who will enforce the ban and I believe the public will do it. I do not doubt that. I had a group of visitors in the House yesterday from a retirement club in Mullingar. Two of them left the visitors' bar because of the amount of smoke in the atmosphere. One lady said if she stayed in the bar for any length of time, she would have to be carried out. I commend the Bill to the House and I thank Fine Gael for indicating its support. All right-minded people will support it.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryHenry" eId="spk_177">
          <from>Dr. Henry</from>
          <p eId="para_396">I welcome the Minister of State. After a lifetime in medicine I warmly welcome the legislation, but I wonder what the country is coming to. We have a major conference of our EU Presidency on sexually transmitted disease and now we are leading the way with a ban on smoking in the workplace. We are tackling incredible subjects and I am delighted to see it.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">Evidence has existed for decades suggesting that passive smoking is an extremely serious problem. There are increased incidences of respiratory disease among children and cot deaths and while we cannot say those children smoke, there are higher levels of both in households where parents smoke than in non-smoking households.</p>
          <p eId="para_398">Senator Glynn was right in describing those who smoke as engaged in long-term suicide. I was glad he also mentioned addiction, as this seems to be the most difficult addiction to deal with. I know people who gave up smoking easily and, never having smoked myself, I find it hard to understand how difficult it is for some people to give up. I am delighted more efforts are being made through the health promotion unit of the Department of Health and Children to help people give up smoking. The advertising campaigns have been very good and the help lines also appear to be useful to people.</p>
          <p eId="para_399">Senator Glynn said some people find smoking more difficult to give up than heroin. I dealt with a pregnant woman some years ago in the Rotunda who was addicted to both heroin and tobacco. The nurses' strike was on and we had to discharge her. I was concerned about her so I went to see her later that day and she was smoking at the door when I got there. She said she could keep off the heroin but not the cigarettes. She was proud of herself in hospital because neither was available. She was a very intelligent young woman and it had to be very difficult for her when she knew how much damage she was doing to herself and her unborn child.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">People in the workplace deserve our protection from passive smoking and it is right to bring in this ban. I have visited Canada since it banned smoking in restaurants and pubs and human life is continuing. The weather was cold but some people stood outside to smoke. I regret to say that they were mainly European. Knowing this debate was coming up, I asked a publican if there had been much drop in trade and he said there had been a drop in the counter trade for a while. He had made up for that with the table trade, as many more people came in to eat because there was no smoking, and when I spoke to him his bar trade had returned to what it had been.</p>
          <p eId="para_401">We have such a problem with alcohol that we should avoid too much moaning and groaning about a drop in its consumption. Yesterday on the Order of Business a Member said that children would not be able to go into pubs during the summer. The Leader said she felt a pub was a most unsuitable place to have children and I agree. I did not get a chance to agree with her because she was responding to the Order of Business. I find it profoundly depressing to see small children asleep at 10 p.m. and 11 p.m. in pubs and welcome the fact that we now take these issues more seriously.</p>
          <p eId="para_402">There has been a welcome drop in the percentage of people who smoke in Ireland to 25%. This is quite something because 20 years ago the figure was approximately 50%. We are getting somewhere and our figures are better than quite a few other countries. However, one black spot is in respect of young women, among whom there is an increase in the number who smoke. In this regard, the bans on advertising are very important.</p>
          <p eId="para_403">I listened with care to Senator Feighan's remarks about vending machines which may get around some of the proposed bans in shops. How long will retailers be given in order to change the displays in shops? Many small retailers have cigarette displays, the facades of which take up a huge amount of space advertising tobacco products.</p>
          <p eId="para_404">Excellent legislation has come before the Houses of the Oireachtas in respect of which regulations have not been introduced to enforce it and I am worried that may be the case with this Bill. I hope any regulations which are required to enforce the Bill are introduced as rapidly as possible. For example, Senator Feighan referred to candy cigarettes, which it would be a great pity not to ban because I am sure the confectionery companies would not go out of business without them. It seems ridiculous to promote cigarettes to young children in this manner and tell them later they cannot smoke.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">It has been demonstrated that young women are very much drawn towards smoking what are described as "light" cigarettes, which numerous surveys have shown are just as harmful as regular cigarettes. The associations with being slim and sexy are always present in cigarette advertisements. I was depressed to discover a few years ago that Tower Hamlets, a health district in east London, had a higher death rate from lung cancer than from breast cancer among women. It is the first place in which this happened and I would hate to see it happen here. We are making huge efforts to reduce the incidence of death from breast cancer, therefore, let us try to do the same in respect of lung cancer.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">As I walked to the House this morning, I was interested to note that almost every young woman I passed had a cigarette in her hand, although most of them must have burnt out as they walked along. There are many young women among those who smoke outside office buildings in which smoking is prohibited. The efforts made to stop women smoking will have to be redoubled.</p>
          <p eId="para_407">It is despicable to see the advertising by tobacco companies in developing countries. If we have any influence as President of the EU, I would hope we would use it to do something about this. I attended the Cairo conference on population ten years ago. The only bit of Cairo I saw were the Pyramids, beside which was the bizarre sight of an advertisement for Camel cigarettes. I suppose it is a good brand to advertise because of the presence of camels there but it was depressing to see in a country with so much poverty and in need of a great deal of health promotion.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">This legislation will be enforced by people in pubs and restaurants, certainly in the latter. It is much more difficult to get a table in a non-smoking area than a smoking area. One often has to take one in the former because there is none in the latter. I am concerned about the large number of places which are exempted from the Bill. For example, it could be hard in a nursing home for someone to say "I do not want you smoking near me", if the people are sharing a living area. I hope this will be examined carefully. We have had problems in the psychiatric service with people being rewarded with cigarettes, although the practice has stopped as far as I know. I hope we are careful in the areas which have been exempted.</p>
          <p eId="para_409">I would like to see hotels and guest houses included in the ban. They must have an adequate supply of non-smoking rooms because there is nothing worse than booking into hotel and having to take a smoking room. Most people do not want to smoke in their bedrooms. Therefore, from a commercial point of view, the hotels would be well advised to look at this because it is hard to sleep in a room in which people have smoked.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">I am glad to see the legislation about ten being the minimum size of a packet of cigarettes. This will help reduce the numbers sold to school children. I still see children being served cigarettes and I have objected. I am sorry it is not easier to make complaints about shops selling cigarettes. One would need an environmental health officer under one's arm. On one occasion when I complained, the man told me that he knew the customer's family. It is quite immaterial to me whether one is related to someone or not, one is not supposed to sell cigarettes to children. This is a difficult issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_411">Does the Minister have to make orders for sections 15 and 16, which are important parts of the Bill, or will they come into force on 29 March? I sincerely hope so. I am looking forward to seeing these measures enforced in the Dáil bars. It will be very interesting.</p>
          <p eId="para_412">Like the Minister of State, I was extremely pleased that we were one of the first countries to sign the World Health Organisation framework convention on tobacco control but I would be more pleased if we ratified it. Signing shows that the spirit is willing, but is the flesh weak? It would be great if we got around to ratifying the convention. I hope the Office of Tobacco Control will have all the powers it needs to carry out the functions which Members of the Oireachtas intend and that it will have adequate funding to do so. I am delighted to see this Bill before the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#GeraldineFeeney" eId="spk_178">
          <from>Ms Feeney</from>
          <p eId="para_413">I welcome the Minister of State to the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_414">We all knew this Bill was coming but it rings sweet in one's ear to have it before the House. I listened to Senator Feighan state that his party would support the Bill. It is getting all-party support, which is pleasing. That is the way in which we must proceed in the battle against tobacco.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">It is wonderful that Ireland, a small State on the periphery of Europe, is leading the way in the fight against tobacco. As has been rightly outlined by Senators, smoking is a huge health issue — probably one of the greatest we have ever had to deal with. It is all the more welcome that we are doing something positive by introducing this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_416">Last May, the House debated alcohol and tobacco consumption on a Private Members' motion. We were all well-versed and advised at the time by groups such as the Cancer Society, ASH and the Irish Heart Foundation. I remember being touched by correspondence I received from Dr. Fintan Howell of the Irish Medical Organisation, which outlined that 7,000 of our citizens die annually from smoking related diseases. This is a terrible scandal. If the same figure applied to deaths from road, building site or waterway accidents, the nation would search high and low for a solution to the cause.</p>
          <p eId="para_417">I was also interested to read the fact — one has to assume it is a fact when it is printed on ASH paper — that smoking kills six times more people in Ireland each year than road accidents, work accidents, drugs, murder, suicides and AIDS combined. That scared me. If the figure was a quarter of that, there would be uproar, but we sit and take it. As there is a battle on and we face opposition, people seek compromise, but there cannot be any compromise on smoking. The best compromise on smoking is not a compromise at all but an outright ban. I ask those who seek a compromise to think about what they are doing. Are all their concerns really commercial and are they putting them ahead of their workers' health? Do they honestly believe that hotel and bar workers are not entitled to the protection in the workplace that the rest of us enjoy? Do they honestly believe that there can be a compromise on health?</p>
          <p eId="para_418">I went through the Bill to find out what I might say today that was different from what I had said in the past because one feels one is repeating oneself and has said everything before. I know people do not remember it, but one feels that one is giving the same speech as seven or eight months ago. I was touched to see that the smallest amount of cigarettes that will be allowed to be sold in a packet will be 20. That will have a positive effect on those who try to buy cigarettes. I had a grin on my face when I saw that provision because I remember, when I was at secondary school, going into the shop on the corner when I went home for lunch in the middle of the day, buying loose cigarettes and putting them in the little geometry pencil box that I had in those days. If the cigarettes stayed in there for two or three days, how sick one felt after smoking stale tobacco. I am so glad teenagers now do not have to stoop so low as to carry loose cigarettes.</p>
          <p eId="para_419">The Bill is beneficial. I am the mother of four young adults — they are not so much teenagers — and three of them, to my detriment, are smokers; I hate to see them smoke. My 21 year old son said the other day that he was dying for 29 March to come because it meant that he would start saving, as he will no longer be able to spend the money that he is spending on cigarettes. That gives me confidence that the ban will work.</p>
          <p eId="para_420">As Senator Henry and Senator Feighan said, confectioners will now have to get rid of the little boxes of sweet cigarettes. I remember them too. As young girls of six years of age, we would go around with them in our mouths and stand in front of mirrors looking at ourselves with the things in our mouths and practising how to smoke the real ones. It is no wonder that so many of us smoked. We would even sharpen the ends of them and make them redder than they were when they came out of the box. The boxes had all sorts of cards in them, which meant that we were collecting cards as well as buying the packets of sweet cigarettes.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">As I said, 29 March will be a watershed in many people's lives. On the third floor of this building, where my office is located, there is one Senator who likes a cigarette. I am sure that he is watching the debate on the monitor. I said to him that I betted he would give them up and he told me to go into the Chamber and tell the House that he was waiting for 29 March to come because he is going to quit. I know several people who are using 29 March as the day that they will go cold turkey.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">In March last year, in the run-up to the date that was to be set for the smoking ban, we said the same things. The advertising we have seen has been extremely effective, especially the graphic billboards to which we have become used around the country that show blood seeping from a brain. As a non-smoker, I find that difficult to cope with so I can only imagine what it is doing to somebody who is smoking up to 40 cigarettes a day.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">We need not worry about how the ban might be policed. I doubt whether we will make much money from the penalties that are to be imposed on those who are found to be in breach of the ban because smoking has become so antisocial that smokers are feeling intimidated; they do not like being the only one or two in a large group who is smoking. Senator Henry is smiling. She said that she looked forward to seeing how the ban would work in the bars in the Oireachtas and I suppose she really means the Members' bar. I feel the ban will police itself there because so many of us are non-smokers that the smokers will feel hugely uncomfortable lighting up in front of us.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">It is terribly sad to see the amount of young women who smoke nowadays. We are all aware of it. My eyes are drawn to it the whole time because I have two young daughters, who are aged 17 and 18 respectively, who are not allowed to smoke in front of me. I do not want to hear about them smoking, but I know that they are smokers. I see other young girls like them smoking on the street or outside buildings. For whatever reason, it seems that a higher percentage of girls smoke than boys. Perhaps the girls feel that it is cool, chic or sexy, but boys do not seem to be as foolhardy about damaging their health as young women.</p>
          <p eId="para_425">I commend the Minister for bringing the Bill before the Seanad. I am glad that we have got to the point at which it will be brought into law.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DerekMcDowell" eId="spk_179">
          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_426">The Labour spokesperson, Senator Ryan, is unfortunately not able to be here today, so I am filling in for him.</p>
          <p eId="para_427">I confess to being a little confused about the purpose of the Bill. I am aware that it essentially re-enacts 14 sections of the Public Health (Tobacco) Act 2002, but I am not sure what happened to those 14 sections in the interim period. Perhaps the Minister of State could clarify for me whether, during that period, those sections were commenced or which ones were or were not commenced. Perhaps he could also clarify whether there were any prosecutions under those sections that clearly applied during the interim period and whether the view of the Department of Health and Children and the legal advice that it is getting is that the law as we thought it to be will stand up. Are we effectively admitting that the law was infirm over the past year or so, at least in respect of those 14 sections? If so, how stands any prosecution that may have been taken for offences that were created by the 2002 Act? I am interested to hear the Minister of State's clarification of those matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_428">The Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Martin, got a fair measure of grief in the Lower House due to the technical oversight, as we shall call it, of not putting the provisions through Brussels. I do not intend to repeat that today. It is remarkable that something of that nature can happen, but I am disposed to believe that it was human error and that, when one thinks of something as a public health measure, one does not think of it concerning trade restrictions. Nonetheless, it is unfortunate that it happened and it is compounded by the delay that arose subsequently in submitting to Brussels the regulations on the smoking ban in the workplace. That does not give the impression of the highest degree of confidence that one might expect from the Department or the Office of the Attorney General. The most important thing to do is to repair the infirmity. The Labour Party will co-operate in doing that and did so in the Lower House.</p>
          <p eId="para_429">On the more substantive issue, the figures adduced by the Minister during the course of his presentation are frightening. He referred to 7,500 annual deaths from tobacco related illnesses and listed a frightening number of pretty horrible diseases such as lung cancer and emphysema where smoking is a major contributor and which lead to an unpleasant death. All the figures hide the reality of individual suffering. Many of us have relatives who have been affected by cancer, heart disease and so on, brought on specifically by tobacco-related carcinogens.</p>
          <p eId="para_430">Other statistics are more interesting. The Joint Committee on Health and Children produced a report a number of years ago which suggested that 80% of all smokers start smoking between the ages of 14 and 16. This emphasises the importance of trying to discourage kids from starting to smoke. Almost everyone starts smoking at an age when it is actually illegal for them to buy cigarettes. This means we must do everything possible to cut off the various means through which children are encouraged to smoke, such as advertising, sponsorship of sport, vending machines and so on. I know this Bill is intended to deal with some of those means through which children are targeted.</p>
          <p eId="para_431">One point that is very striking is the behaviour of the tobacco companies which are huge multinational conglomerates in a very profitable industry. They were not only aware of the addictive qualities of nicotine for many years, they also hid this fact. They had a deliberate plan of concealing it for as long as possible and, to an extent, they continue to deny that nicotine is an addictive substance. It is now proven that they also added extra nicotine and carcinogenic substances to tobacco for many years to ensure they got people hooked, specifically children who were more liable to addiction. This is an unscrupulous industry that has deliberately targeted children to make exorbitant profits.</p>
          <p eId="para_432">When dealing with a multinational industry, we must act on a multinational level. There is an overwhelming argument for dealing with this on an EU basis. In that regard Ireland has been to the fore in taking a lead in issues such as the workplace ban and the ban on sponsorship. We saw very clearly what happened with the Belgian grand prix when the Belgian Government attempted to ban sponsorship and the grand prix was effectively pulled by the tobacco company that sponsored it. These companies are profitable and unscrupulous and will do everything in their interest for as long as they can continue to push the weed.</p>
          <p eId="para_433">My party supports the smoking ban, as do I personally. I agree that 29 March will be a remarkable departure if those who promised to give up smoking on that day do so. That will bring a further improvement in the numbers the Minister outlined, which I feel are already encouraging. He stated that the number of smokers was now down to 25% of the population, a reduction of 15% or 16% in a short period of time. In the past, the numbers dropped very slowly, perhaps by 1% over a two to three year period. It is probably an exaggeration to refer to the recent reduction as a collapse but it is significant and suggests that with a concerted effort over a whole range of areas — health promotion, prevention of tobacco companies targeting children or trying to break the links between the movie industry, sport and smoking — results can be achieved. What is most important is that it is no longer trendy to smoke in Ireland. That is something which produces a momentum. When smokers are under threat there is a social pressure which is probably the most important factor in reducing the number of smokers. Legislation can play its part but ultimately it is people's evaluation of themselves and social pressure that will bring about the reduction we all seek.</p>
          <p eId="para_434">There has been some reference to the nanny state and its effects. This is an argument with which we must engage. The suggestion is that it should be entirely up to individuals whether they choose to smoke. However, there is a likelihood that sooner or later one will become a burden on the State and its taxpayers because one will end up in hospital requiring lengthy treatment. Moreover, passive smoking damages the health of others so it is not a choice for individual smokers and is one they cannot be allowed to make. If we can use the law as well as social pressure to discourage people from smoking, then that is what we should do.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FeargalBrowne" eId="spk_180">
          <from>Mr. Browne</from>
          <p eId="para_435">It is obviously an embarrassment for the Government to be back here only two years after the Public Health (Tobacco) Act 2002 was enacted. A catalogue of mistakes were made in a straightforward Act, the first of which was the failure to notify. We are now back dealing with the Bill, some aspects of which amuse me. I do not agree with my colleagues about the idea of banning the retail sale of cigarette packs of less than 20. That would lead to an increase in smoking. The reality is that if one buys 20 sweets instead of ten, one will probably consume them all. I can see the logic of it from one angle but I can also see the other side of the argument, even the fact that it is targeted at children. There will always be someone who wants to scrounge cigarettes and one would be far less inclined to share from a box of ten than a box of 20. I never smoked, as I have enough bad habits between drinking and politics, but I have noticed this among friends of mine who smoke. I always resented that some people felt an obligation to scrounge cigarettes, they never had money to afford their own. That is one downside of a sales ban on cigarette packs of less than 20.</p>
          <p eId="para_436">Some of us are getting a little carried away and we are forgetting that we are dealing with humans. The road to hell is paved with good intentions. I was amused when Senator Feeney spoke about her son and his decision to quit smoking on 29 March and that from then on he would become an excellent human being. I would love to see a debate in six months among all these smokers who are now going to stop smoking and lead a fantastically healthy lifestyle. I am conscious of this myself. Last year I did a ten mile road race in Ballycotton and promised myself afterwards that I would lose weight and exercise. Next Sunday I will do the same race, unfortunately the same weight as last year if not slightly heavier, with less training done than this time last year in spite of my good intentions. Perhaps I am an exception, but I think I suffer from human frailties like everyone else. I was speaking to a lady in Carlow County Council a few moments ago. She is delighted the ban is being implemented on 29 March because she wants to give up smoking. I joked with her that it might not happen. I do not think it will happen because many people will still smoke. If one asks anyone on the street on New Year's Eve about their new year's resolution, most will say they are going to the gym three times a week at least, they are giving up the drink for weeks on end, eating healthy food and cooking at home. The reality is, however, that by February or March the gyms are fairly empty.</p>
          <p eId="para_437">The smoking ban is a smokescreen for the Government's failure in many areas of health. The Minister, Deputy Martin, has got away with blue murder by introducing the smoking ban and diverting people's attention from the real health issues. The Minister will be aware of a case I brought to his attention recently, in which I acknowledge he has been of assistance. The case involved a 48 year old stroke victim from Carlow, who cannot get into the St. Michael's Rehabilitation Hospital in Dún Laoghaire and faces going to Bristol. We have heard nothing recently about the diagnostic health centres earmarked in the health strategy. These are the real health issues but the smoking ban has been used to try to divert the public's attention from them.</p>
          <p eId="para_438">I wonder where will we be in six months or a year. I suspect the ban will not be implemented in many pubs. The Minister might correct me but, as far as I am aware, there are 10,000 pubs in Dublin and 10,000 outside Dublin. It appears that 31 health inspectors will monitor the situation, which does not appear adequate. We are very quick in Ireland to introduce legislation but we are very bad at enacting it. Earlier this week, the ban on cocktails was raised in the Seanad, because the legislation was passed but it has not been enforced. There are other issues such as "happy hour" and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_439">I query the ban on advertising cigarettes. The advertisements on cigarette boxes are very graphic. They list the side effects of smoking and indicate that smoking kills. When I ask my friends if it has an impact on them, they say it has not. They choose to smoke, even though they are aware of the health implications. Advertising the health risks makes no difference, because people will still smoke.</p>
          <p eId="para_440">It is all very well to talk about banning sponsorship by tobacco companies, which is acceptable in regard to major events. I am conscious, however, that many smaller county football teams, juvenile teams and so on are heavily dependent on such sponsorship. Anyone involved in sporting or voluntary organisations will be aware that one does not have a long line of sponsors knocking on one's door each day offering to sponsor teams. One would be very lucky to get one person to sponsor them. This aspect of the legislation should be looked at again. There should not be an outright ban in this regard because it could have a devastating effect on small rural communities. I can see the logic behind it but I query it.</p>
          <p eId="para_441">When the smoking ban is introduced, in reality people will not be allowed to smoke in pubs, therefore, vending machines should not be allowed in pubs. Why put temptation in the way of people? At the beginning of the night, when people are sober, they may adhere to the law, but towards midnight, after a few pints, they might look for a cigarette. Having vending machines on the premises may be putting temptation in their way. We all know the story of Adam and Eve and, unfortunately, we have not learned anything from it.</p>
          <p eId="para_442">While I am anti-smoking, I am annoyed about some of the stupid arguments put forward on the smoking ban. <i>The Irish Times</i> quoted a survey carried out in a hospital where 95% of patients were smokers. It concluded that smoking caused these people to be in hospital, which is not the case. There are genetic factors and so on involved, therefore, we should not get too carried away with the smoking ban. We should be careful how we analyse results and figures.</p>
          <p eId="para_443">In my 30 years, I have noticed a big change in the gender balance of smokers. Far fewer boys smoke than girls. Perhaps girls smoke in order to lose weight and so on. I am aware that the Department of Health and Children is tackling the issue of obesity and weight management. I do not know how we can prevent girls from smoking. Boys appear to smoke less and less but, unfortunately, girls appear to smoke more and more.</p>
          <p eId="para_444">When the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, was last in the House, I asked how the Government plans to deal with the projected loss of revenue from the sale of cigarettes. Perhaps it will save money in the long term in terms of health but that could be in 20 or 30 years' time. In the meantime, if more people stop smoking there will be a severe loss of revenue from the sale of cigarettes. How much revenue does the Minister of State anticipate will be lost?</p>
          <p eId="para_445">If the smoking ban is to be successful, it will have to be EU-wide. Given that Ireland holds the Presidency of the EU, has the Minister used his unique position to promote the ban on smoking EU-wide and what has been the reaction in other countries?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#UlickBurke" eId="spk_181">
          <from>Mr. U. Burke</from>
          <p eId="para_446">I welcome and support the legislation. However, the Government must take responsibility for much of the uncertainty about the legislation because of the extension of dates and mistakes made when drafting the Bill initially which resulted in loopholes that could be contested. All of this led to uncertainty. If there is a difficulty in implementing the legislation, surely it is as a result of the inadequacy of the original legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_447">I ask the Minister of State to give an undertaking that health boards will no longer be allowed to use children as pawns, investigators or testers by being sent into various premises to purchase cigarettes. As a former member of a health board, I have asked the CEO of the Western Health Board on various occasions to stop using children in court cases to prove a particular person sold cigarettes to under age people. This is wrong. If this continues following the enactment of the legislation, it will be a criminal act on the part of health boards or other agencies who use children in this way.</p>
          <p eId="para_448">There have been headlines in local newspapers of court proceedings where the health board fined the owners of premises because cigarettes were sold to children. There is something terribly wrong with an official of a health board sending children into a premises to try to buy cigarettes. I ask the Minister of State to immediately issue health boards with a directive to desist from such an activity. Various Senators said that they see many young people, particularly young girls, smoking cigarettes in public. How can we reconcile that with the health board, as the agency of the Minister in this instance, testing the effectiveness of the ban by using children? Is there nothing else in this Bill whereby we can test the effectiveness of legislation other than to use children? I ask the Minister of State to stop this continuing.</p>
          <p eId="para_449">Those of us who, during a daily routine, go into various places with which we would normally associate smoking, such as pubs, have no doubt that the air is cleaner and that people are now conscious of the need for cleaner air and the need to stop smoking. It is difficult to reconcile with the legislation the list of exemptions made. As Senator Browne said earlier, the Minister has never given any justification for them. There is no justification for this list of exemptions, particularly as they relate to health situations. We are talking about health, and the diseases caused by smoking, yet these irreconcilable exemptions are made.</p>
          <p eId="para_450">The Minister mentioned the importance of education regarding non-smoking. We are supposedly putting forward education as a way in which we can strengthen the smoking ban, but whether it is the Minister for Education and Science or the Minister for Health and Children who will take responsibility, the Government has done nothing except put the notion on paper and abandon it. It has been simply pushed out in the public arena so that someone or some enthusiastic group might take it on, such as teachers or health advisers. We have done nothing to follow through on it. If we intend to use the idea of education as a means of reducing smoking, we must do something by way of follow-up and encouragement, in whatever way we can, to provide the wherewithal. We might send advertising into the schools, or use some information process, rather than just letting the notion stand and hoping something will happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_451">Senator Feeney said that the public will enforce this legislation. It is a weak and wishful position if the legislation is being published in the hope that the public will implement it. If the legislation in this instance is based on that strategy, as the only effective way of implementing it, God help us. It will not work. The idea of using "reasonable force" is not practicable. We are putting something on paper and we must find better ways of implementing this legislation by way of encouragement regarding the health aspects and asking people to do the right thing, which will benefit us all as citizens. We face great difficulties here and the uncertainty we had before is shown repeatedly in the provisions of this Bill, and in the initial failure to bring forward an Act without having to withdraw it and amend it to such an extent. We might be the leaders in Europe in this area. We might have hastily put together this legislation to show we are doing something in the health area, but it is too important for such an approach. I hope the Bill succeeds, but the record of the Minister and the Department regarding this legislation has been unbelievable, uncertain and woolly, to say the least.</p>

          <p eId="para_453">I listened with interest to the last few speakers and I have been monitoring the debate. Senator Burke indicated much concern about the Public health (Tobacco) (Amendment) Bill 2003. He gave a wide berth to the provision and delivery of our health services. Senator Browne gave them a similarly wide berth and indicated that the Bill is a smokescreen, using that word as a pun I presume. We can measure what we have done in the health area under Fianna Fáil-led Administrations since 1997. We can also measure what was done prior to 1997. We remember that one of the illustrious leaders of Fine Gael was Minister for Health and some people will remember him for the particular manner in which he went about his business, which may not have been seen at the time, or even today, as compassionate as some people might have liked.</p>

I would like to use one particular measure to endorse what I believe is the very strong commitment of Fianna Fáil-led Administrations since 1997 regarding the improvement of our health services. Two very good strategies have been introduced, in the cardiovascular and cancer areas. People ask what the good is in coming up with a piece of paper and they say that there must be funding to back it up. In 1997-8 we spent approximately €3 billion on our health services. In 2003 the final spend on health was approximately €9.2 billion. Accordingly, we have trebled the money put into health.</p>

I am a former smoker and I am not that different from many other former smokers in that when I decided to give up cigarette smoking, I did not do so on my first attempt. It takes a number of attempts and it is quite difficult for those who are addicted. Giving up smoking is quite a difficult process and there are many failures. However, this Bill is not only about giving up smoking; it is about the quality of the environment in the workplace. We are not asking people to cut off their fingers to stop smoking. We are saying people should be able to go to work and enjoy their work in unpolluted, environmentally friendly circumstances. If that leads to more people kicking the habit, it will be tremendous. Supports are in place to assist people who need to kick the habit.</p>

          <p eId="para_485">I will try to clarify that issue for the Senator but my information is that they are being re-enacted on legal advice and were never commenced.</p>
          <p eId="para_486">Public health authorities in many countries have grappled with the problem of how to prevent people taking up smoking and how to get smokers to break their addiction once established. The introduction of the Public Health (Tobacco) (Amendment) Bill is innovative. I have been contacted by a number of member states and have done a number of radio and television interviews. Some member states are looking at the innovative measures Ireland is now applying and will closely monitor the success or otherwise of this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_487">We all acknowledge there is no single solution to dealing with the tobacco epidemic. A comprehensive approach of the type being undertaken by the Government through the Public Health (Tobacco) Act 2002, this amending Bill and through education, information and smoking cessation programmes is necessary to maintain the battle against tobacco on all fronts. Strong legislative measures will remain an important public health instrument in countering the tobacco threat.</p>
          <p eId="para_488">Much has been achieved to date in reducing the incidence of smoking among our population. The level of smoking of 27%, which the surveys have shown, is in stark contrast to the level of 43% which prevailed in the 1970s. This welcome reduction translates into lives saved, serious illnesses prevented and avoidance of the pain and suffering involved in death brought on by tobacco-related diseases such as lung cancer and emphysema.</p>
          <p eId="para_489">I am also aware that much effort in promoting and supporting tobacco free initiatives has been, and is being, carried out by a range of groups and organisations. I take this opportunity to congratulate them and wish them continued success in the various mechanisms being undertaken. The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children published two reports on health and smoking and their conclusions left no one in any doubt of the nature of the threat posed by tobacco consumption. I also take the opportunity to congratulate a number of legal practices in Ireland which are closely monitoring the issue of litigation against some of the tobacco companies. I understand solicitors Ward and Fitzpatrick have initiated proceedings in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_490">The cardiovascular health strategy group, Shaping Healthier Hearts, also made clear the importance of reducing smoking levels to reduce the incidence of heart disease, one of the greatest causes of mortality in Ireland. Organisations such as the Irish Cancer Society and the Irish Heart Foundation carry out splendid work in advancing the health message in the field of smoking cessation. The positive health message is getting through. Smoking tobacco products and environmental tobacco smoke are seen for what they are because direct and second hand smoke inhalation causes grave and serious risk to individuals and significant risk to the health of the smoker and non-smokers.</p>
          <p eId="para_491">The introduction of smoke free indoor workplaces from 29 March will be another positive step in the smoke free initiative that the Government is undertaking. Many workplaces are smoke free and employers and employees realise the benefits of working and socialising in a clean, smoke free environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_492">Addiction to tobacco-based nicotine is powerful and difficult to break. As a former smoker, I understand the difficulties smokers experience while trying to quit. According to research, most smokers commence their addiction before adulthood. Most people who quit only succeed after a number of attempts. The Department of Health and Children is undertaking an enhanced smoking cessation programme to further assist people trying to quit. Services available to smokers wishing to quit are being used more frequently. The national smokers quit line is well established and widely used. More than 14,000 people have called the number since it was set up last October. Nicotine replacement therapy was made available to all medical card holders who smoke. The national Break The Habit campaign was developed on a partnership basis between the Department, the Irish Cancer Society and the health boards. Additional smoking cessation officers have been recruited by the health boards.</p>
          <p eId="para_493">Not long ago, smoking was considered the norm, despite increasing health concerns about the effects of tobacco smoke. The intervention of successive Governments on public health grounds across a wide front has achieved much in reducing tobacco smoking and exposure to tobacco smoke. Credit must be given to my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Martin, and the Government for bringing forward this powerful, positive legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_494">Tobacco use remains a significant burden on individuals, families and society through death, illness and medical costs. The positive measure being undertaken across a broad front in reducing tobacco use will increase life expectancy in Ireland and result in happier, healthier people and a better quality of life for all. I thank the Members for their contributions.</p>

          <p eId="para_497">I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House to respond to my motion concerning the refusal of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to grant visitor visas to Nana Kwyku Agyeman, who was born on 23 June 1994, and Kofio Oppoku Agyeman, who was born on 7 July 1990. They are both minors. These boys have applied through their mother, Mrs. Agatha Agyeman, and her husband, both Irish citizens, living in Newtownforbes, County Longford, to come to Ireland on visitor visas to see their young sister, Nina, aged three years, who is terminally ill. It is important for them to make this visit while her condition still allows her to recognise them.</p>
          <p eId="para_498">Nina suffers from metachromatic leukodystrophy, a degenerative, progressive brain disease, which is likely to be fatal. Nina is unable to walk or sit and drools while trying to speak or eat. Her condition is deteriorating and her prognosis is extremely poor as she experiences rapid regression in all aspects of development together with a loss of all cognitive abilities. The diagnosis and Nina's condition are causing great distress to her parents. Their emotional state and well-being would be greatly helped by seeing their sons and having them meet their sister while she is still able to recognise them. I cannot stress more strongly the extreme need for this family to be united for however short a time.</p>
          <p eId="para_499">There is absolutely no grounds for thinking these boys will not honour a visitor visa and I ask the Minister of State to outline further requirements that could be fulfilled to enable the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to make a positive decision in favour of them and allow this little girl and her parents the comfort and joy of seeing these boys again.</p>

The case centres on the Ghanaian parents of an Irish born child who have been granted permission to reside in the State on that basis. The parents came to Ireland through the United Kingdom and made asylum applications in December 2000. One month later they had a child in Ireland and withdrew that claim. The child is seriously ill and the prognosis is poor. Her parents applied for residency on the basis of parentage of that child and this was granted in February 2002. The visa applications are for the purpose of allowing their two Ghanaian sons, aged 9 and 13, to come to Ireland. Both children are attending school in Ghana and are being looked after by relatives. For the purpose of completeness, it would appear from information supplied in connection with their asylum claim that they have two other children, aged 15 and 12, who are also resident in Ghana.</p>

          <from>Mr. Callely</from>
          <p eId="para_502">However, there are another two children. The Refugee Act 1996 contains provisions which oblige the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to allow family reunification to certain family members of refugees, including a spouse and dependent children. This provision operates on the premise that, since a person who has refugee status is unable to return to his or her country through fear of persecution, it is a reasonable and humanitarian gesture to allow other close family members to join them in Ireland. However, the couple in this case are not refugees. Nonetheless, it has also been the general policy of successive Ministers to operate a similar policy in respect of persons who were given leave to remain in the State on the basis of having an Irish born child. It is important to bear in mind, however, that the policy was a concession and that the family in Ireland did not enjoy a statutory right to be joined by the family member in question.</p>
          <p eId="para_503">Following the decision of the Supreme Court in the cases of L and O, the separate procedure which then existed to enable persons to apply to reside in the State on the sole basis of parentage of an Irish born child ended on 19 February 2003. The Government also decided that the general policy of allowing such parents to be joined in the State by other family members would no longer apply. Accordingly, the immigration division of the Minister's Department does not generally approve visas for family reunification in such cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_504">As Senators will be aware, the issue of claims for leave to remain in the State by the non-national parents of an Irish born child has been a matter of serious concern to Government for some time. A claimed right to reside in Ireland based solely on the birth of a child in Ireland came to be used as a method of attempting to circumvent normal immigration controls. The scale of this issue had grown considerably in recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_505">Evidence suggested that a significant proportion of adult female asylum applicants were pregnant upon arrival in the State and that their decision to seek asylum in Ireland was, at least in part, motivated by the anticipation of the benefits which might accrue to themselves and their families as a result of that child being born in Ireland. That concern extended to the knock-on consequences of granting permission to remain to the parents of Irish born children and the extent to which the vehicle of family re-unification was being used to bring other family members into the State. In many cases the extent of the prior existing relationship between parent and child was by no means clear. It has been estimated that for every applicant for leave to remain on the basis of an Irish born child, there are an average of two family members who could seek to join them in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_506">The general position on the granting of visas is as follows. In Ireland, as in all countries, the visa system is predicated on credibility. Is the stated purpose of the visit the true purpose of the visit? Every visa applicant is required to make a declaration to the following effect:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_507">I declare that I have understood all the questions relating to this application and that, to the best of my knowledge, the details I have given are correct and complete.</p>
          <p eId="para_508">The thrust of Senator Bannon's motion is to ask the Minister to review, on compassionate grounds, the decision to refuse visitors' visas, and he put the case very well. One of the considerations that attends a determination of this nature is, of course, the reality, despite the unfortunate circumstances of the case, that the acquisition of a visitor's visa could be used as a means to circumvent the general policy being adopted on family re-unification in these cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_509">The details of the visa applications made in this case are relevant in this context. The applicants are 13 and nine years of age respectively. Both visa applications stated that the purpose of the visit was to re-unite with members of the family who are resident here. Lest there be any doubt about this matter, the box for the date on which the children in question proposed to leave Ireland was left blank. Instead, the application contained a statement to the effect that they would leave "as soon as practicable". Consequently, these visa applications were considered as applications to come to Ireland to reside permanently with the family.</p>
          <p eId="para_510">Therefore, the proposition which the Minister is being asked to address in this debate was never put to his staff in the first place. What was put to his staff was a proposition that the children be allowed to re-unite with their family and that the intention was that they would return at a date which was practicable. It would appear that the children will arrive unaccompanied from Ghana and there is no information on the manner in which the children will return home.</p>
          <p eId="para_511">Given the unfortunate circumstances of the case and the proposition contained in Senator Bannon's motion, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is prepared to instruct his staff to give consideration to this matter on the basis that it constitutes an application for a visitor's visa. What he wants, however, is a truthful account of the intentions of the family in question and an indication that those who have supported these visa applications are satisfied that the children will return home. If the true intention is to visit their sister, the Minister would like an indication of when it is intended that the children will return home. He also requires details of the arrangements which will apply to their return home, for example, who will accompany the children, will return tickets be purchased and will the arrangements which currently apply for their care in Ghana be available to them when they return? A letter containing this additional information should be sent to the visas section in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, whereupon the matters will be reconsidered as applications for a visitors' visas. Should Senator Bannon need more information I will be happy to give him my advice and assistance.</p>

          <from>Mr. Feighan</from>
          <p eId="para_513">I raise the question of the need for the Minister for Health and Children to indicate whether the function of the interim registrars who register births, marriages and deaths, especially in the Western Health Board area, will continue to operate in the future. If not, will the Minister outline the redundancy package offered to them?</p>
          <p eId="para_514">This is a vexed question for members of the community who have offered a sterling service registering births, marriages and deaths. This method of registration is prevalent in the Western Health Board area, particularly in my county. Private registrars have entered into this arrangement with enthusiasm and have done their work in a professional manner and at a very low cost to the health board and to the Government. Private registrars can register a birth or death for less than 50 cent, before tax.</p>
          <p eId="para_515">The future position of these registrars is not secure. They want to know if their position will continue into the future. They are more than willing to continue to offer this very worthwhile service. If not, they want to know what redundancy package the health board or the Department will offer. These questions have been asked many times in the Dáil and Seanad. I hope the Minister of State will not give the same vague answer which has been given so often in recent years. I hope he has something worthwhile to offer which will appease these people, who want to work for the State but who want to know what remuneration package the Government has put in place for them. I hope the Minister of State will give me good news which I can bring back to my constituency.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#IvorCallely" eId="spk_218">
          <from>Mr. Callely</from>
          <p eId="para_516">Births, stillbirths and Roman Catholic marriages are registered by the registrar of births, deaths and marriages for the district in which the event occurred, as provided in the Births and Deaths Registration Acts 1863 to 1996 and the Registration of Marriages Act 1863. As the Senator is aware the provisions of the new Civil Registration Act 2004, when introduced, will replace these provisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_517">The health boards discharge the functions of the superintendent registrars and in future will become the new local registration authorities, as provided by the Act. Registrars are mainly employees of the health boards. In addition to health board personnel there are some 67 private registrars appointed under the Acts to register births, stillbirths, Roman Catholic marriages and deaths in their designated districts.</p>
          <p eId="para_518">This group largely comprises private individuals who provide a service from their own homes and general practitioners who provide a service from their offices. Some private registrars are also full-time employees of the health board. All such appointments are made by the health board. While their letter of appointment stipulated the term of their appointment up to the age of 65, some have been allowed to continue after that age.</p>
          <p eId="para_519">The level of business transacted by most private registrars varies considerably. In 2002, some 47 registered from four to 100 events, 16 registered between 100 and 200 events, two registered between 200 and 400 events and two registered between 1,000 and 2,500 events.</p>
          <p eId="para_520">Persons appointed by registrars who are not permanent and pensionable employees of the health boards derive income from fees for registrations and from fees for certificates issued by them. These fees are set out in statutory instruments, including S.I. 278 of 1987, which sets out the principal fees for the registration of events and the issue of certificates. In particular and limited circumstances a registrar may issue a certificate which is compiled from an entry in a register in which amendments have been made. The fees for such certificates are set out in S.I. 234 of 1987. In discussing plans for the modernisation of the civil registration service, some private registrars asked for a severance payment — many are over 65 years of age. To consider the issue, Department of Finance officials requested that the contractual relationships of private registrars be established. Legal advice obtained from the Office of the Attorney General on the matter indicates that no contract of employment exists under the current terms of employment. Officials from my Department and the Department of Social and Family Affairs, the Department with responsibility for the Civil Registration Act 2004, are holding discussions with the Department of Finance concerning the issue of entitlement to payments, if any, on the cessation of service of a private registrar.</p>
          <p eId="para_521">All registration staff, including private registrars, will be re-appointed on the commencement of the relevant part of the Civil Registration Act 2004. Private registrars, therefore, will continue to provide a paper based service as heretofore in respect of births and deaths and will facilitate the return of the new marriage registration document when introduced. The events registered in this manner will be subsequently entered on the electronic database.</p>
          <p eId="para_522">The provisions covering the administration of the Civil Registration Service in the Civil Registration Bill will require each health board to draw up a scheme for the administration and delivery of the service in its area. In drawing up such a scheme, it will be necessary to review current locations, the range of services provided at each location and the need to provide an enhanced service to customers. This may lead to a rationalisation of civil registration services locations through the merging of offices or co-location with other health board services.</p>
          <p eId="para_523">Some rationalisation of health board staffed locations has already occurred. This was deemed necessary so as to be able to provide an improved service to customers, to maximise resources and meet future needs of the service, for example, the registration office in Trim was amalgamated with the office in Navan. Other proposals are in the pipeline, for example, providing civil marriage services from one main centre in a county, such as in Waterford or in Wexford.</p>
          <p eId="para_524">As the current number of registrations at many private registrars' locations does not exceed 100 per year, installing network computers, PCs, printers and so on would not be feasible from a cost or a security perspective. However, account must be taken of geographic factors, for example, the offshore islands. Therefore, it will be necessary to continue to operate a paper based registration system for some time in these locations. The events registered in this manner will be subsequently entered on the electronic database. Such registrars will facilitate the issue of certificates.</p>
          <p eId="para_525">Section 17 of the Civil Registration Act provides for the continuance in office of existing registrars of births, stillbirths and marriages. As the implementation of the provisions of the Act will take some time, there will be no immediate change in the current duties of private registrars. Private registrars will continue to retain fees for all certificates issued.</p>
          <p eId="para_526">However, the introduction of the new marriage provisions will lead to some change. On implementation of the new provisions, all marriage notifications must be made at health board staffed registration offices, as all couples will be required to electronically sign a declaration that they are free to marry. This is necessary so as to be able to electronically produce the marriage registration form, which will incorporate the details supplied at notification including the couple's signatures. Private registrars could accept a signed marriage registration form and forward it to the superintendent registrar.</p>
          <p eId="para_527">I trust this clarifies the future position of registrars following the completion of the rollout of the new civil registration system and commencement of the provisions of the Civil Registration Act 2004. I note that Senator Feighan referred specifically to a redundancy package as well as to whether interim registrars will continue to operate. I have tried to outline the situation as best I can. Some private registrars have already raised with the Department the issue of entitlement to a severance package and many registrars over 65 years had sought an extension of the existing contractual arrangements. The Department of Finance's officials are looking at contractual relationships that can be established with private registrars and will seek advice from the Office of the Attorney General. However, to date, the advice indicates there is no contract of employment under the current terms. Discussions are ongoing so we have not come to a dead end. The issue of entitlement, if any, is under discussion. Should Senator Feighan wish to bring an issue to my attention, I will have it clarified for him.</p>

          <from>Mr. McHugh</from>
          <p eId="para_529">I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Callely, to the House and express my appreciation for the time he is taking to listen to the Adjournment matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_530">I welcome yesterday's announcement of short-term funding to address the functionality and day to day running of St. Eunan's College. The board of management of St. Eunan's College and the school itself have asked that I raise on the Adjournment the plans envisaged for the school extension. It is now seven years since St. Eunan's College applied for an extension and a sense of disillusionment and frustration with the process has set in. What mechanism is in place to deal with the proposed extension of St. Eunan's College?</p>
          <p eId="para_531">In addition, Ballyraine national school applied in the early 1980s for a school building project. What I sense from both boards of management is complete and utter frustration with the process as they have nothing to aim towards. Politicians, for example, have a date to aim for, 11 June 2004, the local elections, which gives us drive. However, there is no mechanism in the administrative procedures of the Department that sets out the timeframe for building projects. Does the "advanced architectural stage" of Ballyraine national school mean anything? The school needs a timeframe and a date which indicates when it will go to an advanced architectural stage. What are the terms of reference of the band system and the category into which St. Eunan's College falls? St. Eunan's College is in the necessary band which is below the urgent band. What are the terms of reference of the necessary band? The school has nothing to focus on and it does not know what it should aim towards. I ask the Minister of State to digress from his script.</p>

          <from>Mr. Callely</from>
          <p eId="para_534">On replying to the second Adjournment matter, I said I had provided two out of two. I am hoping to satisfy the House by giving it three out of three.</p>
          <p eId="para_535">I thank Senator McHugh for raising the matter of St. Eunan's College, Letterkenny, and for providing me with the opportunity to respond without using a script to some of his points. The list of summer work schemes has been published. These are the works which are possible and which can be accommodated within the finite resources and timeframe available. I did not come to the House with information on Ballyraine as the school was not mentioned in the notice of this Adjournment matter. While I do not know what stage of advanced architectural planning it is at, I undertake to ensure that my officials, who are listening to the debate, will respond directly to the Senator over the next seven to ten days. I hope their response will be positive.</p>
          <p eId="para_536">A full design team has been appointed and architectural planning of the major project at St. Eunan's College, Letterkenny, is progressing well. The school is listed in section 9 of the 2004 school building programme, which is published on the website of the Department of Education and Science. The proposed project is at stage one of architectural planning, which relates to site suitability and the site survey. The project has been assigned a band three rating by the Department in accordance with the published criteria for prioritising large-scale projects. I will obtain for the Senator the detail of the published criteria to allow him to inform himself of the way in which the band rating was assigned.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">The Senator is correct to indicate that service providers in education and other sectors have been somewhat frustrated about the mechanism in place for large-scale projects. Rather than provide annual budgets, it is considered that a better mechanism involving multi-annual budget allocations or envelopes is required. Such a mechanism would inform service providers of exactly what money was available for a project. One of the achievements of our brilliant Minister for Finance has been the implementation of a mechanism to respond positively to the frustrations outlined by Senator McHugh. The people involved in service provision in whatever area are the ones who know what is required to develop necessary infrastructure and large-scale projects. They know those requirements cannot be met over a short duration and that it is best to proceed through a planned process which allows them to tap into a system of multi-annual allocations.</p>
          <p eId="para_538">In the case of St. Eunan's College, the key strategy going forward will involve the budget 2004 announcement of multi-annual allocations for capital investment in education projects. All projects not moving to construction stage as part of the 2004 school building programme, including St. Eunan's College, will be re-evaluated with a view to including them in the multi-annual building programme from 2005. The Department of Education and Science will make a further announcement on this matter during the year.</p>
          <p eId="para_539">I hope my reply addresses some of the issues quite rightly and forcefully raised by Senator McHugh in relation to St. Eunan's College. I hope Senator McHugh has an opportunity to consider and digest our current status in the context of the need for multi-annual envelopes for projects of this nature. I will discuss the matter with my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey. If I receive any further information, I will let Senator McHugh know what progress is being made on projects which require multi-annual envelopes.</p>
