          <from>Mr. Rabbitte:</from>
          <p eId="para_18">Does the Taoiseach acknowledge that, in terms of expenditure, there is still an information deficit, which was revealed as  recently as this morning in the latest Eurobarometer poll? It showed that 30% of our citizens have heard of the Convention on the Future of Europe compared with an average of 39% across Europe. Does the Taoiseach foresee a role for the forum in promoting knowledge of the Convention? Has he plans in that regard?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_3">
          <from>The Taoiseach:</from>
          <p eId="para_19">It is not for me to set the forum's agenda but I hope it has been presented with copies of the Convention report and the new constitution. I understand the forum is also producing a second video for distribution to all second level schools and will undertake a number of other initiatives in the regions, which are helpful and necessary.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_4">
          <from>Mr. Kenny:</from>
          <p eId="para_20">The forum organised 21 events this year compared with 40 last year. Does the Taoiseach agree that, in a year when the European Convention produced a draft constitutional treaty and a new Intergovernmental Conference has commenced, the forum should promote more public meetings? If that does not happen, we will be in the same position as applied prior to the first Nice referendum with the public prepared to reject a proposal on the basis of lack of information.</p>
          <p eId="para_21">When I recently criticised a 54% cut in the forum's budget, a statement immediately issued from the forum which said it was happy with the amount allocated. While that is a matter for the forum, it is not usual for such an agency to make such a comment. Will the Taoiseach clarify that no official in his Department was associated with the issuance of the statement relating to the forum and its work?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_5">
          <from>The Taoiseach:</from>
          <p eId="para_22">That is a matter for the forum but I saw both statements. I saw the forum's statement before I even read the Deputy's remarks and, therefore, had no involvement with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_23">With regard to his first question, the meetings are continuing. I am careful not to try to set the forum's agenda. There were not large attendances at many of the regional meetings but I agree with the continuation of meetings. I attended a number of them in the run-up to the Nice referendum. They are useful and a good way to provide an information base. If we are approaching the conclusion of the Convention, the forum should continue to hold sessions to explain it because those who attend them are genuinely interested and are opinion formers on these issues.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_6">
          <from>Mr. Kenny:</from>
          <p eId="para_24">The Taoiseach may well have serious matters to deal with during his Presidency of the Union from January to June 2004, as a result of which there will be another constitutional referendum. Should the Government and the Taoiseach allow the forum to hold as many meetings as it thinks appropriate throughout the  State as ideal preparation for the putting of a complex question to the people following the Intergovernmental Conference? While the Taoiseach does not set the agenda, he should make it clear he will provide resources to the forum to hold however many public meetings it thinks fit.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_7">
          <from>The Taoiseach:</from>
          <p eId="para_25">I agree with Deputy Kenny with regard to that issue. He raised it with me at the previous session of the forum and I stated publicly that it would be the position.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TrevorSargent" eId="spk_8">
          <from>Mr. Sargent:</from>
          <p eId="para_26">The Taoiseach referred to a figure of €3 million. Is that in line with the Government Estimates breakdown of January 2003, which gave a figure of €197,000 for 2001, €2 million for 2002 and €700,000 for 2003? That amounts to a slightly smaller figure. Is the Taoiseach in a position to say whether it includes the cost of producing the draft constitution which the forum launched, or is that yet to be reported? Has he a figure in respect of that cost? Will additional copies of the document be printed for wider distribution, having regard to the indication from the recent Eurobarometer poll that 71% of the Irish people – far higher than most European countries – wished to read a summary of the constitution, if not the full document? Is an allocation being provided in line with the forum budget to ensure that will be available? Will the forum have a specific additional role in this regard during the Irish Presidency of the EU, as well as during the run-up to the referendum on the new EU constitution? Has any role been envisaged by the Government in that regard?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_9">
          <from>The Taoiseach:</from>
          <p eId="para_27">The forum had a very busy year in 2002 in which it spent almost €2 million. The figure for 2003 up to the end of October, at €808,000, is in excess of that mentioned by the Deputy for this year. I am aware that the constitutional document was widely circulated but I am not aware of any plans for further circulation. However, the Government will continue to try to resource the work of the forum. I believe its meetings are receiving considerable attention. The information available to me is that it has prepared and circulated a summary booklet on the draft treaty to establish a constitution for Europe and a glossary of terms. I do not have a figure for the number of copies printed.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeHiggins" eId="spk_10">
          <from>Mr. J. Higgins:</from>
          <p eId="para_28">Does the Government envisage giving new guidelines to the forum for the wide debate which should now open up on the proposed new EU constitution? Has the Government ideas as to how this debate can take place to the widest possible extent? Does the Taoiseach agree that there continue to be diverse views on the proposed EU constitution and that it is very important that both sides of the argument are heard? Does he agree that, on one side of the argument, those opposed to some of the structures of a Europe dominated by big business should not be at a disadvantage because of a lack  of resources? Has the Taoiseach an inkling of the timescale for a referendum on the proposed future EU constitution? Incidentally, if it does not go the Government's way the first time, will there be a re-run?</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach:</from>
          <p eId="para_30">I believe the debate to which the Deputy referred is under way. There have been a number of forum sessions on the EU constitution. The last of which I attended involved people of divergent views on both sides of the argument. That debate is being well managed by the forum and should continue. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, and Minister of State, Deputy Roche, have been involved on behalf of the Government, as well as numerous other speakers. From my involvement on the previous occasion, it is my impression that the forum intends to continue that form of debate.</p>

          <p eId="para_31">Will the forum continue its work in the lead-up to the referendum on the draft constitution for Europe? Given the outreach work of the forum and the opportunities in the run-up to the Nice treaty which allowed for public participation in discussion meetings in different locations around the country which were well attended and very successful, will a similar approach be employed in the lead-up to the referendum? Will the Taoiseach tell us when the referendum will take place?</p>

What steps will the Government take to assist the work of the forum and in the wider debate on the information deficit regarding the Government's position on the draft constitution, clause by clause? Will the Taoiseach consider publishing a White Paper which will detail all the information, clause by clause, in order that we can fully appreciate the Government's attitude to this important document?</p>

          <p eId="para_37">On that matter, the Government has already put its views through and at the Convention. There have been 35 plenary meetings, 31 regional meetings and four national conferences. As I said, a video on the Convention on the Future of Europe has been sent to all post- primary schools and a national schools writing and public speaking competition for transition year students, based on that video, was recently completed. A further schools initiative for this academic year is in preparation, as is a summary booklet on the draft treaty establishing a constitution for Europe and a glossary of terms. In answering these questions I do not want to say that I am doing the work of the steering group. I am conscious that it is an all-party group and I do not direct it in any way, but this gives an indication of what the forum is doing on this issue.</p>

          <from>Mr. Sargent:</from>
          <p eId="para_39">I will stick to the cost issue. On my first question relating to the publication of the draft constitution, will the cost given by the Taoiseach for the forum's work provide sufficient copies for each household in the State, as was considered in previous referenda? Notwithstanding the fact that the forum makes its own policies, does he agree that the Government must at least give a nod in the direction of the forum, given that it controls the purse strings and will decide, <i>de facto,</i> whether everyone gets a copy of the constitution by virtue of the funding available? Has there been Government discussion of this?</p>

        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_22">
          <from>The Taoiseach:</from>
          <p eId="para_40">There has not, for one simple reason. Deputies have asked me when the referendum will take place, but we need to conclude the constitution first before that is decided, and those discussions are ongoing. It could be a considerable length of time before that work is finished. Normally a glossary, summary or full document is sent out but that is usually done by the Department of Foreign Affairs.</p>

        <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_23">
          <from>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin:</from>
          <p eId="para_41">The Taoiseach said earlier that the Government had provided significant information. However, while an explanatory document was circulated, and there have been a number of public statements which addressed specific issues within the wider debate, there has not been a substantive address of all the essential elements or core points on a clause by clause basis. Is there a cost consideration? What is the cost of an informed debate which allows people to have truly informed opinions on the draft constitution proposals in the absence of a White Paper? Will the Taoiseach tell the House that he and his colleagues are prepared to produce a White Paper to ensure the public is informed on this issue?</p>

          <p eId="para_64">The costs arising to my Department for the Government meeting in Emo, County Laois, are estimated to be in the order of €4,000. The Government intends to continue having meetings outside Dublin from time to time. In addition to the meeting in Emo, meetings have been held in Ballaghaderreen, County Roscommon; Knocknaheeney, County Cork; Faithlegg, County Waterford; Ballymascanlon, County Louth; Killarney, County Kerry; and Glenveagh, County Donegal. The holding of Government meetings outside Dublin is very much welcomed by communities in the areas visited. There are no specific further meetings planned at this stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_65">The following are the Cabinet committees established by the Government and the dates they last met: Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion, Drugs and Rural Development, 22 October 2003; Cabinet Committee on Housing, Infrastructure and Public Private Partnerships, 5 November 2003; Cabinet Committee on Children, 1 October 2003; health strategy, 29 May 2003; Cabinet Committee on European Affairs, 29 October 2003; Cabinet Committee on Information Society, 9 September 2003; and Cabinet  Committee on Asylum, Immigration and Refugee Matters, 13 June 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_66">The Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion, Drugs, and Rural Development has met on eight occasions to date in 2003 and is scheduled to meet again on 19 November 2003. The next meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Asylum, Immigration and Refugee Matters, which meets every six months, is scheduled to take place tomorrow.</p>

          <from>Mr. Kenny:</from>
          <p eId="para_67">I am not sure that the meeting in Ballaghaderreen impacted to any great effect on the spend in the BMW region. It generated an amount of comment and local coverage and meetings were held on the margins but I am not sure they had a great impact.</p>
          <p eId="para_68">The Society of St. Vincent de Paul indicated that an allocation of about €2.8 billion in the budget will be needed to deal with the poverty issue, excluded groups and those who are below the poverty line. Does the Taoiseach agree that the Cabinet committee on social inclusion should organise hearings to enable groups such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul to get its message across directly to Government?</p>
          <p eId="para_69">When the new e-Cabinet meeting table is in place will that mean that no further Cabinet meetings can be held outside Dublin because the technology cost involved of €42,000 will not be available?</p>
          <p eId="para_70">Being a politically aware person, I am sure the Taoiseach has assessed the impact, in publicity terms, of holding Cabinet meetings outside Dublin. Between next January and June the Taoiseach will be tied up with the European Presidency, but will he give a guarantee that, in Cabinet meetings the Government will hold outside Dublin during that period, there will no electioneering on the margins of those meetings, whether they are held in Faithlegg, Pollathomas or wherever, and that they will not be turned into a slick Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats operation whereby they say they are back in town and anything the people want they will deal with provided the people come across with the readies before the middle of June?</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach:</from>
          <p eId="para_72">The Government will continue to meet in the regions and that is a good practice because its members can meet the various groups and organisations who seek such meetings. They are a good utilisation of time. As Deputy Kenny knows, many of the regional groups like to have the opportunity of being listened to in their own bailiwick, area or region, and that is a good practice. I do not know why people did not do this down through the generations. Perhaps Governments in the past were Dublin orientated and it took a person from the middle of Dublin to take a different view. Whatever the reason, it is a good practice. Organisations such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul should have an opportunity to  make a case. In recent years the Minister for Social and Family Affairs has held open sessions in preparation for the budget where all of these groups have the chance to put their views forward and to make a pre-budget submission in advance of the new financial year. That has happened this year and is an important part of the process.</p>
          <p eId="para_73">With the way it is shaping up, I am not sure that there will be much time for travelling around during the Presidency.</p>
          <p eId="para_74">The e-Cabinet process will take time to develop but over time it will help. The advanced technology can be put to use in the regions as part of the decentralisation programme, and will be of assistance in many decentralised offices throughout the State.</p>

          <p eId="para_78">I would not and the Minister also sings a different tune these days. Does the Taoiseach think that Cabinet meetings are too Dublin focused? Would he consider holding a Cabinet meeting in Nenagh where the Minister for Defence has thrown out the Hanly report and have the Cabinet endorse that stance? Would he push on to Limerick, where the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Dea, has come out against the dismantling of the community employment schemes? Southill in Limerick would be a suitable venue for the Cabinet on tour.</p>
          <p eId="para_79">Will the Taoiseach direct the Cabinet committee on social inclusion and drugs to examine why, despite repeated commitments that community drug treatment projects would not be impacted by the cuts in community employment, they are being affected? Schemes dependent on a sponsor such as a local authority lose community employment workers when they fall below a certain figure and the community drug treatment projects are being left short of staff because the sponsor has let the numbers fall.</p>

Would he consider going to Punchestown, where one of the items on the agenda could be the pet projects of Ministers? The Cabinet could go to the Red Cow roundabout to address the disastrous transport situation. The people in my constituency in Monaghan would welcome a Cabinet meeting to address the growing deficiencies in health care and the health service. Given the position of the Minister for State, Deputy Noel Ahern, on homelessness, the Cabinet could go to a hostel because in his view there are so few people homeless that there is considerable room in a hostel for the Cabinet to meet.</p>

          <p eId="para_277">It is interesting to hear the Taoiseach say that everything is on track and appears fine when people wonder why they were promised in writing that there would be capital investment in various schools such as Ballinasloe's Scoil Uí Cheithearnaigh and in hospitals such as the one in Tuam. Is the Taoiseach saying that it is again a case of the poor having to wait? Will he confirm that next year's Estimates will deal with these issues which were promised in writing?</p>

The number of staff has been increased in areas of the Department dealing with information technology and other matters. However, there has been an overall reduction and we are in line.

I am curious to know if that was enforced. Does the Taoiseach recall why it was so much last year? The second cut of 54% was for the Forum for Europe. This goes back to an earlier question on spending to promote knowledge of the Convention. Does the Taoiseach believe that advocacy of the outcome of or promotion of knowledge about what is contained in the Convention and what is likely to be contained in the new constitution are matters to be addressed after the calendar or financial year? Does he intend that the Government would only seek to promote this knowledge after the Intergovernmental Conference has concluded?</p>

          <p eId="para_294">A figure of €800,000 to €900,000 is being spent on the Forum for Europe this year. It reflects a reduction in the enormous number of meetings held last year and in the circulation of the reports and documents compiled. It is still a substantial amount of money. The meetings take place regularly and, as I mentioned, there was the issue of the video. The money is not as much as it was last year because of the enormous printing costs of circulating information prior to the second referendum, but it is substantial and that will continue to the completion of the Intergovernmental Conference, which will confirm what documents will be put to the people. In fairness, the Convention report and the draft constitution have been published. The Revised Estimates for the consultancy service this year was €243,000. Expenditure to the end of October is €203,000 and it is expected that it will come in on target. Most of the consultancy reports prepared in the Department of the Taoiseach are broadly based ones. An amount of work was done in terms of the Green Paper on sustainable development and on research carried out on Newfoundland.</p>

          <from>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. D. Ahern):</from>
          <p eId="para_298">The Deputy will be aware that I have recently spoken out on my dissatisfaction at the level of call roaming charges being applied by mobile operators in the State. As a Minister from a Border county, I am aware of the effect of exorbitant mobile call roaming charges on local people and businesses. The issue is not simply one of mobile operators introducing all-island tariffs, although this, in itself, is to be welcomed. The level of such tariffs and the terms and conditions attached also need to be examined to ensure that consumers are getting a fair deal.</p>
          <p eId="para_299">Although I am not directly responsible for the regulation of call roaming charges – this area comes under the jurisdiction of the Commission for Communications Regulation – I have asked the commission to bring forward proposals to remedy this situation. This request to the commission was in the context of a general review of the impact of the policy directions I issued to it last February. The purpose of the general review is to ascertain what action may be necessary to further regulate priorities in the sector. In the interim I will keep the situation under review and will continue to encourage mobile operators to address this matter themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_300">The framework regulations, which I signed into law in July this year, mandates the Commission for Communications Regulation to conduct market definition and analysis processes into certain markets identified by the European Commission in a published recommendation. These markets are selected on the basis of containing characteristics which may be such as to justify the imposition of regulatory obligations.</p>
          <p eId="para_301">I note that the Commission for Communications Regulation has begun the process of market definition and analysis into two separate segments of the mobile telephony market. I welcome the start of this investigative process and I trust that a positive outcome will ensue.</p>

          <p eId="para_302">I thank the Minister for his answer. I intend asking four concise supplementary questions and I hope to get answers to each one. From experience I have learned to ask them at my first opportunity for supplementaries as I might not get a second chance. Does the Minister agree that further increased competition in this marketplace is desirable and that this is the best way of ensuring that we drive prices down and  improve services? Does he accept the ComReg figures which state clearly that, although prices have dropped measurably in the past five years, the average retail price per minute in Ireland for mobile phone use is still high by European and international standards? Will the Minister, therefore, help to dispel the myth that the only reason Irish mobile phone users pay so much more than our European counterparts is that Irish people use their phones more? Will he confirm and accept the ComReg figures that the average price per minute is higher here than in many other European countries?</p>
          <p eId="para_303">Can the Minister provide a concise answer in respect of whether or not he is planning to introduce a new competitor into the mobile phone marketplace in the future? If he is, when will that competitor be introduced? Does the Minister have plans to provide ComReg with a directive – a practice for which there is precedent – to introduce national roaming to allow Meteor, which has only 5% of the market share, to use the networks of Vodafone and-or O2 while it is rolling out its own? Meteor would then—</p>

          <p eId="para_310">I will be as concise as I can. I agree that increased competition is needed in the Irish market. I agree with the ComReg figures. It is not up to me to introduce a new competitor. We have an open market which means it is entirely up to the market to provide competition. However, I have had discussions which have made me aware of some interest in the Irish market among other operators. Eircom itself, as a result of the agreement under which it broke away from Eircell, is potentially entitled to return to the mobile telephony market as of May 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_311">The Deputy asked about the provision of a directive to ComReg. I have had quite a number of meetings with ComReg, the most recent of which took place in the last fortnight. It was very comprehensive and included discussion of the issue to which the Deputy referred. In the reply to the Deputy's parliamentary question, I outlined that because of the discussions ComReg and  my Department have had, an analysis of the mobile telephony market has commenced. The aim of the analysis is to discover if other measures can be taken to engender competition to reduce prices. I have indicated that my Department and, I hope, the Oireachtas would be willing to sponsor what powers or legislation ComReg feels it needs to achieve those goals.</p>

        </question>
        <speech by="#DermotAhern" eId="spk_130">
          <from>Mr. D. Ahern:</from>
          <p eId="para_313">While the provision of telecommunications services is a matter in the first instance for the private companies operating in a fully liberalised sector, there is a clear consensus that in cases of market failure or sluggish market response it is perfectly legitimate for Government to intervene. An indicative €200 million, part-funded by the European Regional Development Fund, was earmarked for the regions under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 for a programme of broadband infrastructure projects which will facilitate the provision of world-class communications services. Earlier this year, I issued a set of policy directions to the Commission for Communications Regulation in respect of flat rate Internet access. FRIACO, as it is called, was introduced in June 2003. I understand the numbers of those with FRIACO has gone from 0 to somewhere in the region of 30,000. This is a significant number. I am currently conducting a general review of the impact of the policy directions with a view to ascertaining whether further action by way of a new policy direction is needed to further regulatory priorities for the sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_314">I intend also to bring forward proposals for new telecommunications legislation to enhance the provisions of the regulatory framework package. I intend this legislation to support and encourage competition, innovation and affordable services, provide protection for quality services to the end user and deal with consumer protection issues in the retail broadcast sector. I intend to bring the legislative proposals forward early next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_315">There are many towns around the country in which the provision of broadband should be addressed by the market. The regional broadband deficit is unsustainable and I want to see it addressed in a pro-competition, pro-choice and low-cost fashion. If the market does not address the deficit quickly, I will intervene on the regulatory and legislative front to advance change. I will continue to push the broadband agenda by every means available to me.</p>

          <p eId="para_316">Was it not an indictment of the Minister's last 18 months in office that he had to tell the IBEC conference of a whole range of Irish towns which do not have DSL enabled exchanges? Some of them, like Newbridge, Maynooth, Ardee, Mitchelstown, Roscrea, Cobh and, we could add, Blessington and other towns in the Minister's Wexford constituency, are quite large. I have received e-mail after e-mail from citizens who bitterly complain about the lack of broadband facilities in their local areas. The Minister must get twice the amount of e-mails I have received on this subject.</p>

          <p eId="para_319">The Minister has referred to legislative proposals. Is it not increasingly embarrassing to find report after report and survey after survey stating the Government's 2002 target of linking 9% of the population to a broadband connection by 2007 is hopelessly unattainable? The latest I have seen was the DotEcon study. Is it not an unbelievable state of affairs that this is allowed to happen? It was the Minister who spoke about a five megabit connection for every citizen. He will be known to history after this Government loses office as "Five Megabits Ahern", the Minister who failed to come remotely close to achieving this goal. Did not the Minister mislead the IBEC conference by stating that nearly 40% of Irish adults had an Internet connection when the real figure is closer to 30% as the Minister and ComReg well know?</p>

      asked the

       if he will be giving a direction to the energy regulator on whether the future rules governing the sale of electricity into a central market will be designed in a manner which ensures the rapid development of the renewable energy sector.
      [26589/03]
    </p>
        </question>
        <speech by="#DermotAhern" eId="spk_183">
          <from>Mr. D. Ahern:</from>
          <p eId="para_370">The Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, in discharge of its duties under the Electricity Regulation Act 1999, is required to have regard to the need, <i>inter alia,</i> to promote the use of renewable, sustainable or alternative forms of energy. In addition, the regulator is required to ensure that the system operator gives priority to generating stations using renewable, sustainable or alternative energy sources when selecting generating stations.</p>
          <p eId="para_371">I am empowered by section 9(1)(<i>a</i>) of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 to issue a policy direction to the CER in regard to electricity trading arrangements. This power was exercised by the then Minister for Public Enterprise in July 1999, on foot of which regulations were made by the CER on 17 February 2000, which provide for an interim trading system to enable new entrants to participate effectively in the market, pending full market opening in 2005. The CER decided to accelerate the review required by that policy direction so as to provide existing and potential market participants with an increased level of certainty required for investment purposes.</p>
          <p eId="para_372">Accordingly, on 16 July 2003, the CER made the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 (Market Arrangements for Electricity) Regulations 2003 with my consent. These regulations establish the new system of trading in electricity, that is the mandatory centralised pool, and pave the way for the detailed rules and procedures necessary to give effect to the new market arrangements in a fully liberalised market. The question of a policy direction to the regulator does not arise at this stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_373">The detailed design of the new market arrangements in regard to renewable energy generation, CHP and embedded generation in the new market arrangements, taking account of the specific characteristics of green energy, has been the subject of recent extensive public consultation by the CER. The CER's consultation paper highlights the issue as to whether renewables or CHP could be more effectively supported through a mechan ism outside the market arrangements, through preferential treatment or via special rules under the trading arrangements. The CER has indicated that it favours supporting renewable and CHP plants outside the trading arrangements to allow true market signals to be seen, minimise market distortion, minimise system and market operation costs to the final customer; and afford greater transparency.</p>
          <p eId="para_374">Consideration is being given by the CER to comments, submissions and representations received by it on foot of that process. In tandem with this exercise, I will shortly publish a detailed consultation document on the promotion of renewable energy technologies into the next decade and beyond. This document will, among other things, concentrate on the market's view on future targets and future support mechanisms for renewable energy technologies. I will be setting out possible market support mechanisms and consulting the industry and the public on the best way forward.</p>

          <p eId="para_375">The Minister may understand the issues in this regard but we are laughed at by the OECD league. Last week at a European investment bank conference, speaker after speaker raised Ireland's dismal record in providing renewable energy. It is one hundredth of the amount Germany produces, despite the fact that we have twice the amount of wind resources. It was embarrassing to have our failure shown so publicly in such a forum. Will the Minister give direction to the regulator, because he feels he gives direction to the Minister? The consultation document to which the Minister referred states that—</p>

          <p eId="para_377">I will refer to the tone of what the regulator said in the document. He says he will take cognisance of the review which the Department is carrying out and will take the review of the grid code for winds and examine the outcomes of these processes. He proposes to examine the deliberations of the Minister and his Department to see if they are compliant with the market arrangements which he is setting. In other words, the regulator will tell the Minister how the renewable energy sector is to be developed.</p>

          <p eId="para_379">Will the Minister make a clear submission to the regulator in regard to the consultation document? I do not agree that it was an extensive public consultation since there was only one month between its publication and the closing date. On such a complex issue, that does not allow the public or other bodies to make an input. Will the Minister make an input and clarify his position? Does he believe that wind or renew able energy should have full priority access because a choice is set out by the regulator? Does he believe that wind and other renewable generation sources should have to pay negative prices, if the market indicates they go in that direction? Should the wind or other renewables industry have to pay if they fail to meet their agreed supply conditions, given that it is difficult for them to predict, unlike gas-fired stations, whether the wind will blow exactly as they thought it would?</p>
          <p eId="para_380">Rather than the Minister telling me he understands the industry, I want to know what he will do about it. One of the most important things to do in the area of renewables is to set the market arrangements to ensure that the renewable energy industry is developed. I do not believe the regulator has that as his main ambition.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Browne):</from>
          <p eId="para_392">The current arrangements for monitoring and control of fish farms were outlined in my reply to Question No. 158 of 7 October 2002. In summary, inspections of fish farms are carried out periodically by officials of my Department. In the year to date, for example, the Department's engineering division has carried out 40 inspections of marine fin-fish sites. The operations of fish farms are also scrutinised through returns and reports that are required to be made to the Department by the companies concerned. Among these are annual benthic surveys, which show the condition of the seabed at the farms and are evaluated for my Department by the Marine Institute.</p>
          <p eId="para_393">The Marine Institute also carries out 14 inspections at each marine fish farm each year under the programme for monitoring and control of sea lice. Other inspections carried out by the Marine Institute relate to monitoring of fish health and residues. These programmes represent a significant commitment on the part of the public bodies concerned to ensuring that fish farming is carried out in compliance with licence terms and conditions, and with other relevant standards and requirements.</p>
          <p eId="para_394">However, in light of certain matters that came to light over the recent past, I decided that a comprehensive review should be undertaken of existing arrangements for monitoring and control of aquaculture and of marine fin-fish farming in particular. This review is being undertaken by a unit established for the purpose in my Department. It will look in detail at all the systems and processes involved in monitoring, control and enforcement and will, as necessary, bring forward recommendations for streamlining and strengthening existing methods and procedures. The aim is to have this review completed by the end of January 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_395">I am committed to having efficient and effective systems and processes for monitoring, control and enforcement so that we can be assured of having a well regulated industry operating to appropriately high standards. This is necessary in the interests of the industry itself and of other concerns of the marine resource and for the conservation and protection of wild fisheries. If it is apparent, following the review, that changes are required to legislation or procedures or practices, these changes will be introduced without delay.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SimonCoveney" eId="spk_200">
          <from>Mr. Coveney:</from>
          <p eId="para_396">The aquaculture and fish-farming industry has a bright future, particularly in parts of the country which desperately need such investment, if it is managed properly. With all due respect to the Minister of State, he has not answered the question I asked. It relates to enforcement, not monitoring. It is well recognised internationally that Ireland has a good monitoring system under the Marine Institute.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">I have four specific questions I would like the Minister of State to address. Has a sanction ever been imposed by his Department on an Irish fish farm for breach of regulations? Do fish farmers who operate under pre-1997 licences operate under different licensing conditions from those operating under post-1997 licences and, if so, why? Will we see a sanction mechanism, in the form of fines, introduced by the Department for fish farms that consistently breach rules regarding levels of sea lice and other rules such as dumping at sea or on land?</p>
          <p eId="para_398">My final question, to which I would like the Minister of State to reply first, concerns the "Prime Time" programme. As a result of that programme, two members of State boards – one from BIM and one from the Marine Institute – are under investigation. Does the Minister of State think it appropriate that these individuals should remain members of the boards while the investigation is ongoing, especially considering the senior Minister's recent outspokenness on standards and ethics on public boards?</p>

      <b>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</b>
       the position in regard to his Department's consideration of the recovery plan from An Post which he ordered the company on 4 September 2003 to produce; when he expects agreement on the plan; if he has received an indication of the extent of the job cuts being sought by the company; if he has sought or received assurances from the company that the problems experienced with Christmas post in 2002, when much mail was not delivered until after Christmas, will not be repeated in 2003; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <from>Mr. D. Ahern:</from>
          <p eId="para_409">In response to my request for a recovery plan, following the announcement by An Post of substantial losses, the company submitted on 30 September a response to my letter outlining a recovery strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">The main components of the recovery strategy relate to cost reductions across core businesses, improved financial and operational performance, a new HR strategy and organisational structure, improved customer service standards and improved performance across core businesses. The detail of the strategy has to be negotiated with unions by the company management before it can be finalised. Finalisation of the detail of the strategy and the success, delivery and implementation of the strategy generally, is contingent on the outcome of these negotiations.</p>
          <p eId="para_411">Staff reductions amounting to approximately 1,140 have been signalled by An Post since early last year. Provisional numbers from the outline recovery strategy envisage an advance on this figure. While the board, management and staff of the company have my full support and assistance and that of my Department in dealing with the difficult challenges ahead, the responsibility for designing and implementing the recovery plan ultimately rests with the company.</p>
          <p eId="para_412">On the issue of Christmas post, I have written to the chairperson of An Post seeking written assurance that the problems experienced with the post last Christmas will not be repeated. Furthermore, this issue has been discussed at meetings between my Department and the company. The matter has also been brought to the attention of the Commission for Communications Regulation  which has the statutory function for quality of service standards under the European Communities (Postal Services) Regulations 2002.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TommyBroughan" eId="spk_211">
          <from>Mr. Broughan:</from>
          <p eId="para_413">Is it not the case that the omens for the delivery of Christmas post are not good? ComReg's recent third quarter report stated that only 71% of mail is delivered the next day as against the An Post target of 94%. Does the Minister find that alarming? Does he, like myself and other Deputies, receive complaints that post from different organisations, notices in particular, arrives up to seven days late? Events are scheduled but sometimes Members only get notice of these on the day or the day after. Does the Minister not find that ominous? Does he not think he needs to do more than write a letter? Should he not meet Mr. Curtin and Mr. Donald and tell them that we do not want a repeat of last year's fiasco where a million Christmas cards were delivered in February and March with the excuse that they were too big for the machine or whatever?</p>
          <p eId="para_414">We have heard reports that local sorting staff are sitting idle during the day while mail from north or south Dublin, for instance, is in transit through places like Waterford and Athlone. This seems to create a situation where we will not have next day delivery.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">With regard to the recovery plan, An Post was asked to re-negotiate the Rheims agreement, or international agreements. We are, apparently, subsidising foreign operators up to €11 million per annum. Has the Minister taken any action on this? Is he aware that significant quantities of US mail are delivered in this country by private operators, who have a deal with US Mail which bypasses the An Post operation?</p>
          <p eId="para_416">It is sad to hear that a large number of workers will become redundant. Given that the United Kingdom, among other countries, has its own postal regulator, Postcomm, in place, does the Minister intend to bring forward any more fundamental legislation and regulation of the Irish postal market for a fully deregulated market?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DermotAhern" eId="spk_212">
          <from>Mr. D. Ahern:</from>
          <p eId="para_417">I have raised the issue of the quality of the postal service and the Christmas post at all the meetings I have had with Mr. Donal Curtin, the new chief executive. Last year, the new computer and sorting system was put in place too close to Christmas. Ultimately, An Post accepted that and accepts that the delivery of Christmas post last year left a lot to be desired. I am assured that will not happen this year. I too have experienced some difficulties with post and one important personal letter took nine days to reach Dundalk from Dublin. I raised the issue of the quality of the postal service with the chairperson, the chief executive and ComReg. I am assured that while there are some difficulties, they will be ironed out, particularly in the run up to Christmas.</p>
          <p eId="para_418">On the issue of further legislation, the postal service is subject to a continuing opening of the  market under EU legislation. This is the responsibility of ComReg, which is the independent regulatory authority in regard to the running of the An Post service, and it is in constant discussion with An Post regarding its current difficulties.</p>
          <p eId="para_419">I accept what the Deputy stated about the possible job losses. It has been agreed with the unions and with management over recent years that there would be a downsizing of the company in exchange for productivity and for a number of special payments under Sustaining Progress. That process is ongoing. The position in An Post is, however, difficult. An Post has indicated that it wishes to get out of some of its peripheral businesses and that it will concentrate on the core business. As I stated here, my Department meets An Post officials on a weekly basis to ensure that we can give whatever co-operation is necessary, but ultimately it is a matter for the company's management and unions to work through the present difficulties.</p>

          <p eId="para_421">An indicative amount of €200 million was set aside under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 for telecommunications infrastructure projects. Following the report of the interdepartmental working group on telecommunications in March 2002, the Government gave the go-ahead for the construction of 19 metropolitan area networks, MANs, in Cork, Limerick, Galway, Carlow, Kilkenny, Wexford, Waterford, Dungarvan, Clonmel, Athlone, Mullingar, Portlaoise, Tullamore, Roscommon, Ballina, Letterkenny, Carrick-on-Shannon, Manorhamilton and Gaoth Dobhair.</p>

          <from>Mr. D. Ahern:</from>
          <p eId="para_423">The MANs programme, which is phase 1 of the regional broadband programme, is being supported by €64 million in Government and EU funding. Subsequent phases of the programme will be contingent on the success of phase 1. Other projects being funded under this measure include the roll-out of digital subscriber lines, DSLs, by both Eircom and Esat BT, which have upgraded a number of telephone exchanges nationwide during the past year. Details of the services provided by these companies are available on their websites, <i>www.eircom.ie</i> and <i>www.esat.ie</i>In addition to these developments, a number of telecommunications service providers are already marketing broadband services to all areas, using  wireless and satellite-based technologies. A full list of service providers is available from the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">This week I signed regulations permitting ComReg to issue 59 additional licences for wireless broadband throughout the State. My Department has also funded wireless LAN and powerline trials to boost platform competition.</p>

          <from>Mr. Kehoe:</from>
          <p eId="para_425">Like most Ministers, Deputy Dermot Ahern avoids the question. I asked the Minister the counties and towns which have no plans for the roll-out of broadband. I could have got out the list in my office stating the towns which have broadband and which he has announced, perhaps 40 times, will get it. Since he mentioned it, the Government has a disastrous history on broadband. The Minister has been in Government for the past six to seven years and when one compares Ireland with other countries, we are lagging way behind. What percentage of schools, both primary and secondary, are linked up to broadband? It is important for the education of our young people that schools have broadband.</p>
          <p eId="para_426">Is the Minister aware of any major industry wanting to come to any county or town in Ireland which did not come because there was no roll-out of broadband in the area concerned? The Government is discriminating against rural towns and some counties by not having put in place the roll-out of broadband already.</p>

          <from>Mr. D. Ahern:</from>
          <p eId="para_428">The Deputy is misleading the House. It is an open market. It is a liberalised market. It is not up to the Government to provide broadband here, there and everywhere.</p>

          <from>Mr. D. Ahern:</from>
          <p eId="para_430">It is up to the Government to ensure that there is competition in the market and that is why we are funding the MANs projects, that is phase 1. Phases 2 and 3 will include up to 132 towns over a period.</p>
          <p eId="para_431">Eircom and Esat have also been funded very significantly by the taxpayer to roll out digital subscriber lines. DSL roll-out in Ireland has only started in the recent past and it is wrong to compare this with what has happened over recent years. On the current figures for DSL in Ireland, the rate of increase, albeit from a very low base, is the highest in Europe by far – there was a 600% increase in the numbers taking broadband from July 2002 to July 2003, which coincides with my period in office. On those areas which are not enabled with DSL and may not ultimately be enabled with broadband, they will be able to get broadband ultimately through other technologies such as the powerline which is in trials and  through wireless LAN, which works successfully and to which I am connected.</p>

The reality, as the private sector would admit, is that they will not go into the peripheral areas. It will mean that many companies which might want to set up in rural areas will not be able to do so and will go into the towns where there is broadband.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnBrowne2" eId="spk_267">
          <from>Mr. Browne:</from>
          <p eId="para_479">The development of a wind farm at Derrybrien by Hibernian Wind Power, a subsidiary company of the ESB, is a day to day operational matter for the company and not one in which I have a function. Nonetheless, I understand from Hibernian that, following the occurrence of the bogslide, attention was immediately focused on taking remedial action to minimise the effect of the slide and determining its possible cause.</p>
          <p eId="para_480">The construction of wind farm projects is subject to the grant of planning permission under the provisions of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts 1963 to 2000. The appropriate local planning authority conducts the planning process for such facilities independently. As part of the planning process, an environmental impact assessment study may also be required in accordance with the provisions of the European Communities (Environmental Impact Assessment) Amendment Regulations 1999. I have no statutory function in regard to the planning aspects of wind energy developments. To be of assistance to the investigation of this incident, the Geological Survey of Ireland, an agency of my Department, in the context of its general scientific interest in landslide occurrences and soil movements, has visited the site and will include information gleaned from that visit in material to be published on its website in due course.</p>
          <p eId="para_481">The Shannon Regional Fisheries Board has responsibility for the management, protection and development of the fishery in the Owendalulleegh River and in Lough Cutra, County Galway. I am advised by the regional fisheries board that its initial assessment is that the Owendalulleegh River is seriously damaged from the area of the bogslide near Derrybrien as far as Lough Cutra and that fish are buried in the peat silt deposit. Casualties include stocks of brown trout, eels, etc., of all life stages. The board has indicated that no preventative measures against fish mortality are possible at this stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_482">Neither is it possible to assess fully the environmental damage or to estimate the extent of rehabilitation works required until events have fully unfolded. It may be necessary to wait for some months to completely assess the extent of rehabilitation necessary and possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_483">The fisheries board has a team of staff working alongside the ESB fisheries conservation unit and environmental staff at Galway County Council in the ongoing assessment of the situation. They are sampling the waters and bed of both river and lake, monitoring for mortalities, assessing the extent of damage to the fish habitat and liaising with other agencies. I understand that all the agencies involved are committed to a restoration and enhancement project on the river when the full extent of the damage has been agreed.</p>
          <p eId="para_484">Both the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board and the local authorities have powers to prosecute for the pollution of the river. While the cause is yet to be formally established, the board will investigate the incident further. Should it  become clear that there is a responsible party, it is the policy of the board to prosecute.</p>
        </speech>

          <from>Mr. Broughan:</from>
          <p eId="para_485">I am sure everybody sympathises with people living in the Derrybrien area and those involved in the fishing industry in respect of the amount of damage that has occurred there as a result of the second major bogslide that has occurred in recent months. The Minister of State indicated that the local authority is responsible for the planning permission aspect of this matter. Was the Department not involved in the licensing arrangements regarding the €60 million wind farm proposed to be built by Hibernian Wind Power, a subsidiary of the ESB? Is it not, therefore, the case that the Department was directly involved in the planning of the project? Was an EIS forthcoming or was some form of environmental assessment carried out? Last week we discussed fish farms and it was stated that a major environmental assessment should be carried out before the licensing process commences.</p>
          <p eId="para_486">The Minister of State referred to trout, pike and eel. I understand that something of the order of 100,000 fish have been killed in this major pollution episode. When does the Minister expect the investigation to be completed? Perhaps Galway County Council or the Department could impose some sanctions in respect of this matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_494">On the fish kill, the chief executive officer indicated that the river is practically wiped out and  that between 50,000 and 100,000 fish have died. He does not anticipate any further fish mortality. It will not be possible to quantify the extent of the damage arising until a programme of electro-fishing can be carried out.</p>
          <p eId="para_495">The Shannon Regional Fisheries Board has informed us that it expects to have a preliminary report available this week. We will assess it when it comes to hand.</p>

          <p eId="para_496">The Minister of State has responsibility in respect of the AER 6 scheme under which contracts to produce energy from alternative sources, primarily wind, were granted. The Derrybrien project, which was to be run by Hibernian Wind Power, a subsidiary of the ESB, was supposed to produce 60 megawatts, making it the largest wind project of its type in the country. If this project cannot proceed as a result of the landslide, is it the intention to reallocate those 60 megawatts to some other contractor or to retain them for the Hibernian group to develop somewhere else? How will the delay impact on the Department's plans in respect of trying to reach a target figure of producing 10% of all energy in this country via alternative sources such as wind?</p>

He is unfortunate in that there have been two major disasters on bogs in recent months. The first of these involved the licensing by his Department of the construction of the Ballinaboy gas terminal on a bog site, which was correctly turned down by An Bord Pleanála, while the second involves the licensing of a wind farm, the construction of which has led to a massive bogslide.</p>
          <p eId="para_503">In terms of his Department's licensing arrangements in respect of exploration and wind farming, would it not be appropriate for the Minister to set out some conditions, standards or directions to companies considering construction on bogs, especially upland blanket bogs which are so volatile, in order that we will not have to revisit this  issue in five years' time when another bog has slipped into a river, lake or community?</p>

      asked the

       the circumstances in which, according to the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, the State is facing a ?12.9 million loss on the deal negotiated with a company (details supplied) regarding the purchase of fibre optic communications links; the steps being taken to recover outstanding moneys; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

        <speech by="#DermotAhern" eId="spk_284">
          <from>Mr. D. Ahern:</from>
          <p eId="para_507">The Deputy quotes the Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General 2002 as stating that the State is facing a €12.9 million loss on the deal negotiated with a company (details supplied) regarding the purchase of fibre optic communications links. However, the report actually states there are outstanding debtors totalling €12.9 million and not that the State is facing a loss of this magnitude. Functional responsibility for recovery of these moneys resides with IDA. The current position is that there are three companies, Worldport, Princes Holdings and Metromedia (Global Voice Networks Ltd.), with outstanding debts in respect of contracted capacity resales arising from the international connectivity contract entered into by the IDA in 1999. The State, through the IDA and my Department, continues vigorously to pursue those debts through legal and other actions as necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_508">A debt of approximately €3.14 million is still owed in the Worldport case. There is a parent company guarantee for the full amount of the debt from the US parent company of the contracting entity and, in default of payment, it is the intention to take court proceedings against the parent on foot of that guarantee. A debt of approximately €6.28 million in the Princes Holdings' case was owed at the time of the publication of the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General. The State held a bank bond for €1.587 million of that debt and that has been foreclosed on. Proceedings were issued against Princes  Holdings on 3 November claiming the balance of the moneys owing.</p>
          <p eId="para_509">A debt of approximately €2.57 million is still owed in the Metromedia (Global Voice Networks Ltd.) case. On 3 November 2003 legal proceedings were issued against the company claiming the moneys owed.</p>

          <from>Mr. Broughan:</from>
          <p eId="para_510">Is it not the bottom line that a sum of almost €13 million is owed to the State, which is almost enough to pay for a stroke in the Minister for Finance's constituency? I read the caustic comments of the Comptroller and Auditor General who severely criticised the Minister's Department on this matter. Is this a classic example of a public private partnership that was created on a wing and a prayer? The State, on behalf of the people, repeatedly bears a significant risk in these arrangements while private operators carry much less risk. Mr. Purcell, the Comptroller and Auditor General stated, "It would have been preferable for the State to have entered a joint project where all risks were shared between the public and private sectors, as originally envisaged."  Is that not the way the Department should have proceeded? The funding is ultimately owed to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment through the IDA. Was this not a complete cock up on the part of everybody concerned, which left the State with a €13 million write off?</p>

Almost €15 million in grant aid was approved by both the Ministers for Finance and Agriculture and Food for a project in the Minister for Finance's constituency. Is he aware the deal was approved for 100% grant aid within seven days and, when costs doubled, funding was subsequently approved within 14 days? Is he further aware that no cost benefit analysis was carried out; Department of Finance guidelines were not followed; no independent technical advice was sought in regard to running costs or long-term benefit; no research was conducted on the need for such a facility; no other potential providers were asked for their views of expressions of interest; and that it was not even referred to the legal advisers in the Departments of Finance and Agriculture and Food?</p>

Does it not make a mockery of the procedures relating to primary school projects, which must go through six phases and take between three and five years for approval in the first instance while, in some cases, parents must raise a 25% local contribution?</p>
          <p eId="para_530">The Minister for Finance railroaded the project through his own guidelines. The Estimates will be published shortly and he has issued a warning to the Secretary General of every Department to scrutinise every euro of expenditure for value in the public interest, yet a situation like this can apply for the rich so that the Ministers for Finance and Agriculture and Food can gain political kudos and stay in with the horsey set. How can the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste, who stated the Government must learn lessons from this, stand over it? How can they stand idly by while this happens?</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach:</from>
          <p eId="para_535">Some thought quite a deal of money had been provided under the subheads. Others referred to the resources provided under the relevant subheads for a national and international agricultural show centre at Punchestown and hoped that, next year, funds would be allocated to Clones greyhound track – I do not know if that happened. Others acknowledged the intrinsic value of the project. That took place over the last number of years.</p>
          <p eId="para_536">With regard to the history of the project, the Punchestown organisation – I understand it is a trust body – wrote to the Department of Agriculture and Food in November 1999, proposing the development of the location as an event and exhibition centre for national events. It subsequently indicated that, following more detailed consideration, it proposed to make significant structural changes, as it did. This revised proposal cost an additional IR£6 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">On 3 October 2001, the Punchestown trust requested further funding to meet Kildare County Council planning requirements, a sewage treatment plant, additional car parking and other ancillary costs. All of this was highlighted in a major way, both locally and nationally. No other promoter made an approach to the Department to provide facilities for such a centre in the country. That is understandable in the context of the scale of the facilities required, particularly the large land bank which nobody else was able to provide. Events and exhibition centres do not generally make profits, as is well known, and have to look towards a long-term investment in the infrastructure. The letters and details of relevant dates are attached to the report.</p>
          <p eId="para_538">In his report, the Comptroller and Auditor General said the proper tender procedures were observed in connection with the placing of contracts and the Department had satisfactory controls in place with regard to processing and payment claims, site inspections and administrative checks. However, he expressed concern as to the adequacy of the valuation in the form of an agreement and stated that, in view of reservations with regard to deficiencies in the form of the agreement, the relevant papers are being examined by the legal services unit of the Department for legal consideration as to whether a new agreement is necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_539">This centre is now up and running. It is regarded as a considerable national asset in the agricultural sector, has already hosted a number of important events and I hope it will continue to go from success to success.</p>

          <p eId="para_541">The Taoiseach would win an award on any version of Ripley's believe it or not. Not once did he refer to the procedure followed, which is the issue in which I am interested. Was there a public tendering process for this project? If the public has paid 100% of the cost of the centre, does the public own it, or will it own it in due course? As it happened, I was Minister for Tourism when Punchestown was awarded the world equestrian games but had to withdraw due to inability to live up to any of the conditions set out at that time.</p>
          <p eId="para_542">The Government's code of conduct for office holders sets out that they should act only by reference to the public interest and dedicate the resources of their offices in furtherance thereof; that they should not be influenced in their official duties by personal considerations and should be accountable for their decisions. As Deputy Rabbitte pointed out at a meeting of the Public Accounts Committee, the Secretary General of the Department of Agriculture and Food said this was a matter as between Minister and Minister  and he, as an official, could not comment on ministerial responsibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_543">The Taoiseach is in charge of those Ministers. As I see it, the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the Minister for Finance have blatantly disregarded every guideline laid down for projects of this magnitude. There was no regard for the public interest, only public kudos. The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste, who said we must learn lessons from this, sat or stood and watched those two big dippers into the public purse. They stood idly by, like Bonnie and Clyde, watching the public purse being plundered, without any regard to the guidelines they have espoused so strongly in respect of every Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_544">In publishing the Estimates this week, the Minister for Finance has specified that every Department Secretary General must scrutinise every euro of expenditure. He should say that to the parents and teachers of school children who need €300 million for primary schools which are falling down, the community groups which are seeking community centres, boxing and tennis clubs, the small organisations which are breaking their backs in an effort to raise a few miserable euro to qualify for a pittance of a grant. How can the Taoiseach sit and watch the approval of €14 million, within a matter of three weeks, with no regard whatsoever to value for money?</p>

          <p eId="para_546">Deputy Kenny asked if proper procedures were followed. The project was examined in detail by the Department of Agriculture and Food; a letter of offer, with 17 conditions, was issued on 1 August; Punchestown accepted the Department's offer by letter of 9 August; the formal exchange of letters was taken by the Department and Punchestown as a binding agreement, as is normal practice in grant-aiding projects by the Department; a separate subhead was provided for the project in the Estimates for the Department of Agriculture and Food for all years while the project was under way. Accordingly, the provision of funding for the centre was open and transparent. Each year, the Department's Estimate was scrutinised by the relevant Oireachtas committee. It is nonsense to suggest it was hidden or not transparent.</p>
          <p eId="para_547">The Comptroller and Auditor General stated in his report that proper procedures were observed in connection with the placing of contracts and the Department had satisfactory controls in place for processing and payment of claims with regard to site inspections. As to the aspect on which the Comptroller did not agree, he expressed reservations about possible deficiencies in the form of agreement. Those papers have been referred to the legal services for examination of that issue and to consider whether  a new agreement is desirable or necessary. That is an issue to which the Minister will return again.</p>
          <p eId="para_548">The Punchestown organisation is a non-profit trust. Although I am not familiar with the deed of trust, I understand that a number of reputable people from different walks of agricultural life are involved in that trust. Part of the requirement for a national centre was to move elements of agricultural exhibitions away from the Royal Dublin Society to a suitable alternative location. It did not relate only to equestrian events but also to agriculture. Those are the issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_549">As I said, the project was welcomed wholeheartedly by all who spoke on the matter at all stages. I cannot find any negative comments on it. It is now a resource for everybody and every organisation to use, as they are doing.</p>

        <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_311">
          <from>Mr. Rabbitte:</from>
          <p eId="para_550">Punchestown was a ready-up in the winners' enclosure by the two Cabinet Ministers involved. Last Wednesday, I referred to the PWC report commissioned by the Minister for Transport, which showed that, as stand-alone airports, Shannon would not be viable and Cork would be a serious loss maker. The Taoiseach then said the report would be made available to both sides and the Minister, Deputy Brennan, agreed. However, that had not been done when discussions took place last Friday between the unions and management. Two days later, RTE corroborated my version of the contents of the PWC report, but the question was not put to the Minister as to why he misrepresented the contents when he said that, if the historical debt had been stripped out, the two airports would be viable. The report said nothing of the kind.</p>
          <p eId="para_551">I now have new information which relates to the memo brought to Government on 14 October. Apparently, the July decision of Government prohibits Exchequer funding in future for Shannon or Cork airports. The competitive implications of that are disastrous in their knock-on effects for the eight regional airports, especially Kerry, Galway and Knock. There are sensitive issues relating to the pension entitlements of the workers. I have the actual text of the Department of Finance view, which is as follows:</p>
          <p eId="para_552">The Minister notes that the memorandum expressly states that the legislation may require review as issues evolve in relation to share capital and regulation by the aviation regulator. Furthermore, consultants with significant legal input are being engaged as advisers to assist the Department of Transport in all aspects of implementation of the restructuring process. The Minister for Finance therefore considers that the drafting of heads of a Bill and the introduction of legislation at this stage is premature and, accordingly, is not in agreement with the decision sought. The drafting of legislation should be done when all issues are resolved.</p>
          <p eId="para_553">Why is the Minister for Transport proceeding against the advice of the Minister for Finance and his Department and creating chaos in the immediate industrial relations environment and, more importantly, putting regional airports at risk? Deputy Kenny came from Knock this morning and I came from Sligo.</p>

          <from>Mr. Rabbitte:</from>
          <p eId="para_555">In the new environment of a prohibition on State or Exchequer funding for Shannon and Cork, those airports will not be able to function. That is the implication for Knock, Kerry and Galway. Why was that concealed from the public? Why did the Taoiseach not make the reports available to the trade unions? He said he would do so last Wednesday.</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach:</from>
          <p eId="para_556">The enormous aid and resources the Government gives to the airports are what is keeping those airports open. Every single seat is highly subsidised and that is what keeps the regional airports going. The considerable extension in the number of flights to those airports is due to those huge subsidies, as not one of them would be viable otherwise.</p>
          <p eId="para_557">Regarding the Pricewaterhouse report on restructuring, my information is that back in March Pricewaterhouse prepared certain financial information for the Department to assist it in advising the Government on the commitment to greater autonomy for Shannon and Cork airports. The report was highlighted as containing sensitive information and, in particular, it referred to the Aer Rianta Eurobond loan and the listing on the Dublin and London stock exchanges, among other issues. PWC information was used in the memorandum for Government which recommended the establishment of three separate airports. Last Wednesday Deputy Rabbitte gave the impression that this was hidden information and did not form the basis of the Minister's presentation but that is totally incorrect.</p>

        <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_315">

          <from>The Taoiseach:</from>
          <p eId="para_559">That is totally incorrect. It was part of the memorandum that came to Government. The current position is that there was no formal PWC report as such but an analysis of the projections provided by Aer Rianta was undertaken by PWC to assist in this process. It made no recommendations whatever on policy, in spite of Deputy Rabbitte's comments last week that these were policy recommendations which were put forward. There is no difficulty in sharing this information with the trade union movement apart from the sensitive data. That is the position. The Department of Transport is in consultation with Aer Rianta to make sure the issues of commercial sensitivity are dealt with and when those are addressed the information can be made available.</p>
          <p eId="para_560">As I said last week, it is the Minister's view that both Cork and Shannon have an excellent future with this debt-free start. He brought this view to Government last week and the Government agreed with him. The new boards at the independent airports in Cork and Shannon will provide dynamic futures for those regions and it was on that basis that the decisions were made. I understand there is continuing engagement with the trade unions on matters of concern to them. Department officials met the Aer Rianta unions last Friday to discuss issues related to the current stopover policy and future meetings have been arranged, though I have no dates for them. The Minister has repeatedly stated publicly that Aer Rianta workers have nothing to fear from the restructuring. There will be no diminution of their tenure or terms and conditions of employment. That remains the position.</p>

        <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_317">
          <from>Mr. Rabbitte:</from>
          <p eId="para_561">The one part of the Taoiseach's response which was not scripted for him will cause alarm throughout the regions in terms of its implications for the regional airports. He said, "every single seat is subsidised."  We know that. What will happen when they are not subsidised and the regulator prevents them from being subsidised? Is the Taoiseach telling the people that Knock, Galway and Kerry will shut down? What is the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O'Donoghue, saying about the implications for Kerry? What is the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Fahey, saying about the implications for Galway? What is the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, saying about the implications for Knock? Why was this concealed? Why is the Taoiseach proceeding when the Minister for Finance says he may not proceed at this stage because none of the essential work in unravelling the Aer Rianta corporate structure has happened and because it is necessary to get advice on borrowing, bond arrangements and pension entitlements, all of which are complex? The implications for the regional airports will be disastrous if the Taoiseach presses ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_562">The Taoiseach says the unions may have the information except for the sensitive data, but every single page of the PWC report has "sensitive data" marked across it. The Taoiseach is the one who said in this House that they could have the report. The Minister for Transport told journalists they could have the report but when they met last Friday they were not given the report. The Taoiseach has no intention of giving them the report. Furthermore, it was the intention to conceal the advice of the Minister for Finance and his Department in this situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_563">The Aer Rianta situation, like so much that the Minister for Transport touches, is a shambles. It is like the port tunnel or the Red Cow. You name it, it is a shambles.</p>

          <p eId="para_578">Yesterday, in hospitals from Tallaght to Ballinasloe and from Blanchardstown to Cork, well over 130 patients languished on trolleys in hospital corridors. Many of them are seriously ill and lying under glaring lights, night and day. All of them are in great discomfort. In Tallaght, 37 patients were on trolleys and 19 were in the corridors beside the emergency room, while that hospital has 35 beds closed in order to save money.</p>
          <p eId="para_579">What does the nursing profession have to do to be given the necessary resources to provide beds, given that 3,000 beds are needed? Should some nurses be dispatched with a bottle of champagne to the Punchestown races, in hope of tripping across the Minister for Finance, who might fortuitously be in the company of the Minister for Health and Children? Should they drink a toast to Fianna Fáil, promise a contribution to that party's funds and then return with the resources necessary to care for their patients?</p>
          <p eId="para_580">We have this crisis at the beginning of winter, before the real brunt of winter illnesses sets in which will put the elderly, in particular, at risk. Incredibly, we now have a situation where many senior citizens, who could be helped to avoid getting ill and therefore avoid being hospitalised, avoiding further pressure on the hospital system, cannot afford to have the anti-influenza vaccination administered. Whereas the dose is administered from general funding, the administration of it is not and may cost up to €40, €50 or €60. While medical card holders are covered, the limit is only €7,000 per annum and many people are suffering grave hardship as a result. Will the Taoiseach intervene to ensure urgent redress for the lack of hospital beds at the start of this winter and to instruct that all citizens who are at risk from influenza, particularly the elderly, will have the vaccination administered from general funding?</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach:</from>
          <p eId="para_581">I am aware there were ongoing difficulties in some accident and emergency departments but I am also aware of the considerable resources that have been put into the system by the Minister and the ERHA in the hospitals mentioned. My information is that the Minister for Health and Children recently allocated resources to the ERHA, under the bed capacity initiative, to facilitate the discharge of patients from the acute system to alternative care, thereby allowing for the moving of about 200 patients over the coming weeks in order that emergency cases in A&amp;E departments where there are delays will be provided with an adequate number of beds. Additional A&amp;E consultants were recruited under the winter initiative. They have been appointed specifically to Dublin hospitals. Other issues concerning A&amp;E departments are ongoing in terms of the winter initiative, which the Minister introduced this year and in previous years.</p>
          <p eId="para_582">My information is that there is no shortage of the influenza vaccine. All those over the age of  70 and all medical card holders have received it, which accounts for a great number of people. Some 470,000 doses of influenza vaccine were distributed to the health boards and to general practitioners under the influenza campaign. I am aware that an A strain of the flu has been quite severe on children and the elderly. An additional 100,000 doses of the vaccine are available to meet the increased demand in health boards nationwide, which has been notified to the central units of the ERHA. I do not know what the Deputy is talking about in this regard. It is not something on which I have information.</p>
          <p eId="para_583">The influenza vaccine is available free to general practitioners for medical card holders and those who come under the ‘at risk' group, who include persons aged 65 or over with special chronic illnesses such as heart, lung or kidney disease and those who have a suppressed immune system, the majority of whom have a medical card. The issue has been well covered. The fee for administering the vaccine in cases where people have no cover is dealt with by the general practitioner and the patient. Everyone in the country cannot have a medical card.</p>

          <p eId="para_585">Does the Taoiseach agree that the vaccine should be available from general funding to all people in those categories? Does he agree that the 200,000 people who were supposed to benefit from medical cards but who were cheated of them in a subsequent U-turn by the Government should qualify? Is he saying that the only remedy promised for the entire winter is the moving of 200 people out of beds they are currently occupying to enable those on trolleys to be moved to those beds? What about the 3,000 beds that are necessary in the system? Far more than 200 beds are necessary as an emergency measure.</p>
          <p eId="para_586">The number of patients on trolleys in Blanchardstown hospital yesterday was 25, yet a state-of-the-art accident and emergency department lies unopened in that hospital and members of the nursing profession there are strongly suspicious that the last tranche of funding to enable it to open is being withheld until a time closer to the European and local elections. Does the Taoiseach agree that would be the most contemptuous cynicism in the treatment of our medical system and those who are desperately dependent on it? Will he address clearly the two or three questions I have put and not give me a second lecture on the strains of the influenza virus? We will leave that to others for the moment. I am concerned about to whom it is available.</p>

          <p eId="para_613">There is a need to debate No. 14 in the Dáil because the issue raised goes far beyond that of time. The proposals in No. 14 are an exercise under the Fourth Protocol to the Amsterdam treaty. There are two proposals, one on Ireland and the other in response to an initiative taken by the Italian Government at Council. It represents a complete reversal of the initial position taken by Ireland. Justification of the Government's reversal of that position warrants debate in this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_614">I take the point made by Deputy Kenny. Under the terms of the Amsterdam treaty and its Fourth Protocol, matters would have to be responded to within three months, hence the suggestion of a timeframe. That is unconvincing because it is open to Ireland, under the treaty, to adopt it later. Even so, there are serious matters raised by the response under Article 4.1 that involve the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It has been agreed by Council and is now coming to the Dáil only for it to nod it through to the committee, for a quick nod from it, without discussing either of the components – a change in position of the Government under Article 3 and a fundamentally disputatious proposal from the Italian Government on Article 4.1. The idea that it should be rattled through in this manner is completely unacceptable. The obligations that arise in international law and our compliance are so serious that it is outrageous that both the Government and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform would seek to deal with such a serious matter in this way. This is why I oppose this proposal for the Order of Business. I agree entirely with what the leader of the Fine Gael Party, Deputy Kenny, said on No. 15. This combination of Nos. 14 to 16, inclusive, as a single item for decision on the Order of Business is clearly unsatisfactory.</p>

I ask the Ceann Comhairle to take note of this. This lumping together of matters makes it more absurd in that No. 14 on the Order Paper will go to a committee and Nos. 15 and 16 are back from committee. They are all diverse issues, are equally important and need to be dealt with in their own right.</p>
          <p eId="para_624">The gravity of No. 14 has been outlined. As it is involves an initiative from the Italian Government, it raises questions when one considers that Government's legacy under Mr. Berlusconi, with immigrants left adrift off the Italian coast. Are we to pay for the deportation of people in those circumstances? What if those third country nationals are parents of Irish-born citizens? These are matters that need to be debated in the House. We represent all the people in the Twenty-six Counties and we should be able to discuss this matter in Parliament.

          <p eId="para_625">No. 15 concerns the Freedom of Information Act 1997 (Prescribed Bodies) Regulations 2003, which states that the term "prescribed bodies" does not include the Garda Síochána. This is one of many matters regarding the Act that must be debated in the House, rather than just nodding it through after referral to committee. As of yesterday, the "blacks" of the debate in committee on the terms of the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture were not available. It is difficult for the House to be fully informed on matters that we are asked to vote on.

There has been plenty of time over recent weeks to afford adequate debate on them, but it was not accommodated. We now have a proposal to send this item back so the Government can meet the set opt-in deadline. We do not have to do that, as the Taoiseach well knows, unless he has proposals to modify or amend the proposals in this case, and there has been no indication of that. The reality is that we can opt in at any time in the future with the Schengen Agreement states that are behind the measure. There is no sound basis for this measure going to committee without proper scrutiny and debate in the Chamber. Accordingly, I oppose the proposition.</p>

          <p eId="para_628">There are two parts to No. 14. Deputy Michael D. Higgins has said that these should be scrutinised and I have no difficulty with that. However, these specialist issues should be dealt with in committee which any Member can attend. The first of these issues concerns the proposal that will oblige participant States, including Norway and Iceland, to advise each other whenever joint flights for the removal of illegally resident third country nationals are being organised, indicating the number of seats available on board the plane and inviting participation. Organisers of a joint flight will appoint a leader for the operation, identify a suitable carrier, arrange a contract with the carrier and ensure that the appointed carrier obtains a flight plan, with necessary flyover and landing authorisations. It merely means that if there is a flight organised, countries co-operate with each other. They are also made aware of the return flight. We are talking about dealing with illegal people who have gone through due process and have been ordered to return home.</p>
          <p eId="para_629">The second part of that proposal requests Dáil time to approve motions on the exercise by the State of an option under the fourth Protocol Directive of the Treaty of Amsterdam in respect of an initiative by the Italian Government with a  view to adopting a Council Directive on assistance in cases of transit through the territory of one or more member states in the context of removal orders. It is a connected item. The proposal will oblige participating EU states, as well as Norway and Iceland, to provide each other with a range of assistance measures in cases of transit for the purposes of expelling by land, including sea crossings between two points within the same country, illegally resident third country nationals who are the subject of expulsion orders to member states. The measures will include meeting expellees and their escorts on arrival at cross-border points and providing them with outward assistance to ensure that the transit operation is completed successfully. It also includes provisions for the use of legitimate force to prevent or overcome resistance to expulsion and transit and to provide accommodation, sustenance, emergency and medical care in transit. The sovereignty of member states, particularly with regard to the use of direct force against aliens resisting removal, will remain unaffected. These are the two proposals that will go to committee for discussion.</p>

All Deputies in the House, irrespective of whether they have a party or not, have been contacted by concerned people arising not only from the Hanly report, but from the Prospectus and Brennan reports. This is insufficient time for Members to discuss their concerns and fears about the Hanly report, when one considers that 1,000 people turned up in Ennis and 20,000 are expected to march there  over the closure of their hospital, and that in Nenagh last night over 1,000 people turned up, including the Minister of Defence, who rejected the Hanly report out of hand. Others around the country are equally concerned. The elected representatives in this House should not be treated this way. They should have the opportunity to have their say and point out the fears and concerns of their constituents, as expressed to them, over the health service and the implications of the Hanly report – where we are and where the aspirations in the report point to. I am objecting to the proposal on that basis. There should be no guillotine on this report.</p>

          <p eId="para_645">The point is well made and I reiterate that the time is not adequate for dealing with the Hanly report. It is a matter that applies to every single individual in this country. If it does not apply now, it could in the future. It is going to affect every town and village, given that it will apply to hospitals, which were the subject of promises by this Government before the last election. The Hanly report, it seems, is a complete whitewash to obliterate these promises from the memories of people. The Government needs to be told that the public's memory is well attuned to it breaking promises and it will not be whitewashed by the Hanly report. I would ask the Government to allow extra time and the Ceann Comhairle to support that. It would be appreciated so that we may get to grips with what the report is really about. It appears to be about whitewashing the Government's policy, to obliterate promises made before the last election and to start afresh. The Government is not going to get away with that.</p>

          <p eId="para_646">Apart from the inadequate time to address what is involved in the Hanly report, there is the much bigger issue of  the fact that there is no motion. There will be no vote and no conclusions drawn from the exercise in this Chamber. Recognising that any diminution of services at any hospital site diminishes everyone, whether in our backyard or any part of the country, the reality is that what Hanly proposes to do is lift the template or the blueprint of what happened to Monaghan General Hospital and to apply it to other hospitals throughout this State. That is objectionable and I would never wish to see the pain and anguish which continue daily in my community and constituency, visited on others. That is the reality of what Hanly spells out. We should have been afforded the opportunity, not only to have more time for statements, but to register our opposition to what the report represents and what it threatens – not promises – to visit on communities throughout the length and breadth of this State.</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach:</from>
          <p eId="para_682">Deputy Olivia Mitchell asked a fair question. With the Ceann Comhairle's permission, I will read a short note, which I think will be of help. This is secondary legislation. The smoking ban is contained in statutory instrument 481 of 2003, which was notified to the European Commission on 24 April 2003. There was no objection to this smoking ban by the Commission or any member state. Accordingly, on 16 October 2003, the Minister for Health and Children signed an order which provided that the ban would commence with effect from 26 January 2004. The legal basis for the ban on smoking, having passed through the required European process, is now rock solid. It is the law and will be effective as and from its commencement date.</p>
          <p eId="para_683">Subsequently, it was decided that there should be exemptions to the ban in addition to domestic dwellings. These exemptions were required to be notified to the European Commission. The specific exemptions are as follows: prisons, outdoor places, psychiatric hospitals, hospices, nursing homes, sleeping accommodation in hotels, guesthouses, bed and breakfast accommodation and accommodation provided for educational or charitable purposes, and the Central Mental Hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_684">Some exemptions have been notified, according to European law, to the European Commission. The first notification was on 3 November 2003 and related to prisons and outdoor places. The second notification will be made tomorrow, which is in line with what Deputy Olivia Mitchell stated last week. Under European law there is a three month period in which other member states can raise objections to the exemptions. In this regard it is of significance that no objections were made to the ban as previously notified. Because of the hiatus between the commencement date chosen by the Minister for Health and Children,  26 January 2004, and the expiry of the three month minimum period for all the exemptions, an adjustment is required to the date of commencement of the ban. A new date will be chosen by the Minister for Health and Children with effect to the expiry of the period stipulated by European law. In these circumstances, the ban together with the exemption is expected to be in operation by end February 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_685">It is important to emphasise that the ban and exemptions are made under the tobacco code of legislation, which is separate and distinct from the health and safety Act. They are two separate codes. Legal advice has been received from the Office of the Attorney General that the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 1989 may not encompass the banning of environmental tobacco smoke in the workplace. To remove this legal uncertainty it has been decided that primary legislation is required. In this regard, I point out that a review of the health and safety Act 1989 is at an advanced stage – I mentioned that a number of times in regard to promised legislation. The heads of the Bill have been issued, therefore amendments to the legislation are already envisaged. The proposed Bill will provide a vehicle for such amendments as are necessary to remove any legal uncertainties. The initiative under the health and safety Act will not affect the implementation of the smoking ban.</p>

          <p eId="para_690">Other Deputies have reflected, and I repeat the point, that the Taoiseach must come clean and be crystal clear in his intent <i>vis-à-vis</i> these regulations. We need to know exactly how they will apply and the definition in regard to dwellings? What is the position for those in psychiatric institutions, nursing homes and the various other situations in which people find themselves through no fault of their own, those who are using the hospitality sector for hotel bedroom accommodation? All these  points need to be specifically spelt out so that people know exactly what they will face.</p>

          <p eId="para_691">The Green Party strongly supports the smoking ban, but we want a proper set of definitive regulations that will not be subject to sniping and loopholes. In that regard whether an An Óige hostel with communal sleeping arrangements is to be covered is still an open question. Will the Government consider a more rounded consultation process in a committee of the House to make sure that all these areas are teased out and that legal opinion is sought in advance so that it cannot be unravelled. According to current reports, there will be serious attempts to unravel it and we must ensure that does not happen.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" as="#Minister_for_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_515">
          <from>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</from>
          <p eId="para_796">I welcome the opportunity to debate the report of the national task force on medical staffing which I published last month. It is a significant contribution to health policy as it maps out the only way forward for our acute hospital services. I established the national task force on medical staffing to deal with a number of key concerns. These were to identify how best to reduce the average working hours of non-consultant hospital doctors as required under the European working  time directive, to explore the practical implications of developing a consultant-provided service and to recommend how to structure medical education and training within a shorter working week.</p>
          <p eId="para_797">From these three tasks – all of them substantial in themselves – arose a further important issue, namely, how to organise our acute hospital services in order that they allow doctors to work and be trained within much shorter hours than at present. Above all, the concern was to organise services to provide the best possible service for patients.</p>
          <p eId="para_798">By now, Members will be well aware of the report's main recommendations. Therefore, I do not intend to go into their detail again. Instead, I wish to concentrate on a number of key issues which should help to inform the debate ahead. As a result of the slant which has been put on the Hanly report, it is not surprising that some people have concerns about the future of their local hospital. If we believed every claim made in recent weeks, we would think that hospitals would no longer cater for patients safely and that a host of existing services would be taken away from local communities. This is untrue, so let us set the record straight.</p>
          <p eId="para_799">Tonight is a good opportunity to state what is really proposed in the Hanly report. We should debate this report responsibly and with all the facts. As legislators, we owe it to the people to have an informed discussion which will help everyone see what is really proposed. Unfortunately, some will seek to manipulate the report to suit their own ends. I call on Members to concentrate on what the Hanly report actually says and on its real implications. Let us deal with facts, not fear.</p>

          <from>Ms O. Mitchell:</from>
          <p eId="para_800">The Minister should not talk about his Government colleagues like that.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_517" as="#Minister_for_Health_and_Children">
          <from>Mr. Martin:</from>
          <p eId="para_801">Let us look at what the implementation of the report will mean for patients and not forget that this report is about finding the best way to deliver the best possible services to patients.</p>
          <p eId="para_802">A great deal of concern has been raised about the availability of accident and emergency services in smaller hospitals under the Hanly proposals. Therefore, we need to be clear what the report states. It is perfectly safe for local hospitals to continue providing the great majority of the services they provide for people who have minor injuries or illnesses. Contrary to some claims, there is no question of closing these departments and transferring all their patients elsewhere. Local hospitals will continue to cater for a high proportion – some 70% – of the patients they see at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_803">However, the task force report states that the best possible care for life-threatening situations is provided in a major hospital with all the neces sary specialties available on-site, including diagnostic and support facilities and intensive care.</p>
          <p eId="para_804">Much of the debate has centred on what would happen to patients in need of emergency treatment if their local hospital no longer provided a full accident and emergency service. In that context, it is useful to look at a few practical examples. Medical advice is that if a person has a heart attack, there are a number of critical interventions which have a direct effect on patient survival and outcome. These include the prompt administration of thrombolytic or clot-busting drugs, the possible use of life-saving cardiac defibrillation to reverse irregularities in the heartbeat, and cardiac resuscitation, including heart massage and mouth-to-mouth breathing. In each of these cases, with appropriate training, health professionals such as trained ambulance personnel and emergency medical technicians can provide these critical interventions. These three important urgent interventions are the best means of improving a patient's chance of survival from a heart attack and are not dependent on having a hospital close by.</p>
          <p eId="para_805">The key concern, which the medical advice emphasises to us, is that the patient should receive urgent treatment at the point of first contact. Thereafter, the priority is to get the patient to the hospital best staffed and equipped with the full range of diagnostic and treatment options. In the North Western Health Board area, general practitioners have commenced administration of thrombolytic drugs to patients with suspected acute heart attacks at the point of first contact, reflecting the urgency of the timing of this intervention.</p>
          <p eId="para_806">If a person is severely injured in a road traffic accident, the medical advice is that there are two main urgent treatments which influence the immediate chance of survival, namely, maintaining the patient's airway at the site of the accident in order that he or she can breathe, and immediate action to stop or reduce loss of blood. The administration of intravenous fluids or plasma expanders can also be critical. Again, health professionals at the scene of the accident can administer these treatments. After that, the next major influence on survival is to treat the patient in a hospital with the comprehensive range of surgical, medical and anaesthetic skills and diagnostic facilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_807">Some people have quoted cases of smaller hospitals stabilising seriously ill or injured patients before transferring them to a larger more specialised hospital. They argue that patients' lives are saved every year by this means and that this will be hampered by the Hanly proposals. However, the international experience in Australia, North America and Scotland is that advanced-trained emergency technicians, EMTAs, can deal with the immediate pre-hospitalisation needs of the patient. This includes basic life support such as airway intubation, intravenous access and advanced cardiac life support as well as thrombolytic treatment, defibrillation  and the administration of other oral and, if required, intravenous drugs, especially to control pain.</p>
          <p eId="para_808">The Hanly report recommends the development of the EMTA service in terms of numbers and training, together with strategically placed ambulance stations throughout the designated catchment areas of the proposed hospital network. This enhanced emergency service needs to be augmented by a corresponding development in primary care and general practitioner services. The clear international expert advice available, therefore, is that immediate proximity to a local hospital is not the critical issue in the case of serious accidents or life-threatening emergencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_809">Concern has been expressed about the type of accident and emergency services which will remain in local hospitals. I emphasise that patients needing treatment for most injuries will continue to be treated there. If one's child has a minor injury, one can still bring him or her to a local hospital and if one has an asthma attack, one can still be treated locally. Contrary to some claims, the opening hours of minor injury and illness units do not automatically have to be nine to five. Opening hours will be set by the volume of demand for services. The experience in Ireland, for example, is that the great majority of non-urgent injuries and illnesses present between about 8 a.m. and midnight. Exact opening hours of local facilities can then be organised accordingly.</p>
          <p eId="para_810">In addition to the future organisation of accident and emergency services, the overall role of local hospitals has been the subject of considerable debate since the task force report was published. As the House will be aware, the Hanly report distinguishes between major hospitals, which provide the full range of specialist services appropriate to a region, and local hospitals, which work closely as part of an integrated network with the major hospitals. The concept of a general hospital is also advanced in the report. Local hospitals are ideally placed to provide an increasing volume of elective procedures and the kind of multi-specialist day and out-patient care performed in larger hospitals.</p>
          <p eId="para_811">Local hospitals should be developed further to provide excellent locally available services to their communities. We should be clear about what this development entails. It means that we would have a wider range of medical and surgical specialties in a number of areas, including cardiology, respiratory medicine, general medicine, oncology and urology as well as ear, nose and throat, ophthalmic and plastic surgery. When one considers the scope of the services proposed by the task force for local hospitals, it is not valid to describe their future role as a downgrade from the services they provide at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_812">We should remember also that local hospitals will have the services of a wide range of health professionals. This is not confined to consultants and junior doctors, but extends to general prac titioners, specialist and staff nurses, radiographers, physiotherapists and occupational therapists. With this type of staffing and service provision, people will have access to a wider range of hospital services in their local hospital than ever before.</p>
          <p eId="para_813">We have heard a number of calls recently to retain all services in all smaller hospitals, including 24-hour, seven-day accident and emergency departments. These calls are in spite of the medical evidence that I have described here. The case for change set out in the Hanly report is compelling because it is based on international evidence and is concerned with ensuring safe, high quality care for patients. Even if all this is rejected – a very unwise thing to do – we must remember the new realities about staffing and working hours.</p>
          <p eId="para_814">Under the European working time directive, junior doctors will no longer be able to work the extremely long hours they do today. We have to reduce their working time from the current average of 75 hours per week to no more than 58 hours per week by next August and to a maximum of 48 hours by 2009. This affects how we provide services in local and major hospitals. We cannot just decide to keep every service in every hospital on a 24-hour, seven-day basis because we will not have the medical cover to provide it within a 48-hour working week.</p>
          <p eId="para_815">It is clear that the solution must not be to employ more junior doctors. The Hanly report estimates that we would need an extra 2,500 non-consultant hospital doctors just to ensure that all of them worked no more than 48 hours a week. Even if we could recruit this number, it would be extremely undesirable to do so. Patients would have less access to senior clinicians and the junior doctors involved would have limited opportunities for formal training.</p>
          <p eId="para_816">By contrast, the task force report argues for a consultant-provided service in which patients would be directly seen and treated by a doctor with the experience and expertise to make a decision without delay. This cannot happen if we disimprove even further the present ratio of consultants to NCHDs.</p>
          <p eId="para_817">Those arguing that nothing should change in accident and emergency services must think about the practical staffing issues. They must answer the question of how to provide medical staff on a 24-hour basis in every local hospital when nobody can work more than 48 hours per week. The task force report has come up with the best solution. It is the only feasible solution I have heard so far which provides quality care for patients and ensures that doctors do not have to work excessive hours.</p>
          <p eId="para_818">A number of Deputies have questioned whether we can reduce the working hours of junior doctors to an average of 58 by 1 August next. There is no doubt that this will be very challenging. However, it is important to bear in mind that, contrary to some claims, it will not be necessary to have recruited the additional consultants proposed in the Hanly report by then. The task force  proposes a set of key measures which, if implemented on a national basis, will help significantly to achieve the reduction required by next August. These include a replacement of the present system of tiered or layered on-call, where a number of junior doctors are on call at once, use of cross-cover between specialties so that the number of doctors on call at once can safely be reduced, and revised working patterns for junior doctors.</p>
          <p eId="para_819">These changes will have to be negotiated through the industrial relations process. I do not underestimate the task involved, but the results will be to the benefit of patients and doctors. For NCHDs, the changes will mean that they will no longer have to work the hours they currently do. This can only improve their quality of life as well as their ability to give the best possible care to their patients.</p>
          <p eId="para_820">A key element of the Hanly proposals is the doubling of the number of consultants over the next ten years so that patients will have much more rapid access to senior clinical decision-making. Consultants would also participate, as required, in the provision of on-site cover in the hospital over the 24-hour period. The task force proposes that consultants should work together on a team basis, with a shared cohort of junior doctors for the whole team. This differs from the current practice where a single consultant and a group of NCHDs work together, but without necessarily any formal arrangements for co-operation between consultants. Effectively, then, consultants would share responsibility for patients with their consultant colleagues.</p>
          <p eId="para_821">The benefits for patients of these changes are considerable. The increase in the number of consultants, together with a team-based approach and improved availability of consultant cover over the full 24-hour period, will give patients faster access to the doctors who are best placed to take decisions about their care.</p>
          <p eId="para_822">We will need significant changes in the current consultant contract to make all this happen. I have asked the Health Services Employers Agency to press ahead with negotiations with the medical organisations as quickly as possible. A new contract will be vital to achieving the changes that we need.</p>
          <p eId="para_823">Some concern has been expressed about the ability of hospitals to cope with new roles, especially where they are already very busy. I must stress that the changes proposed by the Hanly report should only be implemented on a phased basis, taking account of each hospital's facilities and ability to cope with the role it is being asked to play. There can be no question of asking any hospital to take on additional services until it is properly staffed and equipped for that role.</p>
          <p eId="para_824">Some of the claims made recently would have us believe that hospitals will become overloaded and generally unable to treat the patients arriving. The Hanly report clearly states that we need  to develop appropriate services before we transfer extra patients to them. This applies both in the case of moving services from major to local hospitals and the other way around. There will therefore be no question of the chaos that some people have claimed will ensue from implementing the Hanly recommendations.</p>
          <p eId="para_825">In the regions looked at already, we will first analyse the detail of the services that should be provided in each hospital, together with the staffing and capital needs that arise from any change. There will be no question of transferring any services until the necessary facilities are in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_826">I welcome the report of the task force on medical staffing. It is the only way forward. It will improve patient care, increase local access to services, reduce the working hours of junior doctors and give us a truly consultant-provided service. Those Deputies who oppose it must ask themselves these important questions: should we not improve our acute hospital services; should we not introduce a consultant-provided service; should we not double the number of consultants; should we not reduce the excessively long working hours of junior doctors; and should we not reform the way we train doctors.</p>
          <p eId="para_827">Above all, if Deputies oppose the report, or key aspects of it, they must ask themselves what is the alternative. Can they suggest another realistic, substantive, workable way of improving services while also meeting the requirements of the European working time directive? So far I have not heard of such a single alternative to the Hanly report which would work.</p>
          <p eId="para_828">I urge Deputies to consider the report carefully. I look forward to the debate about to take place and commend the report to the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_829">I am a little annoyed that the Minister appears to suggest that it is somehow unpatriotic of us not to accept Hanly's report, and the Minister's endorsement of it, without question. As the Opposition, it is our job to question, dissect and ensure that all proposals, particularly those of this magnitude, are given the greatest scrutiny and not accepted at face value simply because the Minister says they are good. Any expression of opposition to the Hanly report by Fine Gael is not a knee-jerk reaction for the sake of opposition or for political expediency.</p>
          <p eId="para_830">Fine Gael recognises much that is good in the report. While some of our criticism is about the Hanly report <i>per se</i> and its recommendations, much of it is political criticism. It is based on a lack of confidence in the Government's ability or willingness to fund all the necessary recommendations or to manage the major transformation in the health service envisaged in the report.</p>
          <p eId="para_831">We recognise much that is good in the Hanly report and believe that many of the best practice principles underlying it are a necessary part of the reform of the health service and absolutely required to achieve a sustainable quality health care. We recognise also the value of a consultant-led service. If delivered, it will be infinitely better  than the service available to many people presenting in hospitals at the moment.</p>
          <p eId="para_832">We recognise the value of multidisciplinary teams. The lack of an integrated service, in hospitals, out-patient departments and throughout the health service, is one of the major deficiencies in the service. The synergies achievable from multidisciplinary teams are enormous in terms of the quality of the service and the cost savings that will be available through ensuring that the appropriate person gives the treatment.</p>
          <p eId="para_833">I support the training and education recommendations contained in the report and hope they put an end to the scandal in many of our hospitals. Doctors, particularly those sent here from Third World countries, are given poor training and certainly no recognition whatsoever, yet in many cases they are here at great expense to their families and countries. We use them and abuse them merely to meet our service requirements, and I hope that practice will end.</p>
          <p eId="para_834">Fine Gael also supports the increased regionalisation of specialties. It is totally unacceptable that people must travel long distances to Dublin to receive care in many of the specialties. That has repercussions for services in all hospitals, particularly the major hospitals around Dublin. I totally accept the notion of a population of 350,000 being the ideal one for the provision of many of the specialties. I accept other recommendations whereby we would have supraregional services and, indeed, national services.</p>
          <p eId="para_835">I have no hesitation whatsoever in saying that Fine Gael does not support the slash and burn policy of closing all the smaller accident and emergency departments – I will return to that issue – but we support aspects of the Hanly report and we are acutely conscious of the urgent need for reform of the health service, not just the hospital sector with which Hanly deals almost exclusively.</p>
          <p eId="para_836">The immediate context of the Hanly report was as a manpower study on how the European working time directive could be implemented. However, the broader context of it, and the reports of Prospectus and Brennan, was the urgent need for reform of the health service, not merely for the sake of change, but ideally to rethink fundamentally what it does, and to build in an automatically responding flexibility. Such flexibility will ensure that it can respond to changing circumstances in the future and be able to bear the pressures on the service so that we do not hear calls for fundamental reform and change to the structures every four or five years and wonder why in another five years we need to call for further reforms.</p>
          <p eId="para_837">We need sustainable reforms which will carry us through all the pressures on the health service, such as the ageing population, improved technology and the more expensive better drugs. Those pressures cannot be sustained by the system as it is structured and there is a real danger that, starved of funds and subjected to all these  pressures, together with the shortage of manpower, it will simply collapse. Therefore reform is vital and we recognise that.</p>
          <p eId="para_838">I am convinced that these reforms do not go half far enough. I do not believe that getting rid of a few accident and emergency departments and the health boards is the whole answer. Certainly it will not provide long-term solutions. For instance, is there a proposal outlining how the abolition of the health boards will save money? Certainly it will get rid of the democratic accountability within the system. Replacing the health boards and the current system with a monolithic centralised one, with all the worst flaws of the Soviet Russian administration, hardly seems like progress or a way of providing a more efficient system.</p>
          <p eId="para_839">Certainly there is a need for an overarching guiding hand to set policy, but that is the Minister's job. Abolishing all local administration is not the right way to go, and my colleague, Deputy Naughten, will make this point. Indeed, the Minister's colleagues in other Departments are going in the opposite direction. They are breaking up CIE and Aer Rianta, while the Minister, Deputy Martin, is going in the opposite direction and telling us that somehow this will be more efficient. It will not be more efficient. It will lack flexibility, it will lack local knowledge and it certainly will not enhance integration of the service and produce the kind of seamless service delivery which would allow patients access to the continuum of hospitals, community care services and nursing home services. It is hard to see how such a system, which was envisaged in the health strategy, can be provided under the new administrations. I will come back to these reforms, which I see as essential.</p>
          <p eId="para_840">Everybody sees the need for good governance within the health service, which is absorbing much of the budget. The entire Exchequer budget is being absorbed by the health service, but just being in favour of good governance and making changes for the sake of change will not bring it about.</p>
          <p eId="para_841">One of our criticisms of the report, which I outlined when Mr. Hanly came before the committee, is that he started from the premise of assuming a greenfield site and asking what is the ideal health service. The trouble is we do not start with a greenfield site. We have to move from a system where there are sick people to a sustainable one in the long-term and the Hanly report did not provide that road map. It provided a template for a health service if we were starting from day one, but it does not tell us how to get to that, and there is no confidence, even if the money was available, that the Government is capable of making that transformation safely.</p>
          <p eId="para_842">The Government has given no reason for confidence. There has been inefficiency, incompetence, maladministration, stop-go decision-making and false promises, so people no longer have confidence in the Government's ability to deliver. We have seen people on trolleys and on waiting  lists, not only to get into hospital but to see a consultant to get a diagnosis. As I stated previously, in many cases by the time people get a diagnosis it is too late for treatment.</p>
          <p eId="para_843">We have seen community care services decimated. Throughout the country we have seen GPs totally disillusioned. People who had bought into the promise of the health strategy are completely disillusioned. The Hanly report does not offer any immediate solution – nor does the Minister – to any of these problems that exist in the health service and they do not offer a way forward either. Put simply, the public has lost confidence in the Government and will not believe that the Hanly report offers them a better service until they see it.</p>
          <p eId="para_844">My second criticism relates to the lack of resources. Indeed, there is a lack of commitment from members of the Government to the Hanly report and we saw in the newspapers this morning that the report failed the political test at the first fence – the Ministers themselves cannot even support it.</p>
          <p eId="para_845">The resources required for implementation of the Hanly recommendations are enormous, and that has been glossed over completely. I am not talking about consultants' salaries, which of course are considerable, but the huge infrastructural investment that would be required, both at local hospital level and particularly at the major hospitals. Acute beds, which were taken out of the local hospitals, must be replaced in these major hospitals before any dismantling of the local service takes place. GPs and ambulance personnel will require up-skilling and the regional hospital building programme, involving the provision of about 2,500 new beds, will be necessary to replace the emergency beds taken from local hospitals.</p>
          <p eId="para_846">This is to say nothing of the huge investment required in ensuring access, which is a critical aspect of the Hanly report. Ensuring that people can access hospitals entails having a better road structure, perhaps having an air ambulance service, and the up-skilling and resourcing of GPs to ensure that they can provide many of the services provided currently by local hospitals.</p>
          <p eId="para_847">We do not know the amount of money required. It has not been quantified. There is no commitment to it. The only thing we know for certain is that the Minister for Finance has said there will be no funds next year. Therefore we know that in year one of the ten years of the transformation there will be no funds, despite the fact that there are two pilot programmes which must be implemented by next August. Whatever chance there was of implementing aspects of the Hanly report or beginning the transformation during the years of the Celtic tiger, when it also would have been difficult and expensive, it is virtually impossible to do that now because it will be necessary to ensure that nothing is dismantled until replacement services are up and running and proof is provided <i>vis-à-vis</i> the system's capability  of delivering a better service than that which exists now.</p>
          <p eId="para_848">The Hanly-type bed closures taking place in Dublin have exacerbated the accident and emergency crisis. This offers an early indication of the potentially catastrophic impact the recommendations in the Hanly report could have nationally. The Hanly-type closure of beds in smaller hospitals are already occurring without any concomitant investment in terms of increasing the number of beds in the larger hospitals. Acute admissions that formerly went to hospitals such as Cherry Orchard, Peamount, St. Michael's in Dún Laoghaire and elsewhere are now presenting at the already overstretched accident and emergency departments in the major Dublin hospitals. This represents the implementation of Hanly by stealth, before the report was published. The Minister has not uttered one word on this topic and there has been total Government indifference to the impact it is having on Dublin hospitals and the patients attending them. There is a major and ongoing crisis in this area and people are being forced to endure unacceptable conditions.</p>
          <p eId="para_849">The failure to replace closed beds through investment in the major hospitals is a clear, early indication of what we can expect throughout the remainder of the country, when the number of accident and emergency departments will be reduced from approximately 40 at present to what is proposed under Hanly, namely, about 12. I accept, however, that there may be an opportunity to retain more than that. The acute hospital shortage, fuelled by the new flu epidemic and the undoubted reappearance soon of the winter vomiting bug, is spelling disaster for the capital's accident and emergency departments. It leaves no scope to deal with any major or minor disaster that might occur or the emergence of an unforeseen epidemic. If an outbreak of SARS or some similar disease occurred, how would the hospitals manage? They are incapable of doing so. If one adds Hanly's recommendations to this cocktail without increasing investment in the acute hospitals, chaos will be the only possible outcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_850">The withdrawal of accident and emergency services is the aspect of Hanly which has been most criticised and which has caused people to be frightened. I do not believe I have ever come across a political issue which genuinely engenders fear as that of the prospect of people being left without accident and emergency services. The Minister stated that we should not promote fear. There is no need for politicians to do so because people know the value of their local hospitals and they are making judgments about that matter. Promises about centres of excellence are meaningless if such centres are not accessible. The centres to which I refer cannot be accessible without a major investment in roads, ambulances, helicopters, GP services, etc. A person from the midlands recently said to me that we are taking away their hospital and giving them an ambulance. The reality is, however, that we are not  even guaranteeing them an ambulance. That is why people are terrified about this issue.</p>

          <from>Ms McManus:</from>
          <p eId="para_861">Yesterday 37 patients were lying on trolleys at the accident and emergency department in Tallaght hospital, 19 of whom were placed in the corridors. There were 25 patients on trolleys in the Mater Hospital and 22 on trolleys in Beaumont Hospital. There were a further ten patients on trolleys at James Connolly Memorial Hospital, five at Cork University Hospital, 12 at Portiuncula Hospital and ten at St. Vincent's Hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_862">Those were the lucky patients. The unlucky ones were those who could not get a trolley and ended up sitting on chairs. An accident and emergency consultant at the Mater Hospital, Dr. Eamon Brazil, described the situation as being more or less constant for the past three years. He states that, in reality, however, it is worsening every month.</p>
          <p eId="para_863">Yesterday Tallaght hospital had to go off call because the pressures there were so great. At the Mater, ambulances were immobilised because their trolleys were being used and they could not leave until they were returned. Ambulances were recently stranded at Beaumont Hospital for the same reason.</p>
          <p eId="para_864">According to yesterday's newspaper reports, staff working in the Christmas rush in supermar kets are not under as much pressure as are the staff in Dublin hospitals at present. Today we are debating the Hanly report. Following its recommendations, the Government will close down hundreds of acute hospital beds, reduce dramatically the number of accident and emergency departments and divert thousands of patients away from local small hospitals. Patients who would normally attend their local hospital will be forced to go to major centres such as Tallaght hospital, the Mater, Cork University Hospital and Beaumont Hospital. At a time when these centres are tottering under the strain of demand, the idea for many of adding to their woes in this way smacks of madness.</p>
          <p eId="para_865">The Minister's contribution was extremely soothing. However, it is not enough to soothe people's concerns in respect of the recommendations in the report. His contribution did not tell the full story. The closure of accident and emergency departments will end 24 hour emergency services at local hospitals which will be replaced by nurse-led small injuries units. There is already a shortage of nurses, with approximately 1,000 needed for Dublin alone. A further crisis is developing in that there is a shortage of general practitioners. The idea of closing down accident and emergency departments and expecting that there will be enough nurses and GPs to fill the gap does not reflect reality.</p>
          <p eId="para_866">The Minister has not declared from where the money to facilitate this will come. No funding has been ring-fenced. We are aware that, next year, insufficient money will be provided to keep current services operating, not to mention providing for the additional facilities he states will be in place before any changes occur. If that is the case, the Minister ought to explain what will happen in the pilot areas. If nothing happens in those areas until facilities are provided, how will he ensure that the hundreds of acute hospital beds that are being closed in local hospitals will be provided at the major centres? The Minister should address that matter in his reply to the debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_867">In presenting his report, Hanly explained that it was prepared in a vacuum without any political, financial or industrial relations considerations being taken into account. This is its greatest weakness. None of us, particularly the Minister for Health and Children, can afford to disregard these considerations. On the day of the publication of the Hanly report, the Minister warned that he would challenge any opposition. He stated: "I have no doubt that this will be manipulated and used for political purposes. I would say to anyone . . .  listen very carefully in terms of what is being said. Anyone who opposes this needs to be challenged to produce a substantial and comprehensive alternative".</p>
          <p eId="para_868">Last night, at a public meeting in Nenagh, County Tipperary, the Minister's Cabinet colleague, the Minister for Defence, Deputy Michael Smith, effectively tore up Hanly and stated that he refused to endorse the recommendations of the report. He also insisted that he would not  stand over any downgrading of Nenagh Hospital. Where does this leave the Minister for Health and Children? What does he have to say in response to this outright rejection of his view? Where does this leave his much trumpeted programme of health reform? The Minister, Deputy Martin, should indicate whether he has the confidence of the Cabinet and whether Hanly has a future.</p>
          <p eId="para_869">Since the smoking ban, which was to be the Minister's <i>tour de force,</i> has begun sinking under a welter of confusion, the question is increasingly being asked whether he has a future. What credibility can he have as he lectures us about his plans for the future of the health service while his Government colleagues openly reject them? Will this continue? Will the Minister for Finance oppose the closure of accident and emergency services at Naas hospital? What will the Minister for Foreign Affairs have to say? What will the Minister for Social and Family Affairs say about services in Donegal or the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism about services in Kerry? What will the Minister for Agriculture and Food say about the downgrading of Bantry hospital or the Ceann Comhairle about Monaghan hospital? The Minister should talk to them first before he comes to the House to debate with us.</p>
          <p eId="para_870">While he is thinking about this, he might display a little courage and account for his record of gross mismanagement and incompetent use of resources, the failure to confront the core problems, the expectation that flinging money at the problems would bring results and the surfeit of political opportunism, hubris and false humility? Recently the Minster stated on RTE's "Morning Ireland" that the promise he made before the election to eliminate hospital waiting lists permanently by 2004 was a mistake. However, it was not a mistake because it was a cold, calculated ploy to fool people and it worked, but only temporarily. With 176 days to live up to the promise, the Government has lost all credibility on that score.</p>
          <p eId="para_871">The Hanly report is the latest of three reports commissioned by the Government but, before our expectations become too high, I refer to what happened to the others. The Brennan and Prospectus reports were endorsed by the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister and they all promised a swift response, which has not happened. The Minister promised he would announce the shadow HSE and the implementation body by mid-October, and we are still waiting. The process is bogged down because of lethargy and bureaucracy and because those who are part of the problem are taking charge of the process and delaying progress significantly.</p>
          <p eId="para_872">The Hanly report is not like the others because it cannot be put on the shelf to gather dust. The report is fundamentally about an EU directive, which will be partly implemented next August. It is different from the others but it might be out of date already. I do not say this for political pur poses because I am concerned that we may yet again ape what is happening in Britain and we may be too late. Instead of learning from their mistakes, we are following the British. It is important to consider what is happening in Britain because a similar process has been in train there for some time whereby services are centralised in major hospitals and local hospitals are used as satellites.</p>
          <p eId="para_873">The problems and pitfalls have led the NHS confederation and the Royal College of Physicians to set up a working group to review the system to see what can be done. An interesting article was published in the <i>British Medical Journal </i>in August 2001. It stated:</p>
          <p eId="para_874">. . . the favoured model has been a large central hospital with associated local hospitals to which patients are discharged. But this model may make services worse rather than better, argues Andy Black, once chief executive of the Central Middlesex Hospital and now a consultant in the organisation of acute services.</p>
          <p eId="para_875">Acute services can be thought of as a simple system that comprises a medical emergency that usually occurs in the patient's home, a journey to the hospital, assessment, admission, a treatment process, and then discharge. A large central hospital inevitably means longer journeys. This has immediate therapeutic implications: with many conditions minutes matter. Long journeys mean more ambulances –"and two fully crewed ambulances", said Black, "cost the same as the direct costs of a medical ward. Increased distance also creates problems for visiting families and weakens the links with primary care and social services, which are crucial for discharging the patient". Further problems then arise with assessment and admission. The large numbers of patients create logjams, with some patients spending hours on trolleys.</p>
          <p eId="para_876">The worst problems come with discharge. The difficulty of discharging patients increases with their distance from home, so big hospitals tend to fill up with medical patients. Ironically this often means that patients who need elective operation – those who might benefit from larger hospitals – cannot be admitted because the beds are filled.</p>
          <p eId="para_877">The Minister continually asks what is my alternative, and that is a fair question. I am not in a position to provide an alternative because I do not have resources. However, it is the Minister's job to set up a model. I can challenge presumptions made in the Hanly report and should not let them go unquestioned.</p>
          <p eId="para_878">Andy Black proposed reversing the favoured model. The article states:</p>
          <p eId="para_879">. . . patients would be admitted first to the local hospital, which would in effect be an assessment arm of the big hospital. The medical and nursing staff would be part of the team working in the central hospital, and staff would rotate between the hospitals. Most crucially the  local unit would have local imaging and laboratory support and high quality electronic links with the central hospital that would allow specialists there to know almost as much about the patients as if they were examining them directly. This technology exists but is mostly not available in the NHS. Some patients would need to be transferred to the central hospital, but it might well be the minority.</p>
          <p eId="para_880">The first advantage of such a system would be that patients with emergencies would reach hospital within ten rather than 30 minutes. Links with primary care would be better. Those who didn't need admission could be quickly discharged home, which seems to be logistically impossible to achieve in one day with current arrangements. Some patients need never go to the central hospital. Those who did would not need to be assessed again, and transfer could be faster because fewer transfers would be needed overall.</p>
          <p eId="para_881">Within our system, few patients reside within ten minutes of a hospital, particularly outside our cities. Perhaps what the Minister is doing is back to front. Local hospitals should be used as the funnel to ensure various patients are not dumped into the major hospitals, which do not need to care for them.</p>

          <p eId="para_895">If the Minister wishes to change his line, he should do so in a coherent fashion. There should not be a little of this and a little of that.</p>
          <p eId="para_896">I refer to the ambulance service. The Hanly report is predicated on the notion that there will be a massively enhanced ambulance service, which will replace accident and emergency departments in local hospitals. In view of difficulties in our current ambulance service, a huge amount of work would be involved in upgrading it. Under EU requirements, an ambulance can only carry one stretcher patient in future. I believe the training requirements which have been recognised in the Hanly report were also recognised in a report published in 1993, but it is only in 2004 that the training of trainers in specialised skills is envisaged. The situation augurs badly with regard to looking at the needs of the ambulance service and ensuring that, in taking emergency services away from local hospitals, notwithstanding what the Minister is now saying, as is clearly envisaged in the Hanly report, it can be replaced by a greatly enhanced ambulance service which will cost a great deal of money.</p>
          <p eId="para_897">As Mr. Andy Black has stated, the cost of providing the type of ambulance service we are discussing may be equivalent to that of a medical ward. These are costly changes, but we have heard absolutely nothing from the Minister as to how he will fund those changes. It should be clearly understood that he is talking in terms of the removal of hundreds of acute hospital beds from local hospitals, ending accident and emergency departments and replacing them a with nurse-led, part-time service to deal with small injuries. That is not the same as the emergency services which people currently use at local hospitals. The current thinking in Britain in that regard appears to be that emergency treatment should be provided at local hospitals, which should act as a funnel into central hospitals, rather than the reverse, which is the logic of Hanly.</p>

          <p eId="para_900">Unfortunately, due to time constraints, I must confine myself to negative points with regard to the Hanly report. In some respects, the report was summarised by a retired consult ant in Waterford, who said that one's response to Hanly depends on one's postal address. I regard that as a very good definition. For the people of Dublin, Cork and Galway cities, the Hanly report will have very little impact. Although we have heard a great deal about the accident and emergency crisis in this debate, that is a bed capacity and management problem as opposed to anything relating to consultant numbers. However, for patients and their public representatives in all other constituencies outside our major cities, the Hanly report, in its present form, would have very serious repercussions, unless major changes are envisaged in its roll-out.</p>
          <p eId="para_901">For example, 22 million consultations are carried out each year in general practice and there is no remaining capacity in that system to take on an additional workload. As I expect the Minister has been informed, the services appear to be in slow melt-down. Unless there is some action in this regard, I do not see how GPs can take over any of the workload, regardless of fancy terms such as linkage and so on in the Hanly report – it just will not happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_902">I am also aware of a report which highlights the weakness in ambulance response times across the country. The areas with the worst response times are also the areas which will have the worst outcome in so far as the Hanly report is concerned. The Minister and his Department officials should immediately have a look at this report, which examines the significant length of time it takes for an ambulance to deliver a patient to hospital from the time of the initial call.</p>
          <p eId="para_903">To give some reassurance to those constituencies which could be significantly affected, there are some positive things the Minister could do right now. He could insist on an embargo on appointment of further consultants to the teaching hospitals in Dublin and Cork. At least that would give an opportunity to beef up the regional hospitals by increasing their numbers of patients so that they might begin to look like the type of institutions to which the Minister keeps referring. Perhaps if something of this nature was implemented, we might believe that the Government is concerned about more than just the people of Dublin, Cork and Galway.</p>
          <p eId="para_904">In no way can any of the regional hospitals compare with the major hospitals in Dublin. It is easy for Dublin consultants to call for seven consultants in each specialty when that is already the situation in their own hospitals. However, that is not the case in the regional hospitals. The Hanly report identifies this bias which has existed for some time. The Limerick region, which is part of the pilot scheme, currently has 100 consultants, whereas the Dublin region, which is under review, has 177. However, they are both expected to have the same number of consultants when they reach the target population of 350,000. Clearly, a bias is already built into the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_905">Part of the problem in the context of the Hanly report, as I have observed since I became a Mem ber of Dáil Éireann, is an over-reliance on the opinions of Dublin consultants whenever decisions are being made. The Government does not appear to take on board the views of other consultants – perhaps they have not the time to talk to the Minister – as to what is happening on the ground in smaller regional hospitals, which are not being looked after. There appears to be a fatalistic notion in Dublin that one can close accident and emergency departments across the south-east, leaving people to travel 70 miles to Waterford, but that one needs five accident and emergency departments in Dublin. There has been no reference to closure of two accident and emergency departments in Dublin. That situation compounds the bias I find in many reports.</p>
          <p eId="para_906">The spin surrounding this debate is very annoying. It shows a lack of interest in the genuine concerns of patients, general practitioners, ambulance services and consultants in the hospitals which will be most affected by the Hanly report. That report needs much greater clarity in terms of what the Minister plans to do before the final deadline in 2008. We need exact timescales, rather than wishy-washy nonsense with regard to pilot schemes in Limerick, Dublin and the south-west. We need to beef up the regional centres to the status they are supposed to reach when the Hanly report is done and dusted. The report has to be implemented, although it is relatively easy to dismiss other reports. If the chairperson of the Brennan report group had not become so excited about its implementation, not very much would have been heard about that report.</p>
          <p eId="para_907">With regard to negotiations on consultants' contracts, I will play the role of a politician rather than a doctor in this instance. The Minister should bear in mind that the consultants' representative organisations are comprised of over 70% of consultants who work in Cork, Dublin and Galway and have little interest in altering their contracts to suit the Minister's implementation of the Hanly report. That will be one of the major IR issues the Minister will have to face and he should give some consideration to how he will carry it out.</p>
          <p eId="para_908">Health boards in some areas are already implementing their own version of the Hanly report – I regret that time does not allow me to expand further on this. The Department of Health and Children is digging itself a hole which is simply filled with patient expectations. There is more spin coming out than an industrial washing machine would generate. We need much greater clarity as to what is happening.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnGormley" eId="spk_546">
          <from>Mr. Gormley:</from>
          <p eId="para_909">Faced with the ongoing accident and emergency crisis, it is appropriate to debate the Hanly report, although it has been covered extensively in discussion at the Joint Committee on Health and Children. On that occasion, Mr. Hanly was at pains to point out that the smaller hospitals were not being downgraded, a point which the Minister again stressed this evening. As I stated in the committee debate, this claim has  been repeated so many times that it reminds one of the phrase "He doth protest too much."  The claim is simply not credible. Withdrawing proper accident and emergency services from hospitals such as Ennis – I acknowledge Deputy Killeen's presence on the opposite benches – represents a downgrading – that is beyond question.</p>
          <p eId="para_910">Hanly simply continues a trend established many years ago towards greater centralisation and more technology, which involved the amalgamation of the Adelaide and Meath hospitals in my constituency and their move to Tallaght. What has been the result? One has only to look at the situation in Tallaght, with up to 40 people on trolleys in the most degrading and humiliating circumstances. Overworked doctors and nurses are not to blame, as so many people have said, rightly pointing the finger at the Government. The ongoing accident and emergency crisis is indicative of a deep-seated crisis in our health service, caused by the incompetence and right wing ideology of the Government. The Green Party has argued that there should be a single waiting list, whether one is a public or private patient.</p>
          <p eId="para_911">One may find oneself on a trolley, eating meals out of one's lap and using filthy toilets. One may be under harsh lighting all the time, with only occasional access to showers. This is the reality we have heard. The Minister speaks about the reality but this is the reality for patients in our accident and emergency units now. I am afraid the Hanly report is not going to make a blind bit of difference. One can carry out restructuring with the Brennan, Prospectus and Hanly reports, but none of them will deal with the central problem of capacity and years of underinvestment. The Minister and the Government may claim we have reached the Eurpean average in health spending but it is also true to say there is much ground to be made up.</p>
          <p eId="para_912">There is a serious shortage of bed capacity in our major hospitals, particularly in the eastern region. In Ireland in 2001 we had three acute hospital beds for every 1,000 people. This contrasts with France, where there are four beds per 1,000, or Germany, where there are six beds. France has overcapacity built into the system; bed occupancy runs at approximately 75% there, compared to 95% in Dublin's acute hospitals. The Hanly report does not deal with this fundamental problem. There is also the failure to provide suitable step-down facilities, which means too many people spend too long in hospitals and not enough time in the community, where they ought to be.</p>
          <p eId="para_913">One of the first things the Minister said was that we should deal with the reality of the Hanly report. The reality is that the Minister for Finance is not willing to invest further in the health service. Mr. Hanly told us at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Health and Children that the new contract for consultants and the greater need for consultants would not necessarily result in significant extra expenditure. That is extremely difficult to believe. The working time directive must be  complied with, though we will not comply with it in time. We need more consultants, a finding in the report I welcome, but we probably need more than Hanly recommends and that will cost quite a bit of money. I recently saw the German figures for compliance with the working time directive and we have underestimated the costs involved by a great deal. Hanly continues a trend; look at what is happening in Peamount, where Dr. Luke Clancy has said the chest hospital option should continue. Look at the trend towards greater centralisation and the fact that in 1973 we had 108 maternity hospitals. Now we have 22, with a recommendation to close a further ten. This centralisation does not make sense. The Minister will have to listen to people. He will have to listen to the consumer.</p>

        <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_547">
          <from>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin:</from>
          <p eId="para_914">Despite a series of detailed reports analysing the state of the health service and an increased level of current spending above the EU average, our health services still suffer from the legacy of decades of underfunding and from the present day reality of gross inequality. The twin failures of successive Governments – the failure to reform and the failure to resource – continue in 2003 only in different guises.</p>
          <p eId="para_915">The Brennan report exposed many of the economic inefficiencies in the system. The Prospectus report exposed the shortcomings of its organisation and management. The Hanly report has analysed some of the many complex problems of medical staffing. Each report proposed varying and sometimes conflicting solutions, some of which are positive and others negative. All the reports came in the wake of the Government's health strategy, most of which remains unimplemented, and now we have the anomaly raised in the Hanly report. Action to reduce the working hours of junior hospital doctors is welcome and essential, but the associated proposals to downgrade and slash services in hospitals throughout the State are wrong and should be resisted. Must we now depend on the Minister for Defence to defend in Cabinet the rights of communities to basic and essential services such as maternity and accident and emergency facilites?</p>
          <p eId="para_916">We are repeatedly told that accident and emergency and maternity services should be centralised in regional and so-called national centres of excellence. However, the communities which are expected to bear the brunt of loss of services from their hospitals are witnessing crisis situations unfolding in existing centres of excellence such as the main Dublin hospitals. We learned this morning that there were over 100 patients on trolleys in accident and emergency units in the greater Dublin area yesterday. In Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, there are now fewer beds than when it was opened 50 years ago, despite a tenfold increase in patient numbers.</p>
          <p eId="para_917">The Government's handling of the smoking ban has demonstrated an appalling lack of cohesion and political leadership. What hope,  then, that it will deliver even on its own flawed health strategy? There is no evidence of that. The downgrading of hospitals under Hanly is being proposed while the initial 40 to 60 primary care teams and networks promised in the health strategy are not targeted to come on stream until the end of 2006.</p>
          <p eId="para_918">The downgrading of hospitals under Hanly has long been signalled. The cause of the ongoing anguish visited on my home community of Monaghan is now set to visit a hospital near you, dear citizen. The Hanly report did not propose that all new consultant appointments be in the public system only, something it should have done, but the renegotiation of the consultants' contracts in the interest of public patients is essential. The weakness of the Government's position on this, even before negotiations begin in earnest, does not augur well.</p>
          <p eId="para_919">Underlying all of this is the point blank refusal of the Government to confront the fundamental inequality of the two-tier public-private system. That system rumbles on in a week which sees the publication of figures for the various health boards and how they spent beyond their inadequate budgets for the first nine months of the year. The shortfall means real hardship for real people, including bed shortages in acute hospitals, patients on trolleys in accident and emergency, and cuts in home help and other services for the elderly. Funding to deal with the devastating health consequences of drug addiction and many other areas I mentioned today is also totally inadequate.</p>
          <p eId="para_920">Hanly, Prospectus, Brennan and the Government's health strategy are all paper and ink in the final analysis. Without the political will to take action that makes a real difference to patients, without the political commitment to deliver and to mobilise public support and the support of those in the health service, any strategy will remain words and words alone. The Government has demonstrated its dismal failure on health again and again. I appeal to it not to compound those failures in the forthcoming budget and to free up the resources that are so desperately needed in order to have a comprehensive health service available to all our citizens, with equal access to care for all when they need it.</p>

          <p title="motionProposal" eId="para_922">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_923">I wish to share my time with Deputies Ferris and Crowe.</p>
          <p eId="para_924">This Bill seeks to enshrine the right to adequate and appropriate housing in the 1937 Constitution. The right to housing is central to Sinn Féin's commitment to building an Ireland of equals and has long been central to our housing policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_925">The context of the introduction of this legislation, the Twenty-seventh Amendment of the Constitution (No. 2) Bill, is an unprecedented housing crisis, affecting virtually every family, as well as the failure of successive Governments and especially the current one to address that crisis. After six years of unbroken reign which came during the biggest economic boom this State has ever known, this Administration managed to increase the number of homeless and the social housing list to more than 48,000 applicants, representing in excess of 100,000 people.</p>
          <p eId="para_926">The average price of a new house across the State increased from €125,000 in 1998 to more than €222,000, or by 177%, by the end of June last. The average price of a second-hand house across the State in the same period increased from €134,000 to more than €267,000, or by 199%. Official figures for 2002 showed 5,581 homeless in the Twenty-six Counties. Tenants' rights are unprotected, housing for the disabled is underfunded and those people are badly catered for, and Traveller accommodation programmes have not been implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_927">Sinn Féin believes that the absence of a constitutional right to housing has contributed to the severe housing crisis and resulted in a poor commitment from Government and officials to address the housing issue. A lack of adequate housing and homelessness are inextricably connected to increased levels of mental illness, marginalisation and disenfranchisement. Our amending Bill would force social policy to be centred on delivering this basic right as opposed to the current situation where the delivery of adequate housing is left to the whim of politicians and dependent on the economic climate and political priorities. A constitutional right to housing would oblige statutory bodies to provide adequate and appropriate housing for all the people of this State and would ensure that a basic standard of housing provision would be upheld. It would also ensure that the voiceless and most marginalised in society would not be penalised by their lack of political strength or representation.</p>
          <p eId="para_928">The wording of the Sinn Féin amendment is in line with the language of other fundamental rights measures contained in the Constitution. The Bill states: "The State recognises the right of all persons to adequate and appropriate housing." We believe that adequate and appropriate housing, in accordance with various United Nations instruments, refers to accommodation and housing which is secure, affordable, access ible and culturally adequate. It also involves adequate privacy, space, security, lighting and ventilation, basic infrastructure and adequate facilities and services. The word "appropriate" takes account of the cultural requirements of differing sections of Irish society such as the right of Travellers to accommodation which is appropriate to their culture and tradition.</p>
          <p eId="para_929">The State would be obliged to recognise the right to adequate and appropriate housing and respect this right. The Bill also states: "Where practicable, the enjoyment of this right should in the first place be ensured by the initiative and effort of each person." This qualification ensures that priority will be given to those social groups living in unfavourable conditions and ensures that legislation will not be designed to benefit already advantaged social groups at the expense of others. The needs of the most disadvantaged must come first.</p>
          <p eId="para_930">The Bill further states: "Where persons or their dependants are unable sufficiently to exercise or enjoy the right to adequate and appropriate housing, the State, as guardian of the common good, guarantees, as far as possible, by its laws to defend and vindicate this right, in accordance with the principles of social justice." This ensures State intervention where a person, for whatever reason, is unable to access adequate and appropriate housing. The inclusion of the words "as far as possible" qualifies the obligations on the State in similar terms to the qualification in Article 40.3.1º and, therefore, does not, as may be suggested by the Government parties, leave the Oireachtas with no option but to discharge the cost, whatever it might be, as determined by the Judiciary.</p>
          <p eId="para_931">It is important to emphasise that Sinn Féin has not asserted, and does not assert, as the Government will no doubt infer, that the insertion of a constitutional right to housing will on its own magically resolve the complex housing and homeless crisis. It represents a first step, which must be followed by legislation which will bring about the progressive realisation of this right. We foresee that a constitutional right to housing will bring about a fundamental change in how we as legislators address the housing crisis and the housing needs of the people of this State.</p>
          <p eId="para_932">Following the enshrining in the Constitution of the right to housing, Sinn Féin envisages a review of all relevant legislation with a view to making the housing Acts compatible with the constitutional right to housing. A review of existing housing policy would also be required. Sinn Féin also envisages that a national housing strategy, with targets and priorities for the progressive realisation of this new right, would be developed at an early stage. Legislation would have to be brought forward to support the right to housing and to ensure access to adequate and appropriate housing. In the words of the Simon Community: "Legislation would have the dual effect of making the right to housing meaningful in the short-term, and overcoming the difficulties of the  judiciary guiding the legislature on the protection of rights in the absence of clear policy." The realisation of the right to housing will be brought about through public investment, Government regulation of the economy and the land market and incorporation of the right to housing in the overall development objectives of the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_933">The Minister of State with responsibility for housing, Deputy Noel Ahern, recently stated, "the Government's view is that it would be inappropriate to include a legal right to housing in the Constitution", yet he does not think it is inappropriate to ignore the housing crisis.</p>

          <p eId="para_935">A survey carried out on behalf of the Simon Community found that 71% of those surveyed support the inclusion of a right to housing in the Constitution – that survey was carried out last year immediately prior to the general election. The majority of people in this State reject the Government's position. Focus Ireland, the Simon Communities of Ireland, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties and numerous other organisations have made the case for the inclusion of a right to housing in the Constitution.</p>
          <p eId="para_936">As will be outlined by my party colleague, Deputy Ó Snodaigh, when he addresses the State's obligations on the right to housing, as contained in international instruments, the United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights recommended that Ireland "incorporates justiciable economic, social and cultural rights into domestic law", but that has not happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_937">Sinn Féin is confident that an overwhelming majority of the people of this State support the enshrinement of the right to housing in the 1937 Constitution.

          <from>Mr. Crowe:</from>
          <p eId="para_938">Homelessness has almost trebled since the introduction of the Housing Act 1988. Across the State 48,000 applicants are on the housing waiting list, which translates into more than 100,000 people waiting for housing. The average cost of a house in Dublin is now more than €300,000. Across the State as a whole the price of a new house is almost €250,000. Homelessness has increased in our cities while rents and evictions in the private sector have quadrupled. The last decade has seen a crisis across all parts of the housing sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_939">Numbers, statistics and figures give us an overview of the housing problem but they cannot give us the full picture. Numbers do not tell us what it is like to sleep in a doorway in the middle of winter. Statistics cannot explain the stress a mother feels trying to raise her children in bed and breakfast accommodation. They do not tell us how she is supposed to boil a hot bottle for an infant or  what she does during the day when she is forced to leave such accommodation.</p>
          <p eId="para_940">Figures cannot tell us the frustration a young couple feel when starting out in life with a mountain to climb, if they are ever to own their own home. For tens of thousands of young people the prospect of owning their own home is now but a pipe-dream. The pursuit of an affordable house and a better quality of life has forced many to travel great distances to and from work every day leaving them with less and less time to be with their families. For others, the option of having a child has had to be put on hold as the need to repay exorbitant mortgages puts a terrible financial burden on an increasing number of couples.</p>
          <p eId="para_941">The Government believes that there are 4,060 people homeless in the Dublin area. Homeless groups such as Simon believe that this number is a significant underestimate of the real homeless problem in the city. The Minister, Deputy Cullen, and the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, are so out of touch that they are reacting to a crisis while in denial of the full extent of the problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_942">The housing crisis is caused in the main by uncontrolled vested interests in the private house building sector; underfunding of local authority house building programmes by central Government; and the failure to plan for the long-term housing needs of a growing population.  Until these elements are tackled we will slide from crisis to crisis but, instead of tackling them, the Government has made the situation worse since coming to power. Despite three expert consultants' reports and a commission on the private rented sector, there is still a housing crisis. This Government has presided over an economy that brought huge wealth into the coffers of the State but failed miserably to provide housing for its citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_943">One of the first decisions of the Minister for Finance was to eliminate the first-time buyer's grant. He saved an estimated €40 million and, in the process, extinguished the hopes of thousands of young couples. Rising house prices have made the option of owning a home unaffordable for most couples on the average income. To buy a house in the Dublin area, two incomes and, increasingly, generous parents are needed. Dublin house prices have increased by 15% in the last year alone, an extra €35,000 on the price of an average house.</p>
          <p eId="para_944">The Minister could have saved €60 million by removing mortgage tax relief for investors in second properties but that would have meant tackling the investment lobby. He could have saved millions by removing the seaside resort scheme which has added to house price inflation in rural areas. As a result of this scheme, the price of housing has shot up and more and more people are denied the opportunity to own a house in the area in which they were born, but its abolition would have meant tackling the investment and speculator lobbies.</p>
          <p eId="para_945">We were told by the Progressive Democrats that the free market would solve all our problems, even those in housing. It has not and it will not. The market serves only the interests of the developers and their friends in the construction industry, the land grabbers and the housing speculators, the people appearing at the tribunals, the same people who bankrolled the establishment parties. Many would say it is money well spent judging by the substantial returns on their investments. In every decade of the last century there was a housing shortage which successive Administrations failed to resolve. A basic requirement of any civilised, developed society – a roof over the heads of its citizens – has not been provided. Is this not another example of the failure of market-led politics in this State?</p>
          <p eId="para_946">I support the legislation brought before the House tonight by Sinn Féin. It is a reaffirmation of our belief that social and economic rights are every bit as important as civil rights. I urge other parties and representatives in this House to support this proposal and show their support for a rights-based approach to resolving the ongoing housing crisis.</p>

          <p eId="para_947">Following the contributions of Deputies Morgan and Crowe in support of this Bill, I would like to make a number of points on why Sinn Féin believes that social and economic rights and, in particular, the right to housing must be enshrined in the Constitution.</p>
          <p eId="para_948">Sinn Féin believes that in an equal society, social and economic rights are as important as political and civil rights. One cannot advocate civil and political rights and oppose social and economic because of the interdependence of both these sets of rights. As stated by the United Nations, "The indivisibility and interdependence of all human rights find clear expression through the right to housing." An absence of a right to housing can and does curtail the ability of many of our citizens to enjoy the civil and political rights which are already contained in the Constitution. An example of this is the inability of homeless people to vote. It is also worth noting that the World Health Organisation has asserted that housing is the single most important environmental factor associated with disease conditions and higher mortality rates.</p>
          <p eId="para_949">The exclusion of socio-economic rights leads to increased inequality, marginalisation and poverty. This exclusion is in contradiction to Article 40.3.1º of the Constitution, which states, "The State guarantees in its laws to respect, and as far as practical, by its laws to defend and vindicate the personal rights of every citizen."</p>
          <p eId="para_950">The need to guarantee the right to housing is obvious to anyone who looks at the current situation in this State. There are 48,000 people in need of homes. The homeless we meet in the doorways and at ATM machines are only the most stark examples of the failure to provide people with accommodation. There are thousands more living in sub-standard, over-priced accommodation to  which they have no real right beyond the fact that they continue to pay out a disproportionate amount of their income in rent. Of course there are people who will argue this is something that is the responsibility of individuals themselves. This Bill recognises that as far as practicable, this ought to be the case, but we also realise that this is not always possible. It does not always have to do with whether someone lacks initiative, is too lazy or otherwise incapable of doing so. We all know many people who work long hours, scrimp and save but who simply find it impossible to secure adequate accommodation. This Bill would require the State to take proactive measures to ensure that everyone has a place to live.</p>
          <p eId="para_951">What would this mean in practice? Some, no doubt, will try to argue that it is a recipe for the abolition of all private property in housing. It is not. It is a means to place the onus on the State to ensure there are enough housing units at affordable prices to cater for all those who require accommodation. That does not mean there will be no private housing but it would entail the State intervening to control rents and the price of building land and houses.</p>
          <p eId="para_952">We all know the enormous increase in the cost of land, housing and rent in recent years, particularly since 1998. Again, people will argue that these prices are set by market demand. This is not borne out by any analysis of the way in which rents and house prices have risen well beyond the level of increase for other commodities. People are mostly aware of how this has affected Dublin and surrounding counties but even in my own county of Kerry, house prices have increased dramatically over the past decade. New house prices doubled between 1997 and 2002, while second-hand homes increased by even more.</p>
          <p eId="para_953">The curious thing is that while over 1,400 households in Kerry were in need of housing at the end of the third quarter last year according to the local authority housing lists, only 1,261 houses were built in the same period. Supply is not keeping pace with demand even though there are currently 1,000 acres of zoned, serviced land available that would be sufficient to build almost 11,000 houses. If the market was genuinely responding to demand, and certainly the incentives exist to sell the land and build the houses, would this demand not have been met? Or is it the case that there are people who are content to sit on the land and deliberately control its supply to the housing market to ensure that prices continue to rise?</p>
          <p eId="para_954">Kerry is not the only county where this is the case. In Dublin city, where demand is massive and where mortgages and rents have reached ridiculous levels, there were over 3,000 acres of zoned residential land in June 2002 which, by my calculations, would be enough to build over 60,000 houses. There is obviously something amiss.</p>
          <p eId="para_955">The other interesting statistic from County Kerry is that of the 1,261 completions, only 104 were built by the local authorities. More than  1,200 remain on the local authority housing lists as a result. If the local authorities were to play a more active role in house building, by intervening in the land market and purchasing the zoned land at a reasonable rate, then they would be more than capable of meeting the demand from their own housing lists. It would also stimulate private developers to build more as they would have to compete with the local authorities. The importance of young people in our developing society cannot be understated. However, in many rural areas when they buy a site they pay more than the actual cost of a house. Young couples starting off on their lives together expect to spend the next 20 years paying off a mortgage for a site and a house.</p>
          <p eId="para_956">I ask Members to support this Bill to enshrine in the Constitution the rights of our people to the housing programme they deserve and to which they are entitled.</p>

          <from>Dr. Cowley:</from>
          <p eId="para_959">I support this Bill. However, I note it is a little on the simple side. All Members support the right to housing, but that right must be backed up with adequate resources to allow it to happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_960">It is an understatement to say that housing is more than just bricks and mortar to vulnerable people. There has been a discussion in the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution on the right to shelter. However, that is not enough. In Africa, there is a right to shelter, but Ireland as a modern society needs the right to housing. This proposed amendment to the Constitution will provide a focus and a framework on which to build.</p>
          <p eId="para_961">There is no point in amending the Constitution unless it is acted upon. The Government has signed up to a number of international conventions and covenants on housing. These, in turn, should be adopted in our Constitution, just as the right to housing assistance is incorporated in the draft EU Constitution.</p>
          <p eId="para_962">We are good at signing up to international conventions. We have signed up to 20 conventions and agreements on this matter, from the EU to the UN. It is one thing to sign up, but charity begins at home. The Government must be consistent in this regard. If it signs up to international agreements, it should act on them at home and practise what it preaches. Let us incorporate in our Constitution the good things we wish for others. Many European states have the right to housing incorporated in their constitutions, backed up by legislation. We have enabling legislation which allows the local authorities to assist people to become homeowners. However, we need to move away from this hypocrisy of enabling legislation to rights-based legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_963">There is a human need for proper housing. By ensuring proper legislation and resources to implement it, we will make some progress. I welcome the fact that contrary to rumour the ESRI report does not recommend cuts in the social housing budget. I do not know where the rumour emerged, but it may be a leaked report by Government. The ESRI report called for the social housing budget to be left as it was. However, I argue that it should be increased. The waiting lists have increased by 25% in the last four years. Leaving things as they are will certainly not do the business. How can we make progress if we leave things as they are? If we provide the same amount of money as four years ago, we will not meet the current housing needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_964">We have the smallest social housing stock in Europe and we need 150,000 more social housing units. Up to 80% of people on housing lists have an income of less than €15,000. With €225,000 now the average price of a house, this means the cost is 15 times the size of most low incomes. How can they afford houses on their own?</p>
          <p eId="para_965">We need a defined revenue funding scheme to ensure that people, the elderly in particular, on social housing can stay living locally. This will give housing associations the courage to proceed and build housing units. Otherwise, we will never realise the full potential of supported housing. We need more co-ordination between social housing and health policies.</p>
          <p eId="para_966">We will soon be holding the EU Presidency. The right to housing is incorporated in the constitutions of many EU member states such as France and Finland. In many of the accession states, the housing conditions are atrocious. Ireland, with a modern economy due to the Celtic tiger, should set a good example to these states on this issue. We must show leadership.</p>
          <p eId="para_967">There is an unbalanced housing sector where many houses are built, but not for the people who need them most. If one considers that one third of all houses built are bought by investors, are we doing the right job? The balance must be reset in favour of those who need housing. If we incorporate the right to housing in the Constitution, this will make a difference.</p>
          <p eId="para_968">Housing is a fundamental and important issue to the infrastructure of local areas. It is more than bricks and mortar. It is about people, giving them a place to stay in their communities and enabling further services to be provided. I support this Bill.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FinianMcGrath" eId="spk_556">
          <from>Mr. F. McGrath:</from>
          <p eId="para_969">I commend Deputy Morgan and Sinn Féin for introducing this Bill to the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_970">I welcome this progressive legislation to amend Article 40 of the Constitution to provide for the recognition, defence and vindication of the right to housing. We must face the reality that we are now in the middle of a housing crisis. It is not good enough to say we cannot do anything. That is the Progressive Democrats, free market, "our-hands-are-tied" syndrome. It is not good enough.  The people are crying out for houses and are sick to the teeth of being ripped off. This debate is about doing something practical for working people.</p>
          <p eId="para_971">We now have some 50,000 households on social housing waiting lists, which translates into some 130,000 people. These people can never afford to buy a home of their own. There are homes where 300,000 children are living in poverty, with 70,000 classed as living in extreme poverty. After nine years of economic boom, this is unacceptable. It clearly shows where the Government's priorities lie. We must remind those with a decent job and a nice home that 85% of those on housing lists have incomes of less than €15,000 a year. Imagine in 2003 asking a person to survive on less than €15,000 a year. Not only is this scandalous, it is criminal and a shame on those responsible.</p>
          <p eId="para_972">This is the real world for sections of society. Of the 70,000 children in extreme poverty, there are between 1,800 and 3,000 who are severely at risk, living in violent and dysfunctional families. This is relevant to the current crime debate and gangland killings as these are the violent gang members of the future. When will the Cabinet, particularly the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, wake up to this nightmare for many children and families? If one does not have a home that is warm and safe, one will not have a happy child. An unhappy child suffering inequality and violence in turn becomes violent and this leads to crime and imprisonment. The housing crisis is linked to the crime debate. A Government that ignores this is not dealing with crime. Good housing equals happy families equals less crime. Among those families living in extreme poverty, some 42% of women experience serious sexual and physical abuse.</p>
          <p eId="para_973">I strongly support Sinn Féin's 27th Amendment to the Constitution Bill, granting the right to housing. Section 1 of the Bill proposes to amend Article 40 of the Constitution by inserting a new section 7. This State, in the past, during poorer times, built more homes with an opportunity for those who wanted them. Now most young couples are not even at the races when it comes to buying a home of their own, while other sections of society can own two or three houses. This is where we must stand up against the speculators and landbank owners who are playing a dangerous game with people's lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_974">We also must not forget elderly people. It is the desire and right of older persons to continue to live in their own homes, maintaining an independent lifestyle for as long as possible. To this end proper provision must be made for a comprehensive home care package including: special care allowances; extended home help cover, especially twilight cover; and the allocation of adequate resources to cover home adaptation and repairs for older people's houses.</p>
          <p eId="para_975">I also have a number of proposals on housing. The cutback in capital spending on the provision of local authority housing should be reversed. Budget 2004 should include an announcement for  an inclusive structural review to determine targets for reductions in local authority waiting lists and waiting times. There needs to be funding to ensure the effective implementation upon enactment of the Residential Tenancies Bill and budget 2004 should contain an allocation of €3 million for this. We should also fund a pilot scheme for single homeless access to housing in the private rented sector. In budget 2004, the Minister of State should fund an investigation into the establishment of a housing authority that includes representatives of the community and voluntary sector on its steering committee. Budget 2004 should provide an additional €500,000 earmarked to facilitate access to private rented accommodation in Dublin for eligible single homeless persons.</p>
          <p eId="para_976">I urge all Deputies to support this amendment, which sets out do something radical, creative and practical for people on housing lists. Now is the time for the Minister of State to put his money where his mouth is and support the Twentyseventh Amendment of the Constitution (No. 2) Bill 2003.</p>

          <p eId="para_979">The Green Party supports the amendment to the Constitution before the House today. It is high time that recognition was given to a right to housing within the Constitution. While much can be done without having this article in the Constitution, it is worth inserting it to enshrine the right to housing so there can be no excuses the next time the Government is asked why it is not providing proper housing or dealing with the issue of waiting lists.</p>
          <p eId="para_980">Since the Government was formed 18 months ago, we have received a series of excuses for not reaching our targets and achieving the kind of success that was boldly advertised in the Government parties' manifestos. We were promised various initiatives to provide vast amounts of new housing. These promises have proved long on rhetoric but short on substance.</p>
          <p eId="para_981">We should look at underused State-owned land, such as Army barracks and land owned by other State institutions to ensure it is turned around and made available to housing in the short-term rather than being put on the long finger. Why are vast tracts of land still lying idle in Dublin's docklands? Why is Clancy Barracks, along with many other Army barracks, still lying completely unoccupied? Cathal Brugha Barracks in Rathmines is on 70 acres of prime land and is significantly underused. Clancy Barracks is on another 20 or 30 acres of land. We should use this land to provide decent housing. It can be a mixture of public and private initiatives. We do not believe that either the private sector or local authorities have everything to give in this regard. We want to see a mixture of housing provided  and we feel the entire spectrum of housing agencies can help in doing that.</p>
          <p eId="para_982">We want to give greater attention to the voluntary and the co-operative sectors, which are much talked about but have not in practice received the kind of support they deserve from central government. We are witnessing a continual sell-off of land by local authorities. In my county of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, a huge site in the heart of Stillorgan is being sold off because the Government is not allocating funding to local authorities to provide the housing they should provide in order to reduce housing waiting lists. Local authorities are strapped for cash and central government sits there with its arms folded saying: "Go out there and build houses." It is not good enough to say this and claim local authorities have the resources to do it, when they find their services are being cut back and they find it difficult to provide capital funding for housing.</p>

Rather than dwelling on specific sites that should be developed in the short-term, I want to stress that the Green Party supports the proposal to change the Constitution. This will help to ensure the Government is not let off the hook as it has been in the past when the Taoiseach pleaded problems with the Constitution in providing a right to housing. We look forward to this article taking its true place in the Constitution.</p>

        <speech by="#DanBoyle" eId="spk_562">
          <from>Mr. Boyle:</from>
          <p eId="para_985">Bunreacht na hÉireann has by and large served this country well. However, the sign of any healthy democracy is an ability of both its elected representatives and its citizenry to engage critically with its basic law and foundation document. While Bunreacht na hÉireann is a valuable source of all our laws, it should be open to adaptation and change.</p>
          <p eId="para_986">Unlike other constitutions in other democracies, it has very few stated rights for individuals. Many of the rights that come from the Constitution are implied rights. The right to bodily integrity came out of the Ryan case in the 1960s. The Green Party strongly believes the Constitution should include a series of listed rights, including the right of the citizen to be more informed and to be of a higher status in his or her own country. The right to housing is such a right. The right of shelter is basic in any decent society. I use that term because it is used regularly in our political debate. Any decent society should have this as a basic tenet of its political life.</p>
          <p eId="para_987">This change is worthy of debate on Second Stage. Whether the wording is sufficiently precise is a matter for further debate and consideration on Committee Stage. The Green Party strongly supports the principle of having a listed right in Bunreacht na hÉireann that would afford to Irish people the right to housing and it has promoted  such a principle in the past. Any constitutional right must be strong and provable. We must avoid having rights for the sake of aspiration. In the past we have had difficulties with aspirational provisions in the Constitution that had to be changed. A right to housing and shelter should be backed up with the appropriate resources and legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_988">We have Housing Acts that oblige local authorities to provide housing for people who are unable to house themselves. This is already a legislative basis for many people to gain housing. However, it is not an absolute right. People find themselves on a housing list for up to ten years depending on the category to which they belong. It is nearly impossible for a single man to receive any type of accommodation from local authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_989">The difficulty in framing proper legislation on housing is that we are caught up in a developer-led housing policy, in which the house is a three or four-bedroom semi-detached unit. We need to aim to having a housing policy based on housing systems rather than the conventional house. People looking for a first house do not need three bedrooms. Single persons and young couples need the bare minimum, they move to bigger housing as they progress through life and to smaller housing in later life. We do not adopt a housing systems approach to our housing policy and any constitutional reference must take into account the right to accommodation appropriate not only to needs but—</p>

          <p eId="para_992">Housing is one of the most basic social needs. It is central to establishing a sense of personal identity and security. Without good housing arrangements, the stability and viability of society itself are threatened. Housing is not something abstract. It is about matching good quality and suitable accommodation to where people have to work and raise their families and interact with their friends and relations. It is about looking after the special shelter needs of the old, the disabled and socially disadvantaged groups such as Travellers and homeless persons. It is about providing new building land so that an expanding Irish population can supply itself with more houses; and about public and private sector organisations combining so this can be arranged with speed and efficiency.</p>
          <p eId="para_993">Ireland's housing performance is responding well to many of these requirements. We are now building some 15 houses per 1,000 people annually, by far the highest rate of output in the European Union, and over four times that of the UK.</p>

          <from>Mr. N. Ahern:</from>
          <p eId="para_1009">The Government believes that conferring a right to housing on citizens would not of itself afford any greater access for them to the housing services necessary to meet their needs. I believe what Sinn Féin is doing is theoretical and is just academic play acting. The legislation governing social housing in Ireland comprises the Housing Acts, 1996 to 2002. While the legislation does not confer any statutory right to housing, the range and extent of measures implemented under these Acts demonstrate the State's long-standing commitment to ensuring that housing needs, especially social housing needs, are adequately addressed. The Housing Acts provide a statutory framework for measures relating to assessing overall housing requirements and social housing needs, including the needs of homeless persons and Travellers; the provision of social housing for letting, including both local authority and voluntary housing; and assisting people to gain access to owner-occupied housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1010">The Government's view is that it would be inappropriate to include a legal right to housing in the Constitution on the basis that the funding commitment to the various housing programmes is leading to increased outputs and that decisions regarding the allocation of financial resources are a matter for the democratically accountable Government and not the courts.</p>
          <p eId="para_1011">This is in line with the 1996 report of the constitutional review group which concluded that the Constitution should not confer personal rights to freedom from poverty or to other economic or  social entitlements. The group regarded these as being essentially political matters which should be the responsibility of the elected members to address and determine in a democracy. The review group pointed out that solving economic and social problems is an integral part of any political system, and that the degree to which a solution can be found must depend on the resources which the community is in a position to make available at any given time. The final responsibility on the overall redistribution of the State's resources for the common good rests with the Executive as it works through the political system.</p>
          <p eId="para_1012">The review group considered that it would be a distortion of democracy to transfer decisions on major issues of policy and practicality from the Government and the Oireachtas to an unelected Judiciary. It would not accord with democratic principles to confer absolute personal rights in the Constitution regarding economic and social objectives and to leave the Legislature with no option but to discharge the cost, whatever it might be, as determined by the Judiciary. The concept of the separation of powers is at the centre of the Irish constitutional order. Under our Constitution all political power derives from the people of Ireland with this general power divided into the three major arms of government – the Legislature, the Executive and the Judiciary. These powers are separate and distinct. We, the elected Legislature, along with the Executive, are jointly responsible for the formulation and implementation of policy and for the expenditure of public moneys.</p>

          <p eId="para_1015">We are accountable for our actions. Does Sinn Féin in bringing forward this Bill want to remove the decision-making process from the Members of this House and the Government and give it to a non-elected Judiciary that has no mandate, democratic, constitutional or otherwise, to legislate? That is our job. That is what we are doing and we should all be supportive of that and not try to give it away. The Judiciary is not, and in a democracy should not be, politically responsible for its decisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1016">The National Economic and Social Council examined the broad issue of social and economic rights in its November 2002 report. It emphasised the complex philosophical, political, legal and practical issues involved in the identification, creation, legislation and vindication of rights, especially social and economic rights. These included, among others, the basis on which socio-economic rights are defended; the task of identifying what duties arise from the existence of socio-economic rights; the need to distinguish between moral rights and legal rights; and the fact  that the assertion of rights cannot provide an escape from scarcity, trade-offs, balances and compromises, including conflicts between rights themselves. The council saw the challenge of social and economic rights as involving the task of creating effective institutions and policies for social and economic services, implying that we focus on the connection between rights and standards. Accordingly, in the new national agreement, Sustaining Progress, particular emphasis is placed on ensuring that standards of public services are identified, monitored and achieved. This requires further substantive improvements in the delivery of quality public services, including housing, and also requires a renewed focus on setting and achieving standards for the delivery of such services and monitoring progress.</p>

          <p eId="para_1039">This demand has remained strong, notwithstanding the recent slowing of economic growth and it seems likely that the demographic changes underpinning this demand are set to continue. Recently published CSO data on the 2002 census of population points to a decline in the size of families. Coupled with population growth and inward migration we now have the highest population since the census of 1871. This decline in household size is increasing the demand for housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1040">The national development plan estimated the total demand for housing required an additional 500,000 houses to be built in the ten years to 2010. We are well on target to achieve that. Population forecasts underpinning the national spatial strategy generally confirm this position. The Government is firmly committed to the continuation of the measures which we initiated in our previous term to increase the supply of housing. These measures have included increasing investment in the provision of serviced land for housing and more effective use of that land through improved planning guidelines on residential densities. We  are also examining issues around the cost of land required for development and affordable housing in particular. The Taoiseach has asked the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution to assess the possibility of placing a cap on the value of development land, having regard to the constitutional and practical issues involved.</p>

The affordability of the housing we provide must improve in line with increasing supply and our policy is focused on this objective. I am acutely aware of the need to get as many people as possible onto the first rung of the housing ladder which is why I placed great emphasis on the delivery of affordable housing. Activity under the affordable and shared ownership schemes has played an increasing role in assisting low income households to purchase their own homes. The affordable housing scheme, launched in 1999, accounted for the needs of just  under 900 households in 2002. That scheme is operated by local authorities.</p>

          <p eId="para_1072">Meeting increased housing demands in a balanced and efficient fashion requires not only an increased private housing supply but providing for tenure choice. For that reason, the Government is committed to developing and modernising the private rented sector so that the range of effective choices can be expanded. As such, the Residential Tenancies Bill 2003, which I anticipate will be enacted towards the end of the year, provides for the legislative reforms of the private rented sector recommended by the Commission on the Private Rented Residential Sector and accepted by the Government. It introduces a significant measure of security of tenure for tenants and specifies minimum obligations applying to landlords and tenants. It also provides for the establishment of a private residential tenancies board to resolve disputes arising in the sector, to operate a system of tenancy registration and to provide information and policy advice. Furthermore, the Bill restricts rents to market level and contains provisions relating to procedures for the termination of tenancies, including gradated notice periods linked to the duration of a tenancy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1073">The Private Residential Tenancies Board will be established when the relevant provisions of the Residential Tenancies Bill come into operation. The Government recognises that the private rented sector has an important role to play in meeting housing needs.</p>

          <p eId="para_1131">While the legislation governing social housing in Ireland does not confer a statutory right to housing, we have responded to the numerous and diverse challenges with a credible and wide-ranging set of measures to ensure that housing needs, especially social housing needs, are adequately addressed. The overall focus of the Sustaining Progress commitment to the provision of social and affordable accommodation is  on reviewing the effectiveness of programmes designed to assist low income groups, including those with social housing and special housing needs. We will work with the social partners to ensure that our housing programmes are effective in meeting these needs and that the substantial resources the Government has made available are spent in a manner which contributes effectively to breaking cycles of poverty and social exclusion. The Government considers that the most appropriate way of addressing needs in regard to housing is to continue the various programmes and fiscal incentives currently in place, to secure the necessary level of funding to support them, to review their operation on an on-going basis to ensure they are meeting their objectives and to put in place new programmes or measures as required.</p>

          <p eId="para_1145">Fine Gael believes that the principle behind this Bill is commendable. Every child of the State should be seen as equal and the right to a roof over one's head seems fundamental. However, the Bill as proposed is flawed because it is too general to warrant anything other than  a general welcome. Unfortunately, it will not go anywhere towards solving the housing crisis in which we find ourselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_1146">It is an absolute disgrace that, in its seventh year in office, having inherited the best set of economic statistics in history, the Government should have failed so dreadfully on this issue and that the only response to an escalating crisis in the housing sector has been sympathetic words and an utter lack of action.</p>
          <p eId="para_1147">We debate this Bill against the appalling background of the average house price in the country nudging €250,000, the average price of a house in Dublin standing at an incredible €300,000 and local authority waiting lists standing at 52,000 families, that is 120,000 individuals. Progress in the provision and completion of social housing units has been painfully slow and, most shockingly of all, there are almost 6,000 homeless people in one of the richest countries in the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_1148">Fine Gael holds the Government primarily responsible for the intolerable housing situation we are facing. However, my party condemns those who have speculated on the likely bursting of the property bubble. I say to property speculators and bankers that we are not playing a game. Housing is a social issue and the predictions of boom and bust do no great service to the housing sector and certainly not to those who are attempting to get on to the property ladder.</p>
          <p eId="para_1149">It gives me no pleasure to detail the litany of Government failures which have led to the housing crisis, but it must be done. One of the more high-profile casualties of the broken promises of the Government was the first-time buyer's grant. There was no mention of its demise in the Fianna Fáil manifesto, the Progressive Democrats' manifesto or An Agreed Programme for Government, and yet, with a stroke of Deputy McCreevy's pen, it was gone. The number of families on local authority waiting lists has reached at least 52,000, which is an intolerable situation in a modern economy like ours.</p>

          <p eId="para_1156">Against this awful background, the Taoiseach had the brass neck to suggest that we should wait for a report into the Constitution on housing and land issues. The Taoiseach thinks it is acceptable for the people to wait eight years for the Government to tackle a crisis which has been emerging since he took office. This is a cynical insult to those who are putting up with substandard conditions and dreaming of owning their own home but who, in reality, will never be able to afford it. The supply of land for houses and the number of houses built has not been sufficient. Proactive action is necessary to bring balance back into the market.</p>
          <p eId="para_1157">This Bill should be allowed a second reading because it offers the potential, if amended, to provide a basis upon which the solution to the housing crisis can be found. Many things can be done now without the need for a referendum or any reference to the Constitution or this debate. At an IMI conference in Killarney earlier this year, the Taoiseach spoke about housing and once again promised action to tackle the cost of building land. He said he would solve the problem, even if it meant changing the Constitution.</p>

          <from>Mr. Allen:</from>
          <p eId="para_1160">The cost of this house was just $83,990 Australian. Potential purchasers could also qualify for a federal government first-home owner's grant of $7,000 Australian, which is equivalent to about €6,000. Unfortunately, our Government abolished the first-time buyer's grant. The root cause of high house prices is not just the price of land, as suggested by the Taoiseach. In Australia, one can have a good house built for as low as $25 per square foot and an excellent top class finish for $50 per square foot. Friends of mine at home have been quoted anything up to €100 per square foot for a reasonable finish and costs in Ireland are now about five times those in Australia.</p>
          <p eId="para_1161">Property experts tell me one of the causes of such big differences between Australia and Ireland is the huge Government tax on every item of material and every transaction. The Government takes about 40% of the price of a house. In other words, for a €200,000 house, the Government takes €80,000 in tax. The Minister of State  is shaking his head but these are CIF figures. He should know them and if he does not, he is a disgrace.</p>
          <p eId="para_1162">The cost of building materials is another major problem along with the constitutional protection for land owners, which was mentioned by the Taoiseach but he did little about it. The percentage-based fees of the legal profession and other professionals and the strong links between the political system and the construction industry are all contributory factors to high house prices. I do not come to this debate without proposals and, if I had time, would outline about six or eight which Fine Gael believes would help alleviate the housing crisis.</p>

          <p eId="para_1163">The purpose of the Bill is to amend Article 40 of the Constitution, which would ensure that the State recognised the right of all persons to adequate and appropriate housing. It is indicative of the times we live in that such a motion had to be tabled. I welcome the Bill, although it will not solve the housing crisis, but it will open up a debate on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1164">The average price of a house in Ireland is now €250,000. The local authority housing waiting list now stands at over 50,000. There are 1,500 people on the waiting list in Galway city and the waiting time is now six years. The figures in County Galway are just as bad. I have sympathy for the Minister of State who had to come into the House to read that speech. It was like a leaking bucket – holes in it from beginning to end.</p>
          <p eId="para_1165">He started off proud of the number of houses built. In the past half an hour he mentioned so many houses he had built that I thought I would see the cement dust rising from his clothes. He was proud that 15 houses were being built for every 1,000 of the population. The average family size is just over 2.1 but the Minister of State's figures mean just over six people per house. He is going to house one third of the people and leave two thirds without houses and is proud of that.</p>

          <from>Mr. McCormack:</from>
          <p eId="para_1169">Most remarkable of all, the Minister of State says that housing remains at the top of the Government's agenda. He says the  Government has taken a wide range of measures over the course of two terms of office to reduce housing prices. It has taken the exact opposite course of action. In the last budget it abolished the €3,800 first-time buyer's grant and added 1% to the cost of housing materials. In a sleight of hand the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, in the Local Government Act, introduced a regulation which will oblige local authorities to impose development charges. Every local authority must decide how much it should impose to meet the Minister's request. My local authority must add €10,000 per house. I understand the Wicklow local authority will add anything from €12,500 to €25,000 per house, depending on the size of the house. Is that what the Minister of State means when he says the Government has done everything possible to reduce the price of houses? It has done the exact opposite of anything that would reduce the price of houses. My sympathy lies with the Minister of State on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1170">How the Minister of State's speech dealt with grants was a laugh. He mentioned the disabled person's grant and the essential repairs grant. Those grants enabled people to keep inadequate housing stock adequate for them. All local authorities of which I am aware have ceased processing essential repairs grants because they have no money. Disabled persons looking for a bathroom or downstairs toilet cannot get a grant because local authorities cannot sanction funding. The waiting list for funding for the disabled person's grant from our local authority is now over two years in some cases. People are kept waiting. They must wait for the health inspector's visit and report but the inspectors are not going out because of the lack of money. This is the Minister of State's responsibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_1171">I had some respect for the Minister of State when he was on the back benches but he seems to have lost the common touch since he became a Minister of State. I often met him in the bar, not that either of us are bar people, where he seemed to have the common touch. However, he seems to have lost it since others began writing his speeches for him. I am utterly disappointed. I am ashamed to think that the Minister of State would present this. I must read it more carefully in my office.</p>

People have talked about their various constituencies. Cork is a large county and Cork city is a big city. County Kildare, which is much smaller, has 5,000 families on the housing list at present. By the time the Minister of State is 104 years of age, he will have got through that list if the people of County Kildare are lucky enough that he lives that long. Otherwise they have not got a hope in hell of ever being able to do other than pay someone else's mortgage as they will never own a home of their own. Not alone that, but local authority tenants are now getting letters in the post telling them their rent has increased to €100 per week, etc. What a wonderful contribution.</p>
          <p eId="para_1180">The Minister of State mentioned the partnership agreements. Whatever agreement was entered into through partnership was flawed. It was never delivered on. The Government led the social partners to the table and shook their hands. They thought they had done a good deal but were let down.</p>

I do not want to be personal about this issue. I have a letter from my local authority which proposes to offer a shared ownership loan to a constituent where he or she buys half of the house. The maximum loan is €130,000 on a 40:60 loan-rental basis and is about half of the price of a medium range local authority house in my constituency at present.</p>

I am glad it is the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, who will respond because I am surprised that the Progressive Democrats allowed this. This was the party which told us it was going into Government to keep an eye on Fianna Fáil, but since it went into Government with Fianna Fáil it has been as polluted by that party as anybody else.</p>

          <from>Mr. Ring:</from>
          <p eId="para_1192">It is a disgrace that the media and elected representatives are now asked to pay. I saw in a recent case that a journalist from the <i>Sunday Independent</i> had to spend €2,500 to get information that belongs to the people.</p>
          <p eId="para_1193">When I contact the council its first utterance is "Will you please forward your cheque"? It draws a number out of air to decide how much to charge.</p>
          <p eId="para_1194">That is how they controlled the media and the people in Russia in the bad old days. In Russia, the state officials used to keep all the information to themselves and they would not give it to anybody. They then had total control of the people because they only gave the information to the media that they wanted to give so that they could indoctrinate the people. That is now happening in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1195">Between 1916 and 1921, the people of this country fought for the Free State. We are no longer in a free state. We are now in a state where we have dictatorship by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, where they will not give the people the information they need and request without imposing charges they cannot afford.</p>
          <p eId="para_1196">A Member of the Oireachtas or of the media should not have to pay for information which belongs to the people. I call on the Minister of State, his party and the Government, to return to the old system of FOI requests immediately.</p>
          <p eId="para_1197">I also call for more powers for the Information Commissioner. She should determine whether local authorities or the Government have the right to charge elected representatives, the media or anybody who requests information belonging to us. I am a Member of this Parliament and I should not be deprived of information.</p>
          <p eId="para_1198">What has the Government to hide? I suppose we saw this week what it has to hide. We saw the €15 million that was given to Punchestown. We saw how the media over the past number of years, through freedom of information requests, has obtained information and details of what officials were actually saying to Ministers. At least they did their job. They did their duty and they put in writing what was happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_1199">Under the FOI process, I obtained information on a school in Newport which outlined clearly that every departmental official concerned stated there was no need for this school – a third level school – seven miles from three third level schools, and that it was a waste of public money. They put that in writing. The Minister came along and was going to approve that school before the general election, but I can tell the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, that that was another broken promise.</p>

          <p eId="para_1204">I want to finish where I started. What has the Government to hide? Freedom of information was put in place on behalf of the people. The media has a job to do and to it I would say the following. Do not give up on the Freedom of Information Act. Do not allow this Government do this because you are getting briefings from friends in the Government – the spin-doctors. Do not be taken in by that. You should be out there every day writing editorials stating this is not right and you should be carpeting this Government until the decision it took on freedom of information is reversed. This does not need legislation because the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, can extend it by ministerial order. He can exempt elected representatives from these charges imposed by local authorities, health boards and Departments. Elected representatives should not have to pay for any information. We are not cranks; we are elected representatives. We are the people's messengers and we should not have to pay to get the people's messages.</p>
          <p eId="para_1205">The Government should go back to the old way and let the media and elected representatives have access to FOI. What it is doing is wrong. We are now living in a police state.</p>

Some 194 of the requests were made to a single public body.</p>

          <from>Mr. Parlon:</from>
          <p eId="para_1218">It is worth making the point that there are existing grounds in the Act that permit fees to be waived. For example, fees that apply to the search, retrieval and copying cost of records may be waived where the records concerned would be of particular assistance in terms of understanding an issue of national importance. It is also important to underline the fact that FOI requests for personal information do not attract any fee, save in very exceptional circumstances. The Department of Finance has been advising public bodies of the need to ensure that the fees regime and the exemptions are fully complied with.</p>
          <p eId="para_1219">The Deputy also asked why it was necessary to make changes to the charging system for FOI requests. He will recall that the principle of what has been termed "up-front" fees for FOI requests was fully debated during the passage of the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_1220">At that time, the Minister for Finance made clear his belief that changes to the system were long overdue in order to strike a better balance between the burden and cost of administering the Act, which is unquestionably significant, and the need to allow people to continue to have access to information. The Minister also made it clear that, apart from requests for personal information, he wanted a fee to be paid by everybody in order to encourage appropriate use of the Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_1221">Dealing with freedom of information requests has inevitably had an impact on resources and service delivery. To divert an undue proportion of resources to any particular service can adversely affect the other services being provided. An appropriate balance which results in a better appreciation of the service must therefore be struck between the application of these resources and the rights conferred by FOl. An appropriate balance has been struck by the Government. About half of all FOl requests are  from people seeking their own personal information and who are not charged either for the initial request or for appealing a decision if a public body denies the request.</p>
          <p eId="para_1222">For requests for other information, a fee of €15, or €10 if the requester is a medical card holder, is not unreasonable if the service being provided is understood and appreciated.</p>

          <p eId="para_1234">Higher fees will apply for appeals, with significant reductions for medical card holders. This principle is not new, it is a feature of FOI legislation in other jurisdictions. For example, while in Ireland the maximum fee for an appeal is €150, I understand that in Australia a fee of $574, approximately €356, can apply in respect of an appeal under the federal FOI Act to the administrative appeals tribunal. The latter could be seen as the equivalent of the Office of the Information Commissioner here.</p>
          <p eId="para_1235">In Ireland, the majority of FOI requests are granted either in full or in part and there are relatively few appeals. For example, less than 9% of FOI requests have gone to internal review, the first stage of appeal, and less than 3% of cases have gone to the Information Commissioner.</p>
          <p eId="para_1236">A modest system of charges, which strikes an appropriate balance between the public's right to obtain information and the administration of FOI and all other services provided by public bodies, is in the public interest. The system the Govern ment has put in place does this. It would not be appropriate to change this approach.</p>

          <p eId="para_1237">I am disappointed that the appropriate Minister is not present to take this matter. With respect to the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, I hope this is not evidence of a lack of interest in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_1238">The result of the first two phases of the regional autism spectrum disorder service survey, published in November 2002, confirmed that the number of children diagnosed with autism in County Kerry in the age range two years six months to 17 years 11 months was 65. Of these, 63 are receiving services in Kerry and two are receiving them in Cork. A further 32 children currently displaying autistic symptoms are waiting to be diagnosed. The survey has still to be completed in mainstream schools. Phase 5 of the survey will identify children suffering from Asperger's syndrome, which is similar to autism.</p>
          <p eId="para_1239">There are 18 children diagnosed with autism at Nano Nagle special school, Listowel. Six moderately autistic children are catered for in a special class in the school. Until recently, this class was held in a portacabin at the rear of the existing school. As a result of the overcrowded conditions in the portacabin, with six pupils, five classroom assistants, one teacher and the necessary equipment all occupying the same space, the school authorities had no option but to move the class into the school dining area, resulting in the other seven classes, comprising 66 children, ten teachers and 21 assistants, having to have lunch in their classrooms. This is totally unfair to all concerned. The children are not being exposed to the vital social skills they would learn in proper dining room facilities and it is very unfair to the staff.</p>
          <p eId="para_1240">I wish to highlight the fact that a class for severe and profound special needs is being conducted in another portacabin at the rear of the school. Three of the class have to be tube fed and two of the children suffer from severe epilepsy. One of the children suffers from seizures that can last up to 15 minutes. There is little space to control this type of seizure. Equipment was provided to deal with the problem but it is difficult to use because of the lack of space. This could have fatal consequences.</p>
          <p eId="para_1241">An extension has been approved for Nano Nagle special school which will include two classes for autistic children and two for those with severe and profound special needs, a woodwork room, in which pupils will be provided with basic woodwork training and craft skills, a multidisciplinary room and a multisensory room. A playground is also included in the plans. This was approved some years ago but was never provided. Showers and changing facilities, which are vital not only from a hygiene point of view but are also  necessary to develop the social skills of the pupils, will also be provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_1242">The architects are awaiting approval from the Department of Education and Science to apply for planning permission. Surely this project will have to be included in the list of school projects that will proceed in 2004. I invite the Minister of State's colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, to visit the school when he is Kerry in the future. A large number of Ministers have visited the constituency recently, but none visited this particular school.</p>
          <p eId="para_1243">It is totally unacceptable that the teachers, the special needs assistants and the 72 children have to endure the type of conditions that obtain at the school. The building is new but it is overcrowded and cannot cope with the numbers currently on-site. It is no longer acceptable that the conditions to which I refer should continue to obtain in what is considered to be one of the wealthiest countries <i>per capita</i> in the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_1244">I urge the Minister of State, although this is not his area of responsibility, to communicate the concerns of the teachers and parents of children at Nano Nagle special school to the Minister for Education and Science. This is a special case and priority should be given to it when the Estimates, in which funding will be provided for educational facilities in 2004, are announced next week.</p>

          <p eId="para_1245">I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to outline to the House the proposals in respect of the proposed new accommodation at Nano Nagle special school, Listowel, County Kerry.</p>
          <p eId="para_1246">The school has a staffing level of a principal and ten assistants, with an enrolment of 71 pupils at 30 September 2003. The Department of Education and Science received an application from the board of management of the school in October 1999 requesting the provision of additional accommodation. The Nano Nagle school building project is listed in section 7 of the 2003 school building programme, which is published on the Department's website at <i>www.education.ie</i>I am pleased to inform the House that a full design team has been appointed and architectural design of the project is progressing. The project is currently at stage 2/3, detailed plans-costs, of architectural planning. It has been assigned a band 1 rating by the Department of Education and Science in accordance with the published criteria for prioritising large-scale projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_1247">The architectural design of a special primary school project is based on nine stages. The design and planning of the project is covered by stages 1 to 5, during which the project is developed from the assessment of site suitability, through the detailed design, including the obtaining of planning permission, to the point where detailed bills of quantities are prepared. At stage 6, tenders are sought in line with public procurement procedures and subsequently a tender report is prepared and examined. Assuming that the outcome  of the tender process is acceptable in terms of procurement procedures, providing value for money, and that funds are available to meet construction costs, a construction contract is placed at that stage and the construction of the project begins. Stages 7 to 9 cover post contract cost control throughout the construction period, construction and practical completion of the project, including hand over of the building to the proposed occupiers and the completion of the cost analysis in the form of the final account, ensuring that cost control was maintained.</p>
          <p eId="para_1248">The publication of the Estimates later this week will clarify the amount of capital the Department of Education and Science will have available to it for 2004. Based on that amount, the 2004 school building programme will be finalised and the Department of Education and Science expects to be in a position to publish the programme on its website no later than January 2004. It is not possible, in advance of the finalisation of the 2004 school building programme, to indicate when the Nano Nagle special school project will be progressed.</p>

          <from>Mr. Boyle:</from>
          <p eId="para_1249">One of the more interesting roles I had when I was a member of Cork City Council was in helping in the preparation of the Cork area strategic plan, which was the successor to the land use and transportation study. The latter was the first regional study in the country to advocate large-scale public transport infrastructure on a regional basis. While the land use and transportation study succeeded in many of its objectives, it failed spectacularly to deliver in the greater Cork area on any major public transport initiative. The Cork area strategic plan has a better capacity to do so. In the past, there may not have been as great an impetus towards promotion on behalf of local authorities and there was no willingness to provide adequate resources at national government level.</p>
          <p eId="para_1250">The Government has as its stated policy the strategic rail review. It has recognised that Cork suburban rail is worthy of support to the extent that the feasibility of the project is grounded on the delivery of a development strategy. The Cork local authorities have gone as far as they can in delivering such a development strategy. The plan to justify the existence of an enhanced rail network in the Cork area is more advanced than ever. The plan exists on two levels to enhance the existing Cork-Mallow line by running services from Blarney with further new stations at Kilbarry and Monard where it is hoped there will be new housing developments. More importantly, the greatest demand is in east Cork and this will be addressed by reopening the Cork-Midleton line and opening new stations at Carrigtwohill and Midleton.</p>
          <p eId="para_1251">The Cork rail feasibility study that was required of the Cork local authorities under the strategic rail review, provides the economic and  logistic basis for the creation of this service and outlines the various costings involved. For instance, the Midleton component would cost approximately €35 million at 2000 prices while the upgrading of the Cork-Mallow line would cost approximately €20 million. Kent Station in Cork also needs to be upgraded but the cost of all the proposed works would still be less than the amount being spent on the upgrading of Heuston Station and that which was spent upgrading Connolly Station.</p>
          <p eId="para_1252">It is 12 months since the publication of the Cork rail feasibility study and the Government needs to send a positive signal. That would redeem and rescue it from the morass that is its public transport policy. If a positive decision was made on Cork suburban rail, I assure the Government it will not encounter the difficulties associated with Luas and the DART upgrade.</p>
          <p eId="para_1253">Cork suburban rail is needed and, if provided, it will work. It is capable of achieving operational cost effectiveness by 2020. The capital may never be recovered but the recovery of capital is never sought on road projects. The Government cannot point to a public transport initiative under which it was proposed it would pay for itself within a set period. My colleagues in the Cork area and I believe the case for improved, enhanced suburban rail is beyond question. The Government should make the necessary funding available and give the necessary signal because the basis of the Faber Mansell Cork rail feasibility study will be outdated if a signal is not given by the end of the year or the beginning of next year so that the infrastructure can be in place by 2008.</p>

          <p eId="para_1254">The Deputy will be aware that the Cork area strategic plan places great emphasis on public transport, with a target of 29% of all trips, inclusive of rail, going to or from the city centre using public transport. The CASP recommends major improvements to the Cork rail network, the introduction of ten green routes or quality bus corridors into the city centre with a number of park and ride sites. The CASP was commissioned by Cork Corporation and Cork County Council in 2000 and completed a year later. The plan provides a framework for the full integration of land use, transportation, social and environmental policies into an overall development strategy for the Cork region.</p>
          <p eId="para_1255">The main purpose in commissioning the CASP was to ensure the needs of the planning area are identified, prioritised and addressed for the period up to 2020. The CASP was developed with the close involvement of the Department of Transport. One of the key themes of the CASP is a redirection of future development in the Cork area that can be served efficiently by public transport, especially rail. To facilitate this reorientation of growth, the CASP calls for significant development of rail services in Cork on the following railway lines: reopening the line from Glountane to Midleton; provision of new stations to serve developments on the Mallow, Midleton  and Cobh corridors; and provision of more frequent services on these routes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1256">These rail proposals have been made contingent on the implementation of the CASP land use proposals along the rail corridors to support and complement the rail project. CIE was requested to arrange for a feasibility study to be carried out on the proposals to test their viability. Following an appraisal of various options for the development of rail services in Cork, the following options were recommended by consultants: reopening the Midleton line with new stations at Carrigtwohill and Midleton with a 15 minute service from Midleton to Cork using a two-car DMU set; half hourly services on the Cobh to Mallow line; new stations to be constructed at Dunkettle, which would serve both the Midleton and Cobh lines, Kilbarry and Blarney with associated park and ride facilities; implementation of these proposals from 2008 with construction work taking place in 2006 and 2007; and the introduction of improved services in line with development growth and associated demand.</p>
          <p eId="para_1257">The proposals were separately examined by Booz Allen Hamilton during the strategic rail review, SRR, and they feature as one of the recommended projects in the recommended investment strategy of the SRR. Irish Rail has stated that the positive economic return identified in the feasibility study is critically dependent on population growth taking place as predicted in the CASP along the rail corridor. The study recommended reopening the Midleton line and introducing a 15 minute service on each of the three routes. The total capital cost was estimated at €115 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_1258">The Cork local authorities have commenced the process of generating special local area plans for each of the proposed rail services. Irish Rail plans to significantly upgrade the level of service on the Cobh and Mallow routes in December when the new timetable is launched. Additional diesel rail cars will be allocated to Cork services and an integrated Cobh-Mallow service will be introduced with some peak services extended to Charleville. Additional peak services will be provided on the Cobh corridor and the Cork-Mallow rote will have approximately an hourly service.</p>
          <p eId="para_1259">Irish Rail's medium-term rail investment programme is currently under discussion between the Department of Transport and the company. The development of suburban rail proposals in the Cork region are included in this plan. On the basis of these discussions, the Minister expects to receive shortly proposals with regard to proposed rail development in Cork.</p>
          <p eId="para_1260">I refer to the green routes public transport network in Cork. Arising from the CASP, Cork City Council is implementing a green route transport corridor and park and ride strategy for transport in the city. A total of ten green routes will be constructed and these include all the main bus routes. The green routes strategy envisages high volume, high capacity bus-based public transport  corridors, which will connect each of the principal city suburbs and the airport with the city centre and the rail and bus stations.</p>
          <p eId="para_1261">The Department of Transport made €200,000 available to the city council in 2002 for preliminary design work on the first of these routes and is making available a further €3 million this year for construction work on the routes. In addition, the Department is making €3 million available to the city council for the construction of the first phase of the Black Ash park and ride site, which is situated close to the Kinsale Road roundabout. The park and ride site is located on the proposed green route from the airport to the city and it is expected the first phase of the facility will be in operation before Christmas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1262">I refer to Cork bus services, which have improved considerably over the past few years arising from significant investment under the national development plan. The NDP target for Cork over the lifetime of the plan is 130 buses. To date, 54 buses have been purchased by Bus Éireann for Cork: 30 in 2000; 14 in 2001 and ten in 2002. Departures have increased by 26% and the entire regular urban bus fleet in Cork is low floor, wheelchair accessible. The average age of the fleet in the city has been reduced from 11 years in the late 1990s to four years currently.</p>
          <p eId="para_1263">The Cork southern orbital bus service was introduced by Bus Éireann in September 2002 and was funded by the Department of Transport under the RAPID programme. The Government initiative gives priority attention to certain areas where a gap in infrastructure or other social needs is identified. It was confirmed in March 2003 that approximately 4,500 passengers use the southern orbital bus service every week. I hope this information updates the Deputy on the emerging changes in Cork suburban public transport.</p>

        <speech by="#PatCarey" eId="spk_763">
          <from>Mr. Carey:</from>
          <p eId="para_1264">It is odd that I have chosen a night following Hallowe'en to raise the sale and use of fireworks but I do so to give the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform an opportunity to engage in a comprehensive and informed debate regarding how fireworks ought to be regulated. A number of commentators said Hallowe'en in Dublin this year was similar to Baghdad or Beirut. However, better quality fireworks were used this year. More than 2,500 people attended a well organised fireworks display in Ballymun in my constituency. It was organised by the Garda, the Civil Defence, the Order of Malta, the Army and local community organisations. All the local community organisations were represented and there were very few satellite bonfires or fireworks displays. A number of other displays throughout the city were also well organised. In that context, it is opportune to consider the current situation. Coincidentally, a woman from the Raheny-Howth area telephoned me today, expressing concern about the dangers  posed to aircraft landing at Dublin Airport by the huge number of fireworks displays at Hallowe'en. Perhaps that has no serious implication for landing aircraft, but it goes to show that people are still concerned about the implications of bonfires and fireworks.</p>
          <p eId="para_1265">Having researched the Official Report, I found that this issue had been raised by a number of Deputies from both sides of the House, when Ministers from different parties were in charge. Curiously, the replies on each occasion were virtually identical. I will be interested to hear whether the Minister of State is allowed to deviate tonight from the standard reply to such debates. Since early September, fireworks have been blasting in flat complexes and housing estates throughout Dublin, the area with which I am most familiar and concerned. It can be a terrifying experience for older people and, since the use of fireworks began early this past autumn, from the end of August in some cases, many of them have not left their houses after 4 p.m. or 5 p.m. That is an issue which needs to be confronted.</p>
          <p eId="para_1266">I have received a large number of letters and telephone calls asking for action to be taken so that people do not feel threatened in their homes. In some flat complexes, elderly people have had to seal up their letter boxes to prevent fireworks from being dropped through them. They live in fear and there is a huge level of discomfort. Pets and other animals have been frightened. I have read the advice given by a British horse society to horse owners on how to deal with the consequences of the use of fireworks in their vicinity. In one instance in Dublin, fireworks were thrown into a shop in Cabra, causing considerable damage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1267">Fireworks which come into the hands of young children, mainly, pose great risks to them. I compliment the Garda on the excellent work done in this regard, as illustrated on a television programme last night. However, despite working covertly and otherwise, the number of seizures is still not substantial. We rely on section 80 of the Explosives Act of 1875 to deal with the throwing of fireworks and so on. While I have no intention of being a spoilsport, one has to be very careful when using fireworks. While I do not wish to have the Act used severely against young people unless they deliberately throw fireworks dangerously, I am anxious that there should be some reform. I am concerned that we must still rely on section 4 of the Explosives Act 1883 to deal with those who have explosives in their possession or control. It is definitely time to update legislation which is over 100 years old.</p>
          <p eId="para_1268">Clearly, parents have a responsibility, which most of them take very seriously. An extremely disconcerting issue with regard to the type of fireworks found on our streets is their country of origin. Largely, they come from China and they are dangerously volatile. In America, some states have introduced legislation to regulate the use of fireworks and the number of accidents has fallen  very significantly as a result. I ask the Minister of State to bear in mind the concerns I have expressed and to convey my views to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TomParlonPD" eId="spk_764">
          <from>Mr. Parlon:</from>
          <p eId="para_1269">I apologise for the absence of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, who has asked me to thank the Deputy for raising this matter and allowing an opportunity to set out the position in this regard. As the Deputy is aware, under the Explosives Act 1875, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has responsibility for the importation, transportation and storage of explosives, including fireworks. Consequently, to import fireworks, an importation licence granted by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is required. It is a long-standing policy that such licences are granted only for organised displays conducted by professional and experienced operators. Licences are not granted to import fireworks for sale. Prior to the granting of an importation licence, the Department consults with the relevant local authority and the Garda Síochána to establish if there are any objections to the display. The relevant local authority and the Garda Síochána can prevent any organised display from proceeding if, in the opinion of either authority, it is not safe to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_1270">The use of fireworks under such controlled conditions minimises the risk of injury and mishap and enables the spectacle of large fireworks displays, such as the skyfest display for St. Patrick's Day, to be enjoyed in safety. It is clear, however, that supplies of fireworks continue to be imported into the State in contravention of the law, especially around the Hallowe'en period, and that they are finding their way into the hands of young people. Much of what is illegally imported is of dubious quality. Unscrupulous individuals seek to flood the market with as many of these poor quality fireworks as they can sell to make a quick profit, with no regard for the safety of young people using them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1271">During the Hallowe'en period, a concerted effort is made by the Garda to control the illegal possession, sale and use of fireworks. In enforcing the regulations regarding fireworks, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is informed by the Garda authorities that they make full use of the Customs Consolidation Act 1876, the Casual Trading Acts 1980 and 1995 and the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994. Every effort is made by the Garda to identify persons involved in the illegal importation and sale of all types of fireworks. Specific policing plans, such as Operation Tambala in the Dublin north-central division, are put in place in areas where particular problems arise. These plans include intelligence-gathering on dealers and suppliers and, once these are identified, putting plans in place to arrest them and seize their stocks of illegal fireworks. Community gardaí are particularly active in identifying problem areas and, using their local knowledge, concentrate on areas where youths  using fireworks tend to congregate. The Garda was also involved in a public awareness media campaign, aimed at parents and children, regarding the dangers of handling fireworks.</p>
          <p eId="para_1272">This year efforts by the Garda have resulted in the confiscation of large quantities of illegally imported fireworks. On behalf of the Minister, I take this opportunity to congratulate the Garda Commissioner and members of the force on their success in this regard. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is aware that an argument is being made in favour of relaxing the policy to permit the importation of fireworks for individual use so as to enable the quality and use of fireworks to be regulated and controlled. It seems, however, that the potential advantages of any change in policy would have to be very carefully assessed and weighed against the disadvantages arising from the increase in the use of fireworks to which the change would undoubtedly give rise.</p>
          <p eId="para_1273">The current restrictive licensing policy, in conjunction with seizures of illegal fireworks, go a long way towards protecting the public from the inherent dangers of fireworks, while ensuring that  people are not deprived of the enjoyment of the spectacle of fireworks operated by professional and experienced persons in a controlled environment. It is incumbent on us all to take a share of responsibility in this matter. Vigilance cannot be left to the Garda alone. Parents, in particular, should ensure that their children are aware of the dangers posed by fireworks.</p>
          <p eId="para_1274">While the Minister recognises the reed for updating the overall legislation in this area, which dates back to the century before last, and while a review to this end is ongoing in his Department, there is a need to be conscious of the genuine concerns which people have about the use of fireworks. It certainly does not follow that a scheme for regulating the use of fireworks which might be authorised here would, of itself, deal with the problem of the importation of illegal fireworks. Once again I thank the Deputy for raising the matter in the House this evening. The points he has made will be fully taken into account by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in the ongoing review.</p>
          <p eId="para_1275">The Dáil adjourned at 9.10 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 12 November 2003.</p>

          <p eId="para_1286">The revised terms modify the details governing the duration and cost of the former scheme. Under the revised terms, the duration of the authorisation shall be for a period of one, two or three years, but a shorter period may be agreed for particular work programmes. The authorisation may be extended for a further period of 12 months. Previously, the duration was normally for a period of 12 months, with some as long as two years, and could be extended for 12 months. In addition, the rental fees payable on the authorisations have been reduced to those for phase 1 of frontier exploration licence which is €27 per square kilometre. This rate will apply also to any extension beyond the original duration.</p>
          <p eId="para_1287">The objectives are to rejuvenate exploration in the Celtic Sea, and possibly other areas in the future, and to make the licensing option a more attractive measure for promoting exploration activity in offshore Ireland. I am concerned that exploration interest and activity levels in offshore Ireland have declined in the past five years and are currently at a very low level. While this decline reflects similar patterns in other countries in north-west Europe, the Government is anxious to maintain exploration activity at a sustainable level and to make the sector more accessible to small and independent companies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1288">The revised terms recognise the need for Ireland to make its Celtic Sea exploration rental terms more competitive and flexible along the lines adopted by the UK in its "Promote" programme, which applied to the recent North Sea round. The revised terms are designed to appeal to small to medium sized companies in the sector which are more willing than the larger companies to identify and develop smaller and marginal fields.</p>

          <p eId="para_1294">There is a clear commitment to ensuring that the operation, and any further development, of the aquaculture industry takes place in accordance with high environmental standards and in a manner consistent with the conservation and protection of wild fisheries. It was for this reason that action was taken on a precautionary basis some years ago to establish arrangements for monitoring and control of sea lice levels at marine finfish farms. These arrangements have been developed in the intervening period into a comprehensive national monitoring and control programme. The programme involves the carrying out by the Marine Institute, on behalf of my Department, of 14 inspections of each marine finfish site each year. If an inspection detects the presence of sea lice at a site at levels in excess of the very strict trigger levels which are applied in this country, the operator of the site in question is required to apply an appropriate treatment to effect a reduction in the lice levels. These arrangements have been successful in bringing about significant reductions in the level of sea lice at fish farms over the years. For example, in 2002 87% of inspections found lice levels to be less than the rigorous trigger levels for treatment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1295">The position in the current year has been somewhat less satisfactory. While over 70% of smolts sampled had no ovigerous lice, fish which were one winter at sea were found to have lice levels in excess of treatment trigger levels in 32% of inspections. During the critical spring period, levels were above treatment triggers in almost 41% of the samples taken. These data are a matter of concern and my Department will be reviewing the situation, in conjunction with the Marine Institute, as a priority. Attention will focus on factors that may have contributed to the higher lice levels detected this year. In addition, the systems and procedures underpinning the monitoring and control programme will be examined as part of the wider review of monitoring, control and enforcement in respect of aquaculture that is being undertaken by my Department.</p>

          <from>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. D. Ahern):</from>
          <p eId="para_1297">There are two main elements in the deal agreed on the Irish Box at the recent Fisheries Council. First, a new conservation box comprising an area of more than 100,000 square kilometres has been established and, second, specific effort limits will apply to all foreign fishing fleets operating in the waters around Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_1298">The main implication of this agreement is the guarantee that there will be no increases in fishing effort by foreign fishing fleets in waters around Ireland and sensitive waters off the south and west coasts will be given special protection. The agreement also ensures that the current balance between northern and southern waters will be maintained, thus ensuring that there can be no transfer of effort by Spain from waters off its coast, where fish stocks are over exploited, into Irish waters. I voted against this agreement because of my consistently expressed view that the Irish Box in its existing format should have been retained in full.</p>
          <p eId="para_1299">Even though the new Irish conservation box, which has been welcomed as a good deal by the Irish fishing industry, went a significant way towards meeting my demands to protect vital spawning and nursery areas for many key stocks, I was not prepared to depart from that position of principle when it came to a vote. I am, however, confident that this deal will provide stability going forward and greatly help to guarantee the livelihoods of fishermen around our coast dependent on these waters. At Council, I was faced with outright opposition from Spain to any special protection measures in our waters. In the new regulation, however, I secured protection for those waters around Ireland under the greatest level of pressure from Spanish vessels and ensured that strict control measures are put in place within the new Irish conservation box. To that extent, the outcome must be considered broadly satisfactory.</p>

          <p eId="para_1304">Ireland, through my Department, has actively participated in the World Health Organisation's international EMF project since joining as a founder member in 1996. The main purpose of this project is to investigate the possible association between illness and exposure to electromagnetic fields. On three occasions Ireland has chaired the annual meeting of the WHO's international advisory committee to the EMF project.</p>
          <p eId="para_1305">The need to monitor the health of mobile phone users was recognised by both WHO and the European Commission in 1996 and was the subject of expert reports commissioned at that time. On receipt of the recommendations of these reports, the EU and WHO undertook a detailed feasibility study, co-ordinated by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, IARC, which is part of the WHO. This feasibility study was carried out in 1998 and 1999 in a number of countries. Its principal objective was to see whether it was possible to study the relationship between mobile phone use and brain cancer in circumstances where, among other things, almost everyone now uses mobile phones. The study concluded that, with careful planning and control, it should be possible to undertake an epidemiological study that would detect an increase in cancers of the head associated with mobile phone use, if such an increase were to exist in fact.</p>
          <p eId="para_1306">A series of multinational studies is now under way. The work is being co-ordinated by IARC and supported by the WHO with a grant from the quality of life programme of the European Commission.

These large numbers are essential to maximise the power of the study in order to find a risk, if one exists. The findings of this major investigation will be applicable and relevant to other countries, such as Ireland, which are contributing to its cost through their contributions to the international EMF project. The first results of the study are expected in late 2004.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1309">My officials presented revised licensing policy proposals to the sea-fishing boat licensing policy review group on 22 October. A further meeting of the review group was held on 30 October to hear the views of its members, which includes broad representation from industry organisations. The revised policy proposals were also placed on the Department's website with a request for written observations by an extended deadline of noon on 4 November.

          <p eId="para_1310">The Fisheries (Amendment) Act 2003 established an independent licensing authority which will implement the new sea fishing boat licensing policy. The Act allows me, as Minister, to issue general policy directives to the licensing authority.</p>

I will issue a policy directive to the licensing authority in respect of the licensing of vessels in the remaining pelagic, beamer and polyvalent fleet segments, where the policy proposals are somewhat more involved, when the current deliberations are concluded, in a day or two. Details of the new policy will be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil,</i> as required under the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 2003.</p>

          <p eId="para_1319">In February 2003, the chairman wrote to me setting out the view of the authority on various elements of the Government decision.

In my reply, I stated that I did not understand this assertion and explained that this element of the Government's decision was about good corporate governance. I explained that it is about ensuring that the national broadcaster is structured in a manner best suited to delivering on its responsibilities to the licence fee paying public.

        <summary eId="sum_21">The Government's guiding vision for broadband is to have widespread availability of open access, affordable, always-on broadband infrastructure for businesses and citizens throughout the State within three years. As regards competitiveness, we wish to place Ireland within the top 10% of developed countries for broadband connectivity within that time frame. The regional  broadband programme, for which an indicative €200 million of Government and European Regional Development Fund funding was set aside under the National Development Plan 2000-2006, is under way and entails the roll-out of advanced communications infrastructure to all regions.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_22">Recent price reductions and the introduction of flat rate Internet access, which was introduced following a set of policy directions that I issued to ComReg earlier this year, have helped greatly with the uptake of broadband. Higher uptake figures will result from more competitive pricing by service providers who have shown they understand the dynamics of the marketplace and are, as a consequence, lowering the price to consumers and businesses.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_23">Developments during 2003 indicate that broadband penetration is now increasing rapidly in all areas of the country and it is quite evident that there is considerable demand from both business and domestic customers. As a measure of this demand, the EU flash barometer places Ireland fourth in the EU in Internet penetration. Recent reports show Internet penetration among SMEs in Ireland is running at 84%.

The mandate of the new body will be to respond to a wide safety agenda, including better enforcement of safety regulations, promotion of public awareness of safety issues, development of new ship and port security measures and an enhanced pollution prevention and response capability.</p>
          <p eId="para_1335">Advances in modern communications technologies enable new approaches to be adopted in the provision of maritime emergency radio response and co-ordination. On this basis, I have accepted the consultants recommendation that the Coast Guard should operate two control centres as opposed to the three centres that exist. The services currently provided by the Dublin centre will be transferred to Valentia and Malin Head and significant cost savings achieved from this measure will enable other elements of the coast guard service to be developed. This, in turn, will lead to further improvements in our marine emergency response services nationally.</p>
          <p eId="para_1336">The capability of the Coast Guard to co-ordinate and manage incidents will not be diminished as a result of the closure of the Dublin rather than the Valentia or Malin Head centres, nor will the decision affect the very significant emergency response resources on the ground, which will remain available to the Irish Coast Guard on a 24 hour basis all year round. The consultants have also made a number of recommendations to enhance the radio communications network maintained by the Coast Guard as well as changes to operational procedures and staffing arrangements. Senior Coast Guard management are undertaking an examination and implementation of these recommendations as part of the ongoing development of the service.</p>

          <p eId="para_1338">The Common Fisheries Policy provides for the conservation and rational exploitation of fisheries resources through a range of instruments. Total allowable catches, TACs, for the various fish stocks are established each December by the Council of Agriculture and Fisheries Ministers, taking account of scientific advice provided by fisheries biologists on the state of stocks. The advice for this year has recently been finalised and there is serious concern that certain stocks are outside safe biological limits. There is particular concern about key whitefish stocks such as cod, hake and whiting. The European Commission has brought forward proposals for recovery plans in respect of cod and hake in areas, including the Irish Sea, the Celtic Sea and west of Scotland, and may bring forward further proposals in the light of recent advice. These plans are being examined by member states. The overall objective is to ensure the recovery of these stocks within a timeframe of five to ten years.</p>

The regulations came into force on the date. The main features of the directive and the regulations are the right of subscribers to determine which of their personal data are included in publicly available directories of subscribers; a requirement that subscribers are informed of the purposes of public directories before they are included in them and given complete information about the ways in which their personal data can subsequently be used or accessed for example by reverse search functions; provision for the processing of mobile location data, with subscriber's consent, for providing new value added services – subscribers also have the right to withdraw their consent to such processing at any time; con fidentiality provisions are extended to the use of electronic communications networks to store information or to gain access to information stored in the terminal equipment of users; restrictions on unsolicited direct marketing by telephone, fax, automated calling systems, email, SMS and MMS are introduced – notably, the regulations introduce a ‘ban on Spam' originating in the EU. Spam, email marketing, with a limited exception – covering existing customer relationships – is only allowed with prior consent. Disguised identities and invalid return addresses, often used by "spammers", are also outlawed. This ‘opt-in' regime equally covers SMS messages and other electronic messages sent to any mobile phone and fixed terminal. Some protections against unsolicited commercial emails to businesses are also provided; additional consumer protection measures, including access to the courts for redress for loss or damage suffered as a result of contravention of the regulations; and provisions for investigations of suspected breaches of various regulations to be initiated by the Data Protection Commissioner.</p>

Responsibility for the national committee for mountain and cave rescue was transferred from the then Department of the Environment and Local Government to the Coastguard in 2002. The Coastguard is seeking to implement an appropriate auditing process of the organisations similar to the well established procedures in place in regard to the community inshore rescue service. The auditing process entails the coastguard undertaking an annual independent quality assurance assessment relating to safety, effectiveness, equipment, training, management, response times and operational procedures. The different elements of the audit are interrelated and a broad common sense approach is adopted. The quality assurance procedures have been put in place to improve the safety of the rescue teams themselves and the general public who rely on them and they provide a verifiable audit trail to account for public moneys being dispersed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1346">I understand that most of the issues in question have been agreed and I am hopeful that agreement will be reached on the outstanding matters shortly.

          <from>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. D. Ahern):</from>
          <p eId="para_1368">In the Irish Sea and elsewhere, cod is caught in association with a number of other demersal species such as whiting and haddock. Accordingly, a total ban on all cod fishing in the Irish Sea would, in effect, mean an almost complete stop to all fishing operations in that area, which would have a devastating affect on the local fishing communities concerned. The EU has brought forward proposals for recovery plans for cod in a number of areas, including the Irish Sea. Since the latest scientific advice was published by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea a number of weeks ago, the European Commission has held discussions in Brussels with both representatives of member states and the fishing industry throughout the European Union to discuss the proposed recovery plans in the context of the new scientific advice.</p>
          <p eId="para_1369">These discussions involved a detailed exchange of views with the Commission on a range of possible options and measures to assist the recovery of a number of cod stocks, including the Irish Sea stock. During these discussions, the Commission indicated its conclusion that a total ban on all cod fishing was not a realistic option in the circumstances and that it was examining other policy responses. I agree with the Commission's stance in this regard and I look forward to receiving specific Commission proposals in the coming weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_1370">A number of steps have already been taken to promote the recovery of the Irish Sea cod stock. Since 2000, an area in the Irish Sea has been closed each year during the cod spawning season in the spring. Additional technical measures have also been introduced in recent years. In the light of the latest scientific advice, it would, in my view, be desirable to strengthen these measures which, I believe, can contribute to stock recovery. I anticipate a detailed discussion on this matter in the period immediately ahead and I will work closely with representatives of the Irish fishing industry to ensure that the recovery of the Irish Sea cod stock is achieved at the earliest possible date.</p>

          <p eId="para_1382">Deputies will be aware that I have recently spoken out on my dissatisfaction at the level of call roaming charges being applied by mobile phone operators in this State. As a Minister from a Border county, I am aware of the effect of exorbitant mobile call roaming charges on local people and local businesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_1383">The issue is not simply one of mobile phone operators introducing all-Ireland tariffs, although this in itself is to be welcomed. The level of such tariffs and the terms and conditions attached also need to be examined in order to ensure that consumers are getting a fair deal.</p>
          <p eId="para_1384">While I am not directly responsible for the regulation of call roaming charges, this area coming under the jurisdiction of the Commission for Communications Regulation, I have asked the Commission to bring forward proposals to remedy this situation. This request to the Commission was made in the context of a general review of the impact of the policy directions I issued to them last February. The purpose of the general review is to ascertain what further actions may be necessary to further regulatory priorities in the sector. In the interim, I will be keeping the situation under review and will continue to encourage mobile phone operators to address this matter themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_1385">The framework regulations, which I signed into law in July this year, mandates the Commission for Communications Regulation to conduct market definition and analysis processes in certain markets identified by the European Commission in a published recommendation. These markets are selected on the basis of containing characteristics which may be such as to justify the imposition of regulatory obligations.</p>
          <p eId="para_1386">I note that the Commission for Communications Regulation has started the process of market definition and analysis into two separate segments of the mobile telephony market. I welcome the start of this investigative process and I trust that a positive outcome will ensue.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_25">The decision to transfer the services from Dublin was taken on foot of a study of the coast guard services undertaken by independent consultants. Reflecting advances in modern communications technologies, the consultants recommended that the coast guard should operate two control  centres as opposed to the three centres that exist at present. This approach will have the effect of achieving significant cost savings, thus enabling other elements of the coast guard service to be developed, which in turn will lead to further improvements in our marine emergency response services nationally.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_26">My objective is that the remaining two centres at Valentia and Malin will be developed to handle all emergencies around our coast, on inland waters and in relation to mountain, cliff and cave rescue.

          <p eId="para_1408">While I do not have particular knowledge of the specific claim referred to by the Deputy, it is not in dis pute that the biological status of a number of key whitefish stocks, particularly cod in the North Sea and elsewhere in the north-east Atlantic, is a cause for concern.</p>
          <p eId="para_1409">The latest scientific advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, the body of scientists charged with the responsibility of assessing the status of fish stocks in the northeast Atlantic, confirms the need to implement recovery measures for a number of endangered fish stocks, especially cod. It should, however, be borne in mind that not all fish stocks are in an equally endangered state and that North Sea herring, for instance, in now considered to be in a healthy state even though it was endangered a number of years ago. Any suggestion, therefore, of a complete collapse in all fish stocks is overstating the case although that does not of course diminish the need to implement appropriate measures in response to cases where there is a clear cause for concern.</p>
          <p eId="para_1410">The new Common Fisheries Policy, agreed last December, provides the basic legislative framework under which the European Union implements detailed conditions and controls applicable to fisheries throughout the Union. The new CFP contains a heightened emphasis on the need to conserve fish stocks and includes in particular provisions for the recovery of fish stocks such as cod which are considered to be endangered.</p>
          <p eId="para_1411">In the period immediately ahead and in the light of the recent scientific advice from ICES, I anticipate that the Council of Fisheries Ministers will assess and evaluate the present situation in detail and decide on the most appropriate course to follow. There is a need to strengthen existing conservation measures in order to address the concerns that have been identified and I will be articulating this view to council colleagues.</p>

These re-designations of company to sub-post offices are also the subject of agreements with the trade unions.</p>

          <p eId="para_1427">There are a number of initiatives, which have been taken or are being taken, by the maritime safety directorate of my Department in relation to competency in boat handling. First, the directorate recently reviewed and recognised courses run by the Irish Sailing Association, ISA, and the International Yacht Master Training, IYT, to enhance the standard of yacht master and powerboat handling in Ireland. Second, the directorate recently appointed the ISA and the IYT as approved bodies for the issuing of the international certificate for operators of pleasure craft, ICC, on behalf of my Department. In so doing it has enabled Ireland to accept Resolution No. 40 of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe and its annexes. Issue of the ICC by these approved bodies is subject to, among other things, the operator undergoing a training programme and demonstrating competency in specified safety requirements. Work is under way in the directorate on developing competency standards for skippers of domestic passenger ships and passenger boats with a view to introducing the necessary regulations in 2004.</p>

          <p eId="para_1435">The promotion of renewable energy technologies is a key priority of the Government. As Minister with responsibility for energy policy, my immediate goal is to add an additional 500 megawatts of renewables based electricity generating capacity to the electricity network by 2005 and a further 218 MW by 2006 subject to EU state aids clearance.</p>
          <p eId="para_1436">The 500 megawatt target is currently being implemented and will be achieved in the main under contracts offered by me under the fifth and sixth alternative energy requirement competitions. I am confident of securing state aids clearance for the additional 218 MW which will be allocated to AER VI projects but I cannot commit to individual projects until the European Commission has finalised its position on the state aids notification.</p>
          <p eId="para_1437">In addition, Sustainable Energy Ireland, SEI, the independent non-commercial State body focused exclusively on sustainable use of energy including deployment of renewable energy sources, has commenced a challenging work programme to increase energy efficiency and to promote renewable energy technologies. In the renewable energy field, specifically, SEI has opened a research, development and demonstration programme for renewable energy technologies. The programme is open to a wide range of proposals including policy studies, field research, feasibility studies and technology RD&amp;D.</p>
          <p eId="para_1438">The completion of AER VI will close the current chapter of support for renewable energy technologies. I will shortly launch a comprehensive consultation and review of the renewable energy sector which will feed into the formulation of a new policy initiative for this important segment of the energy market. The review of the renewable energy sector will focus on the key issues which I believe we now need to address particularly in the context of the EC directive on the promotion of electricity produced from renewable energy sources in the internal electricity market. The obligation addressed to Ireland in the directive is to increase the consumption of electricity from renewable energy sources to 13.2% of total electricity consumed nationally by 2010. I have already stated that this is a minimum target which must be achieved.</p>

          <p eId="para_1440">The maritime safety directorate of my Department is developing a registration system to enhance the safety of recreational craft. This new system will form part of an overhaul of the vessel registration process generally by the directorate, which will put safety at the centre of the process. It is proposed that recreational craft would fall into two categories for registration purposes, a small craft register or full registration, depending on length, tonnage and speed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1441">The registration system, which I expect to be introduced in 2004, will initially be on a voluntary basis to facilitate the introduction of the scheme, but it is my intention that the system will in time be put on a statutory basis.</p>

          <p eId="para_1448">The scientific model for analysis of salmon stocks continues to be refined in the light of data relating to marine survival, catches, spawning escapement and habitat. A key element of this approach is the installation and operation of fish counters on salmon index rivers. The overall management of the national fish counter programme has, to date, been primarily the responsibility of the Marine Institute, which has operated the programme directly or by subcontracting where necessary in order to maintain its objectives.</p>
          <p eId="para_1449">I am advised that since 1995 the Marine Institute, in conjunction with the Regional Fisheries Board, fishery owners, engineers from my Department and consultants, has installed 22 fish counting systems on the following Irish salmon and sea trout rivers: Dee, Boyne, Liffey, Slaney, Suir, Bandon, Kerry Blackwater, Laune, Waterville, Feale, Casla, Gowla, Invermore, Erriff, Moy, Ballysadare, Garravogue, Eany, Eske and Dungloe. It is planned to develop and install additional counting systems in the rivers Bunowen, Cork Blackwater, Corrib and Munster Blackwater in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_1450">The Marine Institute has maintained a national database of fish counts since the programme commenced in the mid 1990s and currently collates all counter data both remotely via modem and directly by means of direct download of data. During the season, fish count data is downloaded and compiled into monthly reports which are made available to the central and regional fisheries boards, members of the standing scientific committee of the National Salmon Commission and relevant fishery owners/managers. Many of these counts are available on-line to the general public via the Marine Institute's website.</p>

          <p eId="para_1457">Major electricity blackouts are usually the result of a number of contingencies, including generation shortages, transmission network failures and operational difficulties. While no electricity power system can be fully protected from such events, I am satisfied that measures are in place to reduce as far as possible the risk of a major blackout occurring on our power system and to maintain security of supply.</p>
          <p eId="para_1458">The Commission for Energy Regulation continues to monitor the security of supply situation and has initiated a number of positive actions to redress postulated generation capacity shortfalls in the short-term and the medium to long-term, as forecast by ESB National Grid in its most recent generation adequacy report. Short-term measures put in place include the implementation by ESB National Grid of a demand side management programme operational for the coming winter; increased imports of electricity from Northern Ireland, together with the purchase by ESB of 104 MW of additional peaking capacity operational from 1 January 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_1459">As to the capacity deficit in the medium to longer term, the CER is holding a competition for the award of contracts for up to 531 MW additional generation capacity to be announced in early December.</p>
          <p eId="para_1460">The ESB is currently undertaking a significant networks investment programme, of some €4 billion up to 2007, to bring the transmission and distribution systems up to required international standards and to meet projected capacity demand requirements. The programme is being delivered within the planned timeframe and budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_1461">In the event of an emergency situation, the transmission system operator, as part of its licence conditions, has in place a number of specific emergency plans to deal with the incident quickly and effectively. These include power system restoration and capacity shortfall plans which involve, <i>inter alia,</i> matching supply to demand by load shedding while prioritising supply to critical users such as hospitals.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_34">The recent statements by the CER referred to in the question appear to stem from its response to a discussion paper issued by the Department  of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on the subject of a strategy to reduce emissions. These statements are not a forecast of what will happen in practice and should not be cited out of context.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_35">Finally, Deputies may be aware of concerns at EU level of insufficient development in some member states of transmission and generation infrastructure and reserve capacity. In this connection, the Energy Commissioner, Mme de Palacio, has stated her intention to present a communication shortly on the issue of security of electricity supply within the EU.</summary>

The INPC has already paid €20 million to the Exchequer. As I advised the House on a number of occasions, and most recently in my reply of 7 October 2003, the company is not yet in a position to determine definitively and pay over the final balance because a number of outstanding matters have still to be  resolved. As these matters, comprising chiefly environmental claims and a contractual dispute, have potential financial implications, the INPC, having regard to the Companies Acts, is not currently in a position to divest itself of its remaining financial assets. As these matters relate to day-to-day operations for the INPC it is not appropriate for me to elaborate on them further at this stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1467">It has always been accepted that the total cash return to the Exchequer arising from the INPC transaction would be considerably less than the headline sale price of $100 million as the INPC had, for example, to use some of the proceeds to discharge the company's debt. I am satisfied, however, that the transaction represented a very favourable outcome for the State.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_36">The Dooish exploration well, which was drilled last year by Enterprise Energy Ireland off the Donegal coast and which discovered a hydrocarbon accumulation, was re-entered and deep ened this summer. Drilling commenced on 11 May 2003 and the well was plugged having confirmed the existence of a substantial gas condensate column, and the rig moved off-site on 30 July 2003. Both my Department and Shell-Enterprise Energy Ireland are continuing to analyse the well results and integrate them with other data from the area. Further technical work on the prospect will be required before the size of the gas condensate accumulation and the possibility for any commercial development can be accurately assessed. However, it is extremely encouraging that this well, only the second to be drilled in the Rockall Basin, proved to be such a significant discovery, and my Department has emphasised the positive implications of this discovery for the prospectivity of the basin as a whole.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_37">No further oil or gas exploration occurred during the summer months of this year. The Cong exploration well is currently being drilled in the Erris Basin, approximately 60 km. off the Mayo coast and some 20 km. north-east of the Corrib Gas Field. Drilling began on this exploration well by Statoil in the Erris basin on 5 August 2003.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_38">There have been a total of three seismic surveys carried out offshore Ireland this year, all off the west coast. However, one of these surveys was abandoned following damage to equipment. The results of the surveys are not yet available due to the highly technical processing required for this type of data.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1503">Under section 9(1)(<i>a</i>) of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999, I, as Minister, am empowered to issue a policy direction to the CER on electricity trading arrangements.

          <p eId="para_1504">The CER decided to accelerate the review required by that policy direction so as to provide existing and potential market participants with an increased level of certainty, required for investment purposes. Accordingly, on 16 July 2003 the CER made, with my consent, the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 (Market Arrangements for Electricity) Regulations 2003. These regulations establish the new system of trading in electricity, that is the mandatory centralised pool, and pave the way for the detailed rules and procedures necessary to give effect to the new market arrangements in a fully liberalised market.</p>

The CER's consultation paper highlights the issue as to whether renewable energy generation and  CHP could be more effectively supported through a mechanism outside the market arrangements, through preferential treatment or via special rules under the trading arrangements.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_42">The CER has indicated that it favours supporting renewable energy generation and CHP plant outside of the trading arrangements in order to allow true market signals to be seen, minimise market distortion, minimise system and market operation costs to the final customer and afford greater transparency.

That study identified the substantial potential benefits such a system could deliver and gave an indicative estimate of costs of the order of €3.4 million, excluding VAT, for the central element of the  project, rising to a figure of the order of €5.58 million, excluding VAT, when taking account of the security infrastructure required, and other costs which might accrue to individual Departments. Current indications are that the project will be delivered within these projected costs.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_45">It is hoped to deploy the initial system in Departments early in 2004, on a phased basis. Deployment has been rescheduled from late 2003 to early 2004, primarily due to having encountered some technical issues associated with the variety of ICT infrastructure and configurations already in use across Departments. This has required intensive focus on resolving these issues with a consequent impact on the scheduled implementation of the e-Cabinet system itself.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_46">My Department is also developing a Government on-line returns extranet. This extranet will be available to all Departments so that they can refer and contribute to schedules of Government events and engagements both at home and abroad. It is planned that this extranet will go live in November of this year. The cost of this project was originally estimated at €21,208. Some additional development work was required and it is now estimated that the costs involved will be approximately €25,000.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_47">It should be added that general work to enhance my Department's ICT network, systems, websites and applications is ongoing.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1519">Expenditure by my Department to date is on target and it is expected that overall spending in 2003 will remain within the agreed Revised Estimates for the year. Details of expenditure figures to end October 2003 are contained in the following table which shows the Department's spending to be within budget for the first ten months of the year.</p>

          <p eId="para_2121">IDA Ireland is the agency, which has statutory responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment to the State and its regions. Since the beginning of 2003 there have been five site visits to the Donegal region. Three of these were first time visits. The companies are in the medical technologies, digital media and international services sectors. The two remaining visits were repeat visits from companies in the contact centre and pharmaceutical sectors. Ultimately, it is the overseas investor who makes the final decision on where any project will locate, including what areas to visit as potential locations</p>
          <p eId="para_2122">The IDA continues to promote Donegal and the north-west region as a location for inward investment and I am confident that the strategies and policies being pursued by them, together with the ongoing commitment of Government to regional development will bear fruit in terms of attracting additional sustainable overseas investment for Donegal.</p>

          <p eId="para_2183">My Department has invested significantly in IT over the past number of years to provide systems to underpin its operations and to provide enhanced customer service. At any time there is a large programme of IT initiatives being progressed. Much of this work involves essential changes and enhancements to the existing range of systems that support the operations of the Department, and is carried out by the in-house IT team.</p>
          <p eId="para_2184">Large new developments in this programme are outsourced, in line with the Department's IT strategy. Procurement for these is done on the basis of fixed price contracts. These projects are managed by project boards, who control the project and authorise any contract changes, where business requirements change during the implementation of the project or where it is decided to have the contractor carry out additional related work. Any such changes are also done within procurement guidelines.</p>
          <p eId="para_2185">Outsourced projects which are ongoing or were completed during 2003 include a project to provide on-line access for farmers to their area aid applications and their maps, an SAP based accounts project to underpin purchasing, accounts receivable, material management and fixed assets management, a project to build a new system for intervention based on SAP, and the construction of a new animal health computer system to support disease eradication.</p>
          <p eId="para_2186">I will extract and provide directly to the Deputy the details he has requested in regard to all such projects that are ongoing or have been completed during the year.</p>

          <p eId="para_2226">Under the terms and conditions of the scheme, a producer who has applied on 14 animals or more must continue to own, possess, hold and maintain on his holding during the six months retention period a number of suckler cows at least equal to 60% and at most equal to 85% and a number of heifers at least equal to 15% and at most equal to 40% of the total number of animals for which premium was requested.</p>

          <p eId="para_2229">The person named included a land parcel on his 2003 area aid application that was also being claimed on another herd owner's application. The area aid unit contacted both herd owners to clarify the matter. The person named replied and confirmed that he did not have entitlement to claim the parcel involved. His application was fully processed with an area overclaim of 13.81 hectares or 41.32% having been determined by my Department. The appropriate penalty, as a result of the area aid over-declaration was 100% since the difference between the area declared and the area determined exceeds 20%. Therefore, in accordance with EU regulations, no payment is due to the person named under the 2003 area based compensatory allowance scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_2230">The person named had six animals eligible to him under the 2003 slaughter premium scheme. As two of these animals were beef breed heifers under 30 months of age, they were also eligible for national envelope top-up premium. Advance payment of 80% has issued for both schemes.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_77">The person named submitted no applications under the 2003 special beef premium scheme. The person named applied for premium for 34 animals under the 2003 suckler cow premium scheme. The application was processed and his 80% advance instalment for €3048.44 issued on 17 October 2003. At the time of advance payment no forage area was determined. Accordingly, under the terms and conditions of the scheme a producer may be paid up to 15 reckonable livestock units and in this case payment issued in respect of 17 animals, that is 15 livestock units.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_78">Even though an over declaration of the forage area has been found the area linked penalty may not be applied to the suckler cow premium if the area found eligible is sufficient to support a stocking density of 1.8 livestock units to the hectare or less. As stated, an area of 33.42 hectares has been determined for payment purposes but because the herdowner is entitled to submit special beef premium applications until the end of December my Department will not be in a position to establish the exact stocking density situation until balancing payment stage in early 2004. At that time payment of any further suckler cow premium entitlements that may be determined will be made.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2236">A total of 313 farmers in the Cooley Peninsula, County Louth, were compensated for the culling of their stock during the foot and mouth disease crisis. In so far as sheep were concerned, valuations were carried out to fix a market value for each flock as the basis for compensation as provided by law. Initial valuations tended to conform with the ready reckoners used by the Department's own valuers. As matters progressed it became necessary for outside valuers to be drawn in to speed up the whole process. Their valuations were seen by local flock owners as more generous than valuations carried out by the Department personnel. Roughly speaking, those whose animals were taken in the latter part of the exercise tended to be satisfied, while flock owners whose animals were valued and taken at an earlier stage felt aggrieved.</p>
          <p eId="para_2237">To address local concerns it was agreed that the cases of flock owners who fell into this category would be reviewed. The review comprised an examination of valuations on 286 files followed by a further investigation of 182 cases where it was established that this was warranted. Valuers were requested to re-examine these files and supplementary payments totalling €415,000 and ranging between an additional €80 to an additional €22,535, were recommended. These payments were in addition to payments of some €3.4 million already made to the flock owners in question on foot of the initial valuations. These recommendations were accepted by my Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_2238">I am satisfied that the valuation review in relation to the Cooley flocks was conducted in a fair, detailed, professional and speedy manner. I have no plans to take any further action in the matter. My Department will be vigorously defending its handling of this issue in legal proceedings brought against it by a very small number of those involved who are claiming they were inadequately compensated for culled animals.</p>

With effect from 2005, the decoupled payment, which is to be known as the single payment scheme, is to be based on the average number of animals or the average number of hectares in the case of arable aid on which payments were made under the livestock premia and arable aid schemes in respect of the three reference years 2000, 2001 and 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_2243">The 2000 headage schemes and the 2001 and 2002 area-based compensatory allowance schemes are not included in the single payment scheme calculation. This scheme continues as before. The single payment is calculated by taking the three yearly average number of animals-arable hectares which attracted payment and multiplying them by the payment rate for 2002 in respect of livestock or by €383.04 per hectare in the case of arable aid. Entitlements are established by dividing this single payment amount by the average number of hectares over the three-year period. Farmers for whom entitlements have been established must activate those entitlements in 2005 by continuing to farm and submitting an area aid declaration in that year.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_79">It appears the person named commenced farming in 1997 and was paid cattle headage, special beef premium and extensification premium under the 1997 and 1998 schemes. From 1999 to 2001, inclusive, he was paid under the cattle headage or area based compensatory allowance scheme only. In 2002, he received payment under the area-based compensatory allowance scheme and the slaughter premium scheme. There is no record in my Department of an application to the suckler cow reserve having been received from the person named in any of the years 1999 to 2002, inclusive. He applied to the 1998 reserve, but was not accepted because there was insufficient quota in the reserve to allow allocations to be made to applicants whose livestock units exceeded 15, which was the position in his case. His livestock units were determined at 38.4. He could, of  course, have leased or bought in quota in those years. He applied to the 2003 reserve and was allocated seven quota rights, which was the maximum allocation to any qualifying applicant in 2003 due to the low level of rights available in the reserve.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_80">The person named will have entitlements established in accordance with EU rules based on the animals which attracted payment under the 2002 slaughter premium scheme. However, since he was farming during the entire reference period, the number of animals and hectares declared must be averaged over the three years when calculating his entitlements. He may apply to the national reserve when it becomes available, but priority must be given to new entrants to farming who commenced farming after 31 December 2002 because they would not have been in a position to establish any entitlements in their own right. He may, of course, purchase or lease in entitlements from 2006 onwards if he so wishes.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2245">While approximately 60,000 soil samples were tested last year, there is scope for a much greater use of the available soil testing facilities in Ireland. Soil testing is a useful management tool. While its use is compulsory for participants in the rural environment protection scheme, I encourage other farmers to make better use of this service for both economic and environmental reasons. Research has shown that considerable cost savings are possible when fertiliser use is based on soil analysis and is in accordance with Teagasc recommendations. Effective use of soil analysis data also has the potential to contribute to the protection of the environment and facilitates the achievement of the goal of sustainable agriculture.</p>
          <p eId="para_2246">I will shortly make proposals to the European Commission for changes in REPS. I am confident that these changes, once approved by the Commission, will result in a significant and sustained increase in the number of participants in the scheme. This in turn will lead to an increased level of soil testing, which Ireland has sufficient testing capacity to facilitate.</p>

          <from>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh):</from>
          <p eId="para_2248">I introduced the provision for milk production partnerships within the Irish quota system to allow for flexibility in farming practice by combining two enterprises and quotas while at the same time preserving the integrity of the quota system. Standard milk production partnerships were provided for in 2002. Since then, 17 such partnerships have been registered. Following a review of the first year of the operation of the partnerships, I introduced new regulations to provide for the registration of new entrant and parent milk production partnerships. New entrant and parent milk production partnerships can be established between a new entrant to dairying and his or her parent or parents with a milk production quota of less than 300,000 litres. These partnerships allow a qualified young farmer to start a milk production enterprise in partnership with his or her parent without having to establish separate facilities where he or she has received an allocation of milk quota as a new entrant farming in partnership under a milk quota restructuring scheme. Such partnerships provide an opportunity for trained young farmers to get established in the industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_2249">Since April 2003, 60 new entrant partnerships have been registered and at least 40 more are expected to be added to the register by the end of the quota year. The principal conditions which apply to partnerships are as follows. Both quota holders can participate in quota allocation schemes in their own right in the case of the standard partnerships. One partner's milk quota may be up to four times greater than the other at the formation of the partnership in the case of the standard partnerships. The partners' holdings may be up to 20 km apart. A person can only be a member of one registered partnership. Both producers must have delivered at least 70% of their respective quotas in the three milk quota years prior to entry into the partnership, though this requirement may be waived in certain circumstances. A partner may have annual off-farm income of up to €22,000 in the year preceding the registration of the partnership or during the partnership except for the new entrant where no limit applies to income in the year preceding the partnership. A producer aged 60 years old or more may not join a partnership and a person may not continue to be a partner after they are 65 years old. The partners must not have been involved in any land transfers in the two years prior to the formation of the partnership, though exemptions from this condition are available on application if satisfactory explanations are provided.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_81">The partnership must have a formal partnership agreement of a least five years duration. The regulations also require that all the farming activities of the partners are included in the partnership though most on-farm specialist enterprises may be exempted from its scope. The full details of the rules applying to such partnerships are set out in the European Communities (Milk Quota) (Amendment) Regulations 2002 as  amended by the European Communities (Milk Quota) (Amendment) Regulations 2003.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_82">I am keeping the regulations on partnership under review to ensure that they are working to the benefit of the sector. I will make whatever amendments are necessary and practicable to improve their operation in the future.</summary>

          <from>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh):</from>
          <p eId="para_2255">I propose to take Questions Nos. 224 to 228, inclusive, together.</p>
          <p eId="para_2256">CLA is a bacterial disease of sheep and goats that can cause economic losses in the form of poor weight gain, lower wool yield, reproductive inefficiency, devaluation of hides and condemnation of carcasses at slaughter. It is not possible to be definitive about the origin of the disease in Ireland, although a number of cases in recent years can be linked to imports of breeding stock. It is equally difficult to be certain about the exact number of cases because there is no readily available test which could facilitate screening for the disease. However, there are grounds for believing that there is substantial under-reporting of the disease and the available evidence suggests that the disease is common in many flocks.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_83">In Ireland, this disease is categorised as a class A disease under the Diseases of Animals Act 1966 and it is compulsorily notifiable. Until recently, affected flocks were restricted. Sales for slaughter were permitted, but sales for breeding and fattening prohibited. However, the disease is not categorised as a class A disease under current OIE rules and is not regarded as being of human health concern. Against this background, I recently announced that flocks in which CLA has been confirmed would no longer be restricted other than in exceptional cases where this was considered necessary. However, the disease will retain its class A status and will remain compulsorily notifiable. This will facilitate an ongoing evaluation of case numbers and allow my Department to take action in exceptional cases where this is considered necessary.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_84">Prior to my recent announcement, eight pedigree flocks were restricted with the disease. My Department does not have a compensation scheme for affected flock owners. However, in the past, and in the context of a regime which prohibited the sale of breeding stock from affected flocks, my Department from time to time madeex gratia payments in respect of the depopulation of sheep to pedigree flock owners whose primary business was prevented by such a restriction. In this context, my Department is considering the making of similar ex gratia payments to the flock owners referred to above. I expect this matter to be finalised and offers made to these farmers in the very near future. The question of providing such compensation in future cases does not arise.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_85">In July of this year my Department issued an advice note to every flock owner in the country to assist them in identifying the clinical signs of the disease, understanding how it is spread, protecting their flocks, reducing the risk of the disease spreading and dealing with suspect cases. In this context, the primary responsibility for tackling this disease and the most effective means of doing so rest with the sheep sector itself. I urge farming bodies, breeding societies and flock owners to encourage greater effort in this area.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2383">I am satisfied that the partnership agreement Sustaining Progress provides an appropriate basis, as its terms state, to sustain economic growth, maintain high levels of employment and secure living stan dards for all, while at the same time strengthening the economy's competitiveness and its capacity to resume trend growth in more favourable international conditions.</p>
          <p eId="para_2384">I cannot overstate the importance of competitiveness. Sustaining Progress identifies the renewal of competitiveness, both domestic and international, as central to the achievement of our macroeconomic objectives. It is vital that we bring our price and cost increases down to EU levels with the least possible delay and that wage increases are limited to those set out in the agreement if we are to be in a position to compete in global markets. A second progress report on the implementation of the agreement was recently laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>

          <p eId="para_2386">I have previously indicated that the infrastructure programme of the national development plan will not be completed by the end of 2006, although significant enhancement of our economic and social infrastructure as a result of plan investment will be achieved by then. The matter of progress on individual projects under the NDP infrastructure programme is a matter in the first instance for the relevant responsible Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_2387">At programme level, the Exchequer has provided €1 billion more for investment in infrastructure over the first three years of the plan than originally committed. Subject to maintenance of a sustainable overall budgetary position, I am committed to according high priority to infrastructure over the remainder of the plan. It will be important that this investment is targeted at projects which yield the highest rate of economic return, thereby limiting the negative economic impact of non-completion of the full infrastructure programme by the end of 2006.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_90">The budget day target for income tax in 2003 is €9,307 million. At the end of October, the Exchequer had received €6,863 million in income tax or 74% of the target for the year. In terms of the Revenue Commissioners' profile of tax revenue for 2003, revenue net receipts for income tax were some €106 million below what had been expected to be collected by Revenue in the first ten months of the year, due mainly to a shortfall in schedule D receipts – PAYE receipts are slightly above target. Certain other tax heads, including excise and VAT, are also currently performing below the Revenue collection targets while others, including stamp duty, are performing above target.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_91">I have previously indicated that a shortfall in tax revenue of up to €500 million may arise at year end. A lot of tax revenue has still to come in and my Department will continue to review the position regarding the expected shortfall in tax revenues in the period leading up to the budget.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2475">The Government is adamantly opposed to the use of the death penalty and accordingly seeks its uni versal abolition. We believe that its abolition contributes to the enhancement of human dignity and the progressive development of human rights. The Deputy will be aware of the efforts we have made in conjunction with our EU partners and in accordance with the common EU guidelines on the issue of the death penalty to seek its universal abolition. The EU has pressed for abolition and has also issued <i>démarches </i>on the use of the death penalty in many countries. In the recent past, <i>démarches </i>have been made in the US, according to the EU guidelines, at both federal and state levels on behalf of a number of individuals. The EU also raised the issue in its human rights troika meetings with the US.</p>
          <p eId="para_2476">The EU guidelines adopted in 1998 set out clearly the common EU position on the use of the death penalty. These guidelines now form the basis for Ireland's concerted interventions, along with other EU member states, in death penalty issues. The Government firmly believes that intervention at EU level is the most effective means of addressing this issue; in view of this I propose to raise this case with our EU partners.</p>
          <p eId="para_2477">The abolition of the death penalty is a political priority for Ireland and our EU partners. Ireland along with our EU partners will continue to engage in dialogue with the US authorities to seek abolition of the death penalty, and are seeking in the interim the introduction of moratoria at state level and the reintroduction of the <i>de facto</i> moratorium at federal level. Internationally we will continue our efforts, with our EU partners, to seek the universal abolition of the death penalty.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_94">The Cricklewood Homeless Concern Centre has been supported by the DÍON committee since at least 1989. However, building projects and the provision of accommodation are outside the DÍON criteria for funding, and the Cricklewood Homeless Concern Centre has not directly approached the DÍON committee to seek funding for this project.</summary>

First, the automated passport system is essential to meet future demands for passports in an efficient and effective manner and to comply with new international regulations for passports. Second, to maintain Ireland's image as a modern, technologically advanced country, including during our upcoming Presidency of the European Union, it is vital that a fast, reliable communications system, expected of a modern foreign ministry, is available to the Department. A programme for upgrading the IT infrastructure commenced at headquarters in 2003 with a view to ensuring that up-to-date information is available to the Minister and his officials speedily and effectively. The figure includes the cost for the phased deployment of the new infrastructure to the offices of the Department worldwide over the next few years.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_97">Third, the Department has 69 offices worldwide which receive and transmit information relating to all aspects of Ireland's representation, namely consular, political, economic, cultural and administrative business.

I understand this problem has arisen following the introduction of the Commission's new financial regulation which, we understand, prohibits the provision of direct grant funding to more than 200 such information points around Europe from January 2004, including four information points in Ireland – Cahirciveen Dublin, Dungarvan and Mullingar.</p>
          <p eId="para_2506">The European Commission has indicated that it is anxious to ensure that the existing network of information points in Ireland and other member states continues to operate and is seeking to resolve this funding problem. In the immediate term, the European Commission Representation in Ireland has indicated that it will continue to provide non-financial support and assistance to the four Irish information points. This assistance includes the continued provision of information materials, brochures, maps, EU documentation and CD roms etc., to the information points for distribution to the public. The Commission Representation will also continue to fund training costs for host institution staff employed in the information points. Most of this training takes place in Brussels.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_98">The Government attaches great importance to the communication of information about the European Union to the public and would be con cerned if the Commission's information points were no longer able to function. The Government will stay in touch with the European Commission about the matter over the coming weeks and hopes that a solution can be found to the problem which has arisen. The information points play an important role in providing information about the European Union to members of the public and business, locally and regionally, and the Government hopes that they can be sufficiently resourced to continue this task during the Irish Presidency.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2547">The Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts 1968 to 1992 provide that the means to be taken into account for the purpose of assessing eligibility under the scheme are those of the student, if any, and of the parents or guardians of the student.</p>
          <p eId="para_2548">The Acts make special provision for the assessment of means in the case of mature students. Under the terms of the higher education grants scheme, mature students are categorised as either independent mature students or mature students dependent on parents. An independent mature student is defined to mean a mature student who was not ordinarily resident at home with his or her parents from the October preceding their entry to an approved course. Independent mature students are assessed without reference to either their parents' income or address. The statutory definition of a mature student is a person of not less than 23 years of age who has reached that age on 1 January in the year of entry to an approved course.</p>
          <p eId="para_2549">Parental income must, therefore, be taken into account irrespective of the individual circumstances in cases where the student is not a mature student. The other student support schemes have similar provisions in relation to the means assessment of students.</p>

I have also made clear that I favour putting in place a multi-annual capital funding envelope for the next four to five years because I believe that the provision of such an envelope for the school building programme will enable my Department to provide greater clarity for all edu cation partners concerning the progress of projects within the programme.</p>

In the five years up to and including 2002 my Department has spent €1.248 billion on primary and post-primary school buildings. This is a very significant investment.</p>

          <p eId="para_2582">The funding arrangements for voluntary secondary schools reflect the sectoral division of our second level system and is structured mainly on the basis of capitation grants. There have been significant improvements in the level of funding for voluntary secondary schools. The standard <i>per capita</i> grant now amounts to €266.49 as against the rate of €224.74 that applied in 1997. For disadvantaged schools the increase has brought the <i>per capita</i> grant to over €300.</p>
          <p eId="para_2583">In addition, secondary schools have benefited under the school services support initiative. The initial grant of €25 per pupil that was introduced for second level schools in September 2000 was increased to €89 per pupil from September 2002 and was further increased by €10 per pupil from January last to €99 per pupil. In the case of voluntary secondary schools the grant was increased by a further €28 to €117 in September 2002 bringing the support services grant in the case of such schools to €127 per pupil from January last. This increase is in addition to the range of equalisation grants of up to €15,554 per school –€44.44 per pupil; per annum that have also been approved for voluntary secondary schools.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_104">For a secondary school with 500 pupils, this amounts to extra funding of up to €100,000 per annum and annual grants of €236,761 –€255,811 in the case of disadvantaged schools – towards  general expenses and support services. Schools are afforded considerable flexibility in the use of these resources to cater for the needs of their pupils. This is in general a preferable approach to putting in place grants for specific initiatives, including those to which the Deputies referred. I am committed to improving further the funding position of voluntary secondary schools in the light of available resources.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2595">I am aware of conditions at Blennerville national school. The position is that in 1999 the board of management applied to my Department for a new school. Following examination of the application it was agreed that accommodation should be provided for a six teacher school. A subsequent technical inspection of the existing school and site was carried out and a recommendation was made that a new school on a greenfield site should be provided. The Office of Public Works, which acts on behalf of my Department in respect of procurement of sites, was asked to investigate and report on suitable sites for the proposed new school. While a number of sites have been identified, investigations in this regard have yet to be completed.</p>
          <p eId="para_2596">The purchase of a site and advancement of the school's building project to architectural planning will depend on the budgetary provision for 2004 and subsequent years, the rate of progress of existing projects in architectural planning and the priority afforded to each project by reference to the published criteria for prioritising large-scale building projects. Funding of €48,000 towards temporary accommodation was provided to St. Brendan's national school under the 2003 capital programme and in 2002 my Department grant aided the purchase of two portable structures which had been rented at the school.</p>

          <p eId="para_2598">Under the terms of the development plan for the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, it is envisaged that there will ultimately be 11 educational psychologists providing a service in the north western region – Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim. The most recently available figures indicate that NEPS provides a service to 43% of schools covering 71% of pupils in the region. At present, there are six educational psychologists deployed in the region, of whom 2.5 psychologists, whole-time equivalent, are assigned to County Donegal.</p>
          <p eId="para_2599">At present, NEPS is not in a position to provide a service in Inishowen as it was not possible to fill the vacant post there from the most recent recruitment competition. Due to general staffing constraints, it is unlikely that there will be further recruitment to NEPS during the current school year. At present, schools that do not yet have a service from NEPS, may avail of the scheme for commissioning psychological assessments. Details of this scheme have been circulated to all schools and are also published on my Department's website.</p>

Exemption from the SCG examination is granted to teachers who have qualified as primary teachers in St. Mary's College, Belfast, having successfully completed the four years honours academic Irish course.

          <p eId="para_2631">I am aware of the National Youth Council of Ireland's campaign to have an additional €5 million allocated to the youth work sector in 2004. The funding for the youth affairs section of my Department for 2003 is €27.123 million which is a 5.5% increase over 2002. Provision for the youth sector increased by almost 60% from 1997 to 2003 which demonstrates the Government's commitment to supporting the work of the youth sector. I do not, therefore, accept that there is a serious financial shortfall in the sector as the cumulative increase since 1997 has been very significant and well ahead of inflation over that period of time.</p>

The question of additional funding for the youth sector will be dealt with in the 2004 Estimates process. Of its nature, the Youth Work Act 2001 has to be implemented on an incremental basis. The national youth work development plan is intended to cover a five-year period and was published earlier this year on the basis of its phased implementation as financial resources permit.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2704">I regret that my Department does not provide funding for sea angling festivals. I understand, however, that Fáilte Ireland provide funding for festival and cultural events. Fáilte Ireland recently invited funding applications and the closing date for receipt of applications is 28 November 2003. Application forms are available from Fáilte Ireland's website at <i>www.failteireland.ie</i> or from the cultural events officer, Tel 6024249.</p>
          <p eId="para_2705">With reference to your correspondence in relation to the demise of sea angling festivals nationally, and in particular the use of boats which have been certified by the United Kingdom, the position is that boats carrying up to 12 passengers for reward require a passenger boat licence issued by my Department. Boats which hold United Kingdom certificates are required to be surveyed by surveyors from my Department for compliance with Irish requirements. Each application is considered on a case by case basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_2706">The marine safety directorate of my Department has been in contact with the Maritime Coastguard Agency, MCA, surveyor in charge in Belfast about mutual recognition of certificates, as the United Kingdom does not accept our passenger boat licences and requires an inspection for issue of a United Kingdom certificate. There have also been discussions with MCA headquarters in Southampton about this issue. The conclusion reached from these discussions is that United Kingdom and Irish legislation requires national certificates.</p>

          <from>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. D. Ahern):</from>
          <p eId="para_2714">The development of our renewable and alternative energy resources as a clean supply of electricity and as an efficient source of heating is an important part of the Government's overall energy policy. The aim of the policy is to create a positive and supportive framework within which renewables can prosper and become a real contributor to both our future energy needs and to our obligations under the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
          <p eId="para_2715">Government policy in this area is espoused in the Green Paper on sustainable energy and the national climate change strategy. In the Green Paper a target of an additional 500 MW of renewables based electricity generating capacity has been set as a key priority to 2005. The Green Paper also provided the impetus for the establishment of the then Irish Energy Centre as Ireland's national energy authority. Sustainable Energy Ireland, SEI, was established in April 2002 as a semi-State body. SEI promotes and assists environmentally and economically sustainable production, supply and use of energy, in support of Government policy, across all sectors of the economy. In the renewable energy field specifically SEI has opened a research, development and demonstration programme for renewable energy technologies. The programme is open to a wide range of proposals, including policy studies, field research, feasibility studies and technology RD&amp;D.</p>
          <p eId="para_2716">The 500 MW target for renewables will be achieved in the main through projects successful under the alternative energy requirement, AER, programme and through direct sales to final customers under the liberalised electricity market. The programme is an open competitive process conducted in accordance with European Union procurement rules. As renewables energy sources cannot compete with conventional fossil fuel electricity generation, the additional cost incurred in the generation of electricity from these resources is passed on to the consumer as a public service obligation levy. Therefore the contracts offered under the AER programme are awarded to the lowest bids up to the available capacity on offer. By this route at the national level the levy charged to customers is minimised and at the EU level the state aid intensity is minimised which is consistent with general EU State aids rules.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_117">As regards climate change, Ireland has committed to limiting the increase in greenhouse gas emissions to no more than 13% above 1990 levels by 2008-12. My colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, is taking the lead role in the climate change agenda and in this regard published the national climate change strategy in  October 2000. This document provides a framework for the actions needed to ensure that Ireland meets its Kyoto target. The strategy is currently under review with updates expected on emission projections and measures needed.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_118">As the energy sector is a significant source of emissions, it will have to play its part in helping Ireland meet its commitments. Adopting a least cost approach to the Kyoto agenda is essential to minimise the impact on the competitiveness of the Irish economy. The adoption of the Kyoto flexible mechanisms such as emissions trading, joint implementation and the clean development mechanism will be an essential element of the energy sectors response to the need to limit emissions.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_119">I have already announced that my Department in conjunction with Sustainable Energy Ireland will conduct a fundamental review of the renewable energy sector. The review will focus on the key issues which I believe we now need to address particularly in the context of the EC directive on the promotion of electricity produced from renewable energy sources in the internal electricity market. The obligation addressed to Ireland in the directive is to increase the consumption of electricity from renewable energy sources to 13.2% of total electricity consumed nationally by 2010. I have already stated that this a minimum target which must be achieved.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_120">A consultation document to kick-start the review process will be published by me shortly. The consultation will provide an opportunity for the general public and those interested in the sector to promote regional and/or rural sustainability as a priority of the new programme.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2718">Since January 2002, the Department has been in consultation with Kilkenny County Council and the National Roads Authority concerning route options for the proposed N9-N10 roadway – Kildare to Waterford. The Department was anxious to ensure that none of the proposed options would interfere with the working of an existing dolomite mine or sterilise future reserves of the mineral in the vicinity of Maddoxtown, County Kilkenny. The Department wrote to Kilkenny County Council  on 29 August 2002 formally objecting to any road proposals that would threaten the viability of minerals extraction. At subsequent meetings, Kilkenny County Council was informed that the question of compensation in respect of lost royalties would arise where minerals were sterilised. In all, four meetings were held. The estimated figure for compensation is in the order of €2 million in a scenario where the lowest volume of minerals are sterilised. The figure could be considerably higher.</p>
          <p eId="para_2719">On the other issues raised, there is an existing mining lease held by a private operator that expires in December 2008. There are no proposals for extending this lease, and discussions have not taken place with the lessee for a further extension. The Department will consider applications for exploitation of the mineral reserves south of the existing mine from suitably qualified operators.</p>

          <p eId="para_2741">At present my Department operates a geographical information system for coastal and aerial survey work. Coastal work is just one of the applications running on the general GIS and the amount expended on the coastal application only is not available.</p>
          <p eId="para_2742">The amount expended on building up elements of the coastal GIS is as follows: beginning in 1999 a detailed survey of the coastal strip from Carnsore Point, County Wexford to Dalkey Head, County Dublin, was carried out using sophisticated laser based technology known as LIDAR at a cost of €110,000 and this survey has been installed on the GIS system; beginning in 2001 all aquaculture sites here were entered into the GIS and this was carried out in-house at an estimated staff cost of €50,000; this year my Department commissioned an oblique video aerial survey of the entire coastline at a cost of €260,000, results are currently being processed and it is expected that they will be installed on the GIS before the end of this year; and this year a detailed desk study, conducted by a combination of consultants and in-house resources, of the entire coastline was categorised using a number of erosion parameters and entered on the GIS, costing an estimated €35,000. In relation to coastal protection decision-making and forward planning, plans are under way to develop a national database and GIS with detailed information on each segment of coast, its vulnerability to erosion and flooding and the value of the assets at risk.</p>
          <p eId="para_2743">I am very pleased with developments to date. Introduction of geographic information systems has lead to greatly improved efficiencies and reduced work turnaround time significantly, particularly on aquaculture mapping. Geographical information systems are widely used throughout my Department. They are powerful tools in terms of collecting, collating, analysing and presenting spatial information. I intend for this capability to be developed in line with my Department's wider modernisation programme and the management information framework generally.</p>

          <p eId="para_2745">Safety standards for seagoing passenger and cargo vessels are developed and adopted at international level,  principally from the Safety Conventions of the International Maritime Organisation and from initiatives at European level. My Department participates in the relevant IMO and EU committees that develop new standards and legislation. It continually updates our maritime law to ensure that all the resulting EU directives and IMO safety conventions are fully implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_2746">Under Irish and international law all vessels trading into and out of Irish ports are required to carry appropriate certification to demonstrate compliance with the requisite international conventions and regulations applicable to ships of their size and type. All vessels are subject to surveys and inspections by their flag states and, under the EU port state control system, all vessels using Community ports are liable to inspections by any of the EU states they are visiting. The application of port state control ensures that at any given time a large number of ships operating within the area covered by the system have undergone an inspection by an EU port state control authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_2747">All Irish registered passenger and cargo vessels are inspected at least annually by my Department's marine surveyors.</p>
          <p eId="para_2748">In the case of Ireland's port state control obligations, following a redeployment of resources in the latter half of 2002 my Department achieved an improved inspection rate of 30% in 2002. This is above the 25% inspection rate requirement and improves the safety standards of ships using our ports. We have already achieved our 25% target for port state control this year and we are continuing to inspect foreign flag ships.</p>
          <p eId="para_2749">In addition, we carry out inspections under EU Directive 99/35 on foreign flag roll on-roll off passenger ferries operating into and out of our ports. These inspections include an initial scheduled inspection prior to a ro-ro passenger ship taking up a route and unscheduled inspections on these ro-ro passenger ships throughout the year. As part of our survey regime for Irish registered ro-ro passenger ships we carry out drills as part of the annual survey requirement.</p>
          <p eId="para_2750">The monitoring of ships, by regular inspections, is proving to be an effective measure in encouraging full compliance with international safety standards. It also ensures that the vast majority of vessels operating into and out of Irish ports comply with those standards.</p>

          <p eId="para_2764">Overall responsibility for marine pollution prevention, preparedness, response and management is assigned to the Irish Coastguard. This includes responsibility for supervising the planning and implementation by local and harbour authorities of arrangements for the protection of coastal amenity, fishery and wildlife areas, the removal of oil from the coastline and in the event of a major pollution incident, the direction and co-ordination of the on-shore response.</p>
          <p eId="para_2765">Offshore response to oil pollution incidents is mainly confined to monitoring, oil recovery or dispersant spraying.</p>
          <p eId="para_2766">The Coastguard maintains national stockpiles of pollution response equipment at Killybegs, Castletownbere and Dublin. These stockpiles include offshore booms and skimmers. The Coastguard also has a contract with a commercial company to provide additional equipment on-site within guaranteed timeframes in the event of a serious incident. This contract also provides for aerial dispersant spraying.</p>
          <p eId="para_2767">No country has sufficient State equipment to respond to every pollution emergency. Under the Bonn Agreement between north European countries, to which Ireland has been invited to accede, mutual support in marine pollution incidents is available, including access to a purpose built oil recovery vessel so successfully utilised in the recent <i>Prestige</i> incident. Ireland is also a member of the EU pollution management committee that can provide experts and also facilitate supports on request.</p>
          <p eId="para_2768">The Sea Pollution (Amendment) Act 1999 provides for harbour and port authorities, oil handling facilities and maritime local authorities to prepare pollution incident response plans to the Coastguard for approval. These contingency plans are part of the overall national response framework. Plan templates have been provided to the parties concerned and plans are being finalised. The Coastguard is also making arrangements for the provision of aerial surveillance facilities from 2004 onwards for the detection of oil spills and other harmful substances. It also supports research into the use of satellite technology to identify oil spills.</p>

          <p eId="para_2770">I am very conscious of our extensive and vulnerable coastline. I am also aware of the potential for marine and environmental damage caused by pollution from oil and other hazardous substances.</p>
          <p eId="para_2771">Ireland plays a full role in the new European Maritime Safety Agency which held its first meeting in December 2002. One of its key objectives is to support member states in identifying ships that have the potential to cause pollution incidents and prevent them operating in EU waters.</p>
          <p eId="para_2772">I also announced that I will bring forward proposals to Government shortly for the establishment of a new independent agency with responsibility for all marine safety issues. The agency will have specific responsibility for pollution prevention and response. This measure will significantly strengthen Ireland's ability to prevent and deal with maritime disasters around our coastline in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_2773">I have consistently supported measures to improve maritime safety and the protection of the marine environment including a number of key initiatives at EU level aimed at preventing maritime disasters like the <i>Prestige</i> incident off the coast of Spain in November 2002 and the <i>Erika</i> incident off France in 1999.</p>
          <p eId="para_2774">Earlier this year the EU Council of Ministers agreed to further accelerate the phasing out of single hull tankers from EU waters and to introduce a ban on the carriage of heavy grades of fuel oil in single hull tankers. This regulation came into force on 21 October. EU member states have requested the International Maritime Organisation to introduce similar arrangements to be applied internationally. At present a proposal by the Commission concerning sanctions for offences involving pollution of the marine environment is under consideration at EU official working group level.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_123">Following thePrestige incident, Ireland along with Belgium, France, Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom decided earlier this year to present the IMO with a joint request to designate certain maritime areas as a particularly sensitive sea area to strengthen its protection of particularly vulnerable areas. The PSSA request was  considered by the Marine Environment Protection Committee in July. MEPC agreed in principle to the request for designation and referred the matter to an expert navigation committee for examination. This committee is expected to report to MEPC next year.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_124">Legislation is continually under review at both EU and international level. Recently I enacted the Oil Pollution of the Sea (Civil Liability and Compensation) (Amendment) Act 2003 which updates our legislation on oil pollution compensation. I also have two further Bills before the Oireachtas that have been prepared to give effect to the terms of various international instruments on pollution prevention, liability and compensation for damage in connection with the carriage of hazardous and noxious substances by sea.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_125">Last week I met Mme. de Palacio, EC Commissioner during her visit to Ireland. She informed me that the Commission expects to propose a thirdErika package of measures in May 2004. These measures will cover a wide range of issues including living and working conditions of seafarers, update of the Port State Control Directive, update of the Directive on Maritime Transport Management and Information System, regulation on the compliance with IMO flag state, regulation on the application of the Athens Protocol – passenger liability for all traffic, national and international – and a directive on maritime accident investigation</summary>

          <p eId="para_2785">One exploration well at Dooish was completed this year and one at Cong is being drilled. Last year Enterprise Energy Ireland drilled an exploration well at Dooish, off the Donegal coast and a hydrocarbon accumulation was discovered. The well was re-entered and deepened this summer. On 11 May drilling commenced and the well was plugged after a substantial gas condensate column was confirmed. On 30 July the rig was moved off-site. Both my Department and Shell-EEI will continue to analyse the well results and integrate them with other data from the area. Further technical work on the prospect will be required before the size of the gas condensate accumulation and commercial viability can be accurately assessed. This well is only the second to be drilled in the Rockall Basin. It is extremely encouraging to make a significant discovery at the site. My Department has emphasised the positive implications of its discovery for prospecting in the area.</p>
          <p eId="para_2786">At present the Cong exploration well is being drilled in the Erris Basin, approximately 60 km off the Mayo coast and some 20 km north-east of the Corrib gas field. Statoil began drilling the well on 5 August.</p>
          <p eId="para_2787">In Ireland this year three seismic surveys have been carried out off the west coast. One of them was abandoned following damage to equipment. The results of the surveys are not yet available due to the highly technical processing required for this type of data.</p>

          <p eId="para_2790">The discarding of rejected fish has become an increasing problem in recent years and is recognised as such by the fishing industry. It is a particular problem because the majority of fish discarded are undersized and immature and thus their spawning potential is lost.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_129">While Community legislation requires the discarding of fish in certain circumstances, discards  also occur for economic reasons such as the low commercial value of species or of individual fish. It is a complex problem, particularly in mixed fisheries such as those which prevail in Irish waters and one that is unlikely to be solved by piecemeal measures.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_130">The need for a co-ordinated approach has been recognised. Last April the Agriculture and Fisheries Council approved a community action plan to reduce discards. A number of pilot projects will be undertaken to examine the feasibility of a number of possible solutions. These include reviews of the structure of fishing gears, minimum landing sizes by catch quotas, and the departure from fishing grounds where high rates of discarding occurs.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_131">Ireland has been to the forefront in pressing for action on this issue and I support the community action plan. I will continue to press for early progress on this issue and I am confident that, with sufficient impetus, significant improvements can be achieved in this area.</summary>

        <summary eId="sum_142">A grant of €2,539,476 was allocated to Letterkenny Town Council under the 2000 sports  capital programme, administered by my Department, towards the provision of a sports centre in the town. To date €378,910 of this grant has been paid in respect of enabling works at the site.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_143">Letterkenny Town Council has also applied to my Department for funding towards the replacement of a swimming pool in Letterkenny to be part of the overall sports complex. Under the programme, grants of up to a maximum of €3.8 million are available towards either the refurbishment of existing pools or the provision of new pools, subject in both cases to the total grant not exceeding 80% of the eligible cost of the project or, in the case of projects located in designated disadvantaged areas, 90% of the eligible cost. Support is available towards the cost of the swimming pool, toddler pool, sauna and steam room.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_144">In relation to the Letterkenny swimming pool application, the situation is that the preliminary report has been approved and, as provided for under the terms of the programme, the contract documents are now being assessed by my Department's technical advisers, the Office of Public Works.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_145">My Department is endeavouring to administer the available grants in a manner which will ensure that the sport and leisure centre can be progressed on an integrated basis. In that regard, my Department is awaiting from Letterkenny Town Council updated details of its financial package for the completion of this overall development, upon receipt of which the project will be further considered.</summary>

        <summary eId="sum_146">As the Deputy is aware, with the substantial increase in the number of health board high sup port and special care places for children who need more intensive intervention and with the development of other services, this practice by the High Court has greatly diminished in recent years and has almost been eliminated.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_147">There are more than 120 high support and special care places compared to 17 in 1996. These include a five place regional special care unit for boys in the Mid-Western Health Board area which was completed recently and is now in a position to accept placements. During this period approximately €40 million in capital funding has been made available through the health boards to put in place these additional high support and special care places. In addition, intensive community based services have been put in place to provide for the needs of this group of children, for example, the youth advocacy pilot projects in the Northern Area Health Board and the Western Health Board which commenced last year.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_148">While High Court orders of detention are currently required by health boards to detain non-offending children with challenging behaviour in special care units Parts 2, 3 and 11 of the Children Act, 2001 provide a statutory scheme for the placement of such children in special care units. Such placements under the Act will be on foot of a special care order made by the District Court in appropriate circumstances, as a last resort and for as short a period of time as possible. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the order commencing Part 11 of the Children Act, 2001, which places the special residential services board on a statutory footing, came into effect on 7 November 2003. This in turn should allow for the introduction of Parts 2 and 3 of the Children Act, 2001 by early next year.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_149">It is envisaged that, taken together, these measures will obviate the need for applications to be made to the High Court for orders for the detention of non-offending children in need of special care or protection.</summary>

I am satisfied with the progress being made in relation to these projects. As some of these initiatives are at procurement stage, the project costs are estimated. In addition, my Department, in conjunction with the Department of Social and Family Affairs, is undertaking a major modernisation of the civil registration service. This programme includes a significant ICT component to enable electronic registration of life events, certificate production and information sharing. The system has come into operation in recent months and is already delivering significant benefits to the public. ICT investment in this system to date by my Department has been €890,000.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_155">In overall terms the analysis indicated a significant improvement in response times in relation to emergency calls. The improvement in response times was mainly due to progress in relation to two person crewing arrangements, decreased reliance on withdrawal of nurses from hospital wards, advances in command and control arrangements, enhanced professionalism of ambulance staff, advances in EMT training, higher specifications and better equipped ambulance fleet</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_156">In addition, it is widely accepted that the discontinuation of on-call arrangements and standardisation of work practices and procedures  throughout all regions will further improve response times. My Department is pursuing these objectives in conjunction with the Health Boards Executive, HeBE, and the Health Boards Authority.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_157">While the emergency ambulance service needs to be in a position to meet the demands placed upon it, it is also important to ensure that emergency medical technicians are in a position to provide efficient and effective intervention which may not only determine the survival of the patient but also the extent and length of hospital care required and the quality of life after discharge. In this regard the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council, PHECC, which was established in 2000 and whose primary function is to develop appropriate standards in pre-hospital emergency care, has submitted proposals to my Department in relation to the introduction of the emergency medical technician – advanced, EMT-A, programme to the ambulance service. I was pleased to announce policy approval earlier this year to this initiative and the development of the programme is now being progressed by my Department.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_158">In line with its remit, the PHECC is also undertaking a number of research and development initiatives on response times standards, based on clinical need, in the Irish pre-hospital emergency care setting. Included are the development of a national electronic patient clinical record keeping and information system, spatial analysis research to identify where access to appropriate and timely pre-hospital emergency care may be an issue because of geographic location, the purpose of which will help to facilitate the prioritisation of the implementation of, for example, first responder schemes, and research on the international evidence on dispatch systems and their use for prioritising resources according to clinical need. The outcomes of these research and development initiatives will inform the further development of ambulance response times standards into the future.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_159">I assure the Deputy that policy initiatives aimed at improving key aspects of the emergency medical service will continue to be pursued by my Department.</summary>

I would therefore be happy to urge insurers, when looking at revisions in their plans or their promotional activities, to give every consideration to how they can contribute to a reduction in the prevalence of smoking among their customers.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_169">I am pleased to advise the Deputy that I have taken a number of measures to improve orthodontic services on a national basis.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_170">The grade of specialist in orthodontics has been created in the health board orthodontic service. This year, my Department and the health boards are funding 13 dentists from various health boards for specialist in orthodontics qualifications at training programmes in Ireland and at three separate universities in the United Kingdom. These 13 trainees for the public orthodontic service are additional to the six dentists who commenced their training in 2001. Thus there is an aggregate of 19 public service dentists currently in training for specialist in orthodontics qualifications. These measures will complement the other structural changes being introduced into the orthodontic service, including the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_171">Furthermore, the commitment of the Department to training development is manifested in the funding provided to both the training of specialist clinical staff and the recruitment of a professor in orthodontics for the Cork Dental School. This appointment at the school will facilitate the development of an approved training programme leading to specialist qualification in orthodontics. The chief executive officer of the Southern Health Board has reported that the professor will  take up duty in December next. In recognition of the importance of this post at Cork Dental School my Department has given approval in principle to a proposal from the school to further substantially improve the training facilities there for orthodontics. This project should see the construction of a large orthodontic unit and support facilities; it will ultimately support an enhanced teaching and treatment service to the wider region under the leadership of the professor of orthodontics.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_172">Orthodontic initiative funding of €4.698 million was provided to the health boards-authority in 2001 and this has enabled health boards to recruit additional staff, engage the services of private specialist orthodontic practitioners to treat patients and build additional orthodontic facilities.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_173">In June 2002, my Department provided additional funding of €5 million from the treatment purchase fund to health boards specifically for the purchase of orthodontic treatment. This funding is enabling boards to provide both additional sessions for existing staff and purchase treatment from private specialist orthodontic practitioners.</summary>

          <p eId="para_3373">Garda clearance arrangements currently apply in respect of candidates for employment in the health services where they would have access to children and vulnerable individuals. This includes services in respect of children and vulnerable adults provided by external agencies but funded by the health boards.</p>
          <p eId="para_3374">My colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has informed me that following a review of Garda vetting arrangements, a central vetting unit was established in January 2002 to deal with the then known demand for vetting. It was envisaged that when the central vetting unit became fully operational and all its backlogs were cleared that a phased extension of Garda clearance arrangements to other groups would take place. To this end, a working group was established to examine the issue, taking account of all aspects of the vetting of persons coming in contact with children and vulnerable persons be they full-time, part-time, voluntary or community workers or students on placement. The Department of Health and Children is participating in the working group with the Garda Siochána, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Department of Education and Science and the Office of the Attorney General. The work of the group is ongoing.</p>
          <p eId="para_3375">It is worth stressing that, irrespective of whatever clearance arrangements are in place, it will continue to be necessary to bear in mind that criminal record checks, while being capable in appropriate circumstances of making a significant contribution to ensuring that unsuitable persons do not secure positions of trust, are not the sole answer to ensuring applicants' suitability for jobs particularly where children or other vulnerable persons could be open to abuse.</p>
          <p eId="para_3376">There will continue to be a particular onus of care on employers-organisations to maintain good employment practice both during the recruitment stage, for example, good interviewing practice, checking references and also when it comes to ensuring adequate supervision arrangements post-recruitment.</p>
          <p eId="para_3377">Children First: national guidelines for the protection and welfare of children recognises the need to support community and voluntary groups develop best practice in their dealings with children. A document entitled Our Duty to Care was published in April 2002. It is based on Children First and on Northern Ireland's Our Duty To Care document and is available to all groups. Essentially it promotes good practice and procedures for organisations dealing with children and consists of a booklet and fact sheets covering areas such as safe recruitment practice, developing safe management practices and policies and raising awareness of child abuse among volunteers and staff. It also provides advice on how to report concerns to the health boards.</p>

          <p eId="para_3487">The national car testing service has been engaged on a sole contractor basis to provide and operate an integrated national network of dedicated test centres. This method of procuring the service was decided by the Government in 1996 from a range of options, among which could have been the operation of the service through appointed local garages. The present contract for roadworthiness testing of cars excludes, for its duration, the deployment of other procurement arrangements.</p>

          <p eId="para_3561">I am fully aware of the west-on-track campaign to reopen the Sligo-Limerick railway, which forms part of the proposed western rail corridor, WRC. The WRC was one of a number of railway proposals that was evaluated in the strategic rail review, SRR, which I published earlier this year. The purpose of the SRR was to provide the Government with a policy framework for the  future development of the rail passenger and rail freight sectors in Ireland. While it was noted in the SRR that this particular scheme complements the objectives of the national spatial strategy, it did not perform well in the cost/benefit and multi-criteria analyses carried out in the course of the review and so it was not included by the consultants in the recommended investment strategy of the SRR. One of the conclusions of the SRR is that consideration of new railway proposals, such as the western rail corridor, would need to be preceded by the adoption by local and regional authorities of appropriate and complementary land use, settlement and economic strategies, that would provide the economic, social and commercial rationale for the project before it could proceed. Recognising that the western rail corridor fits in well with the aims of the national spatial strategy I have provided the relevant regional authorities in the west with consultancy advice to ensure that they are fully aware of the necessary prerequisites that would need to be put in place before a detailed feasibility study could be commissioned by Irish Rail on the western rail corridor. In September last, officials from my Department together with the SRR consultants organised a seminar in Athlone to outline to officials of the border, west, mid-west and south-west regional authorities, the context in which the western rail corridor was considered within the overall strategic rail review. The seminar also dealt with the land use and settlement issues that would be critical to such a proposal. The seminar was very timely as all eight regional authorities are currently in the process of drawing up regional planning guidelines for their regions as part of the implementation of the national spatial strategy. The seminar was therefore an opportunity to discuss the WRC proposal in the context of the development of these guidelines. The seminar has been followed by direct one-to-one discussions on these issues between the consultants and each of the regional authorities involved and the western development commission. Iarnród Éireann is well aware of my position with regard to planning for new rail projects in Ireland.</p>

      <b>Mr. Rabbitte</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Transport</b>
      if, in view of the underspend on the programme for economic and social infrastructure in respect of the BMW region, he has plans in respect of the moneys concerned; his views on whether the reopening of the western corridor would be an appropriate investment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <p eId="para_3563">Under the economic and social infrastructure operational programme the total expenditure in the BMW region over the period 2000-02 was €42.365 billion or approximately 90% of that forecast in the operational programme. The shortfall was mainly accounted for by the lower expenditure than that forecast for national roads and public transport. In relation to national roads, nine pro jects in the BMW region are currently at tender stage and due to start construction in the coming months. As regards public transport, the programme for continuous welding of rail track, the rail network track and signalling project, the redevelopment of Heuston Station and the Iarnród Éireann rolling stock programme when completed will provide higher quality and more frequent rail services to the midlands and west. In addition, the bus capacity provided by Bus Éireann and private operators in the region has increased significantly in recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_3564">My Department is reviewing the situation of public transport expenditure in the region in the light of the conclusions of the ESIOP mid-term evaluation and is in discussions with CIE about investment plans for the remaining lifetime of the NDP.</p>
          <p eId="para_3565">The western rail corridor was one of a number of schemes that was evaluated in the strategic rail review, published earlier this year, but it did not perform well in the cost benefit analysis in the review and therefore was not included by the consultants in the recommended investment strategy.

          <p eId="para_3566">While it is entirely a matter for the regional authorities to consider the potential for rail developments, such as the western rail corridor, in their upcoming planning guidelines, I would stress that such proposals must be supported by land use and settlement strategies that would underpin and support the rail proposals if they are to have any chance of success.</p>

      the level of funding allocated to each county in the BMW region by his Department under the various operational programmes since the establishment of the BMW regional assembly; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

        <speech by="#SeamusBrennan" as="#Minister_for_Transport" eId="spk_1014">
          <from>Minister for Transport (Mr. Brennan):</from>
          <p eId="para_3697">The public transport priority in the economic and social infrastructure programme of the National Development Plan 2000-2006 deals with investment in mainline rail track renewals and upgrades under the railway safety plan, and with other improvements in public transport services. The public transport priority is being implemented not on a county-by-county basis, but through two measures, the DTI public transport and traffic management measure and the national public transport services measure.  Investment is therefore not allocated on a county-by-county basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_3698">The level of expenditure over the past five years on rail routes serving the BMW region is €190 million. In addition, Irish Rail is in the process of conducting a study of all railway stations in the BMW regions to allow for decisions on further investment. This report is expected shortly. It is acknowledged in the strategic rail review, published last February, that continued investment will be needed to further enhance rail services in the region.</p>
          <p eId="para_3699">The BMW region has already benefited greatly from the investment in public transport under the current national development plan. In the past few years, track renewal has been almost completed on the railway lines serving the BMW region, that is, to Galway, Westport-Ballina and Sligo. Once the Ballina route has been completed by the end of 2003, all railway lines serving the BMW will have continuously welded rail over their entire route. This work alone has allowed Irish Rail to reduce journey times on trains to the BMW regions by up to 20 minutes. Further reductions are planned in the future with the introduction of newer more modern rolling stock and further planned work on signalling systems on these routes.</p>
          <p eId="para_3700">In addition to track renewal, considerable investment has also been made in bridges, fencing and level crossing upgrading. Resignalling of the Galway line was completed in June 2003. This will go towards providing a safer, more reliable service. Savings in journey times of over 20 minutes have already been achieved on the service with a reduction of a further ten minutes when all infrastructural works are carried out on the line. Platform upgrading work is under way at a number of stations and the programme will continue next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_3701">The BMW region will also benefit from projects undertaken in the eastern region such as the Heuston Station project. This project will enable Heuston Station to handle trains more efficiently than before and has already been instrumental in allowing the speeding up of journey times to and from the BMW region. Realignment and resignalling on the routes into Heuston will also allow for speedier more efficient handling of trains from all regions of the country. In addition to investment in railway infrastructure a total of €4.25 million will have been spent on bus infrastructure and accessibility projects in the BMW region in 2002 and 2003 alone. These projects include work on bus stations in Athlone, Sligo and Monaghan. New low-floor buses have been provided for Galway and Sligo.</p>
          <p eId="para_3702">Allocations to each of the regional airports since the establishment of the BMW Regional Assembly are as follows: Knock Airport, €2,400,100; Galway Airport, €2,004,100; Donegal Airport, €979,300 and Sligo Airport, €890,500. The regional airport companies have drawn down approximately 60% of this funding to date.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_181">However I am informed that grant allocations made by the NRA to local authorities in the BMW region are as follows: Donegal €67.18 million, Sligo €40.58 million, Leitrim €18.76 million, Cavan €30.26 million, Monaghan €42.86 million, Louth €95.48 million, Laois €32.18 million, Longford €14.89 million, Offaly €13.35 million, Westmeath €122.73 million, Galway (city) €5.09 million, Galway (county) €67.20 million, Mayo €95.13 million and Roscommon €70.02 million.

          <p eId="para_3708">I propose to take Questions Nos. 420 and 422 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_3709">Penalty points are at present applied to speeding, driving without insurance and non-wearing of seat belts offences. Penalty points are being applied to the driving licence records of those convicted of speeding, seat belt wearing and insurance offences, and of those who pay a fixed charge to the Garda, in the case of speeding and seat belt wearing offences, in order to prevent the instigation of court proceedings.</p>
          <p eId="para_3710">The First Schedule to the Road Traffic Act 2002 outlines the full list of offences to which penalty points will apply, when the system is fully operational. This list includes the application of penalty points to the offence of driving a vehicle with a 50 mph speed limit on the outside traffic lane of carriageway of a motorway. The full application of the penalty point system will be achieved when the relevant IT systems being developed by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda are completed.</p>
          <p eId="para_3711">The recording of convictions for offences is a matter for the Courts Service. In addition, the compilation of data relating to payments of fixed charges where the relevant notices are issued by the Garda Síochána is a matter for that force. Both organisations transfer the appropriate data to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to facilitate its entry into the national driver file which is the responsibility of that Department. It is understood from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government that 72,678 penalty point notices have issued as at 3 November 2003</p>

          <p eId="para_3746">Irish driving licence regulations are required to operate within the framework of a harmonised EU system. The criteria essential for recognition of licences from other countries are testing and licensing regimes which meet the requirements of the EU Directive and reciprocal recognition of Irish licences. A person who holds a driving licence issued by a member state of the European Union or of the European Economic Area – includes Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway – is  permitted to drive in Ireland for so long as that licence remains valid. Where such a person has taken up normal residence in Ireland, he or she may exchange their licence for an Irish driving licence without taking a driving test.</p>

Under these regulations, persons holding a valid driving licence from a recognised state may exchange their licence for an Irish driving licence where they take up residence here, without the need for a driving test. In all other cases, a person taking up normal residence in Ireland must undergo the driver theory test, obtain a provisional licence and pass the driving test in order to obtain a driving licence.</p>

          <p eId="para_3782">The European Communities (Units of Measurement) (Amendment) Regulations that were made by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment in 2002 permit the use of imperial units on road signs for speed and measurement until 31 December 2004. A working group carried out a review of speed limits this year against the backdrop of the proposed metrication of speed limits by the end of 2004. The group presented its report to me last month. The report contains recommendations that a revised speed limit structure be introduced and recommendations in relation to metric signage. I am examining the report in detail and I propose to make final decisions on the recommendation shortly.</p>
          <p eId="para_3783">I have asked the group to continue its work for the purpose of advising on the implementation of the metrication programme. The introduction of the revised speed limit structure recommended by the group will require the introduction of new primary and secondary legislation and the precise implementation date must take account of the timescale for processing of the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_3784">All new cars sold in the European Union must have whole vehicle type approval, WVTA. WVTA requires cars to meet the requirements set out in a series of separate type approval directives including Directive 75/443/EEC as amended by Directive 97/39/EC relating to the reverse and speedometer equipment of motor vehicles. This directive provides, <i>inter alia,</i> that for type-approval purposes, a speedometer shall display speed in metric values. However, member states where imperial units of measurement are used are permitted under the directive to require that speedometers display speed both in metric and imperial values until such time as metric units of measure are mandatory. All new cars imported into Ireland at present therefore display both metric and imperial units of measurement but as indicated above when the changeover to metric units is implemented by end 2004 all new cars must display metric units only.</p>
          <p eId="para_3785">The report on the review of speed limits was published on my Department's website in early October and copies were issued to the Society of the Irish Motoring Industry, SIMI, and other interested bodies. My Department will be consulting further in relation to the implementation of the changeover to metric units.</p>

          <p eId="para_3797">In its deliberations, the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities considered the recognition of sign languages. The commission received a broad range of submissions from different disability organisations and from individuals, including proposals for the recognition of Irish sign language as the language of deaf citizens and for education to be provided to deaf children through Irish sign language. Arising from its deliberations, the commission made 402 separate recommendations, including proposals relating to sign language. The commission did not recommend Irish sign language as an official language or specify a particular form of sign language to be used – two forms of sign language are commonly in use in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_3798">Recognising sign language is a matter for a number of Ministers and the matter is being actively pursued by them. I understand that the Education Act 1998 has made provision for support services in respect of students learning through Irish sign language or any other sign language, including interpreting services. Further, I also understand that Comhairle, which operates under the aegis of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs has provided funding to Irish Sign Link to provide sign language interpretation services. The two official languages of the State are set down in Article 8 of the Constitution as Irish and English. The Constitutional Review Group which reported in 1996 did not advocate the addition of any further languages. There are no proposals either in the Report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities or in my Department to give recognition to any other language as an official language.</p>

          <p eId="para_3809">My Department does not have statistics of the number of immigrant parents of Irish born children. However, of those who applied to my Department for residency on the basis of parentage of an Irish born children,  10,584 were granted residency between 1996 and 23 January 2003. There are a further 11,493 such cases on hand.</p>
          <p eId="para_3810">Following the decision of the Supreme Court on 23 January 2003 in the cases of L &amp; O, which held that no automatic residency rights obtain in respect of non-national parents of Irish born children, the Government decided that the separate procedure which had then existed to enable persons to apply to reside in the State on the sole basis of parentage of an Irish born child would not apply to cases which were outstanding on 19 February 2003 – that is, cases where applications were lodged but where no decision had been made.</p>
          <p eId="para_3811">In relation to outstanding claims to reside in the State on the basis of parentage of an Irish born child and future claims for leave to remain in the State from the non-national parents of Irish born children the Government decided that every such case would be examined and decided individually. In respect of every person, including a parent of Irish born children, who has no legal entitlement to remain in the State, a letter issues under the terms of section 3(3) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, informing him or her of the Minister's intention to deport. The person is allowed 15 days in which to opt for one of the following: make representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he or she should not be deported, that is, be allowed to remain temporarily in the State; leave the State before an order is made or consent to the making of a deportation order.</p>
          <p eId="para_3812">Where a person does not consent to a deportation order or does not leave the State voluntarily, the Minister is required to take a number of factors which are specified in section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, into account in determining whether or not a deportation order should be made. These factors include considerations relating to the common good, the person's individual family and domestic circumstances and humanitarian considerations. In the case of a parent of Irish born child, particular regard is given to the Supreme Court judgment in the L&amp;O case and the subsequent judgments in this area. The Minister is also required to consider the prohibition on refoulement which is contained in section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 as amended.</p>

          <p eId="para_3864">I propose to take Questions Nos. 445, 461, 462 and 477 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_3865">Following a review of Garda vetting arrangements, a central vetting unit was established in January 2002 to deal with the then known demand for vetting. The unit currently processes approximately 100,000 vetting requests per annum in respect of, <i>inter alia,</i> prospective employees of health boards entering full-time employment who would have substantial unsupervised access to children or vulnerable persons. When the central vetting unit became fully operational and all its backlogs were cleared, it was envisaged that a phased extension of the vetting arrangements to other groups would take place.</p>
          <p eId="para_3866">To this end, a working group was established to examine the issue, taking account of all aspects of the vetting of persons coming in contact with children and vulnerable persons, be they full-time, part-time, voluntary or community workers or students on placements, including the scenarios envisaged by the Deputies.</p>
          <p eId="para_3867">The working group comprises representatives of the Garda Síochána, my Department, the Office of the Attorney General and the Departments of Health and Children and Education and Science. It has met on five occasions to date.</p>
          <p eId="para_3868">There is no current commitment to introduce legislation in the area of vetting. However, I understand that the working group is examining the possible role of statutory provisions in vetting arrangements generally, and I will give full consideration to any recommendations in this regard. The work of the group is ongoing at present, and I would hope to receive the report of its deliberations in the coming weeks.</p>

          <p eId="para_3874">No level of illegal drug consumption in a prison setting is acceptable to me or to the prison authorities. It is extremely difficult, however, to quantify the precise level of illegal drugs consumed by prisoners while in custody, particularly given the extremely covert nature of illicit drug taking in a custodial setting. However, an independent study by the Health Research Board Drug Use Among Prisoners: An Exploratory Study, which was published in 2001 found that once imprisoned, those who continued to engage in illicit drug use greatly reduced the quantity of drugs they used, and the frequency with which they used them, when compared to their drug use in the community. This study focused on the Mountjoy Prison complex and involved anonymous and confidential interviews with prisoners who were long-term drug abusers. The study reported that it was felt that there was a perception among the general public that drugs were extensively available within the prison. Respondents argued that this was not the case. In the respondents experience, while drugs were available in the prison, the quantity was significantly lower than assumed by the public.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_189">There is, furthermore, no reliable evidence to suggest that the use of illegal drugs in prisons is on the increase. On the contrary, there are indications that there has been something of a decrease  in the use of illegal drugs in prison in recent times. The introduction of the methadone maintenance programme in a number of our prisons in recent years has resulted in a significant number of offenders with long drug histories, who would have been on report in the past for using illegal drugs in the prison environment, now being on a stable programme for which they must supply at least two clean urine samples per week. The Governor of Mountjoy Prison and senior members of his management team have also reported that there has been a reduction in the number of prisoners appearing at disciplinary hearings, having been found in the possession of drugs or drugs paraphernalia. The new visiting arrangements in the prison and the methadone maintenance programme referred to above, appear to be among the reasons behind this decrease. The remark by the Prisons Director General quoted by theSunday Times was in reference to these positive developments.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_190">Finally, I wish to reiterate that it is the intention of both myself and the Irish Prison Service, in line with the commitments in An Agreed Programme for Government, to take all necessary measures to eliminate drug misuse among prisoners.</summary>

On the visa application form, the applicant's uncle was named as his reference in the State. However, no details of his uncle's status in the State was submitted with the visa application.

          <p eId="para_4008">The Government is concerned at the abuse of Irish citizenship law by persons with no connection to the State arriving in Ireland with the sole objective of giving birth to a child who will, as a result of being born in Ireland, be entitled to Irish citizenship. The Supreme Court judgment of 23 January 2003 in the cases of L&amp;O brought clarity to the situation of those non-national parents of a child born in Ireland who sought to establish a basis for residence in the State solely on the basis of their parentage of such a child. On 17 July 2003, the Government's policy on the handling of claims for leave to remain in the State from the parents of such children was announced. I am continuing to monitor the situation in regard to this issue including the question as to whether constitutional and legislative change may be necessary. Ireland is the only member state of the European Union which grants citizenship to a child based solely on its birth on the national territory. In all other member states, the citizenship of a child is dependent on the citizenship of the parents and-or the status and duration of residence in the member state concerned.</p>

          <p eId="para_4010">Building on the commitments in An Agreed Programme for Government, the Governments approach to the issue of asylum is based on the achievement of a number of key objectives, namely: ensuring that the State continues to meet its obligations under the 1951  Geneva Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and its related 1967 Protocol and with this in mind, that persons genuinely in need of refugee protection receive that protection as quickly as possible; dealing with the high number of unfounded asylum applications received as speedily as possible – in the region of 90% of asylum applications are rejected after consideration by two independent determination bodies; increasing the number of voluntary returns of failed asylum applicants on the basis, for example, of programmes operated in co-operation with the International Organisation For Migration, IOM; ensuring that persons who do not qualify for refugee status and who are not eligible to remain in the State on some other grounds, and who do not avail of a voluntary return option, are returned to their country of origin as quickly as possible. As the UNHCR points out, returns of failed asylum seekers in such circumstances to their countries of origin is important in order to protect the integrity of the institution of asylum and, of course, to counter misuse of the asylum process.</p>
          <p eId="para_4011">To achieve these objectives a multi-pillared approach continues to be taken including speeding up processing times for asylum applications and increasing the number of cases being processed on the basis of the allocation of substantial additional resources to the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, ORAC, and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, RAT. The result of the strengthening of these bodies has been, <i>inter alia,</i> that processing continues to move strongly, with the number of cases over six months old in the ORAC and RAT at the end of October 2003 in the region of 2600, the vast majority of which are at an advanced stage of processing.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_197">I have also introduced substantial amendments to the Refugee Act 1996 in the Immigration Act 2003 which came into effect on 15 September 2003 to streamline the asylum process. Included among these amendments is provision for prioritisation of certain categories of asylum application, for example, by country of origin of applicants, date of application, grounds of application, the likelihood that applications are well founded or whether applications do not show on their face grounds for the contention that the applicant is a refugee, and based on ministerial directions to the ORAC and RAT for this purpose; designation of states as safe countries of origin as a result of which nationals from states so designated are presumed not to be refugees but may rebut that presumption at interview. I have by regulation made on 15 September 2003 designated 12 states as safe countries of origin namely, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia. Designation of states as safe third countries for the purpose of determining the state responsible for processing an asylum application with appeals in such cases having non-suspensive effect. In Dublin Convention cases,  now replaced by an EU Regulation, appeals also now have non-suspensive effect.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_198">Applicants are required to play a more active role in the asylum process and now have a statutory duty to co-operate in the investigation of their applications and in the determination of appeals. Applicants who do not actively pursue their applications by, for example, failing to attend for interview or to furnish information relevant to their applications or, where required to do so, fail to report to an immigration officer or to reside or remain at particular accommodation, will, unless they can indicate within a specified time limit a wish to continue with their applications, have those applications rejected.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_199">Credibility issues have been given a statutory foundation with the asylum agencies, in assessing the credibility of an applicant for the purpose of the investigation of an application or the determination of an appeal, being required to have regard to a large number of issues such as whether the applicant possesses identity documents, and if not whether he or she has provided a reasonable explanation for the absence of such documents; whether the applicant has provided a full and true explanation of how he or she travelled to and arrived in the State; where the application was made other than at the frontiers of the State, whether the applicant has provided a reasonable explanation to show why he or she did not claim asylum immediately on arriving at the frontiers of the State unless the application is grounded on events which have taken place since his or her arrival in the State; where the applicant has forged, destroyed or disposed of any identity and other documents relevant to his or her application, whether he or she has a reasonable explanation for so doing; whether in the case of an appeal, the applicant has furnished information in relation to the application which he or she could reasonably have furnished during the investigation of the application at first instance but did not do so. These extensive amendments to the Refugee Act 1996 while fully consistent with the States obligations under the 1951 Geneva Convention, provide a more comprehensive framework for the fair and expeditious processing of asylum applications. The amendments in question, which as I have indicated were introduced with effect from 15 September, are based on the experience of operating the Refugee Act 1996 over the last few years and, in particular dealing with the high level of unfounded applications and the high number of "no shows" at interviews, which were tying up large amounts of resources that could be better used to provide support to those genuinely in need of refugee protection.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_200">The resources allocated to the Garda National Immigration Bureau have also been increased for the purpose,inter alia, of enforcing deportation orders. In terms of numbers of asylum applications being made, I can tell the Deputy that the trend in 2003 to date is downwards with a 25% decrease in applications to end October 2003 compared to the same period in 2002. The month  of October 2003 saw the lowest monthly number of asylum applications recorded since June 1999. We are also continuing to maintain the number of deportations being effected with 463 persons deported in the year to the end of October 2003 and 635 voluntary returns also taking place during this period compared to 506 persons availing of the voluntary return option for the whole of 2002.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_201">With €340 million being spent on the asylum and related immigration process including on the provision of support services to asylum seekers in 2002, I am sure the Deputy will agree that it is incumbent on the Government to ensure that we have a fair and efficient asylum process in place which can both tackle abusive applications but ensure that those in genuine need of protection receive that protection as quickly as possible.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_202">I recognise that the issue of asylum is complex and presents many challenges for all the agencies involved in the asylum and immigration process. However, I am convinced that the policies being pursued are the right ones as evidenced, in particular, by the results I have highlighted in reply to the Deputys Question today.</summary>

          <p eId="para_4016">There are two basic categories of visas available – a "C" visa, for persons whose stated purpose of visit is for any period of less than 90 days and a "D" visa for persons whose stated purpose of visit requires a stay in excess of 90 days. The purposes for which visas may be sought are quite broad and include, for example, visas for the purposes of a visit, holiday, business, study, employment and medical treatment.</p>
          <p eId="para_4017">The granting of an Irish visa is, in effect, only a form of pre-entry clearance. It does not grant permission to enter the State. Visa holders are subject to the normal immigration controls at the port of entry and may be granted or refused entry to the State by the immigration officers in accordance with the provisions of the Aliens Act 1935 and the Aliens Order 1946, as amended.</p>
          <p eId="para_4018">Visa applications are assessed by a visa officer having regard to the criteria set out in the above legislation, and will address, <i>inter alia,</i> the following concerns: is the applicant's stated purpose of visit their true purpose of visit? Is the applicant in a position to fully support himself or herself while in the State? Is the applicant in possession of a valid passport or other such document? Might the applicant breach the conditions of the visa by, for example, working without a work permit, or overstaying the length of time applied for? Might the applicant breach the common travel area by travelling from the State to the UK or Northern Ireland without an appropriate entry visa?</p>
          <p eId="para_4019">In assessing these issues the visa officer will have regard to the information provided in the application and to such factors as the applicant's ties and general circumstances in their country of origin, their immigration history as well as the surrounding circumstances. The Department's approach in these matters is informed by past experience, including experience of abuse of the system.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_1047">
          <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell):</from>
          <p eId="para_4021">The Interdepartmental "Synergies" Committee on Childcare was established in early 2000 and was chaired by my Department. The aim of the group was to aid co-ordination and co-operation between Departments and State agencies involved in funding child care. The role of the "Synergies" Committee was to act as a  forum in which the various Department and State agencies, principally with a function in funding child care could meet to exchange information on the schemes available and to look at ways in which the duplication of funding could be avoided.</p>
          <p eId="para_4022">The committee first convened on 19 February 2000 and the group had a total of eight meetings throughout 2000. The committee consisted of representatives from the following Departments and other bodies-agencies: Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Department of Health and Children, Department of Education and Science, Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, health boards, FÁS, NVCA, Dublin Institute of Technology, Dublin Corporation (social inclusion unit) and ADM Limited. The membership was made up of representatives normally at the level of principal officer or equivalent.</p>
          <p eId="para_4023">In February 2001, the Cabinet committee on social inclusion decided that the funding for out of school hours projects allocated to the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and the funding allocated to the Department of Education and Science for after schools child care projects would be transferred to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The overall result of this transfer of funds for school age child care was the consolidation of funding for child care under the umbrella of my Department's equal opportunities child care programme. In essence, the transfer of this funding put in place a "one stop shop" for child care funding and ensured that applicants, both private and community based, could apply for funding under my Department's equal opportunities child care programme. The transfer also meant that the issue of co-ordinating the funding initiatives of the various Departments, which was the principal function of the "synergies" committee, was taken care of.</p>
          <p eId="para_4024">My Department continues to actively chair the National Childcare Co-ordinating Committee, NCCC, also established in 2000, which oversees the development of a child care infrastructure in an integrated manner throughout the country. The NCCC meets regularly and provides a productive forum for discussion and for the exchange of views on policy issues among the key players involved in the child care sector. Membership comprises representatives of both the statutory and non-statutory sectors, including the social partners and regional assemblies. Where necessary, my Department meets other Departments-agencies bilaterally to discuss specific issues of concern.</p>

          <p eId="para_4069">I am committed to making available the necessary funds where appropriate for the maintenance of Garda stations and equipping the force with modern technology.

          <p eId="para_4072">A number of significant projects in the field of information and communications technology for An Garda Síochána have been implemented in recent years. These include the PULSE computer system and the pilot digital radio network in Garda divisions in the Dublin area.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_205">I should mention to the Deputy that the waiting times outlined above represent the length of time that the person longest on the waiting list has been waiting for an appointment with a solicitor.  I can also inform the Deputy that the board operates a procedure whereby priority is accorded for certain categories of cases, for example domestic violence, child care, child abduction and other cases where there are time limits. These cases are dealt with immediately and such applicants are not placed on a waiting list. Such a system for priorities is necessary to ensure that, for example, persons who are subjected to domestic violence and cases involving the care of children are provided with speedy service. It is important to note that in 2001, priority appointments offered by law centres was approximately 22% of the total number of appointments offered to new clients during the year.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_206">In addition, managing solicitors at law centres have authority to give priority to any case on the waiting list at their centre. For example, if an applicant is gravely ill or in cases where an applicant is in danger of losing assets or of losing title to a legal remedy if legal services are delayed, the managing solicitor can accord such cases priority status.</summary>

          <p eId="para_4301">The National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, had been organised in three divisions headquartered respectively in Dublin, Cork and Galway. The establishment of a fourth NPWS division serving eight counties, Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Longford, Monaghan, Roscommon, Sligo and Westmeath, has been under way since 2000 when a more general reorganisation of the service was broached.</p>
          <p eId="para_4302">The designation of Sligo borough as headquarters for the new NPWS north division was consistent with the criteria regarding regional access adopted for the other divisional headquarters. It also followed extensive discussions between the former Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands and the union which represents NPWS staff.</p>
          <p eId="para_4303">Consequent on the above designation, the Office of Public Works has included the requirements of the NPWS north division in its plans for the extension of Government buildings in Sligo. The Office of Public Works is at present seeking interim accommodation for the staff unit involved, pending the availability of space in Government buildings, and will be prepared to assess all suitable accommodation in this context.</p>

          <p eId="para_4307">The total affordable housing provision, Exchequer and non-Exchequer, in 2003 is almost €400 million. This provision includes site subsidies, rent subsidies payable under the shared ownership scheme and mortgage subsidies payable under the affordable housing scheme. It is expected that the target of 1,000 units for both schemes will be met in 2003. The latest information on completions under both schemes for each local authority is published in my Department's housing statistics bulletin. A copy of the June quarter 2003, is available in the Oireachtas Library.</p>
          <p eId="para_4308">The non-Exchequer capital allocations for both schemes are limits to the local authorities' expenditure for loans under these schemes. The actual expenditure is funded either from the local authorities' own resources or from borrowing from the Housing Finance Agency. It is not possible to transfer any unspent non-Exchequer allocations to social housing projects. However, while the activity is high on both the affordable housing and shared ownership schemes, some shortfall anticipated due to a fall in demand for shared ownership is being used to meet commitments for disabled persons' grants.</p>

The national rural water monitoring committee is overseeing the implementation of a pilot programme by local authorities to test a range of new, small scale waste water collection and treatment systems, based on DBO procurement. Subject to a satisfactory outcome to the pilot testing, a potential role is envisaged for group sewerage schemes in the collection of domestic waste water from households outside the catchment of the new treatment systems. The confirmation of such a role for group sewerage schemes and any review of the associated grants must appropriately await the results of the pilot programme.</p>

          <p eId="para_4525">The Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board is an independent statutory body under the aegis of my Department. The remit of the board is to prepare a plan for the disbursement of moneys from the dormant accounts fund for the purposes of programmes or projects that are designed to assist the personal, educational and social development of persons who are econ omically, educationally or socially disadvantaged or persons with a disability.</p>
          <p eId="para_4526">The first transfer of moneys from credit institutions to the dormant accounts fund, managed by the National Management Treasury Agency, took place at the end of April 2003. The total involved was approximately €196 million. Since then some €19 million has been reclaimed and approximately €2 million earned from investing the fund, leaving a current total of €179 million in the fund. This figure includes a reserve which must be maintained to meet claims for repayment and various costs associated with administering the scheme. Consistent with advice received from the Department of Finance, the Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board, which is responsible for overseeing the disbursement of unclaimed moneys from the fund, has agreed that not more than €30 million should be disbursed annually.</p>
          <p eId="para_4527">I welcome the board's announcement last Friday, 7 November, concerning the publication of its disbursement plan. The plan sets out the board's objectives in making disbursements and its priorities for the duration of the plan. I understand the board is finalising arrangements to enable commencement of the implementation of the plan.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Mr. N. Ahern):</from>
          <p eId="para_4546">The national advisory committee on drugs, for which my Department has responsibility, published a study on the prevalence of opiate misuse in Ireland last May. The Deputy should note that this is the first formal estimate of the number of opiate users undertaken since the 1996 study carried out by Dr. Catherine Comiskey which used the same methodology. However, the 1996 study, which arrived at an estimate of 13,461, estimated prevalence for Dublin only.</p>
          <p eId="para_4547">The latest study estimates that there were 14,452 people using opiates in Ireland in 2001. The estimated figure for Dublin is 12,456 with 2,225 people using opiates outside the capital. I should make clear that the Dublin and outside Dublin figures do not add up to the national total as all three figures are the result of separate statistical calculations and are performed independently of each other.</p>
          <p eId="para_4548">The estimate is based on statistics provided by three data sources: central drug treatment list, national Garda study on drugs, crime and related criminal activity and hospital in-patient inquiry database. I regret to tell the Deputy that I cannot make available the breakdown he has requested for number of reasons, due primarily to confidentiality and statistical considerations.</p>
          <p eId="para_4549">First, the methodology used determines a prevalence estimate by identifying the number of individuals in each data source and the overlap of those appearing in one, two or three data sets. The numbers are then modelled using a statistical technique to provide an estimate. However, the numbers by area cited outside of Dublin are so small that there is a distinct possibility that individuals could be identified and the NACD have both ethical and data protection duties to consider in this regard. Second, estimates cannot be provided with the same degree of reliability on a regional basis outside of Dublin due to small numbers involved in each region. Accordingly, I regret I cannot provide the Deputy with the breakdown he has requested.</p>

          <p eId="para_4552">1. Identify and describe the availability of official support for enterprise, including tourism enterprise, in rural areas, that is, all areas excluding the greater Dublin area, the gateways and hubs as defined in the national spatial strategy and their areas of influence, and their structures of delivery.</p>
          <p eId="para_4553">2. Identify weaknesses or gaps, if any, in supports and/or their structures of delivery taking account of EU State aid law, the national spatial strategy and Exchequer financial constraints.</p>
          <p eId="para_4554">3. In regard to 2, identify the likely effects of and make recommendations on designating areas as the only ones where official assistance will be provided for establishing certain services and industries, where such sectoral targeting does not exist.</p>
          <p eId="para_4555">4. Arising from consideration of 2 and 3 above, recommend structures of delivery focusing on the sub-regional level, including the number and role of agencies needed to optimise enterprise, including tourism enterprise, development in rural areas, and avoid unnecessary duplication. For this purpose, regard should be had to the role and function of the following organisations: Leader companies, county enterprise boards, Enterprise Ireland, Western Development Commission, SFADCo, Údarás na Gaeltachta, Fáilte Ireland, regional tourism authorities and the amalgam of Bord Bia and Bord Glas.</p>

          <p eId="para_4561">The first results of the all-Ireland drug prevalence survey were launched on 20 October. This survey, which was the first of its kind in Ireland, was undertaken jointly by the national advisory committee on drugs, NACD, in Ireland and the drug and alcohol information and research unit, DAIRIU, in Northern Ireland. A total of 8,442 people aged 15-64 were surveyed by MORI MRC on behalf of the NACD and DAIRIU, 4,925 in Ireland and 3,517 in Northern Ireland, between October 2002 and April 2003. The survey was carried out using a pre-prepared questionnaire and face-to-face interviews, the preferred method under EMCDDA, European monitoring centre on drugs and drug addiction, guidelines.</p>
          <p eId="para_4562">The key finding of the survey was that just under one in five people, 19% surveyed reported ever using an illegal drug; one in 18, 5.6%, reported use in the last year and one in 33, 3%, reported use in the last month. Cannabis was the most widely used illegal drug reported with 18% of those surveyed having used it in their lifetime, 5% in the last year and 2.6% in the last month. Prevalence of other illegal drugs is lower and largely confined to the younger age groups. Further details are available in the bulletin released by the NACD and DAIRU, a copy of which will be sent to the Deputy. This is the first in a series of bulletins which will be published.</p>
          <p eId="para_4563">The NACD and DAIRU continue to analyse the information gathered. This analysis is being carried out on more than 150 questions relating to tobacco, alcohol and illegal drug use as well as findings relating to specific drugs, attitudes, perceived availability of illegal drugs and attempts to modify behaviour by quitting drug use.</p>

          <p eId="para_4570">With effect from 1 January 2003 the conditions for entitlement to back to education allowance were revised. From that date the scheme has not applied to most full time postgraduate courses, including those leading to a masters degree. This was because I wished to refocus the scheme towards people who most need additional training or qualifications to gain a foothold in the labour market. In a time of financial constraint, I have to ensure that supports are directed at those with the most pressing needs. In this context, limited resources must continue to be aimed at those in most need and who are most distant from the labour market.</p>
          <p eId="para_4571">People with a primary degree are already in possession of a third level qualification. Their academic qualifications already impact positively on their employment prospects and it was not appropriate that the back to education scheme be used to facilitate further academic specialisation. However, to facilitate people who wish to pursue a career in teaching, those wishing to take up a higher diploma in all disciplines or graduate diploma in primary school teaching were not affected by these changes. This does not apply to masters in education courses as a masters degree is not a pre-requisite for a career in teaching.</p>

In terms of the larger ICT projects in train, budgets and costs are clearly identifiable as, in general, resources are allocated exclusively to these projects. For smaller projects where mainly internal resources are used, these resources may be employed on a number of different projects and it is not always possible to apportion costs to specific projects.</p>

          <p eId="para_4576">There are well-established project management processes in place within my Department for managing and monitoring the progress of ICT projects. Where projects are large and span a number of years it may be necessary to revise project timescales and costs in response to changing circumstances, and it is not always possible to predict such changes in advance. One of the objectives of the project management process is to detect and provide indications, as far in advance as possible, of upcoming circumstances or contingencies which may necessitate changes to project timescales or resources. Application of the project management process enables such changes to be flagged, and their effects on projects managed, in a controlled manner.</p>

          <p eId="para_4583">The scheme of grants for voluntary organisations providing marriage, child and bereavement counselling services is a non-statutory scheme of once-off grants to voluntary organisations providing such counselling in relation to parental separation, marriage preparation courses and bereavement counselling for families and support services. The focus of the scheme is on support for the development of these services by the voluntary sector in the community, to enhance stability in family life, and to assist families and their members in dealing with difficult periods which they may experience.</p>
          <p eId="para_4584">Government grant aid for the development of marriage, child and relationship counselling services in the voluntary sector has been increased from £900,000 in 1997 to over €7 million in 2003. There are now more than 460 voluntary and community groups throughout the country providing marriage and relationship counselling, marriage preparation programmes, child counselling for children whose parents have separated and bereavement support services. The scheme is now administered by the family support agency, which was established earlier this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_4585">In 2003 the organisation in question sought funding under the scheme for the provision of marriage preparation courses and received a grant of €5,700 for the provision of these services. An application form for the 2004 scheme of grants will issue in the new year. Any such applications will be considered by the agency having regard to available resources and the overall demand for funding.</p>

          <p eId="para_4587">The free travel scheme operated by my Department provides free travel on the main public and private transport services for those eligible under the scheme. These include road, rail and ferry services provided by semi-State companies such as Bus Átha Cliath, Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann, as well as services provided by more than 80 private transport operators. The vast majority of private contractors providing services under the scheme operate in rural areas. I am always willing to consider applications from licensed private transport operators who may wish to participate in the free travel scheme. However, while my Department pays transport providers to operate the free travel scheme, it is not in a position to provide transport services where none exists.</p>
          <p eId="para_4588">The issue of access to public transport is being addressed at present through the rural transport initiative, which is being managed by Area Development Management, ADM, on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Transport.</p>

I will continue to review the operation of these schemes with a view to identifying the scope for further improvements as resources permit.</p>

The carer's allowance is not payable in this case as the care recipient is resident at a care-rehabilitative centre. However, the person concerned receives a carer's allowance for the periods when her daughter is residing at home with her.
