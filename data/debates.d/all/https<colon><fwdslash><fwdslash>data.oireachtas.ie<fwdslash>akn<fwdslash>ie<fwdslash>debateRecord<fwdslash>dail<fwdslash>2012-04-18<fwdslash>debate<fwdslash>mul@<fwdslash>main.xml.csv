I hope you will find your visit enjoyable, successful and to our mutual benefit.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1	It was bad enough that the household tax was pushed through come hell or high water by 31 March, with the result that only half of households have registered for payment.  Now the country is faced with the water metering debacle, with headlines in The Sunday Times suggesting that people will have to pay up to €300 to install a meter.  This was followed by a spokesman for the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government saying that both the cost of buying and installing water meters would be passed on to households and not paid for by the Exchequer.  We then had the Taoiseach stating:There will not be an installation charge for the householder because that cost will be covered as a loan from the National Pensions Reserve Fund to the Department.  There will be a cost for the meter itself.On RTE Radio's "This Week", the Tánaiste articulated a third position, that no decision had yet been made on how water meters are to be paid for.  As if these confused statements were not enough, on Monday the Taoiseach repeated that while there would be no charge for the installation of water meters, somebody will have to pay for them.The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, added the Government was awaiting proposals on metering from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, stated that no formal decision had been taken but that he saw meters as a friend of householders, businesses and so on.  All of this took place on the same day the Irish League of Credit Unions painted a stark picture of more than 47% of households having less than €100 in disposable income per month.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	21	It is the hapless Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, who always is sent out.  Where is the Minister, Deputy Hogan?  The Minister, Deputy Hogan, should come into the House to give a detailed statement and answer a few questions on it for the benefit of the House and the public.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	22	Before calling on the Taoiseach, I remind Deputies there are two minutes for asking a question and three minutes for a reply.  I ask everyone to adhere to those limits.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	24	The Minister, Deputy Hogan, is in Denmark today to attend a meeting of European Union Ministers.  The Government made two decisions today.  First, it decided that Irish Water would be set up as a subsidiary of Bord Gáis Éireann in public ownership, with no intention of privatisation of the Irish water system.  Second, the Government made a formal decision that there would be no upfront charges on anyone in respect of the provision of water and that charging for water will not begin until 2014.  That deals with the three questions Deputy Martin asked.  The Government now has two years in which to work out the detail of what is involved in this regard.  There will be no job losses in the 34 local authorities but an additional 2,000 jobs will be created for those men and women who are quantity surveyors, engineers, plumbers and people working in the water system.  I repeat the Minister, Deputy Hogan, is in Denmark.I might point out to Deputy Martin that on his first day back in the House, it ill behoves him to take the opportunistic line he is taking.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	25	I simply asked a question.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	26	I am not in any way commenting on the speculation one always will have regarding issues that arise in politics in the normal course of events.  However, I want Deputy Martin to understand that the actions of the Governments of which he was a member have left the Government with this unprecedented mess.  The present Administration has the courage to sort it out and is not so doing by perpetrating a scam on the Irish people to the effect that one can run all the country's services with the tax revenues coming in from property speculators.  The Government has chosen to not increase income tax.  It has chosen to not impose a tax on work, employment and jobs.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	27	Yet.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	28	It is transferring responsibility in this area to consumers, who will have a choice.  Moreover, the Government has built in protections in all things to date for consumers.  It intends to change the entire transmission system of the way in which water, which is a precious resource, is dispensed nationwide.  Deputy Martin is aware of the impact, economically, personally and socially, of what happened with the cryptosporidium case in Galway.  He is familiar with the difficulties that arise when people receive notices that they are obliged to boil water.  He is aware of the volumes of high-quality, pristine, safe and clean water that now are demanded in Ireland, where there are high levels of confidence for investment about which I hope to make a further announcement today.  We cannot continue in the manner that obtained in the past, whereby 40% of the water from reservoirs never gets to the facilities or to those who are supposed to use it.  The Government must deal with this problem and will deal with it in as fair, as equitable and as affordable a way as possible.  There will be no charges until 2014.  An assessment in respect of the level of investment that will be required in respect of the roll-out of water metering will commence very shortly.Bord Gáis Éireann has been a public utility company for many years.  It has a brilliant record in the context of dealing with consumers, the payment of bills, pipelines, business, enterprise, governance, etc.  It and Bord na Móna submitted substantial proposals in respect of this matter in response to the Government's desire to retain Irish Water as a public utility in public ownership.  Earlier this morning I heard Deputy Donnelly referring to tenders and contacts with a view to privatising Irish Water.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	36	The Deputy should ask a supplementary question.

I am aware that the Tánaiste was in difficulty on Sunday as a result of the Labour Party conference.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	40	A supplementary question, please.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	41	I took the Tánaiste at his word when he stated that a decision has not been taken.  However, I suspect that something else may have been going on.  In 2009, the Labour Party had a very clear position on this matter when it indicated that "water is a basic and fundamental need and should not be treated like a market commodity".
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	42	I would prefer if we had questions rather than statements.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	43	At that time, Deputy Tuffy stated "Charging for domestic water, in the light of our current taxation system, will only add to inequality, since such charges don't take account of people's ability to pay."  She also stated "The Labour Party abolished water charges when Brendan Howlin was Environment Minister in the Rainbow Govt, 1996.  We would oppose any attempt to reverse that move."

The Government also made a decision that there would be no up-front charge and that charges would not be imposed until 2014.  The Government will also make the decision regarding the free allowance consumers will receive in respect of water.  However, in accordance with tradition, the regulator will have responsibility for the structure and the detail of what will be involved.The ESB has been a public utility company for very many years.  Neither I nor the Deputy can inform people as to what will be the cost of electricity in five years' time.  It is daft to ask what will be the charge for water when the details of the matter have not even been discussed or worked out.  The relevant regulator will have responsibility in this area.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	59	There is no hiding behind the regulator.

Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dílis.  They say that lightning does not strike twice but the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, seems to be disproving that maxim.  May we have a couple of straight answers from the Taoiseach?  He has said there will be no upfront charge so is he therefore stating that people will not be charged for the installation of meters?  Will he tell us whether this Government is really considering the prospect of cutting off the water supply to houses in the event of a charge not being paid?  This is a strategy that was indicated by one of the Ministers.  Does he believe that in this day and age that would be any kind of a civilised option?The Taoiseach has stated there will be a number of years for the details of this scheme to be worked out and that the regulator must have an eye to the consumer and hardships that might ensue.  I ask those on the Government benches to in the first instance have that eye to the citizen because the reaction of the public to yet another charge is one of wondering where they will get the money and wherewithal to meet the cost.  Substantial numbers of people have not registered and will not register for the household charge for the very simple reason that they cannot afford it.  Equally, hardship will ensue-----

#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	100	The Taoiseach has made a virtue of the fact that he will not touch income tax and it is clearly a matter of doctrine that the Government will not tax the very wealthy.  It is fairly gung ho about imposing charge after charge on lower and middle income people.  What will the charge be for the installation of meters?  Will the Taoiseach give a guarantee that whatever way this scheme works, the Government will not countenance, in any circumstances, cutting off water supply to homes?

The position is that there will be no upfront charge and when this system is worked out by the regulator, the cost of the system will be subsumed into the standing charge to be determined by the regulator.  The people living in the Deputy's constituency will not be given an upfront bill for payment.Electricity is a public utility-----

With regard to the comment about people being cut off, these are all matters for discussion with regard to how the system will work.

However, as I have explained to him on many occasions in the past, troika or no troika, we in this country have to sort out our public finance problems ourselves.  Nobody will walk in with a cheque and say it has all been paid for.  Everybody is involved in this and the Government understands the burden on those who have real difficulty, which is why we have introduced waivers, exemptions and regulations which lessen that burden.The question was asked of somebody yesterday whether VAT will be imposed on water.  The answer is "No" because, as Deputies know, water is exempt from VAT under European regulations.

That is all a matter for discussion and determination by Bord Gáis when it sets up Irish Water together with the regulator.  As I stated, the Government will determine what will be the free allocation.

#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	124	Water, as the Taoiseach conceded, is essential for a decent standard or quality of living.  He stated the speculation as regards costs that is doing the rounds in the public arena is just speculation.  However, in the absence of any clarity from the Government, there will be such speculation.  The Taoiseach has failed this morning to indicate in any substantive way for the citizens of the State what level of charge they will face.  It is most astonishing that he will not rule out the prospect of cutting off water supply to homes.  That is a disgrace and I ask him, when he gets to his feet again in a moment, to make crystal clear to people who are very worried as they watch this that the water supply to their homes will not be jeopardised.

It is nothing of the kind.  In fact, the legislation will strengthen the position that this is a publicly owned utility.  That is why when expressions of interest were sought on who might run and set up Irish Water two existing semi-State bodies responded, not private companies which, in the words of Deputy Donnelly, would have a contract or tender awarded to them for the privatisation of water.  This is a universal product.  A universal transmission for high quality water is so important for both business and for personal life.The Deputy should not say in this House that I said people would have their water cut off.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	147	I call on Deputy Ross.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	148	Thank you Ceann Comhairle.  On behalf of the Technical Group, I would like to join with Deputy McDonald and the Taoiseach in expressing our sympathy to Deputy Doherty on the death of his father.Yesterday the Cabinet moved to end the confusion which had existed about these water charges, following a report in The Sunday Times last Sunday.  We should greet that with a certain amount of optimism, but having heard it, to be honest I prefer the confusion to the clarification.  We now know a few very limited things about what will happen with water charges.  We know that the Government, in its wisdom, has decided to create another State monopoly with a free hand to charge consumers a completely unspecified amount of money at its own discretion.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	149	Well if you tell us how much it is, that would be fine.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	152	No we do not.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	153	It is a standing charge of €40, more or less.  We know that this charge will be used to repay a loan given by the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  Why are the people borrowing money from the National Pensions Reserve Fund?  We are borrowing our own money when we do that.  This contrasts completely with what happened to the National Pensions Reserve Fund when the banks went to it.  When the banks went to the NPRF -  a great misnomer because no pension will ever be paid from it - they were given money.  An equity investment was made and they will never have to repay most of the money, as everybody knows.  Why did the Government not direct the NPRF to put this money into the installation costs so that people do not have to borrow it?  Why is this fund, which was pillaged by the banks for money which they will not pay back, being loaned to the people, who are going to have to pay back?  We could treat the people at least the same as we treat the banks and allow them to take the money, thereby abolishing that €40 charge.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	154	I thank the Deputy for accepting the principle of what is involved here.  What is involved is transforming the way in which water, as a valuable, precious entity, has been dealt with in this country.Over the next 25 to 50 years it will become even more important and it is critical that the Government now sets in place a system and platform by which water can be delivered to homes and businesses for use in an entirely safe, competent and absolutely professional manner.  That is why the Government was anxious that this would be retained as a public entity and as a public utility.  Otherwise, if one goes the other route of privatisation and competition for the supply of water among private companies, in our view that would have disastrous consequences.  That is why we are very clear about this being a utility retained in public ownership.The reason for the loan being made in the way it will be made is to provide a commercial return for pensions for people for the future.  The Government, as the Deputy will be well aware, does not have any pot of free money to allocate as it so wishes.  It is all the people's money one way or the other.  We want to deal with the question of serious savings having regard to leaks, investment in proper infrastructure for the carrying and the transmission of water, and the large-scale evidence of water leaks between public boundaries and private houses, of which there are many cases.  People do not want that to be an issue with which they cannot deal.What is involved is a clear Government decision about a way to deal in the future with a resource that has been taken for granted in this country for centuries.  We cannot continue the way we have gone before.  We must deal with it.  The Government decision is absolutely clear in that business and the consumer will take responsibility for their contribution to providing a water system that will continue to inspire confidence in this country from abroad.As the Deputy will be well aware from his business experience and contacts, it is critical and of fundamental importance for business and major investors that we continue to be able to prove and demonstrate that we have a high quality water system that is safe, clean and in which people can absolute confidence to invest.  For personal consumers, it is important that they understand and appreciate, which they do, that this is not a resource that is there to be wasted; it is there to be enjoyed and for use in living, but not to be abused.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	155	I thank the Taoiseach for his reply.  I do not disagree with a lot of what he said but he did not answer the question.  The question is very simple and maybe I could repeat it.  I do not believe that the NPRF - to which the Taoiseach said the money will go back to pay for the pensions in the future - will ever pay a pension.  It will be used for infrastructure.  It has been used for the banks.  It is now a kind of a slush fund for the Government at a time of emergency.  It has two forms of funds.  It has one for direct - what it called directed - investment and one for discretionary investment.  This one is for some reason being used for discretionary investment and the other one, into which the great multiple of the NPRF money has gone, is one that is gone down a black hole into the banks.  Why can we not use this €450 million as a direct investment, thereby relieving people of this €40 charge annually over 20 years?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	156	As the Deputy will be aware, that decision was made by a previous Government but what we have done here is to supplement the moneys from the NPRF through the PCAR system where we have borrowed to put a foundation in place for banks.  The roll-out of this system under Irish Water will provide a unified, unitary, single transmission system of high quality where the exceptional losses through wastage, leakage, broken pipes and different systems operating throughout the local authorities and town councils will be brought under a single high standard and high quality system.  That will be good for the consumer, for business and for the country.  We recognise the scale of the mess that was left before that was never attended to where, as I said to Deputy Martin earlier, a major scam was perpetrated on the Irish people - that it could be assumed free services could be delivered on the backs of taxes coming from property speculation.  When that collapsed, the system collapsed along with it.  We must deal with that and will do so in as fair, as equitable and as affordable a way as we can.

Is the proposal that the Dáil shall sit later than 9 p.m. tonight agreed to?  Agreed.  Is the proposal for dealing with Nos. 11 and 12, motions re ministerial rota for parliamentary questions and Further Revised Estimates, Votes 2 and 3, without debate agreed to?  Agreed.  Is the proposal for dealing with Private Members' business agreed to?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	160	In terms of the order, I want to oppose the general order.  The Ceann Comhairle is taking items one by one but I want to oppose the order.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	161	The Deputy must oppose something.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	166	Very constructive.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	168	The bottom line is this: I want to put it to the Taoiseach that we have had commentary left, right and centre about a substantial issue to do with charging for water.  Irrespective of one's perspective on it, it goes to the heart of the relevance of this House to debate what is taking place in the country.  We have had this on successive days over the weekend.  The least this House should do is to allocate time for the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, to make a detailed statement outlining the work that has been undertaken to date on the preparation for the introduction of water metering and all of the detailed proposals that have been submitted by the utility companies for the selection process.  It was the worst kept secret that Bord Gáis would get this because executives were saying this a number of weeks ago - that is interesting if the decision was only taken yesterday.  People seemed to know Bord Gáis would get this some time ago so there is a need for the Minister of State to come in, to make a detailed statement and to take questions from Members.The Taoiseach mentioned the VAT issue this morning.  His own Minister of State could not answer the question on that this morning when he was asked it on "Morning Ireland".
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	169	We cannot have a full discussion on it now.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	170	There is a need for clarity on the Government side of the House, not from anyone else.  We did not start this on Sunday.
#MichaelMcNamara	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-party	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	171	Fianna Fáil started it in December 2010.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	175	There is a need for this House to debate it.  I just want the House to discuss it, to have clarity and a detailed presentation.  That is all I want.  It is being discussed everywhere else.
#MichaelMcNamara	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-party	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	176	Fianna Fáil did not discuss things in December 2010.  Why did Deputy Martin not discuss it with Brian Cowen?  Where was he then?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	177	Is this House relevant anymore to anything that goes on?

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	180	As Deputy Martin is aware from his years as Minister for Foreign Affairs, we are preparing for the Presidency of the European Union for the first half of 2013.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government is at a Council of Ministers meeting in Denmark dealing with environmental matters.  When the Minister returns there will be no difficulty at all in making as much time as the Deputy wishes available.  However, it cannot happen today.  Today we are dealing with the European stability treaty.  The Deputy was giving out yesterday that there is not enough time to deal with this.  It is on the agenda today and is an absolute priority, so we will devote as much time to it as is necessary.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	181	The Taoiseach could provide 45 minutes extra and we will stay for the extra hour.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	184	We have no difficulty with talking about this and with dealing with all the issues the Deputy wishes to raise.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	185	Bring the Minister to the House to make a detailed statement, rather than leaking left, right and centre against each other.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	186	Deputy Martin should remember there will be two years of discussion on this, between the entity being set up, the regulator, the Government, the House and the people-----
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	187	So the Minister should come to the House to talk about it.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	191	It is being discussed everywhere except in this House.  That is not a good enough answer.  It is the old story.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	192	Sorry, Deputy, I am trying to bring a little order to the proceedings.  We have been away for a fortnight but Members should settle down.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	193	A Cheann Comhairle, it goes to the heart of the relevance of this House.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	194	Is the proposal for dealing with Private Members' business agreed to?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	195	It has been stated by the Taoiseach that the Government is anxious to raise up to €500 million through a property tax and that it will bring proposals before the House shortly in that regard.  Could he indicate when legislation will be introduced?
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	196	Could we have order please?  I am sorry, but could those who are leaving the Chamber do so quietly?  We have business to transact in the Chamber.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	197	Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle.  The Government has stated that it wishes to raise €500 million through a property tax.  Could the Taoiseach indicate to the House when he intends to bring legislation forward to prepare for the introduction of a property tax?Given that we now have a date for the European fiscal treaty referendum, could the Taoiseach indicate when it is his intention to bring forward legislation to provide for a constitutional amendment to abolish the Seanad?
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	198	I understand that a committee headed by Dr. Don Thornhill is due to report to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, shortly on the introduction of a property tax.  As the Taoiseach is aware, public speculation is that the proposed tax could amount to €1,000 for home owners.
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	199	It is nearly as bad as in Northern Ireland.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	200	Could the Taoiseach confirm when the group will report to Government, whether the report will be published and debated in the Dáil and what his plans are to introduce proposed legislation for the property tax?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	201	I thank both Deputies for their questions.  I saw the report from the ESRI referred to this morning.  The Government has its own specialist group which is operating under the chairmanship of Mr. Thornhill, as Deputy McDonald indicated.  I do not know when his report will come to Government, but when that happens there will be a full discussion on all such matters.  I cannot answer Deputy Martin's question on when legislation will be introduced.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	202	My understanding-----
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	203	We have not even got the report back from Mr. Thornhill yet.  I have seen the speculation about the ESRI report.  That is just speculation.  In reply to the question on when we will get the report; I do not know.  In reply to Deputy Martin's question on when the legislation will be introduced; I cannot tell him that because we do not have the basis for a discussion on the issue.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	204	But the Government said it had to be in place by 2013.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	205	Yes.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	206	This is 2012.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	207	Deputy Martin asked me when I will introduce the legislation.  I cannot answer the question for him.  I will wait and see what the report states.  We have a process of decisions to make following the production of the report.  I do not have a date either for the legislation in respect of the abolition of the Seanad.  I will speak to Deputy Martin's party and other parties about the proposition in that regard.  It is clear that referenda and the holding of them is a matter for public consultation and political decision in the House.  I want to do this in the right way.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	208	Because of the vote we have only seven minutes remaining on the Order of Business and we have seven Deputies offering.  I urge them to please be brief.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	209	Notwithstanding what the Taoiseach said this morning, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, said yesterday that he was in favour-----
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	210	I am sorry, Deputy Higgins, but this is not in order.  Please.  We are not having such a debate.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	211	-----of having water cut off to people's homes.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	212	No.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	213	Yes, he did.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	214	I do not care what he said.  This is not in order on the Order of Business.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	215	No, but the legislative issue that arises, a Cheann Comhairle-----
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	216	The Taoiseach has just answered the question.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	217	-----relates to the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act 1997.  Section 12 removed the power of local authorities to implement water charges for homes and therefore removed the monstrous power to cut off people's water.  Could I ask the Taoiseach in that regard what legislative measures - and when - he is bringing forward?
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	218	I am sorry, but is legislation promised to cut off people's water?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	219	Yes.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	220	Well-----
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	221	No legislation is promised so we cannot deal with the matter.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	222	The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, in response to a journalist clearly indicated yesterday that this was his wish.  That needs a legislative response.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	223	I am not into wishes here.  I am into practicalities.  Will the Taoiseach clear this matter up?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	224	Deputy Higgins wants to go on his sensational rant again.  All public utilities, such as Bord Gáis Éireann and Bord Soláthair an Leictreachais, or, as it is now called, Electric Ireland, have protocols in place for persons who have a difficulty.  There is a two-year process here for the discussion on the detail and the legislation in respect of Irish Water.  I already made the point that the Government made the decision to award the responsibility to set this up to Bord Gáis Éireann.  There will be 2,000 jobs created in the installation of the water meters.  The decision of Government is not to increase income tax or to impose further taxes on jobs, and there will be no upfront charge for anybody.  No more than any other public utility - this is being retained in public ownership - protocols and details of that matter are for the regulator and Irish Water to deal with over the course of the next two years.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	225	I thank the Taoiseach.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	226	The Taoiseach has stated that there is no question of the privatisation of water.  Given that commitment, what legislation will the Government bring forward to insulate the State from the requirements of EU law which necessitate that any revenue-producing monopoly must be subject to EU rules of competition and, therefore, deregulation and privatisation?
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	227	That is a matter of detail for the legislation.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	228	Sorry, this is about legislation.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	229	Not about promised legislation.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	230	It is.  The Taoiseach has stated there is no question of privatisation.  I am pointing out to him-----
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	231	We are not into privatisation at this point.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	235	Will you be fair to your colleagues?

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	288	Ireland is a good country with a proud people and it will recover.  The past three years have tested us, our democracy, our values and our determination, but we have not been found wanting.  This is because what the Irish people want is nothing more than their due: to live in a country where they can find decent work, have a home, take care of their family and watch their children grow up in the company of their friends.  We are elected to this House as stewards of that birthright, public representatives whose task, above all, is to act in the interest of the Irish people, not only for today or tomorrow but for our children's future as well.There are differing views in this House about what represents the best interest of those who elected us - that is politics - but there are some facts that simply cannot be denied, or swept aside.  Ireland may be an island, but the borders of its trade, currency and workforce stretch across oceans.  We are a country that is deeply embedded in the global trading system, exporting 80% of everything we produce, we are a member of a 17 country currency, the eurozone, we are part of a European market of 500 million people, and now we are dependent on international institutions to pay wages and pensions and keep our hospitals, schools and other public services running.  Our living standards depend on our reputation as a strong and stable place to do business, and until we can sell Irish Government bonds on the international markets again, our living standards are directly dependent on support from our European partners.  Let us be clear about one thing.  The euro is our currency.  It is the money in our pocket - the money we spend when we have it, the money we save when we can.  The health and future of the euro matters personally, to each of us.As I said at the sub-committee yesterday, in the second half of last year Europe and the euro currency was under massive pressure.  We all saw what happened in Greece.  We all saw multiple ratings downgrades even amongst previously invincible AAA countries.  We all saw global economic powers like Italy under severe pressure.  Citizens using the euro wondered "Should I change my money into another currency?", "Are my savings safe?" and other such questions fundamental to any person, family or business.  All of this was happening despite good news from some sources, including here in Ireland, where our recovery programme was on track, with growing exports and good news in terms of foreign direct investment.Late last year, then, it was clear that the euro was under threat and economies were struggling to fund themselves.  There was a growing crisis, not just for Europe but on a global scale; a crisis where Ireland, as an open exporting country was very exposed to having its recovery derailed unless something was done at a eurozone and European level.  It is often under-estimated how much progress has already been made in addressing the eurozone crisis in terms of early warning systems, much enhanced financial regulation, bank recapitalisation requirements and, overall, the retrofitting of the supporting architecture that should really have been there when the euro was introduced.Last December and then right through Christmas, the new year and January, Ireland and our fellow European member states sat down to negotiate a new and important part of this toolkit, an agreement with the status and weight of an international treaty which committed 25 states, including all eurozone members, to responsible budgeting and better arrangements on how eurozone countries work together and help each other.  It is that deal which we negotiated, called the stability treaty, which I am asking the Irish people to support.The other crucial tool available is, of course, the firewall in the form of the European Stability Mechanism or ESM, which any country ratifying the stability treaty can have access to.  As most Deputies know already, if any country does not ratify the stability treaty, it does not have access to the ESM.This is a treaty on stability and is about ensuring a stable euro.  It is about confidence abroad and maintaining and enhancing the influence we have been rebuilding with investors and our European partners.  In particular, for multinational employers, from whom so many announcements have come in recent months, their decisions have been thanks to our renewed political and economic stability and, above all, the determination of the Irish people, despite great sacrifices, to restore Ireland's economic health.  As Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, I have personally heard directly from these investors and employers around the world.  They want to do business in Europe and they are convinced by what Ireland has to offer as a European base.  However, they need reassurance that the euro currency is stable and that Ireland's is a stable and well managed economy at the heart of the eurozone.In very large part, this treaty reiterates and reinforces rules already in place through the revised Stability and Growth Pact and the recent EU legislative package on governance and economic management.  Giving these higher legal status helps ensure that everyone, big or small, is bound by the same rules in order to give us a level playing pitch.The treaty is about managing our debt in such a way that, over time, taxpayers' money goes not into servicing debts but more and more into public services and targeted growth initiatives to create jobs.  As a small, open economy, we have seen in dramatic fashion how quickly our public finances can become unstable in the face of global economic turbulence.  We cannot allow this to happen again.  Even if we were not party to the treaty, as a matter of proper economic management we would have to reduce out indebtedness over time.  Those who make claims about the treaty imposing austerity seem to believe we can run a deficit for ever or accumulate debt without limit, but we cannot.  That is not a matter of ideology; it is a matter of mathematics.  Anyone who says otherwise is not being honest with the people.This treaty is about having an insurance policy and making sure we have access, if needed, to the ESM funding that allows us to fund those public services and all Government spending.  We are determined to return to the financial markets next year and to stand on our own two feet again.  We are on target with our programme and sentiment towards Ireland is positive.  Yet, we cannot control world events and the world economy.  Markets need to know there is a backup in the form of the European Stability Mechanism and we can only access that if we ratify this treaty on 31 May.  We hope and intend not to need the ESM but what Ireland does not need is to be excluded from it, with the associated uncertainty.The stability treaty is crystal clear about what it is for.  Its very first article states that its purpose is to support "the achievement of the European Union's objectives for sustainable growth, employment, competitiveness and social cohesion" - jobs, real economies and fairness.  To reinforce that point, when the treaty's text was agreed among EU leaders at the end of January, they agreed a growth programme in parallel with it.  The Irish Government was a leader in efforts to ensure this growth programme and in ensuring growth was at the heart of the treaty itself.On 27 March last, the Government decided 31 May would be the date for the stability treaty referendum and announced the wording of the proposed amendment to the Constitution, the Bill which we are now debating.  The Bill contains the proposed amendment to the Constitution, first, to ratify the stability treaty itself and, second, to enable the Oireachtas to adopt any legislation necessary in order to implement its provisions.  Contrary to what some have claimed, we are not inserting the treaty into our Constitution.  We are ensuring that our constitutional arrangements enable us to ratify the treaty.Announcing the referendum date on 27 March allowed for 65 days of debate before polling day.  The Government is determined, both here in the Oireachtas and among the general public, that there will be a full and thorough debate on the stability treaty.  I want to pay particular tribute to the sub-committee of the Oireachtas Committee on European Affairs and its Chairman, Deputy Hannigan, for their work both before and since Easter in debating the stability treaty with a large variety of speakers.  I participated there yesterday and I know its deliberations will inform the debate in both this House and the Seanad in the coming week.  I also look forward to the sub-committee's report in the coming weeks.It is the right and the duty of Government, as before, to play a part in informing the public, and one innovation in this referendum debate will be that every household will receive a copy of the treaty in Irish and English, along with a short explanatory text.  The Referendum Commission, established just over eight weeks before referendum day, will also do its work and, of course, I respect its independence in that.  All of us in the House, a minority of whom will campaign against the amendment, should, and no doubt will, be out there explaining and debating with the people, as is our obligation as public representatives.  I know there are attempts to appeal to people to use their vote to register a protest of some form.  These are difficult times, and with difficult decisions having been made to help fix our economy, it is understandable some people feel angry that they are contributing so much after all the economic mistakes that have been made during the previous decade.  We are all angry that this country has found itself in the position it is in but the Government is determined to fix this.I am voting "Yes" because I believe it helps us.  My point today is that voting "No" genuinely will not help Ireland's recovery, it will hinder it.  If the stability treaty is about anything, it is about making sure grave mistakes are not made again.  It is about getting a sustainable, fair and people focused economy here in Ireland and across Europe, where public money is available for public services and job incentives, not for paying down debt.  In addition, as I have said on many occasions, it is about the euro in our pocket.When we are voting on 31 May, let us not use our vote on issues unrelated to the treaty.  Let us, including all of us here in this House, keep the debate focused on the stability treaty and Ireland.  I am heartened to see early evidence already from civil society groups, energised by this vital national issue and poised to play their part in the campaign.  To see farmers and small business owners call for support for the treaty is a sign of how fundamental a stable eurozone with Ireland at its heart is for all of us.  I do not claim and have never claimed that the stability treaty is the solution to all our problems but it is a very important part of the solution - for a stable euro, for investor confidence, for recovery and for a vote of confidence in our future.  I urge the House to support the Bill and I urge the people of country to support the referendum on 31 May.
#LucindaCreighton	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-party	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-dob	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	289	I thank the Tánaiste for sharing time to allow me this opportunity to address the House on this crucial Bill.  It goes without saying this is extremely important legislation as it will facilitate the holding of a referendum on the stability treaty on 31 May.  While the debate began many weeks ago on the airwaves, it is appropriate that we begin the formal debate in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I look forward to engaging fully as the debate broadens out beyond the Houses in the weeks ahead.  I will be working hard with my Government colleagues to ensure the support of the people for the treaty on 31 May.  I enjoin the Tánaiste in commending the ongoing work of the sub-committee of the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs under the chairmanship of Deputy Hannigan.  The sub-committee has already heard from a broad range of voices throughout society as well as contributions from a variety of our EU partners.  The interventions heard by the sub-committee are contributing to an informed, balanced and considered national debate on an issue of pressing national interest.  As the referendum date at the end of next month draws nearer we can but hope that the considered and tempered approach persists.The public will go to the polls on 31 May and will need the full facts of what is in the treaty and details on the implications of its ratification for Ireland.  I spoke of the need for adequate, clear information to be made available to the people even before a decision was taken to hold a referendum on the treaty.  In response to this genuine need for information, the Government will shortly circulate a copy of the stability treaty to every household in the State.  This was not done in the case of recent referendums but the Government's view is that the need for first-hand information is sufficiently pressing to justify this innovative step.  I appreciate that some who oppose the treaty have welcomed this move by the Government and I welcome the fact that all sides in the debate at least agree that the people need information on the proposition before them to make an informed decision.The full text of the treaty will be accompanied by brief explanatory material intended to highlight the main elements of and related to the treaty.  Later this week the Government will launch a dedicated website concerning the treaty.  This will provide access not only to the text but also to a range of explanatory material.  It is the Government's sincere hope that this information, which will be distributed to every household in the State in the coming weeks, will make an important contribution to providing voters with the information they need to make an informed decision on 31 May.  In addition, the Referendum Commission, under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Kevin Feeney, will fulfil its mandate to explain, independently of Government, the subject matter of the referendum proposal, to promote public awareness of the referendum and to encourage the electorate to vote at the polls on 31 May.Before outlining details of particular provisions of the treaty I wish to provide some context.  We are all aware that we have experienced a profound crisis in the euro in recent years and we are not out of the woods yet.  That much is clear.  Our currency, the money in our pockets, has had its stability, credibility and its future called into question.  Why should this be of concern to the people?  First and foremost, instability in the euro area has impacted negatively on the interest rate at which euro area countries, including Ireland, can borrow money in the international financial markets.  This considerable disruption to the functioning of the financial markets led to Greece, and subsequently Ireland and Portugal, having to withdraw from open market funding and rely on mechanisms put in place by the EU and IMF to secure ongoing access to funds with which to fund our schools, hospitals, the Garda and all the other public services and social payments that are relied upon by citizens every day.A lack of stability introduces added uncertainties to investment decisions made by multinational corporations.  These firms are highly mobile in terms of the destinations for their investments.  It also affects the investment decisions being made by our indigenous companies, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, which crave stability and a maximum degree of certainty.  In the absence of both they are likely to hold off on job-creating investments or, in the case of multinationals, find an investment location with less volatility.  Restoring stability to the euro is a critical step to extract ourselves from our current predicament.  The treaty will play an important part in that effort.  As the Tánaiste has stated, it is not sufficient on its own but it is an essential element.  For this reason Europe's response to the current crisis has been multifaceted.  In addition to reaching agreement on the new stability treaty, to which I will return, we have also established the European financial stability facility, EFSF, from which Ireland currently draws funding.  The permanent successor to the facility, the European Stability Mechanism, ESM, has now been put in place and is due to enter into force in July, one year ahead of schedule.  We have also put in place the European semester which is overseeing the implementation of structural reforms set out in the national reform programmes provided by each member state.  In addition, the European institutions have been mindful of the need to put in place robust and convincing firewalls to prevent negative spillover effects from one member state to another.During the course of this crisis we have seen all too vividly the remarkably pronounced level of interconnectedness that exists among members of a currency union.  What happens in one member state can have and often does have serious repercussions on all the others.  I am pleased to note that the review of the adequacy of the overall ceiling of the EFSF and ESM conducted recently by eurogroup finance ministers has resulted in the agreement to expand the level of support funding to €700 billion.  The Government has been consistent in advocating that firewalls in the euro area must be as strong and credible as possible.  The recent agreement among finance ministers constitutes a strong and credible response and it is to be welcomed.One further element of the jigsaw that comprises Europe's response to the crisis has been the explicit appreciation of the need for fiscal consolidation to be complemented and supported by vigorous action to generate growth and job creation.  The Government has held this view for some time.  Without growth the burden of getting back on track would be much greater.  I am pleased that this is a widely held view among our European partners.  They now appreciate the need for a balanced response to the challenges we face in the euro area.  This is not an either-or situation, as some who are opposed to the stability treaty would have us believe.  One complements and reinforces the other.  Growth built on further excessive borrowing is not a sustainable solution.  It makes the problem far worse for us now and for the generations to come.This brings me to the contents and implications of the stability treaty.  It will be useful to outline to the House the key elements contained in the new treaty.  Some of the provisions have already been the subject of misrepresentation in the House and beyond and it may be helpful to set the record straight.  One element is the introduction of a deficit brake at national level.  This will require member states to have an automatic correction mechanism in their national laws to ensure they keep within the rules and abide by the requirement for countries with debt in excess of 60% of GDP.  This means keeping budgets in balance or in surplus.  Another element is the restatement of a pre-existing obligation in EU law to have a debt brake.  This requires countries with debt in excess of 60% of GDP to reduce it at an average rate of one twentieth per year.  There is also a requirement for countries in the excessive deficit procedure, as set out in the EU treaties, to have a budgetary and economic partnership programme, the content and format of which is to be defined in EU law.  There is an agreement to support commission recommendations in respect of a country's deficit under the EU excessive deficit procedure, unless a qualified majority is opposed, making it easier to take action against a country not playing by the rules.There is the possibility for a signatory of the new treaty to be brought to the European Court of Justice if its national law is regarded as not complying with the requirements of the treaty concerning the establishment of a national deficit brake.  There is also an ability for the court to impose fines if a signatory ignores its judgment in this regard.  New arrangements are set out for the governance of the eurozone, including provision for at least two Euro summit meetings per year at the level of Head of State or Government, at which the Taoiseach will represent Ireland.  Of particular relevance to the Houses of the Oireachtas is the provision in the treaty for a conference of representatives of the relevant committees of the European Parliament and the national parliaments of countries participating in the treaty to discuss budgetary policies and other issues covered by the treaty.  Arrangements are in place for the treaty to enter into force on 1 January 2013 once 12 euro area signatories have ratified it according to their national requirements.  Countries then have one year to transpose measures into national law.The treaty concludes with a provision that within five years at most, following its entry into force, the necessary steps will be taken with the aim of incorporating the substance of the treaty into the European Union's legal framework.  Significantly for Ireland and other countries currently in stabilisation programmes, it is made clear in the preamble to the treaty that none of its provisions is to be interpreted as altering in any way the requirements of a stabilisation programme, such as Ireland's EU-IMF programme.  The preamble also provides that access to the European Stability Mechanism, ESM, is linked to ratification and implementation of the treaty's provisions.  This is done on the logical and reasonable basis that a country receiving the support of its partners under the ESM should be prepared to run sensible budgetary policies.  That is as much in Ireland's interest as in anybody else's.  None of the provisions of the stability treaty, whether new or pre-existing, should cause any concern for this State.  The requirements placed on us by our EU-IMF programme go considerably further than what is envisaged in its provisions.  What the treaty will do is level the playing field so that all member states - large or small, in the north or in the south - will in future be held to account.  Such a development is good news for Ireland.  It is why the Government has signed up to the treaty and why we are actively advocating for its ratification in the referendum on 31 May.Ireland is already delivering on its commitments, as acknowledged across the European Union and far beyond.  An arrangement whereby all member states play by a set of transparent rules and are seen to do so is good for Ireland.  Such an approach will bring credibility and confidence to the euro and stability to the financial markets.  That is in our interest.  As a small, open trading economy, we need to pay our way in the world.  It is a simple reality that, over the medium term, one's income must cover one's spending.  This rule lies at the heart of the treaty.  It is a question of good housekeeping.  Any other approach would regrettably generate a crippling debt spiral through the addition of ever increasing volumes of debt.  It is our responsibility to face this issue head on and to ensure we do not leave that legacy for those who come after us.That is what this Government is doing.  Failing to do so, on the other hand, would be unfair to future generations and counter-productive in terms of instilling confidence and stability in our economy.  This Government is tackling Ireland's problems.  Unlike others, we realise what needs to be done and are not hiding our heads in the sand.  As I said at the outset, wishing away our unsustainable financial position will not make it go away.  It is only through determined action now that we will get back on track.  This is just as true in Europe as it is in Ireland and is precisely what the stability treaty is about.  It is a necessary step in the process of restoring confidence and stability and it is important that we ratify it.

As well as supporting its passage through the House, we will be campaigning for a "Yes" vote in the forthcoming referendum.  We do so as the party which brought Ireland into membership of what is now the European Union, supported the reform and development of the Union through the years and remains absolutely committed to the idea of nations working together to overcome common problems.  As we said repeatedly before the Government eventually agreed to hold a referendum, if this treaty is a significant one - if it represents a significant step towards resolving the European debt crisis - then it is right that the people be consulted.  Ours was the first party to call for a referendum and the only pro-EU party to do so before the Attorney General told her colleagues there was no alternative.  While we are strongly supportive of this Bill, we are not uncritical of the treaty's limitations and the poor way in which it is being handled.People are rightly suspicious of arguments for treaties which are based solely on past achievements rather than future prospects.  However, understanding the need for this treaty requires an appreciation of why helping the European Union to address key failings is in our national interest.  Equally, it is necessary to counteract the arguments of those who try to dismiss and demonise the Union, failing ever to acknowledge its profoundly positive record in this country.  Even at this moment of deep crisis, the Union's record remains one of having enabled relative prosperity and peace that would have been impossible otherwise.  No other economic, social or political model could have come close to enabling Europe to conquer the types of poverty and violence which previously defined its history.  Only five years before the Coal and Steel Community was established, thus launching the European project, the Continent experienced a deep and severe subsistence crisis, with widespread grinding poverty and simmering conflict.  Ours is a pro-EU party because we recognise this record of profound progress and because the Union provides the only credible context in which a small, peripheral country such as Ireland can succeed.Many people are suffering today because of the impact of the recession.  Unemployment is far too high and living standards are under pressure.  However, we must remember the simple fact that both living standards and employment rates remain significantly higher than they would be if Ireland were outside the Union or the euro.  Membership gives security to those seeking to invest and opportunity to those who want to export.  Hundreds of thousands of jobs are in this country because of our membership of and record in the European Union.  Let us not forget that the Union remains an immense force for good in areas such as equality, education and working conditions.  People can summon up all of their ideological fury to condemn the Union as some elite conspiracy to do down ordinary people, but the reality is that it has done more for the people of Ireland and Europe than any left or right-wing ideology.  We have not seen our people conscripted into a European army.  We have not become a nuclear state.  We have remained in control of key national policies.  The rights of ordinary people have been dramatically strengthened.  Not one credible piece of evidence has been produced to suggest that Ireland could have achieved current living standards and employment levels outside the EU.  The Union's relentless opponents have spent 40 years failing to acknowledge the clear and unambiguous progress it has enabled.  Until they are willing to present a more balanced picture they will continue to be more interested in promoting only their own interests.  All of the evidence is that it is in Ireland's vital national interest that the Union be strong and successful.  This is the core sentiment we must bear in mind in this debate.The treaty cannot be separated from the context in which it was proposed, namely, the deepest recession experienced in Europe since the Second World War.  The mounting crisis in 2008 to 2010 saw the Union completely failing to engage.  It continued to seek to work within pre-crisis policies and the idea developed that the troubles being faced by individual countries were fully their own responsibility.  This is the approach which led to unreasonable requirements on Ireland concerning bank debts.  It also was the approach which caused the Irish and Portuguese bailouts to be required.  The insistence that existing rules would remain unchanged undermined confidence and led to the situation nearly spiralling out of control last year.  It is increasingly clear that the Irish bailout would not have been required had the policies in place today been there in 2009 and 2010.  The ECB's support of the financial system would have directly countered the panic which forced the taking on of unreasonable levels and types of bank debt.  A more secure financial system and the existence of bailout funding would have directly reduced pressures and the dramatic increases in borrowing costs.  The narrative that all problems have had as their cause the failures of individual countries was deeply wrong and it is long past time for it to be corrected.Last year's series of emergency summits and last-minute deals escalated the sense of crisis and directly damaged economic confidence.  The mid-year deal for Greece, which was extended automatically to all current and potential countries accessing bailout funding, was only ever a stop-gap solution.  While the Government was busy praising itself for getting a deal which it did not negotiate and was four times what it had asked for, others began to discuss longer-term measures.  The Tánaiste will recall that in August, it became clear there would be flexibility on providing additional funding for support programmes but only if the legal basis for fiscal control was strengthened significantly.  The process by which this treaty was developed was easily the worst for any treaty between European states in the last 50 years.  It was rushed, there was a lack of proper debate and no effort was made to achieve unanimity, even though the final text is overwhelmingly based on already agreed policies.  Through this process, the only stated negotiating objective of the Irish Government was for something good to come out and that treaty changes should be avoided if at all possible.  As a result of this flawed process, the treaty Members are debating today is important but not nearly comprehensive or ambitious enough.  It is part of the answer to Europe's crisis but nowhere near the full answer, as the Tánaiste indicated in his contribution.This is the first time any Government has brought a proposal for a European treaty to the Dáil without first publishing a White Paper.  Past White Papers have served as a definitive statement of each treaty's implications in an Irish context.  While they may have been read by relatively few people - even some politicians may not have read them - they have provided an essential foundation for debate.  As far as Fianna Fáil has been able to ascertain, during the five months since leaders agreed the main provisions of this treaty, the Government has neither sought nor published a single piece of analysis of its understanding of the detailed provisions of the treaty.  The ridiculous situation obtains in which the Government states it has been advised that a constitutional amendment is required to ratify the treaty but has not explained the reasoning for this requirement.  No detail has been provided to the Dáil or to the public as to what is perceived as so significant in this treaty that a vote is being held against the Government's clearly and repeatedly expressed earlier views.  The Bill's explanatory memorandum is a one-page effort, which simply states a referendum is required for ratification but nothing else.  This is a very bad start to a serious debate about a measure that is an important part of the wider agenda of restoring growth and job creation to Ireland and Europe.  In effect the Government has ignored its duty under Standing Orders and precedent to provide Members of the Oireachtas with briefing sufficient to ensure a fully informed debate.I acknowledge the ongoing and valuable hearings of the Sub-Committee of the Joint Committee on European Affairs on the Referendum on the Intergovernmental Treaty to which Members have alluded.  However, given that Members are holding this debate before it has finished taking evidence or even begun drafting a report, the Government clearly is not overly concerned with paying more than lip service to its work.  Thankfully, the gap left by the Government has been filled by independent experts, who have been active in providing detailed analyses of the economic and legal implications of the treaty.  Their work, most of which has been published, provides a solid independent basis for considering the treaty and reaching an opinion on it.  As I stated previously, Fianna Fáil's position from last year has been that any European treaty should be brought to a referendum, irrespective of whether a legal loophole to avoid a vote could be found.  The effort to avoid one would have been legally risky and would cause lasting damage to pro-Europe sentiment.  It would have made it close to impossible to go back to the people with the more significant changes which are desperately needed and which will come in time.After the final text emerged, Fianna Fáil sought independent legal advice as to the exact significance of what had been agreed.  Although it is a lengthy piece of advice, it can be summarised.  While the treaty involves little that is new in policy terms, it does have significant implication in terms of the legal standing of fiscal rules.  The treaty significantly strengthens rules which for the most part already are part of European law and ratified by this and other countries.  This is, of course, its primary purpose in terms of the restoration of confidence in fiscal management within the eurozone.  In terms of the form of ratification, the relationship between national and international law is not the same in every country.  The only way in which the Oireachtas could safely ratify certain of the commitments in this treaty is through a constitutional amendment.  This is particularly true of the requirement that the fiscal rules not be open to easy amendment within national parliaments.  The fact that this is an intergovernmental treaty between EU member states rather than a full EU treaty is legally extremely significant.  It clearly deprives certain elements of the treaty of the protection from challenge afforded by previous amendments.  At an EU level, there remains a question as to whether the institutions can play all of the roles ascribed to them in the treaty but this is not a matter Members can discuss at this point.  While the comments last December by British Prime Minister Cameron to the effect that the other member states could meet but could not use those institutions may not have been helpful, there is little doubt that someone will take a case on this issue.  It has been reported that a Member of this House is to take a legal challenge to the European Stability Mechanism, ESM, treaty.  Fianna Fáil does not believe this will succeed and the people of this country should earnestly hope it does not.  It manifestly does not come within the terms of the Crotty judgment, as it imposes no limitations on the free exercise of the powers ascribed to different institutions by the Constitution.  Instead, it provides a mechanism in which others are willing to give countries much needed funding.  The willingness of governments to stretch the competencies of the Union to include providing loans to member states has been an extremely welcome development.  The ESM treaty is one that Ireland should wish to ratify and see operational as soon as possible, hopefully with a much larger amount of money available to it.Over the last 12 months, Fianna Fáil has repeatedly raised European issues in this House.  Its concern has been to push for actions which are ambitious enough to tackle the crisis.  Fianna Fáil's leader has set out a detailed position on the specific measures which the party believes should be promoted.  Its basic position is it will support any measures which can genuinely contribute to achieving two overriding objectives, namely, saving the euro while returning the eurozone to the path of growth and stability and protecting the democratic legitimacy of the European Union.  Fianna Fáil believes the future relationship between Ireland and the European Union must be fundamentally based on supporting measures to achieve these objectives and the party has assessed its position on the fiscal treaty in the context of these objectives.  As for the euro, it is important to state it is under pressure but is worth saving.  The positive case for Ireland is that it has directly enabled incredible growth in employment in many areas.  It has aided increased exports of between 30% and 60% to different global regions.  Moreover, these jobs have actually been the most secure in the recession and form part of the strongest parts of our economy.  The negative case is the adjustment which would be required were Ireland to leave the euro would be much more dramatic and severe than even the tough adjustments under way at present.  Ireland would face higher borrowing costs, a much worse business climate and a direct danger to employment in major parts of the economy.In respect of democratic legitimacy, while the holding of a referendum is vital, so too is the fact that nothing is being proposed that undermines the accountability of the Union and its member states to their citizens.  In fact, the co-operation and transparency provisions of the treaty enhance accountability.  Fundamentally the eurozone actually is economically strong.  The problem is it has failed to address three core design flaws in monetary union.  First, the mandate and powers of the European Central Bank, ECB, are too narrow.  Second, it needs a unified system of bank regulation and a single resolution regime.  Third, it needs a more substantial fiscal union, particularly strong fiscal rules and increased funding for investment and I note this treaty delivers an important part of this third point.Sharing a single currency directly limits each participant's ability to act by itself.  Co-ordination and agreed controls are an absolutely essential part of not only a currency union but also of long-term shared growth.  The fiscal rules authorised in the Maastricht treaty and finalised by the Council during Ireland's 1996 Presidency, lack all credibility.  These were repeatedly flouted when it was not necessary to do so and a convincing case developed that a much stronger legal basis was required in order to regain confidence that they will be implemented.  The six pack measures, which were agreed in 2010 and which are now in operation, give much greater depth and substance to the fiscal rules.  They have introduced a new level of transparency and oversight, which makes the type of manipulation of debt and deficit figures practised by some countries in the past almost impossible.  They have also helped restore some confidence among investors.  The most pressing need is to ensure these measures cannot be undermined for short-term reasons.  This is the core of the treaty.  It is a reasonable and proportionate demand, particularly in light of the experience of the past decade and a half.In respect of how the fiscal rules are presented, the Government needs to watch its tendency to over-spin and over-politicise everything.  It is simply wrong to claim that Ireland would have avoided a profound recession if these rules had been in place.  The details of the Government parties' economic analyses and projections in 2002 and 2007 show that they believed Ireland had a strong structural surplus and a secure growth rate of 5% per annum.The main attack on the treaty is that it somehow entrenches permanent austerity here and throughout Europe.  No matter how much the slogan "austerity treaty" is trotted out, it will still not be true.  For this attack to be credible, we would have to see an alternative whereby there would be more money available to be spent on public services and to avoid tax increases.  No such scenario has been provided.  In fact, the accumulating evidence is that this treaty represents the road of the least austerity.  That is a point which must be emphasised.  The treaty will reduce the interest rate we are obliged to pay to borrow money in order to fund the deficit and refinance debt.  If it does so to a comparatively modest rate of 1% over the medium term, this will represent a net saving to the State of over €1 billion per year.The challenge to the opponents of the treaty is that they should put aside their sloganeering and show the people some basic respect by setting out the detail of their alternative.  In other words, they should "show us the beef".  From where do they propose we should borrow money and how can the reduced interest rates which will emanate from the treaty be matched elsewhere?It is also being argued that the treaty ends the ability of the State to invest in growth.  This is also not true.  There are many routes to funding growth available.  The only thing that is ruled out is the use of a structural deficit to do so other than in times of deep recession.  The latter is no more than common sense.  Is there anyone who can credibly claim that Ireland needs the power to run unsustainable levels of borrowing during good times?  That is effectively all that is being prohibited in the treaty.The treaty will have one specific and immediate benefit in that ratification will qualify Ireland for future access to the European Stability Mechanism, ESM.  In the absence of a central bank which acts as the lender of last resort, the ESM is now the essential enabler of market access at affordable interest rates.  The ESM is the most important development of the past year and a half and its absence in the early stages of the crisis caused real difficulties.  Opponents have been stating that this is effectively a blackmail clause.  In reality, what it involves is a demand that countries respect common rules if they want access to common funds.  It would be at best arrogant for any country to turn to the rest of Europe and say "We want your money but we will set our own rules".  We believe the official German position on treaty changes is too rigid and is causing significant damage.  However, the demand that the fiscal treaty be ratified before accessing ESM funding is perfectly reasonable and proportionate.The treaty includes a number of provisions relating to the co-ordination of policy and greater oversight.  Few of these are novel and all are reasonable.  They in no way challenge the basic construction of powers between states and the Union.  There is a serious issue with regard to the manner in which the special council for eurozone leaders has been developing.  Its dynamic is poor and its agenda is far too selective.  The failure of countries such as Ireland to speak out against the highly destructive and insulting behaviour of some leaders is a very bad start to what will now be a regular series of intergovernmental meetings.After December's summit, the Taoiseach announced that there had been no discussion of corporate tax issues even though the communiqué explicitly stated that it had been agreed to proceed to harmonisation through enhanced co-operation.  Others have begun sabre-rattling with regard to the introduction of a financial transactions tax within the eurozone.  These are red-line issues in respect of which this country can never succumb and no one should be in doubt that this referendum confers no legitimacy on the harmonisation agenda.My party will continue to support actively the ratification of the treaty.  We have held our position on the treaty despite the Government's behaviour last year in the context of bringing a new level of petty political partisanship into European matters.  This was most clearly shown by the failure to respect the tradition of consultation among the pro-European mainstream until the referendum became inevitable.  The almost 400,000 people who voted for Fianna Fáil in the most recent general election are an essential part of the potential majority that will be required to pass the referendum.  As matters stand, opinion polls show that over 75% of Fianna Fáil voters are in favour of the treaty.  That is a level of support which is far higher than that which exists among Labour voters.We will campaign on a positive message which emphasises the importance of the treaty as part of a wider agenda.  We will continue to push actively for Ireland to be more active in calling for vital measures such as the fundamental reform of the mandate and policies of the ECB.  At a time of great difficulty, we believe the people of Ireland and Europe are dissatisfied with the timidity and failures of Europe's leaders but that the Union remains a focus of their hopes for the future.  They understand that a return to growth and job creation requires a central role for a more active and powerful European Union and this is what lies behind the high levels of support currently being seen in the opinion polls.  Regardless of how the Tánaiste tries to spins matters, it is obvious that the campaign is being rushed because of these polls.  This may not affect the outcome - hopefully that will prove to be the case - but it undeniably increases the risks involved.  It goes directly against the recommendations of researchers and the Referendum Commission and breaks another promise of the Government, namely, that more time would be provided in respect of preparation for the holding of referenda.The date that has been chosen for the referendum also gives rise to a substantial risk that the future of the treaty will be in doubt as a result of developments elsewhere.  The Tánaiste is wrong when he says there is a growth agenda which can satisfy Francois Hollande's demands.  We know where the latter stands in the opinion polls in his country at present.  Mr. Hollande has clearly stated he will not ratify the treaty until growth issues, such as the ECB mandate, are addressed.  His election to power - if it happens - may not overturn our vote but it would introduce unnecessary risk.The treaty cannot be the end of reforms to address the economic crisis.  It must be a starting point, a foundation for forcing more important measures onto the agenda.  It is a necessary and reasonable mechanism which will reduce the costs of borrowing to fund public services in this State.  It is not a major innovation but is rather a confidence-building measure at a time when such confidence is urgently required.  My party strongly supports the Bill before the House, particularly because it will enable a referendum to be held.  We will be campaigning for a "Yes" vote, based on positive arguments and a belief that working with a stronger Europe is the best route back to growth and job creation.

If he is watching proceedings on the monitor in his office, I urge him to come to the Chamber tout de suite.It is important to state at the outset that Ireland is a member of the European Union.  More than that, Ireland is an ancient European nation, and we must be very clear in debating this treaty - like any other - and not go off on some tangent and imagine we are having some kind of existentialist crisis about who or what we are.  We are Europeans and part of this project called the European Union.  As a small nation we should be a dynamic and positive in the development of that political project.It is important to say that those of us who have been critical of EU institutions, policy and treaties are not, therefore, anti-European.  We have a strongly held view of what this European project must be, how it should be governed and the policy direction it must take if it is to deliver fully for citizens and what could truly be described as a project based on the fundamentals of democracy and the rule of law.  I welcome that there will be a referendum on this treaty and as Government Members know, we argued very strongly for it.  We did so because we believe the citizen ultimately has the fundamental right and responsibility to oversee any significant changes to the Constitution and any major shifts in respect of public policy.  Our people value the right to scrutinise, consider, accept or reject propositions in respect of the governance of the EU and Ireland's place within it.I am very disappointed that the referendum will be held on a Thursday.  If I recall correctly, Members now in government railed very correctly against holding referendums on a Thursday for the simple reason that it caused a difficulty for students in particular who may wish to return home to cast a vote.  I register this with a note of disappointment.  It is clear that the initial intention was for the treaty to be ratified without a referendum.  In February, the German Minister for European Affairs, Mr. Michael Link, let the cat out of the bag when he said that European Union negotiators were seeking to design the treaty in a way that it could get past the Attorney General and not necessitate a referendum vote.  It was clear that the Labour Party and Fine Gael were working hand in glove with those negotiators to try to meet that objective but I am thankful they failed, and the Attorney General's advice was correct.  A referendum would not just be democratically desirable and necessary but it would also be a legal requirement.The people must have their say and the decision must be respected.  It is necessary to say at this juncture that the re-running of referendums on the basis of voters arriving at what would was deemed the "wrong" decision by the political establishment has been a shameful attack on democratic values in the State.  The attack was often spearheaded by Fianna Fáil with the full connivance and support of Fine Gael and the Labour Party.  We need a commitment at this juncture that there will not be a repeat performance of that.  When the people have their say in accepting or rejecting this proposition, all of us, as democrats, are duty bound to accept it.I note that Fianna Fáil has called for comh-oibriú and extolled the merits of what Deputy Ó Fearghaíl called "pro-European" parties working together in respect of this treaty.  He made this statement as if it were a novel advance but it is a matter of public record that Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Labour Party have always spoken with one voice not just with EU treaty changes but on the thrust, direction and dynamic of European policy.  There is nothing new in that.  We need an honest and robust debate and there is no room for scare tactics, auction politics or empty promises of jobs for all.  We all recall the campaign for the Lisbon treaty when the slogan was "Yes for Jobs"; that has been thoroughly discredited and I hope it will not be run again in the course of this campaign.If we take this treaty on its merits and separate it from other strands of European policy and our respective positions on them, the problem is that it is essentially a misdiagnosis of the dilemma we face.  It is just wrong to say that this State is in an economic catastrophe because of runaway public spending.  We are in our current dire circumstances because private banking debt became public debt.

At the time, the Taoiseach informed the world at large that Ireland was in difficulty because we had all gone mad borrowing.  On that occasion the Danish Premier was much more insightful and she best encapsulated what had happened when she argued that we were in a position where banks were too big to fail and citizens were too small to matter.  The sub-committee of the Oireachtas European affairs committee has been commended in this House and it has heard evidence from a great range of opinion, including a wide range of economists from across the spectrum, including those who would be deemed centrists, left or right in their thinking.  What they all have in common is that they have said very clearly that if the treaty had been in place a number of years ago, it would not have seen off the economic catastrophe and it would not have been the panacea for the problems we now have.  Even in the Chamber I have yet to hear any Government proposition extolling the value in concrete terms of this treaty, except with regard to link between the treaty and the European stability mechanism, and our capacity to access funding through that mechanism.  It strikes me that it is the only concrete argument being advanced.

#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	297	We have called that clause linking those two issues a blackmail clause, as that is precisely what it is.  The Government is inviting citizens to set in stone a set of economic policies in a binding international agreement that will, by definition, place serious restrictions on our capacity to borrow, with penalties if we fail to measure up.  Not alone must we take this austerity but the Government is threatening that if we do not, access to the stability mechanism and emergency funding will be ruled out.  By any definition, that is political blackmail.We have noted in this Chamber and I will repeat that it is a matter of disgrace that whoever negotiated these matters on our behalf allowed that position to emerge.  It should never have been permitted to proceed.  There is a real chance that the Irish people will consider this austerity treaty and the implications of billions of euro of further cuts before saying "No, thank you."  They have seen what austerity has done not just to the economy but society.  In those circumstances, the Government would be very foolish and irresponsible to have agreed that as a precondition for access to emergency funding.  I am pleased the Government decided to postpone bringing legislation on the European Stability Mechanism through the House until after the referendum.  That was a wise decision because it does not have any option other than to seek at European level to have the blackmail clause removed.  The Tánaiste may ask how this will be achieved.  The Government knows the State has a veto in respect of amending Article 136 of the European treaties.  As matters stand, bailouts are expressly prohibited at European level.  Germany, specifically its courts and legal system, was anxious about this issue.  For the European Stability Mechanism to be built on a solid legal foundation requires a change to the European treaties, specifically a change to Article 136, on which the State has a veto.  As a matter of protecting the national interest and citizens, it is incumbent on the Government to make clear that neither it nor the citizens of this country will be blackmailed.Let us have a debate and let people consider whether they wish to enshrine austerity in an international and legally binding document.  Let us also be clear that it is the responsibility of the Government to separate the debate from the ability of the State, on behalf of its citizens, to access emergency funding.  I do not share the view of the Fianna Fáil Party that it is fair and proportionate that we sign up to austerity in perpetuity as a quid pro quo for accessing funding.  It is neither fair nor proportionate.  Moreover, it is not sensible because even if the stability treaty, as the Tánaiste describes it, or austerity treaty, as I see it, had been in place, it would not have seen off the economic catastrophe in which we are immersed.The Tánaiste stated he does not want the debate on the treaty to be about tangential issues or to be used by people to sound a note of discontent with the Government.  As the leader of the Labour Party, he should note that his party has taken a confused and inconsistent position on these matters in recent times.  I probably should not have to remind him that a number of Members of the European Parliament from his party correctly voted against the so-called six pack modifications to the Stability and Growth Pact on the basis that the proposed measures were economically misguided and the Irish and European economies did not need more austerity and cutbacks.  They also stated that what was needed was growth.  Austerity and growth do not go hand in hand.  The Tánaiste is wrong to claim one can pursue an aggressive strategy of cutbacks and other austerity measures and expect economic growth.  If he examines the recent past, he will see evidence that austerity damages prospects for growth and has a deep and damaging effect on the domestic economy.Sinn Féin believes the treaty, as with much of the policy that preceded it, is bad for Ireland and the European Union-----

One rarely hears mentioned that Ireland adhered to the rules in place prior to the crisis, unlike France and Germany which were serial breachers of the Stability and Growth Pact.The most basic text on the European Union informs us that the  raison d’être of the modern European Union is growth and employment.  While this is taken as a truism, the treaty will impose greater levels of austerity on citizens for an indefinite period and require an estimated minimum of €6 billion in cuts and tax hikes in this jurisdiction post-2015.  Placing these measures in an intergovernmental treaty turns interim measures into permanent rules, which is a crazy approach.  The treaty will mean deeper cuts in education and health and to a raft of community services.  We will see continued unjust stealth taxes increasing which will punish struggling families and the vulnerable.  The Oireachtas will be undermined and even greater decision making powers in economic and fiscal policy will be handed over to unelected officials.  We should have learned from economic and monetary union that a one-size-fits-all approach to monetary policy was a mistake for the European Union.  Equally, any notion of a one-size-fits-all fiscal approach, particularly one that is embedded in the concept of austerity, would be a major mistake for the State and European Union and one which would have longstanding consequences.

We are told the treaty is about being at the heart of the European Union, yet it is not an EU treaty.  We are told it is about preventing the recurrence of the economic catastrophe that is engulfing the eurozone because it will enforce rules previously adhered to by countries such as Spain which now find themselves at the centre of the current economic turmoil and crisis.  We are told the treaty is about confidence and stability but it continues a policy of austerity that has resulted in a double dip recession, unemployment rates of nearly 25% in Spain and youth unemployment rates of almost 50% in Greece.  We are told the treaty will create jobs by continuing a policy that has resulted in an unemployment figure of 440,000 in this country and led to 76,000 people being forced to emigrate since this date last year.  I hope I am not pointing out the obvious when I note that unemployment, austerity and being unable to provide food for one's children are not the ingredients of stability.I echo Deputy McDonald in cautioning the Fianna Fáil Party and the Government against peddling lies about jobs again.  The previous campaign in favour of the Lisbon treaty was built around the issue of jobs.  Since then, 170,000 jobs have been lost and the 440,000 people who are unemployed have little tolerance for lies about jobs.People have experienced the true meaning of austerity and come to understand it through job losses, the imposition of VAT increases, the universal social charge and bin, septic tank, household and water charges.  Ghost estates have been joined by ghost main streets.  Some 190,000 businesses went bust last year.  In the past five years, 50,000 retail jobs have been lost and a further 30,000 jobs in the sector are in jeopardy.  People are all too aware of what exactly the austerity treaty means.  It means a treaty for unemployment, emigration and the closure of schools, hospital beds and Garda stations.

The austerity treaty will not fix the economy or solve the private debt issue.  On the contrary, it will make the problem worse because the policy inherent in it has already resulted in a double dip recession in Europe.  The current European recession bodes ill for the Irish economy given the Government's decision to put all its eggs in one basket, namely, exports which are highly dependent on the health of the European economy.The fundamentals of the treaty are based on the "six pack" modifications.  Labour MEP Proinsias De Rossa said that the "six pack...legislative package will enforce the EU austerity programme, driving us into recession".  He added that "four of the so-called six pack...are economically misguided..." and will "...kill growth, destroy jobs and derail the economic recovery".  That was the position of the Labour Party six months ago.  What has changed?Article 3 of the treaty basically seeks a structural deficit target and makes it permanent and binding.  It puts the nail in the coffin of Keynesian counter cyclical economic policy.  Article 3 includes a provision for a new structural deficit of 0.5%, while there is also a restatement of the 3% deficit target and the debt target of 60% of GDP.  There is a requirement for the states that breach these targets to return rapidly by reducing the excess portion of their debt ratio by one twentieth a year.  This will inflict budget cuts for years after this Government has left office, and could mean fines of up to €155 million on this State, as has been alluded to previously.  If the US had signed up to this treaty during the Great Depression, Roosevelt's New Deal would not have seen the light of day and the US would not have been lifted out of depression.We obviously have to live within our means and levels of debt and spending are very unsustainable, but let us not rewrite history.  The unsustainable debts that face this State arose through the nationalising of banking debt, which is a process continued by the Government.  The Labour Party Members may wish to catcall on this issue.  They may stand over their position in opposition, but in government they have delivered more money to the banks and more money to the bondholders.  Some commentators have sought to liken the national economy to the household economy.  The analogy is not true.  No householders finding it difficult to feed, clothe or house their families will not seek a loan.  People have also said that keeping budgets correct is like running a business.  The reality is that most businesses go through a period of debt in order to make a profit.  Householders and businesses basically need flexibility to pay down debt when the going is good and to borrow and invest when required.This treaty is a major attack on sovereignty and if we want to see what the loss of economic sovereignty means, we have to look 100 miles north to Belfast.  Many on the Government benches have raised the policy decisions of the Executive.  The reality is that the Executive lacks the power to manage its economy fully and has to look to London in regard to what it can and cannot spend.  It is frustrating, it is wrong, it is undemocratic and it fails the people of the North of Ireland.  That is why Sinn Féin is about bringing those economic policies back to Ireland.  If this Government is comfortable with the idea of becoming a provincial administrator, then it should be honest.  It is not the vision of Sinn Féin, nor is it the vision of Collins, Pearse or Connolly.Partnership within the EU should be based on independent sovereign states working for mutual benefit.  Our relationship with the EU should be engaged, confident, proactive and critical when necessary.  It should be intellectually independent.  Our Government should unashamedly be able to put Irish interests at the heart of its engagement.  Instead, we have Irish Governments that are intellectually deferential, docile and passive in the face of other member states' self interest.  The culture that simply accepts what is being handed down to us is not good for Ireland and is not good for Europe.  Seeking favour by being the best "yes" man in the class and failing to contribute robustly to the debate weakens the quality of that debate, which is necessary to halt the economic slide within the EU.The EU is not the community organisation that people think we joined.  Treaty by treaty, power is being centralised to the French and German core, to the democratic detriment of the periphery.  Self determination and independence are at the core of Sinn Féin's policies.  It was the reason we were founded in 1905 and we still struggle today for full Irish independence.   I believe that self-determination and independence are central to the wishes of the vast majority of Irish people; not for some fluffy, romantic reason, but because Ireland unfree will never receive the economic prioritisation nor focus that it deserves.  The economic policies, designed for the needs of the German and French economic cycle, are more often than not damaging to the Irish economic cycle.One of the major weaknesses inherent in the single currency is the lack of a correcting mechanism to offset German and French centred monetary policy.  Given that Ireland represents 1% of the EU economy, monetary policy is seldom if ever designed for Irish needs.  As a result, we have a situation where we need a flexible fiscal policy to offset the dangers of that negative monetary policy.  This treaty seeks to tie the hands of future governments behind their backs on fiscal policy, while the hands of monetary policy are already tied.  We need investment in jobs in this State.  EU banks need to be cleansed of toxic debt.  Debt needs to be written down and we need a central bank in Europe that will be the lender of last resort.  It is only through those processes that we will be able to re-enter the markets and reclaim our independence.

The Bill gives the Dáil the power to ratify the treaty on the stability, co-ordination and governance of the European Union.  I previously welcomed the decision to have a referendum on the treaty, and I think it is vitally important.  The treaty, appropriately better known as the austerity treaty, contains a number of blackmail clauses and this is the way the Irish people will refer to the treaty when they decide to vote for or against it on 31 May.  The treaty contains a number of provisions and it has been said they simply restate what is already there under European law.  It provides for balanced budget rules to ensure that no state can run a deficit in excess of 0.5% and ensure that states must run a surplus if possible.  It will also require Ireland to reduce our national debt over 20 years, which could mean €4 billion to €5 billion reductions in our national debt every year after 2015.  This is to come on top of any of the austerity that the Government proposes to bring in.  We will have to find this €4 billion to €5 billion.  The treaty enshrines austerity for the future of Ireland and enshrines austerity for those people who have already suffered under four years of punishing austerity.  The treaty contains automatic penalties, where cases can be brought to the ECJ against member states that breach these rules, which can impose fines should they be found to be in breach.  This could have significant implications for us.When Government Deputies spoke this morning about the Bill and the provisions contained in the treaty, they mentioned the three aspects of the treaty that I have just outlined.  It is most telling to list some of the things they did not mention.  The treaty contains a provision where if action is initiated against countries for breaching the rules, a reverse majority vote can be used by those countries to prevent the ECJ taking action.  This means, in effect, that France and Germany, along with one or two smaller countries, would have the power to block the ECJ taking action against the State.  This is interesting because we know that rules in the Maastricht treaty on government deficits and the Stability and Growth Pact were first breached by France and Germany in 2001.  They ignored those rules and the fact that they were in breach of the treaties.  I imagine that in future, the first countries to breach these new rules will probably be France and Germany because we have seen in recent years that they have the power and the might and that they are taking the power unto themselves.They will be able to block the European Court of Justice in future from investigating their breaches of the rules.The Government failed to mention that article 10 of the stability, co-ordination and governance, SCG, treaty, specifically references the stability mechanism to be established within the Union and the ability of countries to access the stability mechanism.  This is also mentioned in the preamble to the treaty where a state which fails to ratify the stability and co-ordination treaty will be unable to access the stability mechanism when it is established under that treaty.  This shows that this treaty and the treaty establishing the European Stability Mechanism are intrinsically linked and these treaties are complementary to each other.  You cannot have one without the other.  Both treaties are designed to operate in a complementary manner and are independent and each treaty acknowledges this to be the case.The Government duly obtained the advice of the Attorney General on the SCG treaty.  Having received it and having considered it at Cabinet, the Dáil was informed on 28 February that because the treaty was outside the EU architecture it would be necessary to put it to the people by way of a referendum.  I respectfully agree with the tenor of the Attorney General's advice.  The SCG treaty is clearly outside the ambit of Article 29.4.3o to 29.4.8o of the Constitution.  Therefore, it must be assessed by reference to the provisions of the Constitution governing domestic competence and decision making, fiscal and budgetary matters and for that reason it will be put before the people.We need to examine the European Stability Mechanism treaty as well.  On 9 March I wrote to the Taoiseach outlining my concerns in regard to the linked nature of the two treaties in regard to the European Stability Mechanism and to date I have not received a response other than an automated e-mail reply acknowledging receipt of the letter.  On foot of that, I lodged a plenary summons with the High Court last Friday seeking a number of remedies from the court and for it to consider a number of question in regard to this.  These questions are relevant to both treaties.Under the ESM treaty a new permanent €700 billion bailout fund, called the European Stability Mechanism, will be set up with the power to call on Ireland, at any time of that's institution's choosing, to make capital contributions of up to €11.1 billion in various forms of capital, including cash.  This is equivalent to approximately one third of Government tax revenue for 2011.  This figure can be increased at the sole behest of the ESM at any time in the future with no limits set in the treaty as to what may be sought from member states in the future.  In effect, the ESM can direct the State to raise sovereign debt, give the money it raises to it and then it can decide where, when, whether and how it is spent.  Therefore, Ireland will not be in a position to control decisions regarding the use of sovereign debt raised by it.  What are the implications of this?  What if a majority of voters in the May referendum on the fiscal compact treaty vote in favour of imposing permanent austerity rules on the country in order to get access to a proposed permanent eurozone loan fund only to discover that the treaty to establish the fund is possibly illegal under EU law and unconstitutional in Ireland and may never come into force?I have asked the court to examine the legality of the amendment of Article 136 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union before any further action is taken by Government to approve that amendment.  That amendment is being adopted under a so-called simplified revision procedure which I believe is legally wrong.  The changes being proposed are so fundamental they should go through the ordinary revision procedure of the EU to ensure proper democratic scrutiny.  They should also require the approval of the Irish people.I have asked the court to consider whether the ESM treaty is in breach of existing EU treaty principles which have been approved by the Irish people in previous referenda and which are now therefore part of our law.  In addition, I have asked the court to decide whether the State can ratify the treaty establishing the European Stability Mechanism without first having the approval of the people in a referendum.  The Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union signed on 2 March 2012 is intertwined with the ESM treaty.  Each is dependent on the other.  If I am right in my belief that the ESM treaty is unlawful then there is a question over the validity of the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union.I call on the Government today not to announce a date for the referendum on the treaty on stability, coordination and governance of the Union until the court can examine the legality of the amendment proposed and give its decision.  I have asked the court to consider that question.  I have asked the Taoiseach to respond to the summons and I have not received a response but I hope he will respond in the coming days.  It is vital we do not ask the people to vote on the treaty on the proposed date of 31 May until after these questions have been decided.  In effect, we are asking the people to ratify a treaty that contains provisions that may well be illegal under our Constitution and under EU law.  That is a very important question that needs to be decided.  I urge the Government not to announce a date to allow these questions to be considered and then, if necessary, to put these questions in total to the Irish people so they can have their say.  I urge that the people should not be blackmailed in the run up to the vote on the stability, co-ordination and governance treaty by the use of the blackmail clause and the inherent threat - although the Government may not mention it during the campaign - that if we do not ratify this treaty, we will be unable to access funds in future.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	308	The treaty on stability, coordination and government, otherwise known as the fiscal treaty, will do nothing to address the appalling effects of the current crisis in capitalism, whether that is in Ireland or throughout the European Union.  On the contrary, if the further savage cuts and austerity that would inevitably follow adherence to this treaty's fiscal diktats were implemented across Europe as a whole it would result in a disastrous deepening of the economic crisis against a background where unfortunately 25 million citizens of the European Union are already unemployed.  This treaty does nothing but dictate a straitjacket of austerity for the working class and the poor of Europe when what is needed is the opposite, namely, a massive public investment programme to regenerate the EU economies and create millions of jobs throughout Europe.  The fiscal treaty is a treaty of despair whereas the unemployed of Europe, the working class, the poor, the pensioners, the hard put upon people of Greece, Spain, Portugal and Ireland need hope.  It is an austerity treaty and that is how we on the left will refer to it from now on.Article 1 of the fiscal treaty sets out the EU's objectives as "sustainable growth, employment competitiveness and social cohesion".  The second paragraph of the preamble to the treaty states "DESIRING to promote conditions for stronger economic growth in the European Union".  The preamble states that achieving these objectives "requires the introduction of specific rules to address this need, including a balanced budget rule and an automatic mechanism to take corrective action".  Article 3 as we know concretises these requirements by demanding structural deficits of 0.5% or 1% of gross domestic product, it demands rapid convergence and a correction mechanism that shall be triggered automatically and it demands that member states enshrine in national law provisions of binding force in this regard in permanent character, preferably constitutional, to be adhered to throughout the national budgetary process.  That is Article 3 of the treaty.  Article 4 demands an automatic reduction of general government debt by 5% per year of the amount over 6% of gross domestic product.  Our contention on the left is that three of the four objectives in Article 1, sustainable growth, employment and social cohesion, far from being progressed through the fiscal measures proposed in Articles 3 and 4, will be irretrievably damaged across swathes of the European Union, with dreadful consequences for ordinary citizens if the treaty is implemented.I draw attention to an article that appeared in yesterday's edition of The Irish Times, written by Paul Krugman, not a socialist for sure but an internationally renowned economist and professor at Princeton and Nobel laureate for economy theory.  His article was headed “European leaders seem determined to ruin their economy”.  He stated that what we are seeing from the leaders of the European Union is complete inflexibility.In March, European leaders signed a fiscal pact that, in effect, locks in fiscal austerity as a response to any and all problems [...]So it's hard to avoid a sense of despair.  Rather than admit they have been wrong, European leaders seem determined to drive their economy - and their society - off a cliff.And the whole world will pay the price.Many other economists and commentators have made similar points.  Even right wing economists in this country, like Professor McCarthy and Dr. Karl Whelan, have severely criticised this treaty as offering nothing positive with regard to bringing about recovery in the European Union.Other commentators go on to suggest that even this being the case, because of the possibility of Ireland being locked out of the European Stability Mechanism fund, there is no choice but to vote for the treaty, vindicating the blackmail clause we have spoken about, the clause that was first explained as blackmail by my colleague and Member of the European Parliament, Paul Murphy.  The diktat that member states that do not ratify the austerity treaty would not be able to access the European Stability Mechanism is outrageous blackmail, and it is disingenuous of the Tánaiste in his introduction to repeat this blackmail clause as a given reality.  It is not.  The Irish Government could still block the introduction of this blackmail clause.  The treaty establishing the European Stability Mechanism had the blackmail clause inserted in February of this year and it is shameful the Irish Government supported that very quietly at the time.  Article 136 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union must be amended to give legal standing to the treaty establishing the European Stability Mechanism and the Government could veto this amendment unless the blackmail clause is removed.  Dáil Éireann must vote on these issues so the situation can be reversed.The budgetary strictures in the fiscal treaty, the automatic correction mechanism and the powers given to the European Commission would mean savage cuts and further austerity in this State and across the European Union.  The Department of Finance estimates that the structural budget deficit in the State could be 3.7% in 2015.  That would require €5.7 billion in extra cuts that year or spread over a number of years and it would be similar with the cuts under the automatic debt reduction diktat.Across the European Union, 18 countries out of 25 that want to ratify the fiscal compact have structural deficits greater than the targets.  If the treaty were to be put in place this year, in 2013, it would mean €166 billion of cuts across the European Union.  This would have devastating effects, adding to the crisis and suffering in so many countries across the EU at present.  The IMF itself has related in a report how, when austerity is applied simultaneously in trading partners, its effects are enhanced hugely.  This is just a treaty for the financial markets and bondholders to make sure they get back even more than their pound of flesh.  It is a disaster for the real economies across Europe.The treaty will involve further austerity cuts and tax hikes to rescue casino capitalism and allow it to continue.  People who oppose austerity, therefore, must oppose this treaty.  The significance of the fact that 50% of households in this country are boycotting registration for the household tax is not properly understood.  That is a massive revolt, not just against this new intolerable burden of taxation but against austerity.   People who oppose that, including those who were coerced into registering, see the baleful effects of austerity.  If those people correctly make the link between that austerity and the further austerity measures in this treaty, they will vote against it and they will be right to do so.  These commentators who say people should not vote on other measures the Government is implementing know that the household tax, the water tax and all the other taxes are involved in this further austerity.  They will be and should be included in people's reasoning for how they vote and why they should vote against it.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	309	According to its own institutions, the values and objectives of the European Union are to advance sustainable development based on balanced economic growth and price stability, provide for a highly competitive social market economy aimed at full employment, social progress and a high level of protection of the quality of the environment, and promote economic, social and territorial cohesion and solidarity among member states.  These objectives are underpinned by values such as respect for human dignity, democracy, liberty, the rule of law and equality.This is not a European Union treaty, however, it is an intergovernmental treaty, and we have been told that was why the Attorney General stated that we require a referendum.  The treaty has been generated using a different set of values from those of the European Union.  I do not what the values of this intergovernmental entity are but I know they are nothing to do with democracy and solidarity.  The values seem to be completely at odds with those of the European Union and undermine those shared values, which is very dangerous.  The former Minister for Justice in Germany is currently challenging the treaty in the courts, saying it has crossed a line because it cedes fiscal powers to an entity, granting decision-making power to political elites rather than devolving democracy to the people of Europe.The Bill's explanatory memorandum states that with a view to securing economic recovery and sustainable growth, the key provisions of the stability treaty relate to the strengthening of rules underpinning the Stability and Growth Pact agreed by EU member states for the euro.  At face value, the document is relatively simple and a purely literal interpretation shows that several provisions will certainly achieve increased co-ordination in governance, although I am uncertain as to the level of stability it can create in the absence of debt write-down.  Not all countries are starting from the same point in this regard.  Some countries are starting from a very unequal position.  Having considered the background to how this treaty came about and particularly the adoption of the intergovernmental approach, I believe it is about putting an insurance policy in place for the core euro states for loans provided mainly to the peripheral states.  There was plenty of cheap money put about to secure a return on it and the states are now putting an insurance policy in place to guarantee that it happens.If this treaty is passed it will have profound implications for everybody in this country, but those on low to middle incomes and those most dependent on the State will feel its impact the most.  It reduces the prospect of a debt write-down and will be a stick with which to beat us.  It imposes a set of rules which include financial penalties for not adhering to the formula.  Essentially, it puts a gun to the head of a state that might need to borrow from the ESM because that mechanism will not be available to a state if it does not ratify the treaty.  Germany, in particular, wanted these rules applied at constitutional level to ensure they were copperfastened and could not be watered down.  One market analyst has said on several occasions that the markets have already dismissed this as a political sop to Germany.  However, if we make the treaty part of our Constitution, all future legislation will have to be in conformity with it.  One cannot adopt legislation that is repugnant to the Constitution.  The Minister for Finance, therefore, will frame future budgets with this treaty as the core.  The other issue is that there is no time limit on this treaty; it is open ended.With that in mind, I wish to refer to some legal issues that concern me.  I have concerns about the wording in that it elevates this intergovernmental treaty to a level equal to European treaties.  These treaties have been inserted differently into the Constitution.  The treaties ceded power from the State, whereby we shared our sovereignty with an entity that had a judicial and democratic elements.  The current treaty contains no democratic oversight.  This is particularly worrying given that the treaty seeks to impose direct financial and fiscal obligations on the State.  The 1972 accession treaty had the same wording.  The Maastricht treaty, which was a consolidating treaty and dealt with governance issues, also contained that wording, as did the Lisbon treaty.  The Amsterdam treaty did not contain that wording.  The referendum on this treaty, by using the same wording, is putting this treaty on the same level as the accession treaty to the European Union.  That is incredibly dangerous.  This is not a democratic entity, but an intergovernmental one.  I have proposed an amendment to delete much of the proposed wording, and this will be dealt with on Friday.  What would be sufficient to achieve what the Government is seeking would be to insert something on a par with what was contained in the case of the Amsterdam treaty.I oppose the treaty and will vote against it.  Nevertheless, I query why the wording in this amendment contains such an explicit clause to elevate this treaty to a level that is superior to all other sections of the Constitution.  Our Constitution is meant to be harmonious but if one elevates certain treaties, how can they be harmonious when they are in conflict with each other?  I believe this intergovernmental treaty is potentially in conflict with the European treaties.Let us consider what the treaty means in practical terms.  The current Government deficit is close to 10% of GDP and we must get it to 3% by 2015.  The Government has decided to achieve that through a roughly two thirds to one third ratio of spending cuts to new taxation.  The Tánaiste, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, told the Labour Party conference at the weekend that there are two tough budgets ahead.  If there were only two tough budgets ahead, we would have some hope.  However, if we adopt this treaty and interpret it literally, we will take away all hope because we will be in a very difficult financial bind in the medium to long term.Over the next three or four budgets we must reduce our current budget deficit by €13 billion.  If we exit the programme, we must reduce the deficit to 0.5% of GDP.  One can see the implications for the country of being so constrained financially.  Indeed, jobs were to be at the heart of this Government's policies, but the jobs budget was watered down to a jobs initiative because there was no capacity to invest in job creating measures in the economy.  While exports obviously remain a natural means of growing the economy, and I acknowledge the efforts being made in that respect, we cannot rely on them exclusively.  International markets remain weak.  Spain's Finance Minister indicated a few days ago that Spain has gone back into recession.  An export-led recovery, therefore, will not happen quickly and will not deliver the number of jobs we need.While undoubtedly trade should be an important element in Ireland's return to solvency, it should not be the only element of the strategy.  Currently, we are locked into a fiscal adjustment plan that strips the Government of any means of stimulating the domestic economy, and ratifying this treaty will continue that.  If we are to reach the 3% deficit target and we do not have the capacity to grow the domestic economy, there will be only two options - cuts in services, which we have already seen, and new and increased taxes, which we have also seen.  On the overall level of Government debt, under the terms of this treaty we will be signing up to reducing our debt to GDP ratio to below 60% by making debt service payments of one-twentieth of the excess each year.  Ireland’s debt to GDP ratio will be 120% by the end of next year, so at a conservative estimate we will be obliged to pay back between €3 billion and €4.5 billion per annum for the next 20 years.  There is also the prospect of incurring fines.This treaty is primarily an insurance policy for the core euro states to ensure they are repaid what they loaned.  There was a great deal of reckless lending just as there was reckless borrowing.  It appears that the member states have become hostages to the money markets.  They have lost sight of the purpose and vision that underpinned the European Union.  There has been an absence of a common vision, an absence of leadership and an absence of a common, workable solution.

The people will be asked for their view on 31 May and before that many of us will have the opportunity to engage with the electorate and explain why the treaty should or should not be adopted.  It is vital to explain to people who do not have the same level of information that is available to us what the treaty is about and how it will provide a level of support for the economy and especially for the smaller, weaker countries in the euro zone.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	311	NAMA was established by the Oireachtas to remove systemic risk to the Irish banking system through the acquisition of land and development and associated loans from participating institutions and to obtain the best achievable return to the State from these acquired loans.Since 2009, when it was established, NAMA has achieved significant milestones, including the valuation, purchase and transfer of relevant loans from the participating institutions.  The establishment and development of the agency itself to carry out the tasks mandated to it by the National Asset Management Agency Act 2009 has also been an important achievement.  The agency is now fully engaged in its core role of managing and selling the assets under its control with a view to achieving the best financial return for the State.  The agency advises me that it has completed its initial engagement with close to 800 debtors.  At this stage, it has assessed 99% of debtor business plans which has enabled it to identify and implement strategies to maximise the returns from the loans and underlying property assets.The recently completed independent Geoghegan review found that NAMA had achieved a lot in a very short time and had done so while building the organisation from the ground up, and all of this while dealing with a very complex issue.  Given the considerable work and achievements of the agency over such a short period, it is clear that its performance to date has been satisfactory.  However, clearly much remains to be done over the coming years to ensure a successful outcome.The NAMA board is reviewing its strategy in the light of developments in the Irish economy and in the property market since it published its business plan in July 2010.  I am advised by NAMA that the key factors which the board considers critical in terms of NAMA's ultimate profitability include the performance of various economies in which its debtors' assets are located, the timing and sustainability of any recovery in the property market in Ireland, the sustainability of the UK property market, the availability of finance and the extent to which it can maximise the level of income produced by its loans and the property assets securing them.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.Following a recent exercise conducted by NAMA, the agency confirmed its expectation to at least break even.  NAMA advises me that it is firmly on course to recoup for the taxpayer, at a minimum, the consideration paid to the participating institutions for the acquired loans in addition to funds advanced to protect and enhance the property assets securing these loans.  Based on the agency's record to date, I have no reason to doubt the agency's confidence that it will achieve its targets over its lifetime, and I have asked the NAMA board to keep me informed of developments.I note that the agency's own projections indicate that it expects to have completed its work within the initially projected ten year timeframe.  This is an issue that will be kept under review.  As the Deputy is aware, the National Asset Management Agency Act provides for an initial assessment by me of the extent to which NAMA has made progress in achieving its overall objectives and whether continuing NAMA is necessary for the purposes of the National Asset Management Agency Act.  This assessment is to be carried out in 2013.  In the interim, NAMA will continue to meet its extensive requirements for accountability, which include provision for the chairperson and CEO of NAMA to appear, if requested to do so, before a committee of the Oireachtas; reporting on a quarterly basis on a wide range of matters, including details in relation to loans, and which quarterly reports are laid before each House of the Oireachtas; preparing an annual statement setting out the objectives and the projections for the performance of NAMA for the year ahead, which again is laid before each House of the Oireachtas; and submissions of annual accounts to be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General which are laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  The Committee of Public Accounts may examine NAMA on these audited annual accounts.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	312	I thank the Minister for his reply.  I am sure he will agree that the performance of NAMA, the most important State agency in our economic history, will be critical to the country in the next few years.  We now have the benefit of almost two and a half years of NAMA being in operation.  The agency has a difficult job of dealing with the fall-out from the collapse of the property market and the construction industry.  It is in a position of absolute dominance in the Irish property market.Last month, NAMA came before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform.  I asked the chairman, Mr. Frank Daly, if he was confident that NAMA would at least break even over the course of its lifetime.  He stated his belief that it would and that he was confident it would.Based on what the Minister knows at this point and accepting that these are still early days, is he confident that NAMA will receive the €31 billion it paid for the loans plus the running costs of the agency?  When does the Minister expect the agency to complete its work and wind up?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	313	NAMA advises me that it recently carried out an analysis which indicated that the agency would repay all its senior bonds by the end of 2020, with a small surplus given one scenario and a relatively small loss given another scenario.  It is predicting a break even, under present circumstances, on the basis of that analysis.NAMA has also provided me with the unaudited accounts to the end of 2011.  These indicate that NAMA expects to generate pre-impairment profit of €1.01 billion in 2011.  Taking an impairment charge of €810 million into account, this should generate a profit for 2011 of €200 million.  The calculation of the impairment charge is, of course, subject to final agreement between NAMA and its auditors and the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I have no function in that process.NAMA also assures me that it expects to make a pre-impairment profit in 2012.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	314	I repeat my key question.  Does the Minister for Finance, as Minister in charge of NAMA, share the confidence of the chairperson of NAMA that the agency will, at least, break even over the course of its lifetime?  The Minister has restated the position of NAMA itself.  We are well aware of that.  It is on the public record.  I want to know the Minister's own view.  Does he agree with what the chairman has said?  Can he confirm that?I also asked about the timeframe for the operation of NAMA.  Does the Minister envisage NAMA completing its work by 2020?  Does he agree that it would be appropriate, given the changes in the Irish economy and the property industry since July 2010, that the business plan should be updated so that we can do a rigorous analysis of where NAMA is today?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	315	It is unreasonable of the Deputy to expect me, in the first quarter of 2012, to take a different view from NAMA about what the situation may be in 2020.  All I can do is to give him the assurances NAMA has given to me and, separately, to the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform.  I accept those figures as the best possible estimate at this time.As I said in my reply, there are many moving parts.  We do not know what will happen in the property market in Ireland.  It looks now as if there is the beginning of slight growth in the property market in Ireland.  We are not sure what will happen in the property market in the United Kingdom or in the economies of countries where NAMA has significant portfolios.  However, on the basis of the information available to NAMA at present, which the agency has shared with me, I share the view of NAMA that it will at least break even by 2020 and will complete its task in accordance with the Act.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	316	As the Deputy is aware, the Government has been committed to reviewing the arrangements that were put in place to capitalise the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC, formerly Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide.  The purpose of this review is to determine if there is a way to reduce the overall cost to the State.  Part of the capitalisation of IBRC was provided using promissory notes as consideration.While the development in relation to the end of  March promissory note payment is positive, we must continue to work towards the greater benefits that would derive from the re-engineering of the promissory note.  There are potential improvements for the banking sector which could also stem from the ongoing technical discussions.It is for these reasons that we must look at the recent developments as an initial step in a process.  This is a medium-term project.  The Government is focused on developing an alternative solution to the promissory note arrangement in IBRC.It is too early at this stage of the process and indeed it would be inappropriate to predetermine what a successful outcome will look like or to indicate how the various stakeholders have reacted or may react to various proposals.  We want to arrive at a successful conclusion that is in the interests of Ireland and the European Union.

This is a sad time for Deputy Doherty.  Ar dheis Dé go raibh anam an Uasal Uí Dhochartaigh.Some of the Minister's backbenchers have been enthusiastically telling the world that the scheduled payment of €3.06 billion to IBRC, which was due to take place on 31 March, did not, in fact, happen.  Of course, the Minister and I know different in that regard.  It would be interesting and important for the Minister to put what exactly happened on the record.  Is it not the case that the IBRC was paid this money from NAMA cash reserves, which are in essence, public money?  Is it also not the case that subject to the approval of Bank of Ireland's board the money will then be reimbursed to NAMA by Bank of Ireland and, in turn, Bank of Ireland will hold it for 13 years and the Irish Government bonds to which the Minister referred in his statement will be repaid by the State in full?  What happened on 31 March was that the State did pay the IBRC €3.06 billion but from a different source than was originally intended.

The second question is that the most immediate consequence of the smoke and mirrors element to this is that there will be a cost to the State of €90 million this year.  The money must come from somewhere.  Where will it come from?  Will it come from cuts or increased taxes and what part of the economy will suffer as a result?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	320	I appreciate the difficulty in understanding every detail of the transaction because it was quite complex.  There were probably simpler ways of doing it but we were not free agents in making the arrangements.  If one looks at it in its totality, the European Central Bank, ECB, provides emergency liquidity assistance, ELA, funding to IBRC - formerly Anglo Irish Bank and the Irish Nationwide Building Society.  That money had to be paid back because some of it was underpinned by a promissory note.  The first repayment is the payment back of money to IBRC which is European Central Bank money.  The bond is being repo'd by Bank of Ireland - if the shareholders agree to the deal, and there is no indication they will not.  At the shareholders' meeting following that, the bond will be repo'd, in other words, effectively turned into cash, but that will be done with ECB money as well, because the money into Bank of Ireland is coming through the liquidity window, which is going into the Irish banking system anyway so that is ECB money as well.  The money which we accessed for bridging finance from NAMA was money which is due to be repaid to the ECB for the loans it gave to NAMA to acquire the impaired assets in the bank.  Again, it is ECB money that is providing the bridge.  What will happen is that when the circle is completed and the shareholders give their consent, which is my expectation, the NAMA funds will be restored and NAMA will do what it intended to do last month, namely, it will repay another portion of what it owes to the ECB.  It has already paid €1.9 billion back last year and it will continue to repay in accordance with its schedule.  There are three different involvements of the ECB.  It is a good deal for Ireland.  There is no doubt about it but it is only one step.  I do not wish to exaggerate it and I did not when I presented it originally.

ISME indicated that 49% of small businesses have difficulties in getting loans currently.  Is it not the case that the Byzantine solution which the Government has concocted will have a negative effect on the real economy?

If one looks at banks all across Europe they are getting far greater quantities of money than the Irish banking system is getting.  It does not impair Bank of Ireland's day-to-day business whatsoever.  I agree with those who have said this is not a full and final settlement.  I said that myself.  It is only a first step which improves the situation for this year
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	329	The €90 million is the estimated difference, for the remainder of 2012, between borrowing under the programme at an estimated 3.5% and the impact on the deficit of the new Government bond.  The State is the ultimate beneficiary as the coupon on the new Government bond is paid to its wholly owned subsidiary, IBRC.My Department is currently updating its macroeconomic and fiscal assessment for the forthcoming stability programme update, SPU.  The SPU will give an update of, among other things, the general Government deficit estimate for 2012, taking account of all of the latest available economic and fiscal data, both positive and negative.  The SPU will be published at the end of the month.  On foot of the Exchequer returns for the first quarter of the year, I am confident we will meet our budgetary targets for the year.The ECB had expressed a clear preference that the financing arrangement would be between IBRC and a bank that was not in majority State ownership.  The transaction would then be financed by Bank of Ireland, through standard ECB money market operations, using the Irish Government bonds issued as collateral.  As NAMA had the funds available, as a short term interim measure, pending the results of Bank of Ireland's shareholders' vote, I directed that the financing of the bond would be through a collateralised facility provided by NAMA to IBRC on equivalent commercial terms as the financing with Bank of Ireland.

The Minister made a statement in the Chamber.  He told us he was spending €90 million of our money and he refused to answer any questions but he did have time for an interview with RTE afterwards.  We have only come back after a two-week gap.  It was very disappointing to be given that little information and not to be given a chance to ask the Minister reasonable questions.  Deputy Michael McGrath and I, and many other Deputies, spent three and a half hours with the Governor of the Central Bank, Mr. Honohan, earlier in the week and the story he gave us of what he believed would happen was substantially different to what we are hearing in terms of the detail now.  There was no mention of NAMA or Bank of Ireland.

My understanding is that the ECB will lend the money when the bond is repo'd to Bank of Ireland at 1%.  What I would like to know is at how much is Bank of Ireland going to lend the money to IBRC and whether Bank of Ireland will walk away with a profit.  The Minister stated that the €90 million additional cost is entirely circular.  I hope it is so that ultimately there is no long-term cash cost to us because it stays within the circularity of the financing, but that is not the case if Bank of Ireland lends the money to IBRC at anything above 1% because then State money will go to Bank of Ireland in which we only have a small minority stake.  Could the Minister confirm the rate at which for at least the nine months in question Bank of Ireland will lend the €3.1 billion to IBRC?  Could he also confirm that the Bank of Ireland will or perhaps already has borrowed the money from the ECB at 1%?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	333	I will deal with the €90 million calculation first and then with the second part of the Deputy's question.  The €90 million is estimated to have an incremental impact on the Exchequer which is calculated as follows.  The status quo was estimated as the cost of borrowing under the programme for the promissory note instalment, namely, €3.06 billion at 3.5% for the remainder of 2012 giving an interest cost of €80 billion.  On 29 March, before the Government bond was issued it was estimated that the bond power value would be €3.53 billion.  The coupon was known to be 5.4%.  In 2012 the interest cost was therefore €140 million.  There is also a technical adjustment under the Government accounting rules which increases the deficit impact to €170 million.  The €90 million was therefore the difference between the estimated status quo of €80 million and the estimated deficit impact from the new Irish Government bond of €170 million.  The cost to the Exchequer arises from the interest payable on the Government bond not on the margin which Bank of Ireland is getting.  Bank of Ireland is a commercial bank of which 15% is in State ownership.  Of course it is doing this because it is going to make money on it.  Their margin is 135 basis points above the cost of the money.  As Deputy Donnelly correctly states, the money is coming at 1%.  Of course, that is cheaper than the average cost of funds.  The alternative was that we would go back to the European funds, the EFSF fund or whichever fund would provide the funding, where it would cost us on average 3.5%.  Because we are getting it cheaper, there is a margin.  There is a cost, but if one sets the €90 million off against the fact that we are not borrowing an additional €3.06 billion in 2012, one can see that there is a big advantage because that €3.1 billion remains as money on which we can call if we need it, for example, next year.

If we take 135 basis points on €3.06 billion over nine months, there is approximately €30 million for Bank of Ireland out of the deal.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	343	The recent IMF World Economic Outlook report, and its chapter on household debt, is a useful contribution to the range of measures being considered to address the global economic situation.  However, it should be noted that the examples examined in the report in the chapter dealing with household debt related to particular countries and times, and that some of the debt restructuring examples investigated were more successful than others.  Therefore, the particular circumstances of each individual case was a relevant factor in the outcome of the action.  While one should seek to learn from previous examples, it is also important to exercise caution in drawing general conclusions from the report and applying them to the current Irish economic position.  Indeed, in their public comments on the report, the IMF staff indicated that they were not stating that such a blanket approach should be taken in the case of Ireland and, indeed, indicated that, in cases of constrained fiscal space, which unfortunately is the position Ireland currently faces, a targeted case-by-case debt restructuring approach may be the most appropriate approach.  This case-by-case approach is consistent with the recommendations of the Keane report on which the Government approach to address this problem is broadly based.  The current funding situation of the Irish fiscal and banking sectors are also relevant factors to be borne in mind.On the issue of bankruptcy reform, as the Deputy will be aware, the Minister for Justice and Equality, and Defence, has developed a detailed general scheme of a personal insolvency Bill, which was published for public consultation earlier this year.  A significant number of submissions were received in response and these, along with the detailed report by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality on its hearings on the scheme, will be taken into account by the relevant Departments and the Office of the Attorney General in the finalisation of the Bill.  Ireland is maintaining close contact with the IMF and the other troika authorities in the development of its personal insolvency reform proposals and also on the wider approach to tackle mortgage arrears problems and will take full account of their views in the further development and implementation of these proposals.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	344	The main legislative response of Government to the crisis of personal indebtedness and mortgage arrears is the personal insolvency Bill, the heads of which were published in January, and it has since been considered by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.  I want to focus on one of the three instruments in that Bill, the instrument dealing with secured debt such as mortgages, that is, the personal solvency arrangements.  The Minister co-sponsored this Bill with the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, and I want to ask him how it will work in practice and what he sees as the benefits of this arrangement for distressed mortgage holders.  For those who are in mortgage arrears whose income is not sufficient to meet their obligations, can the provisions of this Bill result in a reduction of the mortgage debt as a result of a personal insolvency arrangement?  Can the Minister outline what the benefits of such an arrangement could be for distressed mortgage holders?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	345	The Bill is being drafted.  It is never the practice in this House to discuss detailed measures in a Bill which has not yet been published.  We will get to that at Committee Stage.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	346	I am sure the Minister agrees with the comments of the Taoiseach and Tánaiste in recent weeks that there is a frustration, which they themselves share, about the lack of progress and the lack of urgency in dealing with the mortgage arrears crisis.  The Government has held up this Bill as being the centrepiece of its response.  The Government accepted, at Second Stage, a Fianna Fáil Bill in October last which would have set up a non-judicial debt settlement system.  They are not proposing to set up their own one and one of the key elements of that is a personal insolvency arrangement which will deal with secured debt.  There are thousands of mortgage holders out there who are asking the simple question of what potential benefits can such an arrangement in general terms bring for those who are experiencing genuine mortgage distress.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	347	We want provision in law, as was explained by the Minister, Deputy Shatter, and myself when we launched the heads of the Bill, that is not a full bankruptcy hearing to drive mortgage holders into a bankruptcy position where bankruptcy legislation was never intended to deal with the problems of somebody with an impaired mortgage.  We have also decided that it is insufficient from a policy point of view to leave case-by-case arrangements with the lending authorities to the discretion of lending authorities without the force of law underpinning it.  The proposal to which Deputy Michael McGrath refers is to give judicial recourse, short of full bankruptcy proceedings but also well in advance of voluntary arrangements, and that is the space we are trying to fill.  The legislation in that respect is being drafted in accordance with the head that is published.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	348	As the Deputy will be aware, the latest review mission by the external partners is currently taking place.  It began yesterday, Tuesday, 17 April and will continue until Thursday, 26 April.  The review mission comprises of a significant number of meetings designed to evaluate all the elements of the programme covering fiscal developments, the macroeconomic outlook, progress on commitments regarding restructuring the financial sector and structural reform.After the mission to Ireland is concluded, staff reports will be sent to the ECOFIN Council and the IMF executive board for approval, thus facilitating the next round of disbursements of EU-IMF funding.Verification of the relevant quarterly targets forms a key part of the mission.  The Government has repeatedly stated its commitment to the programme targets.  Meeting these conditions on time and on target is the best way to ensure we emerge successfully from this programme, which is our primary focus.  That would mean we can return safely to the financial markets for funding in as timely a manner as possible.  This is one of the principal objectives of the programme.  The Government's commitment to the programme does not stop us from seeking and agreeing changes to aspects of the programme.  We have already done this successfully.  The Government will continue to do so at the appropriate time.Following each review mission, and arising from detailed and lengthy discussions with the troika team during it, revised versions of the programme documents, including the Memorandum of Understanding on Specific Economic Policy Conditionality, are prepared by my officials before being submitted to the external partners.  It would be premature at this stage to comment on the possible outcome of these discussions.However, it is also important to note that the relevant programme documents are made publically available at the end of the process.

It was a situation where Opposition parties had an opportunity to represent their constituents to the troika, and also to find out if the troika and the Government were on message or was there a deviation between the message that both separate organisations were giving out.  I read in their statement yesterday that they indicated the proximity to the treaty referendum was the reason.  However, many remain sceptical on that issue.  Many believe it was the Government that requested the troika not to meet the Opposition parties.I would like the Minister to go on record in that regard.  The initial response was very vague and much of the information is general.  Will the Minister put on record the detail of what issues are currently being negotiated with regard to the memorandum of understanding and in particular his intention with regard to the National Pensions Reserve Fund and its use for potential job creation?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	350	The decision by the troika not to meet Opposition party members on this occasion was a decision made and announced by the troika.  They make their own arrangements when they come here on how they will relate to different groups in society, different Departments and so on.  That is what they have done on this occasion.On the programme, the first thing we always do is to have a general weighting to set the scene, and we had that yesterday afternoon.  They gave their view of how the programme was proceeding and the Minister, Deputy Howlin, and I gave the Government view of how the programme was proceeding.  Following that, there are then a series of meetings with officials, principally from the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform but also from other Departments.The first task is to see whether, at the end of the quarter, the Irish Government has fulfilled all the conditions in the memorandum of understanding.  When one fulfils the conditions, which we have done, that is a bit of a box-ticking exercise, and it only becomes an issue if one has not fulfilled the conditions.  However, it is a very important box-ticking exercise because unless one ticks the boxes, funds can be withheld.  Therefore, one needs to meet all the conditions of the memorandum of understanding for the quarter before one can draw down funds from the various funds in the future.  We then look to the future as well and, obviously, we will have full discussions on that later in the week or early next week.

Has the Government asked in any way so far for use of the National Pensions Reserve Fund for job creation?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	352	They informed the Department of Finance, which informed me and my officials, and, of course, I informed the Government that they were not meeting the Opposition on this occasion.  I suggested that a formula that might suit their concerns would be to meet the finance committee of the House, on which all parties would be represented, and to do it in public session because they had a fear of being misrepresented when they meet in private.  They decided they would not take up that option.  I would have no problem if they were to meet.The other alternative, given the Deputy obviously wants his views to be known to the troika, is that they are always available to take written submissions.  If he wants to write out his views and send them to the Commission representative, who is the chair of the troika group, I am sure they will consider those.  It could be as effective as an oral submission.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	353	At budget time, over four months ago at this stage, my Department projected that the economy would expand by 1.3% this year, which was in line with the prevailing consensus at the time.  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, in its recent report, outlines that the macroeconomic forecasts underpinning the budget were appropriate at the time.  However, the council also outlines that the recent data, both Irish and international, mean that this projection is now on the high side and points out that other forecasters have recently revised downwards their projections for growth in the Irish economy this year.  The council also acknowledges there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding prospects for the Irish economy.In terms of the macro forecasts, I broadly share the view of the council, that is to say, the forecasts were appropriate at the time of the budget but developments since then have been a little disappointing.  Officials in my Department are assessing all available information with a view to publishing revised forecasts at the end of this month in the stability programme update.Turning to the public finances, this year's general Government deficit must not exceed 8.6% of GDP.  Budget 2012 forecast the 2012 deficit at 8.6% of GDP.  It is worth noting that the troika's forecast is also for a deficit of 8.6% this year, but based on a lower estimate of GDP than my Department projected at budget time.The end-March Exchequer returns show that taxes have made a good start to the year, performing better than expected in the first quarter and close to 4.5% ahead of profile on an underlying basis.  This is a welcome development as we strive to reduce further the deficit in our public finances.  While voted expenditure showed some pressures, I am confident it will be actively managed within agreed limits and I know the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform will be stressing upon colleagues the importance of adhering to the 2012 spending targets, as was done in 2011.  As I stated at the time of publication of the first quarter returns, the figures illustrate that we are on track to meet our deficit target this year.
#PeadarToibin	unknown-#PeadarToibin-party	unknown-#PeadarToibin-dob	unknown-#PeadarToibin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	354	Given that growth figures are probably the most important determinant of the success of the Government programme, and in my view and that of many others it is the one that actually receives the least amount of attention and investment, and given that growth projections have been revised down three times, most recently by the Irish Central Bank, is it not the case that the Government is at this stage in danger of not meeting its obligations with regard to the troika?  What contingency plans has the Government put in place in case this happens?  Might there be a situation where a mini-budget is necessary if those obligations are not achieved?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	355	I am quite confident that we will meet our target of 8.6% on the deficit this year.  Budgets are built not on real growth but on nominal growth, because it is nominal growth that generates tax.  The nominal growth we built the budget on was 2.5%.  Even with a growth rate of 0.7%, which is on the average and is where the Fiscal Council is coming in, the inflation rate as last measured by the CSO was 1.8%, so the nominal growth is still 2.5%, which is what the budget is based on.  In addition, 2011 ended up better than expected and the outturn was below 10% against a target of 10.6%.  Therefore, we are quite confident, with tax revenues well ahead for the first quarter.  While there are some problems on the expenditure side, my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Howlin, is dealing with that and ensuring Departments stay within budget.The Deputy can forget about mini-budgets and all that kind of stuff at this stage.  A better line of attack would be that if growth rates go down, then activity in the economy slows down.  This does not necessarily impinge on our budgetary targets but I would like to see greater activity in the economy.  Our model is export-led growth, so we are very dependent on how the economies in our customer countries are performing.  The mark-down is not due to anything that went wrong in Ireland.  It is the consequence of things going wrong across Europe, in China and in the United States.  However, we believe there will be a better second half to the year.
#PeadarToibin	unknown-#PeadarToibin-party	unknown-#PeadarToibin-dob	unknown-#PeadarToibin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	356	There are many issues I could take up with the Minister.  Given the fact Europe has gone into a double-dip recession, putting all the eggs in the export growth basket is causing difficulty, according to the figures.  The Minister must have an idea of a tipping point growth figure, whereby if growth went below that figure, major difficulties would arise and a mini-budget would be necessary.  If the Minister does not know that, there is a major difficulty because it is important that level of knowledge is inherent in Government.  In the interests of transparency and clarity, will the Minister identify what the tipping point growth figure is that would cause such an eventuality?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	357	We had three years of continuing decline where the economy in nominal terms went down by about 20%.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	359	In our first year in Government, 2011, the economy grew by about 1% and it is growing again this year.  As long as the economy is growing, we are getting out of the problems we are in and we are driving forward.  The Deputy cannot question that but he can question the pace of the recovery.  If we have to mark down growth figures, it slows the pace.  I would prefer if the economy were growing faster but there is nothing we have done or nothing that is intrinsic to the economy at present which is reducing the growth forecast.  We are importing consequences from other economies and, as our model is based on export-led growth, events across Europe are very important, as is sentiment in Europe, the UK and the US, as these are our big customer countries.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	360	This is very difficult to understand.  The Minister seems to be saying that a downgrading of growth projections does not have consequences in terms of likely increased austerity, and he seems to be very sanguine, if one likes, about the downgrading of growth projections.  Does the Minister accept that downgrading the growth projections has something to do with the extreme depression in the domestic economy resulting from the impact of austerity?  The Minister suggests that the key issue is what occurs in the rest of Europe and in our export markets and so on.  Is the point not that growth projections are now being downgraded because the same austerity is being imposed in those countries, shrinking the potential markets for our exports?  This appears to be confirmed by emerging figures for January and February which suggest that our trade surplus has reduced substantially in these months.  Are these not worrying indications that austerity is simply not working, that it will kill off growth and that it will require yet more austerity from the Minister and other Governments throughout Europe to meet their targets?
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	361	I assure the Minister that Fianna Fáil does not share Sinn Féin's appetite for a mini budget.  I believe we stand a good chance of meeting our fiscal targets this year.  As the Minister is aware, 2012 and 2013 will be more difficult.  Some €90 million must be found this year because of the fallout from the promissory note arrangements and the shortfall on the household charge may amount to €40 million or €50 million when the dust settles.  This means there will probably be a shortfall of €130 million or €140 million from these two issues alone.  Where will the money come from?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	362	One could pick any figure but one should examine the matter in its overall context.  We expect to collect approximately €36 billion in taxes in 2012.  Already, we are almost €400 million ahead in the first quarter.  Let us consider the debt servicing costs.  I have explained the €90 million additional cost on the promissory note.  The debt servicing costs for the first quarter are €70 million below the estimate.  One is dealing with swings and roundabouts all the time and one cannot be absolutely precise.  Deputy Boyd Barrett should note that one cannot be precise about trade figures.  Let us consider the February trade figures.  There are 28 days in February and 29 days when it is a leap year.  If a large settlement comes in on 1 March, it is reported in the March figures.  One cannot hang one's hat too much on one month's figures; one must consider it overall.We marked down growth rates.  I do not interfere with the forecasting unit in my Department.  It is independent in its assessment of the data.  I expect it will mark down the figures again at the end of April.  I am simply suggesting that from a fiscal point of view we will still meet our targets.  Naturally, if growth is lower it will have an effect on the overall economy.The Deputy's analysis is always based on an idea of Keynesian economics.  The Deputy's whole focus is on demand-led initiatives.  He appears to take no cognisance of the supply side of the economy.  Much of what we have done involves supply side initiatives because we do not have the wherewithal to carry out a demand stimulus.  I agree with the Deputy without gainsaying.  If I had several billion euro and I could use it to stimulate demand, I would have a list of projects in my pocket to which I could put it quickly.  However, we must play the hand of cards we have.  We can play strongly on the supply side and we have done so.  Let us consider what we did in the tourist industry earlier in the year.  Everyone is aware that had a considerable effect on the restaurant trade.  The 21 small initiatives related to the financial services industry in the Finance Bill are beginning to have a small effect.  We will proceed in this way.  I hope we can encourage our European partners to loosen the purse strings and follow up the rhetoric of growth and jobs with specific proposals.  This is becoming centre stage in Europe now.  We will welcome this with open arms and we will have shovel-ready projects for any money we can get.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	363	The Deputy may be aware that a working group was set up between officials of my Department, the Irish Road Haulage Association, IRHA, and some Members.  The working group is discussing several issues of concern to the haulage industry.  The Deputy will understand that I cannot pre-empt the outcome of these discussions, which are ongoing.  A fuel rebate system, as sought by the IRHA, could not under EU law be restricted to Irish licensed hauliers but would have to be extended to all vehicles intended exclusively for the carriage of goods by road with a maximum permissible gross laden weight of not less than 7.5 tonnes.  In addition, the rebate would have to include the carriage of passengers by a motor vehicle of category M2 or category M3 as defined in Council Directive 70/156/EEC.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	364	I thank the Minister for his response.  The question was prompted by a call from an owner of a haulage business who employs more than 50 people.  He has informed me that he will have to let them all go shortly because the pressure of costs is becoming unbearable.  He cited problems with washed diesel undercutting his business as well.  He said he would not have contacted me except that the matter was most urgent.  He said his business is on life support.  Is it possible for the Minister to give any indication of when the working group will finish its deliberations?  When will it be in a position to report?  Does the Minister have any information on the impact on the haulage industry caused by the high price of diesel and the illegal washed diesel on the market?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	365	It would be a mistake to time-limit discussions of a working group so I will not put a time limit on it.  However, there appears to have been a good exchange of views to date as well as serious discussions on the proposals made by the Irish Road Haulage Association.  Irish hauliers are impacted in the same way as those throughout Europe.  Diesel and petrol prices have gone up throughout Europe.  In comparison with our nearest neighbours in the United Kingdom the imposition of excise on diesel and petrol in Ireland is significantly lower.  VAT on diesel and gas can be reclaimed while VAT on petrol cannot be reclaimed by hauliers but most of the lorries use diesel.  The option to reclaim is available.  The argument that an increase in the VAT rate is having an added imposition is questionable.  Perhaps there is an imposition on cash flow but not on the bottom line because those involved can reclaim it.It is a competitive business.  At the same time there is a good deal of extra business because of the increase in exports.  There is a good deal of hauling to the ports and into Europe but it is competitive business.  Those who require the services of hauliers have cut margins because it is so competitive.  The talks are ongoing.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	366	I thank the Minister for his comments.  I imagine the Minister will agree that this is an important business and that many of our exports depend on it.  They are also competing with companies that have their origins in other EU countries.  Will the Minister comment on the phenomenon of washed diesel?  What is the extent of it?  What is it costing the Exchequer annually?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	367	It is difficult to say what it is costing the Exchequer annually but certainly there is widespread abuse.  The Deputy will recall that I took measures in the Finance Bill to ensure there will now be full traceability of diesel and petrol from the point of import through to the point of sale.  Previously a licensing system was in place if one was providing diesel to pumps.  However, if one had a business in which one was providing central heating diesel or green diesel to the farming community, no licensing was required.  The was a gap in the traceability and that gap has been filled in by the Finance Bill.  The Revenue requested this and suggested that it was an important measure to crack down on the laundering of diesel.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	368	I wish to bring up a related point and broaden the issue to ordinary consumers and motorists.  The price at the pumps has reached a crippling level of approximately €1.70 per litre of petrol.  Since VAT is the last element to be added to the price - it is applied to the excise-inclusive price of diesel and petrol - it is yielding a windfall for the Exchequer.  Does the Minister have any plans to examine the issue and give some relief to motorists who are dealing with exorbitant fuel prices at present?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	369	This came up in Europe in the crisis in 2004 and again in 2007 and 2008.  There is agreement throughout the community that when there are spikes in the price of transport fuels Governments will not alter the taxation element.  What the Deputy is saying about VAT is correct, namely, that it applies to the total price.  However, the increase from 21% to 23% at budget time, with petrol selling at approximately €1.50 per litre, amounted to an add-on of approximately 3 cent.  I accept that this goes on the total price at the end, so it is more like €1.70, but the point is that the spike is not due to tax increases.  We imposed no excise increase on diesel or petrol in the last budget.  There was a 2% VAT increase and a €5 carbon charge per tonne, which equated to approximately 1.5 cent on a litre.  Rather than tax increases, it is international events, in Iran and in the Middle East in general, that are driving the cost of fuel.  There is a spike at present and it is very difficult for people.  It should also be noted that there is no windfall for the Exchequer as a result of these increases.  What happens is that people who have to use their car to get to work will make savings elsewhere.  In other words, they are spending more on fuel and less on something else.  While the Exchequer takes an additional amount on VAT from fuel, it loses VAT on other parts of the spending profile.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	370	I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 10, 26 and 29 together.The Government has been committed to reviewing the arrangements that were put in place to capitalise Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC, formerly Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society.  The purpose of this review is to determine whether there is a way to reduce the overall cost to the State.  Part of the capitalisation of IBRC was provided using promissory notes as consideration.  While the development in regard to the end of March promissory note payment is positive, we must continue to work toward the greater benefits that would derive from the re-engineering of the note.  There are potential improvements for the banking sector which could also stem from the ongoing technical discussions.It is for these reasons that we must look at the recent developments as an initial step in a process.  This is a medium-term project.  The Government is focused on developing an alternative solution to the promissory note arrangement for IBRC.  It is too early at this stage of the process - indeed, it would be inappropriate - to predetermine what a successful outcome will look like or to indicate how the various stakeholders have reacted or may react to various proposals.  We want to arrive at a successful conclusion that is in the interests of Ireland and the EU.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	371	On the basis of what the Minister is telling us it is difficult not to see this entire negotiation and the debate around it as a complex accountancy trick to convince people that progress is being made on this issue when, in fact, very little is happening.  If I understood correctly, he said we do not have to borrow the €3.1 billion this year but that this will have an effect on our deficit to the tune of some €90 million.  Will the Minister clarify whether that is the consequence of this rather complex arrangement?  If our deficit is increased as a result, does this mean there will be a corresponding requirement for additional cuts in expenditure in order to meet our deficit target of €8.6 billion?  Setting that aside, does he accept that whatever deal he is pushing for will make absolutely no difference in terms of the austerity being imposed on ordinary people?  He is essentially confirming the Government's commitment to pay Anglo Irish Bank's €30.6 billion in gambling debts, plus interest, while merely expressing the hope that this interest, pending negotiations, will be somewhat reduced over time.  Not only has he confirmed the Government's intention to repay all of the bank's gambling debts but the period for which the Irish people will be subject to austerity, which is further enshrined in the fiscal compact, will be extended.  The reduction in our debt to GDP ratio which is required under the compact will be affected by the fact that this €3.1 billion is simply being kicked down the road.  Does the Minister accept there will be no let-up in austerity but instead an extension of the period of austerity?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	372	It is difficult to reply to that contribution, but I will try to do so.  There are two policy streams involved here.  First, we must get to a point where what we collect in tax matches what we spend.  As long as we are running deficits, there is a large gap between the two.  That is the fiscal side of it, and we have committed to reducing the deficit to €8.6 billion at the end of this year, to below €7.5 billion next year and to 3% of GDP by 2015.  The other aspect is that we want to return to the markets and to be able to borrow again and repay our debt.  One influences the other, but the promissory note issue is really about the sustainability of the Irish debt position and improving our possibility of returning to the markets rather than having much to do with the annual budget.It is true that an extra €90 million will have to be paid as a result of the arrangement, which must come out of the 2012 figures, but there is no need to make any adjustments because we can cover this amount, as we see it at present, within the figures in the budget.  As such, there is no question of any additional expenditure cuts.  As I said already, debt servicing in the first quarter is €70 million behind where we estimated.  There is always slight movement on figures within the context of a budget which comprises €36 billion in tax plus a significant borrowing requirement after that.  In that context, €90 million is within the swings and balances of the budgetary position.  We will not be making policy decisions as a consequence of this deficit adjustment other than that we are aware of it and it must be paid.

I acknowledge the progress made to date as a result of the very tenacious stance the Minister and Government have adopted in regard to this issue.  Is it possible to speculate at this stage as to the alternative options it may be possible to pursue in the context of a potential restructuring of conditions attaching to the promissory notes, having regard to the likely support for same from other member states, particularly those in the eurozone?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	374	As I have said on several occasions, we are pursuing the possibility of achieving a full deal on a replacement of the promissory note with a mechanism which would, in general terms, lengthen the period of repayment and reduce the interest rate to make it significantly easier on the Irish taxpayer.  However, we are not looking for any write-offs or anything like that, because it was made quite clear when the Greek deal was done that it was a unique arrangement for that country.  Deputy Boyd Barrett asked a similar question, to which I offer an analogy.  If one opts to replace a five year term loan involving very onerous payments with a type of mortgage arrangement over 25 years, one will end up paying more but the annual payments will be much less burdensome.  Moreover, by the end of the repayment term, growth and inflation will have eliminated much of the burden of the debt.  One should bear in mind that most national debt is not repaid, rather it is serviced by paying the interest on it and then it is rolled over.  As a factor of GDP, it reduces dramatically as the years go by in a growing economy with some inflation.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	375	Is the Minister's claim that we can cover the €90 million deficit increase as part of the swings and roundabouts of the budgetary position not slightly disingenuous?  He is saying on the one hand that there is no impact and, on the other, that there is an impact but it can be covered.  Another way of putting this is that we would have an extra €90 million if this were not done, which would necessitate fewer expenditure cuts.  This means that however the Minister frames it, come the next budget, €90 million less will be available for expenditure on public services and the people.  Furthermore, no matter how the Minister might construe it, will taking on this debt burden not have an extremely suffocating effect on the overall economy?  In the Minister's discussions with the troika, have its members given him an explanation to the question asked by Vincent Browne among others?  What justification, moral, economic or otherwise, have they given to the Minister for asserting the people of Ireland are obliged to pay back the gambling debts of Anglo Irish Bank?

This is the question I want to ask the Minister.  The Taoiseach has stated in this Chamber that in all negotiations, including those in respect of the bondholders and the promissory notes, the present Government has never sought, is not seeking and will never seek any write-down in the total quantum of debt Ireland ultimately will owe.  He has made that statement in this Chamber and the Minister may even have been sitting beside him at the time.  Other Ministers have flatly contradicted that assertion outside this Chamber and have stated that Ireland has negotiated hard for write-downs.  The Minister himself signalled a welcome search for a write-down in senior Anglo Irish Bank debt from the New York Stock Exchange.  As the person who I imagine to be the key negotiator, can the Minister confirm whether he and Ireland's negotiating team have ever looked for, are looking for or will look for a write-down in the total quantum of debt?  I ask because Members have heard directly contradictory views from Cabinet members.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	386	The position always has been absolutely clear, which is that the Government will only act with the full permission of the European authorities and, in particular, with that of the European Central Bank, ECB.

I apologise but this is an extremely important point.  That was not the question, as I understand the position of the ECB and the Commission.  Directly contradictory claims have been made by members of the Cabinet and this is extraordinarily important.  Despite what is the ECB's position or despite what it has told the Minister, has the Minister or Ireland's negotiating team ever challenged that?  Has that team ever indicated that although it understands the ECB's position, it still seeks such a write-down and has it ever set out the reason?  Everyone is familiar with the reasons and the Minister has stated previously that he would like such a write-down.  Everyone understands the moral reasons and no one has argued the case better than did the Minister when in opposition.  Has the Minister sought the write-downs, which it was heavily suggested he would do, as the Minister for Finance in waiting?

#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	396	The Minister will acknowledge the history of Ireland's bank related debts is a little more nuanced than he set out a few moments ago.  As the Minister is aware, shareholders lost approximately €60 billion, depositors were repaid in full - I am sure all Members agree this was the right thing to do - and junior bondholders lost approximately €15 billion.  The only people left to take the hit for the losses were either taxpayers or senior bondholders.  Since 2008 and right up to the present, the position of the ECB has been that senior bondholders would not contribute a single cent.  Consequently, the only people left at the end of the queue or on the hook are the taxpayers.  This is what happened as, guarantee or no guarantee, ECB policy ensured this would be the outcome.  Since the Minister announced the arrangement regarding the promissory notes, the language of the ECB has been quite hardline.  Essentially, it does not care, once it is repaid its money through the Irish Central Bank.  Why would the ECB not deal directly with the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC, in respect of this bond?  Is it because it will not deal with a dead bank?  It is accepting a bond, in effect, from Bank of Ireland but will not accept the same bond from IBRC.  What was the requirement for coming up with a cumbersome structure involving NAMA and Bank of Ireland?  Why not go directly with the bond from the IBRC and receive the money from the ECB?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	397	First, I agree with the Deputy's summary of the various groups that took losses as a result of the collapse of the Irish banking system and it is good to have them put in summary form like that.  I refer to the problem of the taxpayer being the last in line and accepting the total burden because the bondholders have the support of the ECB.  That is as a result of the deal the previous Government did on the night in question, which was the time to have done a better deal to share the burden.

On the question of the ECB taking a hard line, I agree it takes an extremely hard line.  The Deputy should recall what happened in Greece during the biggest write-off in history, which was comprised entirely of private sector involvement as not a single euro of European Central Bank debt was written off.  It refused to get involved in writing off any official debt, even though it was holding a large quantity of Greek bonds.  The ECB is very hardline and they are hard people with whom to negotiate.  The Government secured an arrangement on this occasion which the ECB did not oppose.  However, as for the project on which the Government has now embarked, it undoubtedly will be tough.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	409	The budget day forecasts were for GDP growth of 1.3% this year and GNP growth of 0.7%.  These figures were in line with the prevailing consensus at the time.  Moreover,  it is worth stressing that the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, in its second assessment report, outlines that the budget day macroeconomic forecasts were appropriate at the time.  Since then, forecasts for growth in some of our major trading partners have been revised downwards, while available data suggest that domestic demand - mainly personal consumer spending and investment - may be slightly weaker than assumed.Having said that, not all of the recent economic indicators have been negative.  For instance, the latest data provide tentative indications that the labour market may be stabilising, while purchasing managers indices have been moving in the right direction over recent months.  Consequently, there is a lot of uncertainty.  Officials in my Department are assessing all the available information with a view to producing revised forecasts at the end of this month.  These will be published in the stability programme update, which all member states in the EU are producing as part of the so-called European semester.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	410	This is similar to a question taken earlier.  I take it from the Minister's response that the revised forecasts have not yet been finalised.  However, he has indicated clearly a number of times that a further downward revision is anticipated.  Such a revision took place on budget day last December and another will take place at the end of April.  However, the Minister also has indicated it will not affect directly the achievement of the fiscal targets in 2012.  Nevertheless, the Minister must be concerned by the analysis carried out by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council on the impact of nominal GDP being 1% lower, between now and 2015, than the Department's projections to date.  Nominal GDP being just 1% lower than what has been forecast is a highly possible scenario.  In such circumstances, the debt to GDP ratio would reach 125% and continue to rise rather than moving on to a downward trajectory.  The Minister must be concerned, not so much about the short-term impact in 2012 but rather with regard to the impact in later years in the context of realistic growth rates being achieved.  He must also be concerned about the impact the latter will have on fiscal consolidation.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	411	I take the advice of the fiscal advisory council very seriously.  The council provides very good analysis, which is carefully worked out, and offers prudent advice.  I will certainly take cognisance of the advice we receive.  We are taking steps to grow the economy.  As the Deputy is aware we have a very detailed job-creation plan in place and this is being driven forward strongly through the provision of quarterly reports.  We hope that despite the difficult circumstances in our customer countries, we will continue - as was the case last year - to grow the economy.  If we could achieve stronger growth rates, these would obviously be of benefit to everybody.  We are living in times of great uncertainty.  That uncertainty continues to hold sway across Europe.  It appears that the United States is emerging from the difficulties in which it found itself but the position in this regard is not absolutely certain.  I would not like to make predictions in the first half of this year - over which I could be expected to stand - until matters settle down.  One can speculate and be optimistic but there is quite an amount of volatility abroad.  It is, therefore, difficult to build a model in respect of the accuracy of which one could vouch as we move towards 2015.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	412	The Minister seems to be basing his outlook on a defiance of gravity.  At some point, the revising downward of forecasts for growth - such revisions are pretty much universal at present - has an impact on actual growth.  The Minister appears to be stating that despite this and an analysis which he says he takes seriously and which projects a reduction in growth - this will eventually translate into a reduction in growth in our customer countries and in our economy - that growth is actually going to somehow continue here on foot of measures the Government is introducing.  However, the fiscal advisory council has stated that this is not going to happen and that regardless of what the Government does growth is going to slow down, both here and in our customer countries.  Is there not a sort of blind optimism on the Minister's part in respect of or a refusal to face what is clearly coming down the tracks?  I take the point that we cannot solve matters on our own but does this not prompt him and European leaders to question the entire policy that is being pursued?

He is dressing up uncertainty as potential growth, etc.  Both Ireland and Europe have re-entered recession and exports are being hit.  Some 50,000 people in the retail trade here lost their jobs in recent years and 1,800 businesses went bust in the past 12 months.  In addition, 76,000 people - nine every hour - emigrated from the State last year.  The list of statistics which damn the Government's economic policies is as long as both of one's arms.  The Government appears to have a completely unrealistic view of or just simply does not know what is happening among ordinary people in this State.  Each year, growth forecasts and tax receipts are revised downwards.  It is time the Government began to revise its own policies in the same direction.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	414	The Deputies are constantly mixing up two different policy positions and trains of thought.  I am stating that for 2012, the marking downwards of the growth rate will not affect our ability to achieve the 8.6% target in respect of our deficit.  On the evidence of the figures for the first quarter and in the context of an assessment of nominal growth in the economy, we will still realise that target.  If we revise growth figures downward, it is, of course, a reflection that we estimate that less economic activity will take place here.  This has an effect on job creation and is a development about which we are disappointed.  However, we intend to address any of the causes of this development which may be internal in nature.  In so far as the external causes are concerned, we will do our best in Europe to ensure that more demand-led programmes are put in place.  I accept that the latter is not the main trend in Europe at present.  We cannot influence the situation in the UK, which is one of our biggest customer countries.  The US is having an impact because its economy is beginning to grow-----

#JerryButtimer	unknown-#JerryButtimer-party	unknown-#JerryButtimer-dob	unknown-#JerryButtimer-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	421	I thank the Ceann Comhairle's office for selecting this issue for discussion.  The matter to which I wish to refer is of particular importance to me and the people I represent.  There is an absolute need for the Government to consider introducing penalties in respect of landlords and tenants in circumstances where anti-social behaviour occurs in private rented accommodation in respect of which the Department of Social Protection is paying rent allowance.  Where the State is contributing towards the renting of a property, it should have some power to ensure that the law of the land is respected.  In addition, it should have the ability to ensure that landlords and tenants respect those who live in neighbouring properties.  Landlords and tenants must be obliged to obey their legal obligations.  In circumstances where the State is paying rent allowance, the most effective form of enforcement would be to either reduce or withdraw that allowance where anti-social behaviour occurs.I could take the Minister to parts of my constituency - particularly areas in Bishopstown and Douglas - where there are many rented properties which are located in quiet and, in many cases, mature residential areas.  In these places there is often persistent anti-social behaviour and excessive noise, such as through the playing of loud music.  One can also see broken windows and rubbish dumped on neighbouring properties.  In addition, one can witness raucous behaviour that is often threatening and intimidating in nature.  The result of this is that people cannot enjoy living in their homes.  In some cases, they cannot even have a quiet night in.  Those to whom I refer have been intimidated and the Garda has had to be called.  Even where action is taken, the type of behaviour I have outlined recurs either a few hours or days later.The most galling aspect of this matter relates to landlords who are not proactive and who fail to engage in respect of properties they own, the tenants of which have been identified as giving rise to problems.  We must take action in respect of those landlords who are only interested in obtaining access to rent allowance, who do not care about the state of their properties and who believe the feelings of those who own neighbouring properties to be irrelevant.  In some instances, both landlords and tenants are becoming out of control.  The most effective way to deal with these individuals is for the Government to take the initiative and ensure they are severely punished.  This can be done by affecting the amount of money being paid to the tenant and landlord by the State.The Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB, was set up to be the place of refuge for residents experiencing difficulty with tenancies or landlords.  I know of two recent cases where there has been blatant disregard for the law but the punishment was a measly fine of a couple of hundred euro for the landlord.  That means nothing to a landlord and the tenants had no penalty imposed, so they continued their behaviour.  The landlord, owning many properties, continues on while laughing at us.  This issue does not relate to just one landlord but a growing number of landlords who have no respect for anybody.  It is time for us, on behalf of the citizen, to take charge of the matter and assume leadership.  I am not interested in penalising either the landlord or the tenant but both should live up to their responsibilities.  We must act against misbehaviour and I look forward to the Minister's response.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	422	I thank Deputy Buttimer for raising the issue.  At the outset I point out that social welfare legislation already provides the Department with the authority to refuse, suspend or terminate payment of a rent supplement in the case of a person who has been required to deliver up possession of a dwelling provided by a housing authority or an approved body where the reasons for that requirement include anti-social behaviour or the interests of good estate management.  The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.  The overall aim is to provide short-term assistance and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer.  There are currently approximately 95,000 rent supplement recipients, for which the Government has provided a sum of €437 million in 2012.In the case of private rented accommodation, tenancy arrangements involve a contract between the landlord and tenant.  The Department has no relationship with the landlord and tenant behaviour is a matter for the landlord in the first instance.  There are a number of avenues open to landlords in such cases, including the dispute resolution services for landlords and tenants operated by the Private Residential Tenancies Board and recourse to the Garda Síochána or the courts in the enforcement of law relating to anti-social or criminal behaviour.  If necessary, the landlord may seek termination of the tenancy, which if effected would result in the termination of rent supplement.The programme for Government contains a commitment to review the operation of the rent supplement scheme to ensure tenants receiving long-term support from the State under the scheme are subject to the same type of anti-social behaviour regime as local authority tenants.  The most appropriate way for this to happen is for local authorities to take over responsibility for meeting the accommodation needs of these individuals.  The Department is currently working with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government with a view to achieving this goal and the transfer of tenants from rent supplement to local authorities will help to achieve another key Government commitment of removing barriers to employment and returning rent supplement to the original intention of being a short-term income support payment.
#JerryButtimer	unknown-#JerryButtimer-party	unknown-#JerryButtimer-dob	unknown-#JerryButtimer-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	423	The Department of Social Protection and the HSE should be involved in this process, and I welcome the prospect of proactive engagement.  I will quote from a recent adjudication from the PRTB in regard to two recent cases with which I am familiar.  It states "the behaviour of occupants and a visitor to the dwelling on numerous occasions constituted anti-social behaviour, in particular in the disposing of refuse in neighbouring gardens."  It also states:The steps taken by the respondent were inadequate to address the anti-social behaviour and breaches of obligation by the tenants.  As a result of the breaches of obligation by the occupants of and visitors to the dwelling, the applicants were directly and adversely affected such that their quality of life, safety and security in their own homes were harmed and inconvenienced.That is from the report of an adjudicator within the PRTB but all we did as a State was impose a fine of a couple of hundred euro.  The landlord is laughing at us and continues to show disrespect while tenants are being paid by us to live in accommodation.If the State is paying money to a landlord and tenant, they should not be allowed to victimise, terrorise and intimidate people who have bought their own homes or are renting in the area, living up to their responsibilities.  They are decent and law-abiding citizens.  In her reply, the Minister indicated we are paying €437 million for this in 2012 but for how long will a minority be allowed to dictate to the majority?  I would be glad if representatives of the Department of Social Protection, the HSE or the PRTB adjudicator could go into these areas, meet the affected people and understand what they have had to endure.  We are paying €437 million but allowing such behaviour to continue; we must stop it at some stage.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	424	I understand the difficulties faced by Deputy Buttimer's constituents.  That is why there are two specific avenues for dealing with this in the programme for Government.  The first is to transfer long-term rent supplement to local authorities, which have housing expertise.  They have the powers to deal with tenants who are misbehaving and causing significant distress to people living nearby.  In the programme for Government there is also a commitment to introduce arrangements whereby people on rent supplement would be subject to the same conditions as people who are direct tenants of local authorities.  If we can achieve both of these aims, and particularly the transfer of the bulk of tenancies with long-term rent supplement recipients to local authorities, we will have dealt with the issue.Last October community welfare officers left the HSE and joined the staff of the Department of Social Protection.  As the Deputy noted, these staff used to be in the HSE but are now officials of the Department.  Our aim for long-term reform is to have the bulk of long-term tenancies transferred to the local authorities and run under local authority conditions.
#KevinHumphreys	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-party	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-dob	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	425	I thank the Minister for taking this matter, as I know she and her Department are focused on reforming this area.  The Pathways to Work scheme will do much to provide focus and a plan of action for helping people get training and advice for getting back to employment.  I regularly encounter people who fall through the gaps in the system of labour activation, as they are not eligible for some types of training.  The recession has greatly changed the composition of those on the dole and people who have never relied on social security or protection are now finding it difficult to navigate the system.  I am worried about many stories I have heard about people working for many years, contributing to the State through taxes and PRSI, suddenly finding themselves in part-time work for a period and later becoming unemployed.  They are often married or in long-term partnerships.  Initially people are eligible for jobseeker's allowance but they can fall through the gaps as they would not be entirely reliant on social welfare.  If there is another income in the household, it may not be enough once mortgages, bills and college fees for upskilling are paid.  This often means that when an entitlement expires, these people can no longer access community employment schemes, re-training or upskilling programmes run by the Department.I will cite a recent example of such a case, which involves a woman who worked in the same company for 20 years.  When her employer experienced trading difficulty, the woman took a pay cut and moved to a three day week for a period.  She signed on for a social welfare payment as a part-time employee but was later made redundant and was paid the full rate of jobseeker's allowance.  She went through the national employment action plan process and sought to access training.  However, she became ineligible for community employment, upskilling or retraining when her entitlement to jobseeker's allowance expired.  I regularly receive queries from people who have fallen into the same trap and do not qualify for training or upskilling programmes that would enable them to return to work because they no longer receive a social welfare benefit.The individuals affected by this problem belong to the coping classes, in other words, those who have worked throughout their lives to put their children through college.  Having reached their late 40s or early 50s, they are being thrown on the scrap heap because the current rules prevent them from accessing training programmes that are offered to many other people.  The shortest period that any of the individuals who have contacted me has been in full employment and paying tax and PRSI is 23 years.  Despite being in full-time employment for 30 or 35 years, the individuals in question find they are not entitled to back to education allowances or to participate in upskilling or training courses because their partner is working.  I ask the Minister to ensure this issue is examined in her Department and look forward to her reply.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	426	I thank Deputy Humphreys for raising this issue.  The Department of Social Protection operates a range of activation measures which aim to assist and support social welfare recipients of working age to engage and re-engage with education, training and work experience with a view to reducing their dependency on social welfare and ultimately to assist them in gaining employment.  The Department has estimated expenditure of €970 million on employment supports in 2012, up from €861 million in 2011.  This increase in spending of €109 million against a backdrop of significant fiscal consolidation underlines the Government's commitment to enhancing support for employment.  Overall, the Department will offer 85,650 job placement, work experience and education initiatives in 2012.The Pathways to Work policy, which was launched by the Government on 23 February, incorporates the establishment of the new national employment and entitlements service and commits to a new approach to the provision of services for unemployed people.  The objective is to reduce the level of long-term unemployment and ensure those who are unemployed will be provided with appropriate advice, support, education and training to take advantage of new job opportunities as the economy recovers.  This reform will give effect to the policy principle that people have both rights and responsibilities as part of the activation agenda.Activation interventions under the Pathways to Work approach will be based on client profiling.  The key benefit of the profiling approach is that it will identify those who are most likely to fall into long-term unemployment at an early stage.  This will enable early intervention and intensive engagement with those individuals who demonstrate characteristics that suggest they may move into long-term unemployment.  The profiling system will facilitate differentiation in the services provided so that each customer receives the level of support and intervention that is appropriate to his or her needs.A high level policy review of certain activation measures is nearing conclusion.  The review examines, among other matters, the eligibility criteria, payment rates and duration of participation of certain activation schemes, while also examining the interaction of the schemes with a view to concluding if the current suite of measures can satisfy the current and future activation needs of the Department and its customers.  It encompasses work programme and placement schemes such as the community employment scheme, rural social scheme, Tús and JobBridge, while also examining measures that support education, training and self-employment, such as the back to education allowance, technical assistance and training scheme, technical employment support grant and both the back to work enterprise and short-term enterprise allowance schemes.
#KevinHumphreys	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-party	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-dob	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	427	I thank the Minister for her reply and welcome her statement that a badly needed review of the system is under way.  We have created a poverty trap by precluding those who are not in receipt of payments from the State from accessing training and education supports.  Having committed to considerable expenditure, for example, meeting the costs of college for their children or repaying large mortgages, the families in question are struggling.  They are falling through a gap because they do not receive State benefits.Many of those who have been made redundant after 25 or 30 years in employment have skills that are outdated and are no longer required in the current market.  They are anxious to be retrained but when they present themselves at the offices of what used to be known as FÁS to avail of retraining opportunities, they are refused assistance.  This group is growing larger by the month.  It is unacceptable to refuse people training and upskilling opportunities or back to education allowances because they are not in receipt of a State payment.  The individuals in question have paid high rates of tax for the past 25 or 30 years and have probably never been unemployed.  This anomaly in the social protection system is being ignored.  It is, however, probably close to the Minister's heart because she, like many other Deputies, will have encountered similar cases in her constituency.  I ask her to take a special interest in this group which has been discriminated against in recent years and ensure the matter is redressed in the review.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	428	I share the concerns expressed by Deputy Humphreys.  We are trying to recast the social welfare system to change it from a system that has been largely passive to one that becomes active.  Among the key issues in the type of scenario the Deputy describes is to ensure early intervention and early access to information and knowledge about how one qualifies for a placement and to secure for the individuals in question a placement, training, work experience or educational opportunities.  I note the cases raised by the Deputy probably refer to people who are married to partners who are in work.  For this reason, they become dependants, as it were, when their benefit expires, even though, as the Deputy noted, they have been working for the past 20 or 25 years.It is important to ensure an early response in such cases.  We are trying to do this and have brought into the Department the former FÁS employment services which generally handle opportunities for the type of person Deputy Humphreys describes.  We should be able to build up a profile and picture of what we can do to help those in this position much earlier than is the case at present.  Losing one's job after 20 years is often a disaster for the individual concerned.  It is difficult for persons in this position to find that, having paid into the system throughout their employment, the system does not respond to their needs.  I will revert to the Deputy as we complete the review and roll out reform in the Department.
#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	429	Jonathan Spollen is 28 years old, six feet tall and from Ireland.  He was last seen on 3 February 2012 in Rishikesh in the region of Uttarakhand in northern India.  Mr. Spollen works as a writer and editor for the International Herald Tribune in Hong Kong.  His father, David Green, and some family and friends visited the Rishikesh area to search for Jonathan, while his mother, Lynda Spollen, is co-ordinating all efforts here.The picture that has emerged is that Jonathan was mostly travelling in the Rishikesh area in January 2012, near the German bakery area.  He was on a trek from 14 to 28 January.  His trip to India was recreational and he had previously been travelling with a friend.  He came back from this trek with a tummy bug and a slight limp after a tumble near a waterfall.Jonathan's Indian visa would have expired on 21 February 2012, which is relevant, given that as a journalist working abroad he would have been conscious of ensuring that his visa situation would not be prejudiced by passing the expiry date.  His last telephone call home was in the early morning, Indian time, of 3 February 2012.  He had at that time been planning to go to Delhi but had changed his mind and seemed to be intent on going on another trek in the Rishikesh region.  Communications with his family had been good up to that point.  He indicated he would be gone for two to three weeks, but he did say that he would be in touch with his mother in two weeks' time.  Jonathan has not contacted his family since then and in late February, his mother and father raised the alarm with local authorities, the Irish Embassy in India and with family and friends.Around 11 March 2012, some of Jonathan's belongings were found by a small waterfall halfway up the road to Phool Chatti, nearby Rishikesh.  It looks like he was camping there.  This has meant that the authorities have given more priority to the search.  However, any further diplomatic efforts will no doubt ensure that maximum resources and skill are devoted to this effort.  Among his belongings found were his backpack, containing travel documents, a book and the usual things one would expect such as shampoo, basic medicines for upset stomach, headache, and so on.  On investigation at the location, the police also found his sleeping bag and some clothes.On 12 March 2012, another confirmed sighting of Jonathan emerged since the conversation he had with his mother on 3 February.  He was in Lakshman Jhula, Rishikesh, between 12 and 14 Feb 2012, where he spoke with a lady for some time as they were both reading the same book, Shantaram.  They discussed the book and generally chatted but the conversation did not turn to anything that may be relevant to the search.Numbers far beyond what the local police force could be expected to provide are required here.  Volunteers are needed and fund-raising efforts are being co-ordinated from Ireland.  The Minister of State may have seen posters for table quizzes and other events happening in and around Dublin, as well as much activity online.  Anything the Minister of State and the Government can do at the highest level would be incredibly helpful here.  As time goes by, these things always become more difficult for everybody involved.  If we can help in some way to keep up the sustained effort until we can find Jonathan and bring some news for his family, that would be incredibly important.  His family needs our help in this matter urgently.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	430	I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue.  My Department has been providing consular assistance to the family of the missing person since being notified of the matter on 27 February this year.  The Irish Embassy in New Delhi alerted the relevant authorities immediately on becoming aware of the matter and asked that full assistance be given to the person's family in tracing the person.  The embassy also confirmed details of the person's Indian visa and checked with the Indian authorities as to whether an extension had been granted.The person last made contact with relatives on 3 February 2012 from the town of Rishikesh in the state of Uttarakhand in northern India.  The terrain of Uttarakhand is generally mountainous, comprising Himalayan ranges and their foothills.  Much of the lower mountains and foothills, including the Rishikesh area, are densely forested.  The capital of Uttarakhand is the city of Dehradun.  The embassy assisted the family with the process to release the person's telephone records from Vodafone.The town of Rishikesh is situated on the Ganges, which is sacred to Hindus, and has a population of around 75,000 people.  It is often described as the gateway to the Himalayas.  The town itself is at an altitude of approximately 350 m, so its climate is comparable to the plains of northern India.  Winter prevails until mid-February, but temperatures generally remain in the 10° to 20° Celsius range.  Steep hills and mountains surround the town and are accessible by paths.  Temperatures drop considerably with the increase in altitude.  The town is an important access point for a number of Hindu shrines higher up in the Himalayas that are spiritually significant to Hindus and as such, the town caters to large numbers of Indian pilgrims.  However, the four most important shrines are situated at an altitude above 3,000 m and remain closed or inaccessible in February due to snow.Rishikesh is also a centre for outdoor pursuits and attracts many visitors seeking to explore the natural beauty of the Himalayas.  The town has many travel companies offering mountaineering, trekking, rafting, kayaking and so on, and it attracts many backpackers.  Trekking options during February are limited due to climate conditions.On 11 March, tourists found some of the person's personal possessions in the Rishikesh area.  A consular official from the embassy travelled to the region and met local and state authorities, including the state director general of police in Dehradun, Uttarakhand.  In addition, the embassy made a formal approach to the Government of India, asking for a full search of the area in which the belongings were found.  A search was subsequently carried out, but unfortunately the person concerned has not been located.  The consular official also met the family and friends of the person, who had travelled from Ireland to assist in the search.The embassy has also advised the family on various sources of local information, such as travellers' fora, which have allowed the family to tap into the travellers' network and get additional practical help.  The ambassador of Ireland to India has met the person's father and other family members and the embassy remains fully engaged with this case.

The family and friends have not given up the search, and neither should we.  I urge the Minister of State again to make contact at the highest levels with the Indian authorities, at a national level and within the region, to see what further assistance the Government can provide and to see if we can renew efforts to find Jonathan Spollen.  The media can also play a huge role in creating awareness and in helping the family and friends to raise money for the efforts that are under way.  People can go on to the website, findspollen.com, to express support, to help and to make donations to the campaign.  It would be very helpful to all the efforts that are under way if that could be reported as widely as possible.

The embassy is well aware of the matter and is dealing with it, but I will bring to its attention the Deputy's point that the relevant Indian authorities be contacted at national and local level and how the local media can maximise awareness through articles about what has happened and how the website can be used for donations and assistance.  We will bring that to the attention of the embassy and we will try to ensure every effort is made.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	433	Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for the opportunity to raise the matter here.  I have raised it a number of times with the Minister because of its relevance to the industry at present.Irish farmers will face a superlevy fine of approximately €20 million as the industry exceeded the milk quota by approximately 1% last year.  Europe will be around 5% under quota this year. Under the current inflexible quota system, Irish milk production is stagnating while New Zealand, a major competitor, is ramping up production by between 8% and 10%.  Denmark took over the European Council Presidency in January 2012.  Denmark has exceeded the milk quota in the past two years.  Five member states - Denmark, the Netherlands, Austria, Cyprus and Luxembourg - exceeded their dairy quotas in 2010-11, resulting in a superlevy of about €55.57 million, despite the fact the EU was 6% under quota.  While places like Bulgaria only filled 50% of their quota and our neighbours in Britain under-filled their quota by 10% in the 2010-11 marketing year, Irish farmers are being placed under serious pressure to curtail production.  In light of the fact that Ireland came only slightly under quota for the 2010-11 milk quota year and in view of increased production in the Irish dairy industry, we are calling for the introduction of a European wide quota system replacing the current national quota system.  This would allow for an orderly expansion of the Irish dairy industry prior to the ending of milk quotas in 2015.During Question Time on 6 October 2011, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, indicated there were prospects for some agreement on butterfat correction.  He stated that Ireland would be able to increase its quota in 2011 by between 1.5% and 2% in addition to the 1% we receive under the soft landing policy.  I want to know from the Minister of State if any progress has been made on this matter.Adjusting the butterfat correction is one method to address the production problems.  Another way to address the issue is allowing the industry to sell outside of the EU, thus avoiding distorting the market at home.  These destination guarantees would appease opponents of changing the system due to their concerns about milk prices.  This would empower the European dairy industry with an orderly expansion that could protect farm-gate prices by enabling market growth rather than through wastage of product, market stagnation and constrained productive capacities.The Irish dairy industry is at a critical stage.  It has the capacity to make a significant contribution to the regeneration of the Irish economy at this time.  The opportunity exists to do it.  We need to examine the quota system to allow for increased production and we need to do that urgently.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	434	I thank the Deputy for raising this issue at the right time of the year, the beginning of the quota year.  We know that if it were not for the price of fattened cows and the prices secured for the export of cows to England that young farmers in particular would have been badly affected.  They were encouraged by dairies and others in the industry to enter the industry and then they were abandoned when got into a super levy situation.  We all have to join forces to ensure something is done about it.The decision to abolish milk quotas with effect from 1 April 2015 was made in the context of the CAP Health Check in 2008.  Ireland strongly supported their abolition on the basis that quotas were widely regarded by both the Irish dairy sector and market analysts as a brake on the potential of the Irish dairy sector to respond positively to market opportunities.  In addition to bringing an end to the quota regime, the health check also provided for a soft landing towards the post-quota situation, with an expansion in annual production allocations through five 1% annual quota increases and an adjustment in butterfat content calculations, the results of which mean an overall increase of about 9.3% in the 2014 national quota allocation compared to that of 2007.Strong market prices over the past year and the prospect of a quota-free environment post-2015 have meant that remaining within quota has been a challenge for farmers who are preparing for the new regime.  This combination of factors has resulted in high milk production levels in particular during the past month and Ireland is likely to incur a super levy fine for the first time since the 2007-08 milk quota year.  The precise level of the oversupply has not yet been established but the Department expects to be in a position to publish an estimate shortly.  The levy is 28.6 cent per litre over quota and hopefully it might be around half of the figure the Deputy mentioned.  Ultimately, responsibility for the management of milk quota rests firmly with milk producers whose responsibility it is to ensure that the enterprise produces within quota.  It is on the basis of this clear understanding that the milk quota regime has operated since its establishment in 1984.Since entering office, my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, has been working hard at EU level to seek additional flexibility in the milk quota regime to allow Irish farmers to respond to the increased demands without incurring super levy fines.  To that end he discussed the matter extensively last year with other EU agriculture Ministers, both bilaterally and at the Council of Ministers, and with the Commissioner.  Furthermore, officials from the Department have raised and continue to raise this issue at every available opportunity at appropriate EU level meetings, and at bilateral meetings with other member states.Among the options discussed in regard to a soft landing are to have the front-loading of the remaining quota increases, a reduction in the super levy, a further reduction in butterfat correction levels, or a kind of EU flexi-milk arrangement which the Deputy mentioned, which would operate provided EU production overall was within quota.Most attention has been focused on the butterfat correction, primarily on the basis of administrative and procedural simplicity, which has the potential to increase the quota available to Ireland by approximately 2%.   A coalition of member states involving Ireland, Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium and Cyprus formally put a specific proposal to the Special Committee on Agriculture for an adjustment to the butterfat correction mechanism.  Unfortunately, the Commission has consistently resisted attempts to reconsider this issue, as it has resisted attempts to revisit the outcome of the 2008 CAP Health Check agreement in an overall sense.  This is a view which is supported by many member states, who are firmly opposed to any further adjustment to the health check agreement.It is also the case that only a minority of member states are likely to be adversely affected by the current quota restrictions.  Therefore persuading a qualified majority to agree to an adjustment of the current regime, which was itself agreed after a protracted and difficult negotiation, represents a significant challenge.  There are currently no signs of a breakthrough and it is critically important that milk producers have realistic expectations in this regard.Consequently the Minister and his Department have consistently advised Irish dairy farmers to continue to operate on the assumption that no further changes will be made to the milk quota arrangements agreed in the context of the CAP Health Check.  This is extremely important and I cannot emphasise strongly enough that farmers must continue to make this assumption in arranging their affairs in 2012.During the health check process the Commission undertook to carry out market reviews before December 2010 and December 2012 to further consider the conditions for the smooth phasing out of milk quotas.  The 2010 review concluded that there was no reason to revisit the health check decisions with regard to the gradual increase in quotas.  This is not a view with which either the Minister or I concur, and it is intended to keep this issue high on the agenda, to ensure that the change in the milk market situation, both within the EU and globally in the intervening two years, and this year's events which will result in farmers from a number of member states suffering super levy fines, are fully taken into account by the Commission.Exports of dairy products in 2011 were valued at €2.66 billion, an increase of 17% on the previous year.  Ireland already has access to markets worldwide and exports dairy products to more than 80 countries.  My ministerial colleague, Deputy Simon Coveney, has been extremely active in increasing the profile of Irish dairy products in international markets in order to ensure there are profitable outlets for the increased production after 2015.  He is at present leading a trade delegation to China and dairy features significantly on the agenda.While there has been some moderation in dairy prices globally in recent times, the medium and long-term prospects for the sector are strong, and I am confident that with the abolition of quotas, the Irish dairy sector can position itself to take advantage of the increases in global population and demand over the next ten years.  I can assure the Deputy that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and its agencies will continue to play their part in providing an appropriate framework to support the development of this critically important industry, and that the Minister will continue to press at EU level for a further adjustment to the milk quota regime in order to ease the transition to the post quota-situation for Irish farmers.It is important in the next six months that everybody concerned, including the Deputy who is totally committed to agriculture, continues to raise this matter on a daily basis.  We have a responsibility to do this and to get other member states to support us because many dairy farmers, particularly young dairy farmers, need that help.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	435	There is immense opportunity for growth in the dairy industry and that has been confirmed by the statistics the Minister of State has given.  Exports last year were worth €2.66 billion, an increase of 17% on the previous year.  Food Harvest has envisaged a 50% increase, therefore, the potential for growth clearly exists.  At a time when there is underproduction in other states, with our neighbouring state, Britain, underfilling its quota by 10% and Bulgaria only filling 50% of its national quota, clearly there is an opportunity to do what I seek.  I cannot comprehend why we cannot convince the authorities at Community level of the merit of the arguments we can advance.  The €20 million super levy fine and the lack of progress on the butterfat correction are a sad testament to the Government's failure in this area.  There must be a redoubling of efforts.  If it takes a strong diplomatic initiative to achieve these objectives, that is what we need.  This coming 12  months is vitally important.  If we can get a breakthrough on this, it will be of huge benefit to the economy of this country not to mention the agricultural industry.

Nobody would like there to be a euro of a penalty in a super levy.  I do not have the figures to hand but I hope it will not be as high as €20 billion.  I agree with the Deputy that it should not happen but I can tell him that the Government is doing its best.  We have an opportunity to raise this issue and I ask that the Deputy's MEPs and Members of all parties act on this.  The butterfat correction is one way of doing this and the other way is to front-load the yearly increase.  I can promise the Deputy that I, my colleagues and everyone in the Department will do everything in our power to help alleviate the position, particularly for young farmers whose livelihoods were nearly destroyed last year because of bad management.
#TonyMcLoughlin	unknown-#TonyMcLoughlin-party	unknown-#TonyMcLoughlin-dob	unknown-#TonyMcLoughlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	437	Since entering office in March 2011, the Taoiseach has set about his central goal of restoring confidence in Ireland.  In my view he has succeeded, and alongside various Ministers, including the Tánaiste, Ireland has renewed optimism despite the fact that we are still under the troika programme.  Just today, Chambers Ireland stated at the Oireachtas sub-committee on the referendum that a "Yes" vote in the EU fiscal treaty referendum is vital if we are to restore Ireland's confidence.  It is Chambers Ireland's belief that a "Yes" vote is vital if we wish to enhance confidence levels, support employment, attract investment and guarantee future access, if we need it, to the European Stability Mechanism.  It is, in other words, the insurance policy Ireland needs as we move onwards and upwards.Ireland is in a financial crisis for many reasons but many economists would say the primary reason was the lack of regulation.  Who do we blame?  I suggest the Government of the day, which ignored the various limitations under the euro, as many other countries did.  We can also blame the ECB, which also failed to do its job.  The Fianna Fáil-PD Government between 2001 and 2008 increased public expenditure without recourse to a tax-base that was sustainable but instead was based on bricks and mortar.  Today we see the introduction of the household charge, soon to be a property tax, and water metering, all measures that should have been introduced when the economy was better placed to take on a wider tax base.  If Ireland had been living under the fiscal treaty at that time, such excessive spending would not have happened.  We must ensure such cavalier governance of the country is never allowed again.A vital issue Irish people must understand is that the treaty stipulates only countries that sign up will be able to access the ESM.  Access to the ESM is a vital safety net for Ireland when we have completed our funding programme.  If we are out of the loop, where will we go for future funding in an emergency?  This treaty will not involve any additional austerity over the coming years.  It will ensure the Government spends wisely and secures our economic future by ensuring an end to boom to bust economics that we have seen in the last 25 years.Economic fears regarding non-ratification of the fiscal treaty derive from the condition that provides that from March 2013, access by any eurozone state to the €0.7 trillion European Stability Mechanism will be conditional on the country having ratified the fiscal treaty.  Ireland's failure to ratify the treaty would thus come at a price.  It is our insurance policy against default.  Ireland's ambition is to return to the market post-2013 and the decision by Ireland to adopt the fiscal treaty will clearly show our potential lenders our determination to ensure the economy stays within certain economic parameters.The current levels of inward investment by foreign multinational companies is of great importance to Ireland and are part of our economic plans for recovery.  The signal we will send to investors if we reject the treaty is worrying.  We must secure foundations and firewall protection around the economy and the international economy will be watching.I will urge my constituents to vote "Yes" to secure our future within the euro and the European Union.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	438	The stability treaty is an important opportunity to affirm our commitment to stay at the heart of the eurozone and the European Union.  It is in the interests of Ireland and its people: it is as simple as that.The first article of the treaty states that its purpose is to support the achievement of the European Union's objectives for sustainable growth, employment, competitiveness and social cohesion.  As Minister of State with responsibility for trade and development, it is these objectives that guide my work both in Ireland's own trade and in what we are doing to help the developing world.  Stable and responsible economies with stable and responsible currencies are at the heart of what is needed for jobs, social cohesion and healthy trade.  This is a treaty on stability and is about ensuring a stable euro.  It is about confidence abroad and maintaining and enhancing the influence we have been rebuilding with investors, job creators and our European partners.  In particular for job creating investors, from whom so many great job announcements have come in recent months, and even again today, PayPal has been a great example.  Its decisions have been thanks to the determination of the Irish people, the stability restored to our economy and our place at the heart of the eurozone; the company knows where we stand.As Minister of State, I meet job creators and investors around the world.  They are attracted by what Ireland has to offer as a European base.  Many are already here and are thinking of expanding while others are thinking of coming for the first time.  They must, however, be sure the euro is stable and that the Irish economy is a stable and well managed economy at the core of the eurozone.  Ireland is the only English speaking country in the eurozone.  This is crucial to investor confidence, which we can underpin if we vote "Yes" and undermine if we do not.The stability treaty is also about good housekeeping.  We regard the creation of strong rules on budgetary matters in Europe as necessary to restore stability and confidence the euro.  That is entirely consistent with the work we are doing at home.  Most of what is in the treaty is already in the existing EU treaties and laws.  The stability treaty will not solve all of our problems on its own: it is part of a wider picture.  For Europe to move beyond its current difficulty, there must be a balanced approach with equal focus on the growth and jobs agenda.  We have repeated that again and again.  This view has gained widespread support and recent meetings of the European Council at the end of January and the start of March have been firmly focused on the jobs and growth agenda and have identified key measures to drive it forward.  The Government played a key role in pushing this growth agenda.This is also an insurance policy to make sure we have access, if needed, to the ESM funding that allows us to fund public services and all Government spending.  We are determined to return to the financial markets next year to raise money on our own again like we did before.  We are on target with our programme but we are far from immune from global economic events.  Markets must know there is back-up in the form of the European Stability Mechanism and we can only access that if we ratify this treaty on 31 May.  This treaty will contribute to our recovery and ensure economic stability for the country and currency that will contribute to the restoration of confidence in Ireland as a good and secure place in which to invest and do business.The referendum on 31 May will be an important decision for Ireland and the Government will make the strongest possible case for ratification.  It is clear that ratifying the treaty will build on the progress Ireland is making, including in restoring investor confidence in Ireland.  We will be joined by many elements of the Opposition in Parliament and many civil society organisations.  We hope for a calm and informed debate with a positive outcome.  I look forward to playing my part in that and to a successful conclusion.
#SeanKyne	unknown-#SeanKyne-party	unknown-#SeanKyne-dob	unknown-#SeanKyne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	439	On 31 May the Irish people will be asked to ratify the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union.  During and before the Dáil recess, I attended several days of meetings of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on European Affairs which discussed, debated and explored the treaty.  Ambassadors, business and employers' groups, trade unions, NGOs, university academics, economists and business journalists participate in these meetings.  Participating in these meetings has reinforced my belief that a "Yes" vote is best for Ireland and best for the European Union.At one session I attended, the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association, ISME, Financial Services Ireland, the Irish Farmers' Association, IFA, the Irish Business and Employers Confederation, IBEC, and the Small Firms Association were all represented and all encouraged a "Yes" vote.  These groups represent businesses that are surviving, growing and, in some cases, flourishing as part of Europe and they see no benefit to job protection or expansion in a "No" vote.  While it is true that this treaty does not create jobs, it provides the stability and confidence necessary to encourage inward investment into this country.  I am particularly pleased with the announcement today that 220 jobs will be created in Indreabhán in Connemara by Bioniche Pharma.  I warmly welcome the involvement of the IDA and Údarás na Gaeltachta in bringing those jobs to Galway.At that session I was also particularly pleased that the IFA, which represents our farmers, has asked for a "Yes" vote.  Obviously, agriculture is a huge growth industry at present and the agrifood sector has been one of the good news stories in the last number of years.  As John Bryan, the president of the IFA, said: "Ireland is a small, open economy with a growing export-dependent agrifood sector with great potential.  Membership of a stable euro currency is critical to achieving the Food Harvest 2020 targets for investment, growth in output and exports.  IFA is therefore recommending a "Yes" vote to the farming community and rural Ireland, as it believes ratification of the fiscal treaty is in the interest of IFA.  It is also in the national interest.  We believe a "Yes" vote is a vote of confidence in Ireland and in the EU."In that session a number of words were used which are key to this treaty.  They include "certainty", "responsibility", "investment", "stability", "growth" and "positivity".  Ireland has always been at the heart of Europe and this must continue.  The treaty is fundamentally about stability.  It will encourage wiser and better budget decisions and will formally provide a strengthened safety net for euro zone countries, with each country committing to show solidarity and support to partner countries experiencing economic and financial difficulties.  The treaty is also about future security and ensuring that we have a source of funding available at all times if needed.  Ireland has experienced several economic shocks caused by an unsustainable economic model which allowed for huge increases in public spending that were financed by temporary property based revenue.Nobody, regardless of their political colours, can deny that Ireland has a huge gap between revenue and spending.  To keep our country going, to maintain schools, hospitals and social services and to finance our social welfare safety net we are dependent on assistance from our European partners.  Opponents of the treaty claim it is an austerity treaty.  That is wrong.  The treaty will put Ireland back in control of its economic destiny, ensuring that debt is reduced to safe levels.  Without the support Ireland is currently receiving, the budget deficit would have to be closed in a much shorter time frame, leading to greater austerity measures.  A "No" vote will bring about the greatest degree of austerity and hardship because the Government will be faced with the prospect of running out of money and being locked out of the European Stability Mechanism, a €500 billion fund to help countries.  It is entirely logical and reasonable that any country receiving the support of its partners under the ESM should be prepared to run sensible budgetary policies.  While the discussions at the European affairs committee meetings involved numerous speakers who were negative on the treaty, they did not appear to be able to answer questions about alternative sources of funding to the ESM.It is also important to note that the treaty does not affect our sovereignty.  Ireland will still draft its own budgets and make its own decisions on tax rates, including the corporation tax rates.  The budgetary rules all countries will abide by will be the same; how they get there will be up to each individual country.  In recognition of the need for clear concise information, over the next few weeks the full text of the treaty along with explanatory material will be distributed to households to help citizens reach an informed decision.  A "Yes" vote will send a strong, positive message from Ireland and will protect our currency, promote stability, encourage investment, instill confidence and ultimately put us more firmly on the road to economic recovery.
#JohnPaulPhelan	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-party	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-dob	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	440	I am glad to have an opportunity to contribute to the Second Stage debate on this legislation, which provides for a constitutional referendum on the stability treaty.  I am glad the people will get an opportunity to make their judgment on what is a crucial stepping stone on the road to recovery for our economy and country.  This is a different referendum from all the previous referenda we have had on the various European treaties because this treaty will come into effect next year if 12 countries ratify it.  Ireland is the only country that will have a referendum in which the members of the public will have their say directly.  This places us in a unique position.  However, it is crucially different in that the treaty will come into effect regardless of the outcome of the vote in this country.The Minister of State, Deputy Costello, and other speakers have referred to this treaty as providing an insurance policy.  It is similar to householders who insure their houses.  They do not do so in the hope that they will have to use that insurance but for the reassurance of knowing it is there.  The treaty is not just for the reassurance of Irish people and the Irish economy, but for the reassurance of people who are looking at this country with a view to future investment here.  That is the single most important aspect of this treaty and it is the reason I will actively encourage and campaign for people to support it on 31 May.  The euro is our currency.  It is vital to the survival and recovery of our economy that we defend our common currency.  The treaty is a concerted effort by members of the European Union to address some of the difficulties that have arisen in recent years that caused the situation in which our economy and the economies of many states in Europe now find themselves.The stability treaty has been described as an austerity treaty.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Without the support of the IMF, ECB and the European Union - the troika - the difficulties we are experiencing at present in terms of trying to balance our budget would be far more severe.  We would have to do it overnight.  Just as politicians lecture businesses and householders about balancing their budgets, it is essential that governments and countries try to balance their budgets.  It must be remembered that the terms in this treaty are those that were included in the revised Stability and Growth Pact.  A crucial aspect of the stability treaty, however, is that for the first time it is proposed to impose sanctions on countries that go outside the terms established under that pact.  From an Irish perspective, it is worth pointing out that France and Germany were the first countries to breach the original terms of the Stability and Growth Pact.  No sanction was imposed on them.  The sanctions provision will be a protection for smaller members of the Union such as Ireland in that sanction will be automatic on larger countries unless there is a majority vote to the contrary.  That is a significant improvement in the bargaining position of smaller countries such as ours on the future of the euro and the European Union.The job of this Government since the election last year has principally been to return economic and political stability to this country.  I believe the Government has largely succeeded in that regard.  The sense of doom, gloom and terror that existed 12 months ago and the sense of confusion about the future direction of Government policy do not exist at present.  There is optimism, although there is also a realisation that the next couple of years will not be particularly easy.  I believe the stability treaty should be supported by the people and I will do my utmost to bring that message to people in Kilkenny over the next few weeks.  As I said earlier, I am glad the Irish people will have an opportunity to voice their opinion on this treaty through a referendum at the end of May.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	441	I am delighted to have an opportunity to address this Bill.  I strongly support this matter being put to the Irish people.  I am glad the Government eventually came to the conclusion that the Irish people should be asked their opinion.  However, my view is that since there are three interlocking treaties, and this is not the first but the third of them, the Government should have put the three treaties as a package to the Irish people.  I understand a case is being lodged in the courts on that basis.  This is fundamental because, as I will point out later, the fiscal compact will become a reality only if all countries ratify the initial treaty and then the European Stability Mechanism, ESM is set up.No one can argue against the principle of a backstop of cash or of fiscal rule.  I do not know anyone who is against fiscal discipline.  The question is, does this treaty provide fiscal discipline or simply rules that will become a straitjacket and are unenforceable.  Furthermore, will anyone know what are the rules?  This is like asking someone to play in a football match where there is no set of rules that anyone can read and understand.  We know what would happen in such a case.  People would argue with the referee.I welcome this debate, but I am disappointed with it because it seems to be a series of pre-prepared statements for backbenchers and Ministers who do not analyse the issue.  When we hold referendums we should remember the safe cross code.  We should look right, look left, look right again and then cross the road.  We know that in previous referendums that did not happen and difficulties arose.  We know what happened when people made up their minds before examining all the issues and things suddenly jumped out of the small print.  In some cases, referendums were passed and we then had to undo the damage caused.  In other cases, the people examined the small print and decided they were being sold a pig in a poke.  A good example is the referendum that followed the Good Friday Agreement which was passed with a great fanfare.  There were difficulties within the small print of that amendment to our Constitution.  We had to have a second referendum on the question of the Irish born child because of the flawed wording we had passed in the Good Friday referendum.  We had a rushed referendum last autumn where eight former Attorneys General pointed out that what was being proposed was deeply flawed and the Irish people, rightly in my view, decided to vote against the amendment.Those who dismiss all argument, analysis and inquiry into what we are doing at present are letting themselves down and, furthermore, are reneging on every promise they made that this Legislature would be a place of debate and inquiry and not of pre-prepared speeches.  When the Government came to office, there was much talk about the Legislature taking the initiative and holding to account the Executive, but we are back to the same old, "Don't question anything, get the backbenchers to read the same old pre-prepared speeches, don't ask the awkward questions and hope no one else asks them either".  It is important to examine the small print of what we are doing, and I will come to that later.  However, we must also look at the wider picture of what we sign up for and the context in which we do so.  This is particularly important as we are writing something into our Constitution and are being asked to pass a law that will be permanent.  That is why I am looking at this issue from all angles.Can we dismiss the rubbish from the Government that this has anything to do with our membership of the eurozone or of the European Union or that there are pro-EU and anti-EU parties involved?  I know of no one who is proposing that we leave either the eurozone or the European Union.  Sloganising on that basis is a nonsense.The second argument is that this will keep us at the heart of Europe and will make it clear that Ireland is open for business.  We hear the argument that if we vote against this treaty we may be thrown out of the euro.  That is a veiled threat and one that has no substance in law.  People who argue on that basis are abdicating their responsibility to get the best deal for Ireland, and for Europe in this case.  They argue that we must keep ourselves at the heart of Europe and that is why we must vote "Yes".  If one were to accept that argument one would have to vote for every EU referendum put forward, and all proposals from Europe would be waved through without question. I have a question for the Minister of State.  If corporation tax is next on the agenda, will we automatically support that approach as well?  Will a day come when a Government, or the Legislature, will say we do not agree with what is being proposed?  We are keen on being at the heart of Europe but does this mean we agree with everything proposed, any more than saying we must agree with everything the Government proposes if we are to be at the heart of Ireland?  How would rejecting a proposal put forward by Europe mean we would not be at the heart of Europe?  That is a nonsense argument and has no validity.I am in favour of fiscal discipline.  Does this give us fiscal discipline or merely an impossible straitjacket?  Before I come to that issue, we should look at the wider context of this proposal.  Time and again we are asked where we would get the money if we do not pass the fiscal compact?  The reality is that we are passing three treaties.  The first is an amendment of the definition of the treaties governing the European communities to include reference to the treaty establishing the European Stability Mechanism.  We cannot have the other two treaties without that one.  It has not been ratified.  The Government has, rightly, agreed not to ratify it until the fiscal treaty has been ratified.  Second, there is a treaty to set up the European Stability Mechanism and, third, there is the fiscal compact treaty.It is fair to say the second and third treaties can go ahead without Ireland's ratification.  However, if Ireland refuses to ratify the first treaty, the second and third cannot happen.  I presume the Government's reason for postponing ratification of the third treaty until after the referendum is that in the event of Ireland not ratifying the fiscal compact we can hold up the whole ship until we get a proper package that deals with Europe's problems.  What European leaders have decided is not the best package for Europe.  Fiscal stability is only part of the package.  The main cause of the problem in this country was not fiscal instability.  I will come to the detail of that, and Davy Stockbrokers are worth reading on this issue.  The main cause of the problem in this country was the behaviour of the banks.  Nowhere in all of this do we see a rolling in of bank behaviour or international finance across Europe.If the following issues were dealt with, would it not be better for Europe and for Ireland?  Should we not have proper regulation of the financial and banking sector at a central European level to ensure the banking crises and the problems of the past ten years do not recur?  Let us get that into the package.  There should be no further attempts by the EU to impose non-elected technocratic governments in the European Union.  The EU is founded on a bedrock of democracy and yet Europe, centrally, is either imposing or trying to impose technocratic non-elected governments.  We need a commitment from the European Union that the right of initiative remains with the Commission and that two strong member states, that is, France and Germany, will not be allowed, by stealth or by practice, to lay out policy for Europe.  It must remain the role of the Commission to propose policy and the role of the intergovernmental meetings to roll it out.We hear about preserving investment in the country.  The biggest challenge to investment in this country at the moment is the uncertainty being raised by President Sarkozy about our corporation tax.  Let us start again, and this time get a commitment that corporation tax and common consolidated corporate tax base, CCCTB, will not be imposed on this country and that the promises that were given to us in the Lisbon treaty, on which some of us canvassed, will be adhered to.  As a member of the Labour Party I would have thought the Minister of State, Deputy Costello, would have insisted that an employment and growth strategy would be part of the package.  Let us go back and get that first.  As a Labour Party member I would have also thought that the Minister of State would like to see the ECB reformed as a normal central bank with the normal powers of a central bank and that in particular it would have the power to buy sovereign bonds at 1% instead of selling them to the banks at 1% and selling them on at one remove at 5%, leaving huge profits for private institutions.An issue that goes to the core of implementing the fiscal compact is that the European banks that lent to the Irish banks or their sovereign governments would assume their fair share of the losses caused by their shared reckless behaviour instead of trying to saddle the whole debt on the Irish people.  If one leaves the debt as it is and we assume all of the bank debt, when one applies the fiscal compact rules it is tantamount to slow strangulation.  One might argue that if we say "No", we will go over the cliff, but that is not the case because we can hold up the whole show and go back and renegotiate in the interests of the ordinary, plain people of Europe who do not seem to count for much among European leaders.  It is also true to say that we need to ensure a good deal for this country as well.  My experience of Europe is that every country looks after its own interests.When one looks at the fiscal compact itself, one of the interesting things is that nobody knows what it means.  In other words, we are buying a pig in a poke.  A document was published by Davy stockbrokers, who would not be considered revolutionaries, which indicates that "[The] structural budget deficit target of 0.5% is a poor choice."  The report states:The structural deficit is an abstract economic concept that cannot be observed with certainty.  For example, the IMF estimates that Ireland ran a structural budget deficit of 5.4% of GDP in 2006, whereas the EU Commission estimates that Ireland ran a surplus of 2.2% the same year.  Markets are unlikely to derive confidence in fiscal policy from budgetary targets they cannot observe.The report continues: "[The] treaty does not go far enough; IMF proposals that could have preserved Ireland's creditworthiness are not included."  The report also states, rightly, that "The fiscal compact would have had no bearing on the collapse in Ireland's public finances had it been adopted at the inception of the euro ... However, the IMF has proposed mutual insurance mechanisms for the euro area that would have preserved Ireland's creditworthiness."In the context of budgets, Davy stockbrokers state:The key innovation in the new treaty is to enshrine the rules in national law.  The immediate case for reinforcing fiscal discipline in Europe is illustrated by the problems in Greece.  But some argue that enshrining the rules in Irish law will imply a sea-change in the discussion of budgetary policy – by framing the debate around abstract economic concepts such as the output gap, structural budget balance and automatic stabilisers, perhaps our politicians might better manage the public finances.  However, our view is that this approach ignores the key risks to the public finances from financial spillovers within the euro area and the banking sector.The reports indicates that the "Structural budget deficit target is a poor choice as official estimates differ starkly and are prone to revision over time."We have been given examples of where we are buying into the treaty yet nobody knows what the treaty is about or how to measure it.  Even the briefing from the Library and Research Service states that there is no accurate measure of structural deficit and that this is a matter of opinion.  We are buying into a treaty but nobody knows what it is about and what effect it will have.  I will set a challenge for those who claim to know.  If the Government is so sure about the impact of the fiscal compact on our deficit and budget and how it will pan out, I suggest it does two things.  First, it must get the Fiscal Advisory Council to prepare a ten-year budget on the basis of what the Government proposes.  It would also prepare a second budget based on the presumption that a fair share of the bank debt is assumed by the countries who caused it.  In other words we would divide the bank debt of the sovereign by two and then we would run a second budget and see how it works out.  Perhaps neither would work out to be possible or perhaps the second one, which would be preferable if we had the full package I outlined earlier available, would work out far better than the one the Government is offering.  If one puts the figures on the table for the people, I am sure they would make a mature choice.I stand to be corrected but my view is that when one is forced to do the budgetary arithmetic based on the treaty that is proposed, one will find that one will not be within the terms of the fiscal compact with the current level of debt which the Taoiseach insists is going to be paid to the last cent, and that he is not going to look for the recklessness to be spread among the people who were reckless or do what the Labour Party wants to do.  I do not have the resources to do those calculations but the Fiscal Advisory Council does.  I believe that if we work out the figures, they will prove conclusively that this is a straitjacket into which we cannot fit.The Government's problem is that it cannot see a way out.  I have provided the way out.  If the first treaty did not exist there would not be such a handy way out, but because it exists one can hold up the whole train until a proper package is put together that deals with the banking issue.  I am flabbergasted that the Labour Party in celebrating the 100th year of its foundation by James Connolly-----

#SeanSherlock	Labour	14378	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	451	I welcome the announcement by Mylan Incorporated of 220 jobs in the Gaeltacht in Connemara.  This is a testament to the hard work that has been done by the Government in spite of the awful economic morass in which we find ourselves as a result of the previous speaker's Government's actions.  In spite of that economic morass in which we find ourselves, we are still winning new business and new investments and we are, in spite of the economic constraints, sending out signals to the business community that Ireland is open for business and that we are, against the head, doing our very best to restore that economic sovereignty that was lost through the actions of the previous speaker and the Government of which he was a Cabinet member.For the record of this House and for any historical purposes, Deputy Ó Cuív was a Cabinet Minister in the previous Government that brought this country to its knees.  When I listen to the revisionist rubbish coming from that gentlemen's mouth, it would make the hair stand on the back of one's neck.  It is an absolute disgrace that anybody who was a Cabinet Minister in the previous Government would come in here and seek to lecture any other Member on this side of the House about where he perceives that we are going wrong in terms of the path that we are on to try to restore our economic sovereignty.When I listen to his words, I must say that they are quite confused.  I did not understand one iota of what he was saying.  He contradicted himself when he stated that nobody understands this treaty and then, in another sentence, that the treaty does not go far enough.  It was contradictory verbiage.  It is time that he was called on the bluff and bluster that we have heard from him these past few months.  It behoves us, as parliamentarians, to speak responsibly when we come into this House.  We all are prone to oratorical flourishes.  I do not exclude myself from that process, but I think we endeavour to speak the truth.Ratification of this treaty is fundamental to Ireland's recovery.  The instability that has plagued the euro has been a destabilising feature of the EU polity and one which has diminished our stature as a continent in hegemonic terms.The euro is our currency.  It is Ireland's currency and the treaty is about bringing stability to the entire eurozone.  As a small open economy subject to the vagaries of global economic shifts, Ireland's national interest is best served by our continuation as a member of this currency.  Irish ratification of the treaty would further enhance growing international confidence in our ongoing recovery.  We are on target to reduce our budget deficit to under 3% by 2015 and our exports are growing strongly.Nobody would claim that the treaty is the sole answer to Europe's economic problems, but it is a crucial part of a wider package of necessary measures.  The treaty must be accompanied by more action to achieve growth and jobs, particularly at EU level.  Membership of a strong stable euro is vital for the development of the economy.  Achieving a European investment programme for growth and jobs should be a European aspiration and one that is best served by co-operation with our eurozone partners.  I reiterate that, only today, Mylan Incorporated announced more than 220 new positions in addition to the existing operations in Ireland.  It is incumbent on us to ensure that investments such as this continue in the future.Ratification of this treaty will help to ensure that Ireland is seen as a safe place to do business.  Any claim that rejecting the treaty will mean no more difficult decisions are required is patently false and disingenuous.  There have been claims from members of the Opposition that this treaty will lead to further austerity and hardship for the Irish people.  To those who call this an austerity treaty I say this.  It is a falsehood to create a narrative that implicitly suggests that voting "No" means ending fiscal consolidation.  The simple fact is that we, as a sovereign Government, must stabilise our public finances.  That is a moral imperative.  It is a moral imperative to ensure that future generations are left a half decent legacy with which to live.  A debt to GDP ratio of more than 90% damages growth and Ireland's debt to GDP ratio is expected to peak at approximately 118% this year.  We take in only €7 million for each €10 million spent.  We borrow €44 million daily to run the country.  That is equivalent to France borrowing almost €600 million a day.  This simply is not sustainable and we cannot afford to leave that burden to future generations.In Ireland's case, the stability treaty requires us to do no more than we are already doing to rebalance the public finances.  The treaty does not prevent investment.  What it does is ensure we have sustainable finances, balanced budgets, or budgets in surplus in good times and no unsustainable deficits in recessionary times.  Investment is perfectly possible in these circumstances.  That is a classical Keynesian theory.Keynes' theory has been misinterpreted by some to suit some political narratives.  Keynes is not simply about stimulus packages that never need to be paid for.  The economist, Seamus Coffey of UCC, recently stated that had the treaty and the wider package of measures now being considered through closer macroeconomic surveillance been in place over the past decade, Ireland's economic crash would probably have been less severe and we probably would not have needed a bailout in 2010.  Those who oppose this treaty in Ireland never state where Ireland will get the funding for a stimulus package.  They only offer slogans about taxing the rich, and yet refuse to back initiatives such as a property tax.  They think that Government borrowings do not have to be paid back and that there are no negative consequences to defaulting.There have also been questions around why Ireland needs access to the European Stability Mechanism if the intention is to return to the markets next year.  The Government has every intention of returning to the international lending markets next year.  The existence of the ESM will make this process easier.  The ESM is a safety net and will mean that we will be in a better bargaining position when we are looking for market funding.This treaty will come into effect when 12 eurozone countries ratify it by 1 January 2013 or earlier.  Unlike previous EU treaties, Ireland does not have a veto over this treaty.  The only people affected by an Irish "No" would be the Irish people themselves.  Deciding not to ratify this treaty would make Ireland's economic recovery more difficult by, crucially, denying us future access to the ESM.  We are working to ensure no second bailout will be necessary, but the very fact of not having the insurance policy of ESM access could undermine international confidence in our recovery.The Irish Labour Party has long argued that fiscal consolidation must go hand in hand with growth and that one cannot work without the other.  That is why we, with our colleagues in Government, are continually pressing for more growth initiatives in Europe.

Tom Cruise is an actor who has divided opinion.  Some like his films, others do not.  One film that quite a few thought was his finest moment was "Jerry Maguire".  In that film, Tom Cruise plays a sports agent who is trying to sign as a client somebody who plays American football.  Probably the most famous moment in that film is the scene in which the person he is trying to recruit makes one demand of him, which is, "Show me the money."  This is all about the footballer saying that if he goes to work for the agent, he wants the agent to show him the money.  He wants the agent to tell him what money he will give him and how he will do it.  That is the ultimate question that people must answer in this referendum-----

It is the question that those who are against this treaty must answer.  Those who are looking for the passage of this treaty are able to answer it by saying that the State, if need be - we do not believe it will happen - would have access to a fund in the future.  We are able to say that if this treaty is passed, it will make it easier for the State to access funding in the financial markets as well.  People who are looking to reject this treaty cannot answer that question.  They can offer options and theories but they cannot offer a concrete plan regarding how the State would be able to fund essential public services.  We have already seen the convulsions that have been caused in our society, community and economy when we get ourselves to a place where first the banks and then the State are unable to borrow or find the money to fund the services upon which people depend.  The question that has to be asked is which vote in this referendum gives us the best chance of avoiding that vista recurring, and of avoiding a situation where the State cannot borrow to fund the services people rely on.  The answer to that question is to vote "Yes".This morning I saw an example of the need for this during a meeting of the sub-committee of the Committee on European Affairs that has been set up to look at this issue.  People come in to the sub-committee and say we should vote "No" because options will become available and there are potentially other ways in which we can fund our services.  Options, theories and possibilities are not good enough when we come to the question of how we would fund the social welfare payments that people need.I want to deal with the options that have been put forward.  The first option put forward is that if the ECB and the European Commission will not fund us, the IMF will.  What I find extraordinary about this argument is that the very people putting forward this case are the same ones who have been writing books and making speeches decrying and criticising the role of the IMF in imposing conditions on other countries, with this conditionality having, it is claimed, a devastating impact elsewhere.  These same people now come forward to say the IMF will support us.  Does anybody really think the IMF, in an environment in which this country votes "No", is going to move away from the need to impose conditions on a country that is looking for funding?  More importantly, do they think the IMF will operate within the eurozone without the support of the European Central Bank and the European Commission?  If one looks at the recent track record of the IMF in any country, let alone the eurozone, the answer to that question is surely "No".The second point put forward concerns the idea of conditionality in regard to Article 136.  It is suggested it is not right that conditions should be put upon people who look to access the European Stability Mechanism.  However, the ESM in a number of years will include our money in that the money going into that fund will come from the Irish taxpayer in order to be deployed in other countries.  Is anybody seriously suggesting it is in the best interest of the Irish taxpayer not to have conditions regarding how our money is used in other countries?  If they believe the answer to that question is that those conditions should not be there, they need to say to the Irish taxpayer why they will be happy in future for their money to be spent elsewhere without conditions attached.  It is surely in our interest now and in the future for such conditions to be in place.The third argument I hear is that if we vote "No" we will increase our options in the future.  Of course, what this does not recognise is that other countries will by then have already ratified this programme, for example, Portugal has already done so.  If we were in an environment in which our support was needed for this programme to go ahead and for this treaty to be ratified, of course, an argument that new options would be generated would hold water.  However, our support is not needed for this treaty to come into force.To conclude, those people who argue that defeat of this treaty will increase options for our country are surely not acknowledging the reality that our country will find itself in a situation where access to marketplace funding is more difficult, if not impossible, and access to a support mechanism, if we need it, is ruled out.  That does not equal an increase in the options available to our people but instead reduces them to the state that further crisis is inevitable.  That is what we have to avoid.
#HeatherHumphreys	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-party	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-dob	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	455	I welcome this opportunity to speak on the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union.  It is very important that we have this full discussion so the misinformation and scaremongering in which some people are engaging is dispelled and put to bed.  I heard some of the previous speakers who spoke against the Bill stating we need to spend, spend, spend in order to create employment.  As Deputy Donohoe said, show me the money.  Where do they think we are going to get this money to spend?  They are living in a deluded world - in fact, one could call it Alice, Joe or even Richard in Wonderland.  Let us come back to reality.It is important at the outset to define stability.  Stability can be defined as firmness in position or the strength to stand and endure.  We all recognise stability as a good thing.  It is something everybody is looking for in this life - in their work, their family life and their relationships.  How often have we been told that children need a stable home to flourish and thrive?  Stability brings balance and harmony to our everyday lives.  When we build a house, we always look for a stable foundation because, without it, we will have no base and eventually the house will fall.  Therefore, we all agree that stability is a good thing in all aspects of our life and, in turn, we need stability as a nation.Through austerity measures, a lot of weight and burden has been placed on the Irish people but, unfortunately, we need austerity for the sake of stability.  More than ever, we need stability to move on.  The stability of the economy encourages investment and we need investment to allow us to recover and regain our economic sovereignty.The treaty reinforces existing EU rules to require EU Governments to live within their means by cutting excessive deficits and debt.  The stability treaty requires us to put a set of rules in place that states Government budgets should be balanced or in surplus, with any structural deficit set at a lower limit of 0.5% of GDP.  The idea is that if we run budget surpluses during periods when the economy is strong, we can afford to support the economy by running deficits when the economy is weak.  Averaged out over an economic cycle, Government budgets should, therefore, be broadly balanced.  This is good for economic stability and long-term growth.  It means that when the economy is weak, Government supports spending in the economy by borrowing and, when the economy grows strongly, Government takes money out of the economy to repay public debt.  This makes sense because it is basically good housekeeping rules.The treaty also allows countries to breach the deficit rules during exceptional circumstances and borrow more heavily to protect employment through stimulus packages.  An example of this would have been the foot and mouth crisis some years ago, where such a treaty would have allowed Ireland to break the borrowing rules to protect the economy.As well as cutting excessive annual deficits, the treaty also reinforces existing EU rules that require countries to bring their overall public debts down to safe levels, judged as being 60% of GDP.  Economic research shows that debt levels significantly in excess of this benchmark are bad for jobs and economic growth.  It is important to note that countries with debt levels in excess of the 60% target, such as Ireland, will have 20 years to bring their debts down to the target level.  On the other hand, good budget rules give investors confidence about the future.  High public debt levels will increase the perceptions of risk around Ireland, making credit more expensive for businesses and job creators, and increasing interest rates for home owners.Would anyone invest in a business that did not have a clear set of rules within which it operates?  One of the first things a person would look at is the business's memorandum and articles of association and its audited accounts.  This is the same for investors in Ireland Inc.  We must have a clear set of operating principles which we adhere to and we need to demonstrate that we act in a responsible manner.There is a strong link between the stability treaty and the European Stability Mechanism.  If we do not ratify the treaty, we will not have access to the ESM.  We do not plan to need this fund but it is like an insurance policy - you might never need it but it is there when you want it.  Having this protection will make us a much more attractive destination for international investment.  However, if we do not ratify the treaty, markets will become much tougher and all of the progress we have made to date could be put in jeopardy.  There have been several positive job announcements recently, including the announcement of 1,000 jobs in PayPal in Dundalk which will have positive benefits for parts of my constituency in Cavan and Monaghan.  Ireland would not have won these jobs were we not a part of Europe and the eurozone.  The current unemployment crisis would have been far worse had we turned our backs on Europe.The agriculture and agrifood sectors are the backbone of our economy.  They account for 300,000 jobs and are playing a vital role in our economic recovery.  It is well recognised that our agriculture and agrifood industry needs Europe.  I commend the IFA on clearly stating its support for the treaty.  The IFA President, John Bryan, stated that any withdrawal by Ireland from a central role in Europe would have negative consequences in the short term and could potentially lead to Ireland's isolation in the longer term.  Members of the IFA executive council decided unanimously that it would be in the best interests of Irish families, the business community, including the agrifood sector, exports and jobs to vote "Yes" on 31 May.  Successful CAP negotiations in the coming 12 to 18 months will be vital to Irish agriculture and the IFA president has said, "Influence and goodwill in Europe are necessary conditions to ensure the best outcome in these crucial negotiations".  I support the motion and earnestly call on people to vote "Yes" on 31 May.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	456	I wish to share time with Deputy Colreavy.  We propose to take ten minutes each.  The Fine Gael-Labour Party Government signed up to the treaty on 2 March this year.  The reason for the treaty is not to improve the situation for the people we represent.  It is not to provide any assistance to our economic recovery.  In fact, it will result in the opposite outcome.  We are holding the referendum because the core EU member states, including Germany and France, wish to impose stricter fiscal restraints on the peripheral economies, including Ireland.  The aim of the treaty is to strengthen the enforcement of existing rules and to impose some new rules on government deficits, debt and budgetary policy.The treaty makes no political or economic sense.  It is anti-jobs and anti-growth.  Irish and international economists from the left, right and centre have challenged its credibility.  There is a near consensus that it will do nothing to resolve the crisis underlying the euro and, worse, it may even deepen the recession throughout the EU.  It does not deal with the explosion of private debt caused by bankers, developers and speculators that caused the current economic crisis in the country.  This is a crucial point but the treaty does not deal with this issue in any way.  However, it ensures that Joe and Mary Soap, the ordinary citizens of Ireland and Europe, will pay for it.  It will impose greater levels of austerity on ordinary citizens for an indefinite period.  One economist has estimated that it will require a further €6 billion of cuts and tax hikes post-2015 at a minimum.  Since our structural deficit is expected to be 3.7% in 2015, which amounts to almost €6 billion, compliance with the balanced budget rule set down in the treaty will mean austerity budgets from 2015 onwards.The austerity treaty will not solve the eurozone crisis nor will it fix the Irish economy.  It will deepen the recession and lead to greater levels of instability at home and throughout Europe.  The treaty will also mean a loss of economic, political and legal sovereignty for the State.  It will make Government investment in economic recovery more difficult.  At the same time it will force governments throughout the EU to contract their economies and shrink the export markets so important to the growth of the Irish economy.  Everyone in the House agrees that the Irish economy is dependent on these markets for growth.  Fully implementing the treaty will deepen the recession, increase unemployment and generate even greater levels of instability.  The word "stability" has been referred to many times.  Supporters of the treaty maintain that it will create stability.  However, recessions cause instability.  We have seen as much in Greece and to a lesser extent in this country.Article 3 is the most important of the treaty.  It holds that governments' budgets must be balanced or in surplus.  I have no wish to scaremonger.  I read the treaty carefully and I went through it with a fine toothcomb.  The article makes significant changes to the existing EU treaty rules on fiscal policy known as the Stability and Growth Pact.  By placing the rules in an intergovernmental treaty they will become binding and permanent.  If the treaty is ratified future governments will have to implement pro-austerity, anti-stimulus budgets in perpetuity.  This significantly limits the freedom and decision-making powers of governments, including the current Government, irrespective of the size of the mandate they receive from the electorate.  In times of economic growth the State will run a surplus and use that excess to pay down debt or invest in new infrastructure.  At least, that is what should take place.  The previous Fine Gael speaker referred to this but she does not appear to realise that the treaty will prevent the Government from doing so.  In periods of recession, Governments should have the flexibility to borrow and invest to get people back to work and to get the economy back to growth.The key provisions of Article 3 include a new structural deficit target of 0.5%, a restatement of the existing Stability and Growth Pact deficit target of 3%, a debt target of 60% of GDP and a requirement for States that breach these targets to return to them rapidly.  It also means that the current Government will have to implement austerity budgets beyond 2015.  This will result in the loss of political sovereignty.  The treaty significantly strengthens the capacity of the European Commission to enforce member state compliance with the existing and new rules.  Member states will be signing up to a new, legally binding obligation to automatically enter what is inappropriately termed an "economic partnership programme" when they are in breach of the rules.  The content of such a programme will be determined by the European Commission and will be similar to the current EU-IMF austerity programme.  This represents a significant increase in the powers of the commission at the expense of governments, including our Government.The treaty will result in the loss of legal sovereignty because Articles 7 and 8 make three further changes.  The treaty gives the European Court of Justice jurisdiction to determine whether member states are compliant with the debt and deficit rules.  The treaty also allows one member state to take another member state to the European Court of Justice if it believes the member state in question has been in breach of the rules.  It also allows the European Court of Justice to fine a member state 0.1% of GDP if it is found to be in breach of the rules.  For the record, this would amount to €160 million in the case of this State based on our GDP.Article 5 goes further and introduces new measures aimed at compelling member states in breach of the targets to take action deemed necessary by the commission and the council.  There is a new obligation to enter a budgetary and economic partnership programme involving detailed structural reforms aimed at reducing debt and deficit levels.  This is essentially the European version of the troika programme that member states will be legally obliged to accept when they breach the rules.I wish to tackle the issue of what is known as the blackmail clause.  We have been informed that voting against the treaty will mean we have no access to emergency funding in future.  The blackmail clause is an empty threat being used to bully people into supporting a treaty that would not otherwise secure the support of the people.  It has little or no legal force.  It is not an article of the European Stability Mechanism treaty but a recital and it cannot be used to deny funding to a member state if to do so threatened the stability of the eurozone as whole.There is a better way.  Sinn Féin believes that the best way to avoid a second bailout is to cut waste, to implement fairer taxation, to abandon the failed policies of bank bailouts and austerity and to invest in jobs while writing down our debt.  It is crucial that our debt is written down, including that associated with the promissory note.Previous speakers referred to the mantra of "spend, spend, spend."  They may have been referring to the contributions of some of the Independent Members.  We do not believe in spending for the sake of it.  Spending must be done properly.  We have done a good deal of spending in the past two years and it has gone down into big black holes.  We have not got the jobs that should have resulted and we must be more careful about that.  Sinn Féin opposes the treaty and we will campaign actively against it.

Instead it should be called a treaty to ensure the people of Ireland and other European Union states will suffer the consequences of bad decisions by the European Central Bank.  Additionally, the treaty will enable the Government to claim a democratic mandate and the blessing of Irish voters in turning private debt into public debt.  When the current economic crisis began to unfold, Sinn Féin argued that the best way for Ireland to steer its way back onto the path of recovery was a policy of investment in jobs and investment in our economy.  Two Governments and several budgets later, the opposite policy has been and is being pursued.  The economy is still in stagnation, hundreds of thousands are emigrating, unemployment is rising and ordinary people are falling further and further into debt.  A policy of spending cuts coupled with the imposition of tax increases on low and middle-income earners, heralded by the Fianna Fáil-Green Party Government and championed by the current Fine Gael-Labour Party Government, has resulted in nothing but hardship and a deepening of the economic crisis.  The Government now forecasts that one in ten people will be out of work by 2015.  It is abundantly clear that the policy of austerity has failed miserably.  Despite this, the Government is determined that this austerity treaty will be passed into Irish law.  Its commitment to austerity, despite its clear failure, indicates that it has not learnt the lessons of recent years.There can be no doubt that the treaty is a bad deal for Ireland.  The austerity of recent years has sent the country into a spiralling decline of debt, emigration and economic depression.  However, the Government is determined to continue on the same failed path.  It is holding a candle, hoping that Europe in its current format will lead us to a more prosperous future.  What it fails to recognise, or refuses to acknowledge, is that the hardship contained in the austerity treaty will cripple the people of this country.  I agree that Ireland should be at the heart of Europe.  Some people claim that Sinn Féin was never committed to the European ideal.

Ratifying this treaty, on the other hand, will lead only to further hardship.  It will oblige the State to achieve a structural deficit of 0.5% when the current programme with the troika runs out in 2015.  This will require a further €6 billion in expenditure cuts, which will affect hospitals, schools and transport.  It also means that any talk of a future jobs stimulus is nonsense, a false hope.  Instead we will sink further and further into economic depression.  The austerity treaty will tie our hands behind our back when it comes to making the tough decisions that will have to be made.  Our scope to make those decisions will be severely limited.The idea that this treaty will solve all our economic woes is fanciful.

Our banking system is in a state of disrepair and barely functional.  Individual households are suffering under a huge burden of debt and tens of thousands of people are in severe mortgage arrears.  The rules laid out in the austerity treaty are binding and permanent and will be given the protection of the Constitution.  They can only be changed by a future referendum and only with the agreement of the other signatory states.  How much damage will be done by the time the Government admits this treaty is a bad deal both for Ireland and for Europe?The people of this country have faced enough austerity in recent years.  Cutbacks have been made in education, health and social protection, to name but a few.  Almost every person in this State, with the exception of the wealthy, has been touched by the austerity of the current and previous Governments.  They are being asked to pay for a crisis they did not cause.  The arrival of the troika representatives to these shores signalled a fresh wave of cuts, with no sign of an upturn in the economy.  If this treaty is accepted it will place austerity into Irish law indefinitely.  Irish people will be forced to pay for the mistakes of European banks to the detriment of their own welfare.Ultimately, the austerity treaty attacks the very notion of Irish sovereignty and will lead to a further erosion of our political and legal sovereignty.  It significantly strengthens the capacity of the European Commission to enforce member state compliance with the existing and new rules.  Member states will have signed up to a legally binding obligation automatically to enter a so-called economic partnership programme when they are in breach of the rules.  The content of these programmes will be determined by the European Commission and will be very similar to the current EU-IMF austerity programme.  This is a significant increase in power for the European Commission at the expense of democratically elected parliaments and governments.  The treaty attacks Ireland's legal sovereignty by giving the European Court of Justice jurisdiction to determine whether member states are complying with the debt and deficit rules.  Irish Governments will no longer be able to make decisions over the future funding of the State.  As such, ratification will bring our national sovereignty further into question.The Government has demonstrated more than once that it is not adequately adept at negotiating on the European stage.  Consider the current debacle over the rights of turf cutters.

How can the people trust a Government that tells them to vote "Yes" to the austerity treaty when all logical thought demonstrates that so doing would be bad for them and when that Government's performance in representing the rights of Irish people on the European stage has been so abysmal?
#RobertDowds	unknown-#RobertDowds-party	unknown-#RobertDowds-dob	unknown-#RobertDowds-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	474	As much misinformation has been spun by Sinn Féin and certain members of the Technical Group on what this treaty actually will do, it is important to set the record straight.  Put simply, the fiscal stability treaty is part, and only part, of what must be done to stabilise and sort out the euro and is not a panacea for everything.  One must remember the euro is our own currency, the stability of which is at stake, and the fiscal stability treaty will help to sort it out.  As the euro is our currency, we are looking after ourselves in dealing with this issue.  Not only does Ireland's recovery depend on the stability of the euro due to the European Union being our biggest export market, but also Europe's recovery depends on it.  This is crucial to Ireland and Members may recall the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade alluding a number of times to the fact that one problem faced by Ireland in regenerating growth is uncertainty about the euro in general.  Consequently, it is a matter of the utmost importance that the euro be stabilised, and Ireland has a critical part to play in this effort by passing this referendum.  By securing the euro, Ireland will be helping to create a solid export base for itself, and as the only English-speaking country in the eurozone, this should yield significant trade dividends for it.  For example, one might ask why the Chinese Vice President only visited Ireland during his trip to this part of the world.  The trading bloc of which Ireland is a part must be stabilised and secured, and to do this, this referendum must be passed.How will this treaty help people in Ireland?  There are several answers to this question.  First, it beefs up considerably economic and monetary union, thereby ensuring good, sound management of public finances.  Second, the treaty is part of the six-pack of measures that will identify bubbles and unbalanced economies long before they implode, as did Ireland's own economy.  Had these measures been in place at the inception of the euro and had there been legislative oversight of Ireland's public finances, there is no way the Fianna Fáil Party would have been allowed to run the country like a casino.  As for what this treaty will do for Ireland, it will stabilise its currency and export base, help to create jobs and ensure sound and prudent management of the public finances.  Moreover, as part of the six-pack of measures, it will prevent the recurrence of Fianna Fáil-style wild west public policy and help identify bubbles and nip them in the bud to create a more stable, secure economy on which one can build a more equal and caring society.  There are those who argue that it restricts Ireland's ability to take out loans and to run large Exchequer deficits.  Lest anyone in Sinn Féin or the Technical Group has not been paying attention over the past year and a half, I emphasise that Ireland has arrived at a point at which it cannot secure affordable loans on the open market.  Consequently, to state these measures will restrict Ireland is to ignore completely the fact that in the absence of such measures, Ireland is more restricted than it has ever been in respect of getting loans to finance investment.The fiscal compact is needed to hold together the euro.  One must recognise that with monetary policy centralised, some measure of co-ordination on fiscal policy with our partners in the euro is required.  One also must remember that while Ireland's current bailout is unaffected by this referendum, it specifically excludes access to further funding under the European Stability Mechanism, which is linked with ratification.  Given the current circumstances of the country, one would be mad not to provide oneself with this insurance, and therefore a "Yes" vote is essential.As I stated at the outset, this is only part of rather than being the entire solution.  I believe strongly that in the long term, the ECB must perceive itself not simply as being responsible for controlling inflation but must take on a new role as an engine of growth and job creation.  I commend both the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste on driving forward this agenda at a European level.  This is a conscious collective decision the entire European Union must take and I am hopeful this will happen when more progressive parties take power in France and Germany.  Europe is at a turning point at which we either beef up the euro or retreat into our own currencies.  In the world in which we live, we would be crazy to choose the latter because while the member states are such small entities in themselves, together we stand as a highly significant entity.  For these reasons, I strongly advocate that we vote "Yes" in this referendum.
#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	475	In less than 44 days, the people of Ireland will go to the polls and vote on the fiscal compact treaty in what will be the most significant litmus test yet for our country's relationship with the European project.  Much debate and deliberation will take place between now and then on the pros and cons of the treaty, as it should in any vibrant and healthy democracy.  I look forward to engaging in these discussions and fleshing out the various arguments on different sides as the opportunities arise.  As the leader of my party, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Gilmore, so eloquently put it in this Chamber earlier today, "Ireland may be an island, but the borders of its trade, currency and workforce stretch across oceans."  It is a member of a 17 country currency, the eurozone and is part of a European market of 500 million people.  In other words, one cannot ignore the basic fact that our nation is deeply embedded in the structures of the eurozone and that its economic future is intertwined with those of its counterparts within the project.  The treaty is the latest manifestation of this relationship and is a crucial part of the architecture that has been built by eurozone leaders to address the sovereign debt crisis.  Other stabilisation mechanisms already introduced include early warning systems, enhanced financial regulatory structures and bank recapitalisation requirements.In short, the treaty aims to foster greater budgetary discipline and responsibility among eurozone countries by introducing various innovations such as the so-called golden rule, which for the first time ever will set a target on a country's structural budget balance.  In addition, contracting parties must observe medium-term objectives, namely, country-specific targets which take account of a country's economic potential and implicit liabilities, such as those that arise from an ageing population and so on.  Crucially, the ratification of the treaty will ensure contracting countries have access to the European Stability Mechanism, ESM.  This would be a crucial part of Ireland's toolkit, should there be a need to access it once the existing bailout program expires in 2014.Contrary to much of the ill-conceived rhetoric being peddled by anti-treaty sides, this is anything but an austerity treaty.  It is a stability treaty and its ratification is fundamental to the growth of the economy, to the creation of jobs and to the restoration of competitiveness, which was so badly eroded by the previous Fianna Fáil-led Administration.  The treaty is the latest step in a sustained process of confidence rebuilding that has been taking place between Ireland andinternational investors in recent months.  Today, 500 jobs were announced in Dublin and Galway.  Other announcements have flowed in recent months from companies such as Datalogic, PayPal, SourceDogg and Eli Lilly, which is located in Kinsale in my constituency of Cork South-West.  Such announcements have not arisen by coincidence but are the result of renewed political and economic stability in Ireland, brought about by a pan-European approach to solving the sovereign debt crisis and re-instilling fiscal discipline in countries.  Investors and employers around the globe are enthused by Ireland’s story of recovery and in particular by what it has to offer them as a European base for business.  However, they also need reassurance that Ireland is pursuing a sensible, disciplined budgetary agenda and is taking seriously the task of stabilising its economy after years of reckless mismanagement.  Therefore, by ratifying this treaty, Ireland is sending a robust message to potential global investors that this is a country that is confident, united and is a place worthy of doing business and in which to create jobs.  It is not the solution to the jobs crisis but will lock into the Government’s broader pro-jobs and pro-growth strategy and will send a strong signal to the world that Ireland is serious about stability.The European Union, as we now know it, was born out of the European Coal and Steel Community, which was established under the Treaty of Rome in 1957, and the European Atomic Energy Community, which was set up in the same year under the EURATOM treaty.  The European Union is the longest running and most successful peace process on the planet.  Henry Kissinger once asked: "Who do I call if I want to call Europe?"  We need a strong, balanced and reasonable debate, based on the content of the treaty and not on extraneous issues which others may wish to introduce.  European relations with Ireland have never been better.  In the short 13 or 14 months during which it has been in power, the Government has renegotiated the EU-IMF deal.  That was a huge achievement for the country.  The Government has also done a deal on the promissory notes, which is another example of how good relations are between Ireland and Europe.Balanced democracy is not about assaulting gardaí or RTE cameramen, neither is it about the failure of certain Members of this House to dissociate themselves from thuggish and violent behaviour.  It is instead about balanced and diverse views and robust debate.  I would welcome such balance and diversity in the context of the debate on this Bill.
#DominicHannigan	unknown-#DominicHannigan-party	unknown-#DominicHannigan-dob	unknown-#DominicHannigan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	476	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this important legislation.  I wish to refer to the work carried out by the Joint Committee on European Affairs and the recently established Sub-Committee on the Referendum on the Intergovernmental Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union, both of which I chair.  During the past two months, the latter has heard from a range of speakers who support and oppose the treaty.  We have heard from various civil groups, such as the Irish National Organisation for the Unemployed, the Irish Farmers Association and the National Youth Council of Ireland, think tanks such as TASC, trade unions such as UNITE, and business groups such as IBEC, the Small Firms Association and Chambers Ireland.  Representatives from these various organisations have all addressed the sub-committee and outlined their views on what the treaty means for Ireland.  We have also heard the views of Irish political representatives.  Yesterday, for example, we were addressed by the leaders of Fianna Fáil, the United Left Alliance, ULA, and the Labour Party.  In addition, we have been addressed by Ireland's MEPs.  Furthermore, a range of economists, lawyers and academics from this country and several ambassadors from across Europe outlined to us what they believe the treaty will mean for the people of both Ireland and Europe.The sub-committee has engaged in a diverse and productive series of debates and it will continue with these until the end of next week, when the Taoiseach is due to address it.  The sub-committee will publish a report on its proceedings by mid-July and the aim is that this will provide a summary of the various arguments and positions outlined to it.  It is not the intention for the sub-committee's report to influence people into voting either "Yes" or "No".  In that context, we will not be making a recommendation.  We will, however, be providing an unbiased, informative and easy-to-read summary of the evidence and main arguments presented to us.During the debate on this matter, the same arguments have arisen time and again.  I am of the view that the stability treaty does exactly what it says on the tin.  Through improved fiscal responsibility and oversight we can ensure that there will be economic stability.  We must be honest with the people: this treaty will not really introduce any new conditions.  It will, however, ensure that the previously agreed six-pack will be put in place.  One of the consequences of this is that larger European states will be prevented from having one set of rules for themselves and another set for the rest of us.  More importantly, however, if the Irish people vote for the treaty, it will improve international investor confidence in this country, make a repeat of the current crisis less likely, assist in the process of European economic recovery and stability and give us access to the ESM should we need it.Some individuals have stated that if we reject the treaty and if Article 136 of Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, TFEU, is thereby not amended, we can hold Europe to ransom and state that if we do not gain access to the ESM, then neither will the other member states involved.  The sub-committee has heard from various sources that this will not prove to be the case and that Europe does not need Ireland in order to amend Article 136 and allow the ESM to take effect.Informing people that there is no potential disbenefit in the context of voting against the treaty is both wrong and extremely dangerous.  We do not want to be in a position whereby we cannot access the ESM if we need to do so.  It is not the case that we will not lose out by rejecting the treaty.  There are definite dangers in the context of rejecting it.  Conversely, there are many benefits to be had by putting the treaty in place.  I am of the view that voting "Yes" makes all the sense in the world.  I cannot see any benefit from voting "No".  I will be leading my team in the constituency of Meath East in the context of trying to convince the people there to vote "Yes" in the referendum on the treaty.  I have no doubt that it is going to be a tough campaign.  However, once they have all the facts before them, the people will see that the treaty will help to create a stable environment, engender confidence in our economy and assist in attracting more jobs to our country.
#PatrickODonovan	unknown-#PatrickODonovan-party	unknown-#PatrickODonovan-dob	unknown-#PatrickODonovan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	477	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  It is important to bear in mind what we are actually speaking about, namely, a question which is being put to the Irish people and which asks if the policies that created the difficulties being experienced by our economy can be avoided in the future.  The treaty which is the subject of the referendum brings together the member states that use the euro as a common currency and ensures that the policies of such states will not in the future be able to impact on the stability of the currency.  Europe could easily be criticised for the speed of its reaction to the current crisis, for the lack of certainty that existed for such a long period and for the fact that clear direction was not provided.  This criticism could be justified because strong rules relating to the security of the currency were not in place.Why vote "Yes" to the treaty?  In my opinion the treaty offers member states the knowledge that in the event of their requiring assistance in the future, said assistance will be forthcoming.  More importantly, however, it will prevent future administrations from doing what governments comprising Fianna Fáil, the Progressive Democrats and the Green Party did to this country.  A "Yes" vote will inform the world that we value our place in Europe and that we are proud to be part of the most successful political entity - which supports peace, prosperity, fairness and equality - in the modern era.  A "Yes" vote will also state that Ireland, more than any country, values the right of the people to have their say on issues of constitutional importance.  It will also indicate that we, more than most, know how essential it is for governments to behave responsibly and live within their means.A "Yes" vote will also state that while we are currently borrowing €75 euro per week in respect of every man, woman and child in the State, we will strive to regain our economic independence, we will play our part in ensuring that if any of our European colleagues require the help we needed in the past, such assistance will be available and we will see to it that a fair approach is taken in respect of those who find themselves in difficulty in the future.  A "Yes" vote will ensure that unexpected events that may have a major bearing on a country's economy, such as a crop failure or an ecological or some other disaster, can be worked through with the support of the other member states, recognising that it is not possible to legislate for disasters but also being mindful of the consequences that can arise if such disasters occur.Why vote "No" to the treaty?  In my view there is no reason to do so.  The arguments that are being put forward by those on the "No" side are the same tired old versions that have been used by eurosceptics and extreme left-wing fundamentalists since the EU was founded.  Given that every treaty has been endorsed by the Irish electorate, the "No" side has continually been proved wrong.  On this occasion, the outcome will be no different.  If we had listened to those on the "No" side in the most recent referenda, we would be obliged to ask ourselves whether communities that have been plagued by unemployment would have had access to, for example, the European Globalisation Fund.  Some Deputies who are so vociferously opposed to the current treaty are also trying to ensure that moneys from the latter fund will be spent in their constituencies.Those on the "No" side want to play Russian roulette with the Irish economy.  It is clear to me and to everyone else on this side of the House that there is no plan B.  Unlike on previous occasions, it is not the case that all member states must sign up to the treaty.  If 12 countries sign up, then, as the Taoiseach stated, the train will leave the station.  The "No" side is a mixum-gatherum of people who are fundamentally negative about everything.  It would be a lonely, backward stroll into the unknown if we, with our small, open economy, were to reject the principle of balanced budgets, inform our colleagues in Europe that we are not prepared to play by the rules, tell investors that we are happy to go down the road previously travelled by Bertie Ahern et al., and declare to the world that Ireland is not open for business.Those who state that the treaty contains only austerity measures clearly have not read it.  Ironically, the treaty is largely opposed by those on the extreme left.  The latter are now advocating the approach of the Ahern-McCreevy-Harney school of economics-----

The ULA, People Before Profit, the extreme socialists and Sinn Féin have found themselves to be the natural successors to the Progressive Democrats.  They are a motley crew and they advocate that the Government should stay away from the issue of controlling expenditure and that governments should not impose rules.  The philosophy of no rules, no regulation, no oversight and no consequences is what got us into this mess in the first instance.  The new band of progressive democrats in this Dáil want that philosophy to be adopted once again.Small, open economies such as Ireland's do not have the luxury of operating in the so-called eurosceptic bubble.  It is certain that the Marxist-Leninist-communist elements in this House would lead this country into a soviet-style economic winter if they got their way.  It is a pity that the mask and balaclava, only recently removed from Irish politics and which clearly have no place in Ireland, re-emerged last weekend in such an ugly fashion.  All democrats in this Dáil should oppose any element that tries to undermine the democracy of this State and condemn the thuggish elements that seek to conceal their identity while attacking members of An Garda Síochána.This is an important treaty for the people of Ireland in constituencies around the country in telling the world that Ireland is open for business.  We want inward investment and to be at the centre of Europe.  We want a stable currency, balanced budgets and our people back to work in an economy built on a rock-solid foundation rather than the sand that was so easily washed away in 2008.  This is a treaty concerning the future of this country and it is not about the extraneous issues which some people will drag into this Chamber.  It has nothing to do with most of what we will hear in the next couple of minutes from some of the speakers lining up behind me.  It is about the type of future we want for the coming generations and in my opinion, the only route this country must take is a clear and resounding "Yes" vote.  It is "Yes" to Ireland being at the centre of Europe and "Yes" to getting our people back to work.

The dishonesty comes from opinion on the causes of the crisis in the first place, which it is claimed the treaty is trying to address.  Any honest assessment of the beginnings of the crisis would indicate that the European Central Bank's interest rate policy of pumping cheap money into the peripheral countries, with a mantra of competition and deregulation of financial markets, were two major causes.  This treaty does not address such issues at all and instead the compact is dictated by precisely the ECB and EU authorities who promoted the policies that caused the crisis.  It is also being promoted by political parties, such as Labour, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, who told us during the debates on the Lisbon treaty that we should vote for those changes because they would give us jobs and economic stability.  It was precisely the policies of the ECB as set out in those treaties and the policies of deregulation of markets, including unrestrained competition in those markets, that led directly to the crisis.

Why are we bringing in a treaty focusing on those issues rather than the actual causes of the economic crisis?  In order to pay back bankers, speculators, German and French banks and bondholders, we must meet deficit and debt targets; it is to recover gambling losses at our expense.  The consequences will be devastating if we must meet these targets.  After we get out of the troika programme, we will need approximately €6 billion in austerity cuts and measures, and if this fiscal compact kicks in by 2015, we will need approximately 5% cuts in spending annually for four years in order to meet targets.

It might clarify the fact that they have joined a party which is centre-right and is gradually drifting further right.  That is what their policies represent.  The Deputies from Labour and Fine Gael have given some reasons to vote "Yes" but they have repeatedly stated there are no reasons to vote "No".  Of course there are reasons to vote against the compact, although I am not here to advocate voting in such a way.  There are reasons to vote "Yes" and equally there are reasons to vote "No".  When the Government states there are no reasons to vote "No" but there are reasons to vote "Yes", it does a disservice to the Irish people.

Why would somebody consider a "No" vote?  I have considered the six pack, the Stability and Growth Pact and the fiscal compact.  I have some background in economics, although I am not an economist and do not have a PhD in economics.  I do not understand their complexity, although I get them at a basic level.  There is a wide range of deeply complex economic measures in there.  This will shift power from politicians towards technocrats, a dangerous development on which we must keep an eye.  Compliance is becoming so technical that it will require a PhD in economics which most elected representatives do not have.  The structural deficit is an example of this problem.  The structural deficit requirement of 0.5% is one of the main metrics in the fiscal treaty, yet economists cannot agree on what is a structural deficit.  That is the level of complexity being introduced and it is bad news.

They are not in any doubt as to the concept of a structural deficit.  There is a difference.
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	527	They cannot even measure the structural deficit.  We are about to sign up to a serious treaty that requires compliance with a structural deficit target that no one can measure, which is crazy.Compliance will lock in austerity.  Various Deputies referred to not repeating the mistakes of the past.  The point of the treaty is to lock in an austerity based approach from where we are now.  The treaty is characterised by gunboat diplomacy and reminds me of the conversation we had about the bonds when we were told to pay the bondholders.  We are being told to sign the treaty and, although it may not be in the interests of the country, the country will be destroyed if we fail to do so because we will be locked out of access to the European Stability Mechanism and the European Central Bank will withdraw its emergency liquidity assistance and collapse our banking system.  This destroys the principle of solidarity on which the Europe of which I am proud to be part has been built.  We have seen a dangerous trend in this direction in recent years.Unfortunately, the threat to lock out access to the European Stability Mechanism is enshrined in the treaty.  This is the only reason I can find to vote "Yes" and it is a powerful one.  Notwithstanding assurances that we will not need access to the mechanism, having such access, even if we do not draw down funding, is very important.  While there are many reasons to vote "No", I can find only one very powerful reason to vote "Yes".  The Government has proffered a series of reasons for approving the treaty.  Just a few hours ago in Baldoyle, the Taoiseach stated that ratification of the European Union fiscal stability treaty would represent an insurance policy against future mismanagement of the country's finances.  He added that approval of the treaty would provide "a guarantee that no Government of the future will ever again run riot either with the people's fortunes or with the people's money."  He continued, "I hope that business leaders and more particularly, those who work in businesses. . . will be able to say quite openly that they believe in what they do, they appreciate the work and the employment that these firms give and for that reason they want that to continue and will as a consequence vote ‘Yes'."  These are serious statements to make to citizens.  The Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, had an extraordinary article published in  The Irish Times on Monday which echoed some of the sentiments expressed by the Taoiseach.  In the article, he linked a “Yes” vote to continued troika and ECB funding of our banking system through the emergency liquidity assistance programme.  These claims are not true and I encourage the Government to stop engaging in this type of scare-mongering. The treaty will not stop us repeating the mistakes of the past, which were made during the bubble when Ireland was fully in compliance with the main provisions of the treaty.  For the Taoiseach and various Deputies to argue that ratifying the treaty will avoid the mistakes of the past is untrue and they should not make such statements.  They also argue that the treaty will create jobs, which is not the case.  The treaty means we are forced into a programme of debt pay-down and a budget balancing mechanism.  While we can argue about whether this is the correct approach, it most certainly means that money will not be available for a large-scale stimulus which would create jobs.  While it is possible that a "No" vote could destroy even more jobs, the Government should stop making statements that the treaty will create new jobs.  It is highly irresponsible to link approval of the treaty to troika and ECB funding and I ask members of the Government to stop engaging in this type of scare-mongering.An argument is made that the treaty will improve stability. I do not believe it will improve stability for Ireland at this juncture.  The analogy that comes to mind is a fit triathlete - the German economy - and someone who has just come out of intensive care - sadly, this is Ireland being told to run five miles per day, have a balanced diet, avoid ice cream and so forth.  While requiring the triathlete to follow this advice may make sense, requiring a recovering patient who has just left intensive care to do so could kill him.  Ireland will not be in a position in the next two or three years to comply with the rules of the treaty.  As such, attempting to do so could lead to further instability because the economy is not growing as planned and jobs are not being created as we would wish.  Ultimately, this will bring us to a bad place to which we do not want to go, namely, the possibility of engaging in a forced restructuring of sovereign debt, a scenario that would cause more instability than anything we have discussed in this debate.I do not yet know how I will vote on the treaty.  There are many reasons to vote "No" and one very important reason to vote "Yes".  It is about finding the balance.

I happen to be a socialist and I was candid about my policies during the general election campaign.  I engaged openly with people in Waterford about who I am and what I stand for, as the Minister has done on many occasions.  People were comfortable with that and I was elected to the House.  Branding me as "extreme left" is out of order.  I am what I am, unlike other Deputies who made all sorts of promises and got themselves elected to the House on the basis of lies.  I wanted to clarify that matter for a former Deputy.My difficulty with the treaty is that by voting "Yes", I would be gambling with the future of the coming generations because I would be supporting a decision to cede an extraordinary degree of control over economic and fiscal policies from elected governments to unelected bureaucrats and judges in the European Commission in Brussels and European Court of Justice in Luxembourg.

#JohnHalligan	unknown-#JohnHalligan-party	unknown-#JohnHalligan-dob	unknown-#JohnHalligan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	532	Many people share my view.  They are not happy with how Europe is run and believe it is completely undemocratic.  While this may be one of the reasons people will vote "No", they should vote on the basis of what the treaty does and I believe that will happen.Supporting the treaty's demand for a balanced budget and fines of hundreds of millions of euro for countries which breach targets will impose crippling austerity regardless of which Government is elected or what mass movements develop against austerity, as I fully expect will occur in this country.  The condition in the fiscal treaty that forbids access to the new European Stability Mechanism rescue fund to any nation which does not approve the treaty is nothing short of bullying and a tactic to force Irish people to vote in favour of the fiscal compact.  Many people are anxious to learn the reason the Government quietly agreed to insert such a clause in the treaty in a change from what was agreed in July of last year.  The Government continues to have a veto over this blackmail clause.Building the campaign overwhelmingly on a message of scare-mongering, as the Government is about to do, is shameful behaviour by elected representatives and undermines the principle of democracy.  The same holds for the fiscal compact, which denies the right of member state to run a structural budget deficit of more than 0.5%.  Has the democratic right of national parliaments to decide national budgets been removed?  If so, what is the purpose of the Oireachtas?  Should we not bother to introduce a budget this year or next year and allow the European Union to do so on our behalf?  The structural deficit requirement is outrageous.Many people believe the hype that a "Yes" vote will guarantee that the mistakes that led to the economic crash in 2008 will never be repeated.  The debt to GDP ratio of 60%, general government deficit ceiling of 3% and new 0.5% structural deficit rule would have made little difference if they had been in place in Ireland prior to 2008.    As it happens, in 2007 the general government balance was 0.3%, the structural balance was 2.3% and our debt to GDP ratio was 24.8%.  In short, we were already completely compliant with the various components proposed under the fiscal treaty.

The Minister is quick to tell the Irish people that our lifeline will be cut off if we do not vote "Yes".  I believe the treaty commits Ireland to years and years of austerity, further unemployment and cuts in benefits.  There is no question about that and there is no point in denying it.  We heard too much before the election that this would not happen and that this Government would not bring in austerity measures.  The Minister said it himself in every television programme and everywhere he was in a debate.  There is no question in my mind that the people have to ask themselves whether this will happen if we vote "Yes".  There is no question about that and I think the Government should be honest.  Its members should not come in here and tell us we are not going to face further austerity over five or six years, that we are not going to face high unemployment rates and that we are going to face economic growth; we are not.  All the indications across Europe suggest otherwise, including what all the top economists are saying, irrespective of what way we vote on the treaty.  That is what we are facing for the next few years.

These are the facts, irrespective of whether people like them.  This treaty has three main provisions which relate to the balanced budget rule, the debt brake rule and the arrangements of the eurozone governments.  Let us have a debate on the issue of the treaty, not on ideology, not on bogs, not on septic tanks, not on water meters, but on the treaty and on Europe.  Let us have that debate.  Much of this treaty is already in place.   Crucially, however, the treaty addresses one of the major failure of the Stability and Growth Pact, because large member states will no longer be permitted to avoid the consequences of breaching the rules by ganging up to out vote the smaller member states.  That is important.  It is important that the same rules apply to Ireland as apply to Germany or to France.There have been many comments on the European Stability Mechanism and the member states.  Deputy Donnelly has a viewpoint.  The reality is that there is a guaranteed fund available for emergency loans to countries which need financial assistance.  We must ratify the treaty.  We have an obligation to do so.  Our Government's expressed intention is that we will not need access to he European Stability Mechanism in the future, but we need to have that availability open to us.  The ability to access the fund is an important insurance policy.  I would like to ask a question of the Members opposite who are opposed to whatever their ideology stands against.  Where would we be as a country if we did not have access to the EU, the IMF and the ECB?

Some of the Members opposite are very good at scaring.  We saw some of that behaviour last weekend in Galway.  They were on the public airwaves and they denounced nothing and saw nothing.  They were really conflicted.  Let us have a debate about Europe and where we want to be.  Let us not allow the same old arguments to continue by the crowd opposite who were opposed and by the crowd opposite who were for.  Let us have a real debate about what it is to be in Europe.Some of the Members opposite will say this is about austerity.  It is not about austerity.  The Government's overall budget terms have been agreed with the troika and we are committed to reducing our deficit to 3% by 2015.  People will be told the treaty bans future stimulus measures, but it does not.  The treaty allows flexibility and it allows for stimulus measures.  The treaty provides that a Government may deviate from the balanced budget rules "in periods of severe economic downturn..." so long as "...it does not endanger fiscal stability in the medium term."

By voting "Yes", we ensure we have a strengthened Europe.  By voting "Yes", we ensure we have a message of hope, which Deputy Murphy said we do not have.  I will not even go down the road of what Deputy Higgins said this afternoon, because I do not have time for it.  Let us stop making the outlandish claims, the hyperbole and feigning indignation and anger.  Let us have a debate about what is important for our people for stopping emigration and creating jobs.  Let us have a real debate about that.  Let us stop this feigning on local radio about being real Irish people.  We are all Irish people and we are all proud to be Irish, but let us stop the crying about whatever.  Let us stand up and be counted.  Let us put the people of Ireland first and the not our little fiefdoms in our constituencies.

#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	576	Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to have my say this evening on this very important Bill.  The Bill gives effect to the referendum on the Treaty on Stability, Co-ordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union.  The main purpose of the treaty is to create greater discipline among member states right across Europe.  Fiscal discipline is not new to the EU, but is something that has lacked enforcement and leadership in the past.  Member states which signed up to the euro had to meet the Maastricht criteria and the Stability and Growth Pact was put in place to ensure the participating countries observed the rules.  The pact obliged members to practice prudent fiscal policies and more particularly to maintain broadly balanced national budgets over the economic cycle.  The failure of the European Council to apply sanctions against countries such as France and Germany when they breached the criteria showed a complete disregard for the rules that had been put in place, and that caused major problems.  In the case of Germany, it used its size and power to reach a compromise regarding its budget deficit and therefore avoided any sanctions.What this treaty aims to do is to foster long-term budgetary discipline in the EU and the euro area.  The treaty will reinforce the Stability and Growth Pact and it will also promote greater economic governance and fiscal discipline.  The decision to use the six pack and various other types of votes to reverse an agreed programme ensures that states which exceed the permissible deficits will find it more difficult to escape punishment.  The deficit rule will require countries to ensure that public debts are kept at safe levels which is to be set at 60% of GDP.  Economic research on this level has shown that anything in excess of this figure would have a negative effect on jobs and economic growth.  That is what this must be about, particularly given the situation in which this country finds itself.The main difference between this treaty and the existing provisions in EU regulations is that these rules will be implemented into national legislation and will require greater self-discipline by the participating countries.  By endorsing this treaty we as a country are sending a strong and positive message to the world, as this treaty will contribute to our recovery, ensure economic stability for our country and will contribute greatly to the restoration of confidence in Ireland, which has been at a desperately low ebb for the past number of years.  Young people who have left our shores and emigrated to Australia, America, Canada, England and even to mainland Europe are looking to us to do something to change our economy and make this a better place for them, to make their homeland that they so love a place to which they can return and get a job.  Too often in recent years we have seen highly educated young people leave these shores and this has had an impact on GAA clubs, rugby clubs and soccer clubs.  Two young lads will leave my village next week.  They are on the local GAA team and their leaving will be a loss to our community.While young people may want to go away and see the world, what they want us to do is to make sure that when return to our shores they can get a job and that they have an opportunity like each and every one of us in this House has.  That is what is important.  That is the responsibility of us in government.  While Members can say what they want when in opposition and that is their job, those in opposition have not been constructive in the past 12 months in their attitude to the people who have left our shores.  Being constructive in that respect is the important point that we need to stress and that is what these people are seeking.  It is very easy to use septic tanks and every other excuse one can think of to embarrass the Government.  In the next six or eight weeks the Members of this House should show leadership, do what is good for Ireland, do what is good for our young people and show our determination to do that in a realistic way by making sure that in four years time when we leave this House to go to the country we will have it in a better place.

I am surprised that Deputy Donnelly is undecided because he is normally a man of great certainty.  I know him as a fellow financial economist and I have no doubt if he was advising a client in the morning and Ireland Inc., or the Irish Government was the client, he would advise everyone to vote "Yes" for the treaty.  He is increasingly entering the world of politics and on something like the fiscal compact treaty one has to be careful not to veer too much into the political side away from reality, the pragmatic position and what this fiscal compact treaty will do for Ireland.  I see it in very simple straightforward terms.  By voting "Yes" one will get certainty.  People can agree or disagree but one will get certainty that one has the insurance policy of the ESM fund.  I hope we never have to access it but it is an insurance policy.  It gives certainty to multinationals considering investing in Ireland in that one of the key ingredients investors seek is certainty.  They will get certainty if we vote "Yes" for the fiscal compact treaty.  They get much more certainty than if we vote "No".  Those on the "No" side never say exactly what will happen if one votes "No".  The referendum on the fiscal compact treaty requires a proper debate-----

The public want it to be based on facts.  People are aware that under the IMF-EU programme there are major constraints.  We have to get down to under 3% of debt to GDP by 2015.  Deputy Donnelly and I agree that too much debt is effectively an anti-growth measure in itself.  It is a regressive measure.  We need to get our debt down.What is in the fiscal compact treaty is no different from what we already signed up under the six pack last December bar there are issues in terms of imposing fines and other elements to it.  In the main, it is the same.

We have to get our debt to GDP ratio down to 60% and that will be done over a period of time.  What needs to be explained to people is that this is not about getting debt levels down to 60% of gross domestic product overnight.  We have to bring down by one twentieth per year the difference between the 60% and what the debt level is.

Growth will be a key ingredient.  If we achieve a reasonable level of growth, that will take care of that particular measure.  Furthermore, as the Deputy will be well aware, most debt is never repaid by governments, they roll over the debt.  We are in a difficult bind at present.  We are in the IMF-EU programme and to access funding we have to borrow from that programme.  We cannot borrow at any sort of reasonable rates on the international markets.Our objective is twofold.  We have to balance the books and the position in terms of the fiscal compact is difficult but we already have to balance the books.  It is like getting funding from anywhere when one is overstretched, we have to bring the debt back to a manageable form, which is good housekeeping.  Second, it will enable us to put in place the ingredients that are necessary for us to re-enter the markets.  I want us to regain our financial sovereignty.  Why would they give us money if our debt levels are very high and we are running a large overdraft on an annual basis?If we vote "No" to this treaty, however, what will happen?  This is what the "No" side needs to explain.

If we vote "Yes" we are putting in place in a structured form what we have already agreed; it is good housekeeping.  We also get a guarantee, if required, as an insurance policy, that we will have access to the ESM, if we need it.  If we vote "No" we are in a situation where there is a huge degree of uncertainty for both Ireland and Europe.

Multinational companies look for certainty in any market.  With the fiscal compact in place, they get it.We have already brought in very difficult measures so I commend the Bill to the House.  Deputy Donnelly is a reasonable man and when he looks at the cold facts of the case in a pragmatic way, he will come out and extol a "Yes" vote to ensure we have the certainty we so desperately need.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	592	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Thirtieth Amendment of the Constitution (Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union) Bill 2012.Fianna Fáil is a pro-EU party because we believe it is the only credible context in which the small, peripheral country of Ireland can succeed.  Many people are suffering today because of the impact of the recession, unemployment is very high and living standards are under pressure but we must be honest and acknowledge that since 1973 Ireland has benefited greatly from being in the EU.  Being an active member is always more beneficial than being on the outside.  Membership of the EU gives security for those wanting to invest and opportunities for those who want to export.  The EU remains an immense force for good in areas such as equality, education and working conditions.It is important, however, to note that because we are pro-EU does not mean we are uncritical.  There are issues we will be highlighting in that context.  There is a duty on all those who want the Union to work to improve it and address its shortcomings.  We support the fiscal treaty not because it is the answer to Europe's problems but because it is an essential part of the answer, although not a major part.  A stronger and more transparent set of budgetary rules for countries sharing the euro is part of what most experts say is required to secure long-term access to debt markets at affordable rates.  It is important not just from Ireland's point of view but because we wish to see other countries involved in the mechanism following the rules.  It is no good Ireland being a good European - sometimes too good - if some of the other, mainly Mediterranean, countries are not observing the rules.  This is not just to place strictures on the Irish economy, it is to ensure the same strictures will apply to other people.  We need to have that confidence as a country.The contents of this treaty are entirely consistent with what we signed up to in the Maastricht treaty 20 years ago.  Many people will say it is a panacea to all of our ills but we should not over-claim the benefits of the treaty.  It is important to acknowledge that it would not have prevented our problems and cannot be presented as a measure that will ensure the crisis never happens again.  There is nothing in the treaty to prevent another banking crisis and had it been in force five years ago, it would not have prevented the banking crisis then.  Nothing in the treaty could have prevented the build-up of our national debt, which is a big part of what is involved in the treaty.  The treaty does not even purport to deal with those issues and it is important that people should not make exaggerated claims about it.The treaty must form part of a wider effort to address the euro's faults.  We need to propose reform of the European Central Bank.  Every time I have spoken on this issue in recent months, I have said the ECB must be reformed, with more unified financial regulation and an increased budget to provide for investment in the regions and areas with high and rising unemployment.  In the midst of this unprecedented crisis, the European Union must be willing to change to reflect the new situation.  The treaty is a fair and reasonable part of a broader response to the crisis.  It will have a direct and positive impact on Ireland and Fianna Fáil is committed to its ratification.Before we get lost in the specifics, the stability treaty was signed on behalf of the Government by the Taoiseach in Brussels on 2 March 2012.  A total of 25 of the 27 members of the EU have signed this and we now have each of the individual countries ratifying it.  There are 27 countries in the EU, two have said they are staying out, Britain and the Czech Republic, which leaves 25 member states.  There are 17 eurozone states, which means approximately eight countries that are not in the eurozone but that are in the EU will also be part of this stability treaty.  That makes a nonsense of the claim by the Tánaiste on "The Week in Politics" on Sunday when he said the treaty is all about the euro.  He was wrong when he said that.  The euro is very important but several countries are signing up to the treaty that are members of the EU but that are not eurozone members.  It was wrong for the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to tell the Irish people this treaty is all about the euro.  It has a lot to do with the euro but there are many other aspects involved in it and it encompasses countries that are not involved in the euro.  At the moment polls suggest a majority favour the passing of the referendum but it will be important those on the Government side do not display the same arrogance, assuming they can tell the people what they feel like hearing in advance of polling day and expect them to swallow it.  They did not swallow it in the referendum on Oireachtas committees last autumn because of some of the things the Minister for Justice and Equality said.  I ask the Tánaiste to withdraw and clarify that comment because we are now at the start of the campaign and he is putting out a message after his party's annual conference on prime time television and already he is misleading and not speaking accurately about the purpose of this stability treaty and I call on him to correct that.  If he and other Ministers continue to make wild political statements that might be half right or substantially right, that is not good enough.  People want complete accuracy and if people feel Ministers are not speaking accurately, we should not be surprised if they react accordingly.The notice was published in the Dáil today that deals with the details of the ballot paper that will be issued to people to vote.  I will not read it out because everyone will see it.  It will ratify the treaty signed in Brussels on 2 March 2012 and states that no provision of our Constitution invalidates law enacted, Acts done or measures adopted by the State that are necessitated by obligations of the State under that treaty, or prevents law enacted having force of law in the State.  We are asking people to vote "Yes" if they support that.  It is important that when there is a referendum that people should be asked to vote "Yes" to show their assent.On previous occasions when one was trying to ban something, one voted "Yes" if one was against what was being proposed.  It is good, therefore, that it is a straight "Yes" vote.However, people will ask about the obligations under the treaty.  One is bound to worry when one hears the person who might be the next President of France say he wishes to make changes to the treaty.  What happens if there are changes to it?  We have been told it is not open to negotiation but what happens if Ireland votes for the treaty on 31 May and France succeeds in some renegotiation of it under the new government, if there is a new government, later this year?  Will we be obliged to set aside the result of our referendum and return to it again?  Will we have to get legal advice as to whether the changes are important?  It will then be back to the Attorney General and, inevitably, before the Supreme Court.  It is important that it be clarified that no country will be able to change the treaty in its lifetime, which is in perpetuity as the agreement contains no end date.This brings me to the issue of how the Government is handling this matter.  While people are for the treaty, if the Government does not handle the referendum properly, it could face the possibility of not getting a "Yes" vote on polling day.  There must be an effort to get a "Yes" result, but the Government is already going about it in the wrong way.  I mentioned the remarks of the Tánaiste, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, at the weekend.  When we arrived at the Dáil today we received a document in the post referring to the further Revised Estimates for 2012 for the Department of An Taoiseach.  These were published today and will be discussed by the sub-committee of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, which has responsibility for the Department of An Taoiseach.  The Taoiseach will appear before the sub-committee tomorrow, which will approve the Revised Estimates for his Department.  It is the first Department to revise its Estimates for this year and the only reason it is happening is that there is an allocation in the Revised Estimates of €4.2 million, under subheading A6, to be spent on the referendum on the EU fiscal stability treaty.The briefing note received by members of the sub-committee states that the Government will distribute a treaty guide to every household in the State during the first week of May to ensure the public is well informed.  Obviously, arrangements are already in place so the printing must have been done.  Some company, which I hope will be An Post, will deliver it to every house, rather than the fiasco that happened with the leaflets relating to the household charge which were not delivered to every house.  I hope a competent company is doing the job.  This the first time the full text of the treaty in both Irish and English will be circulated to every household.  It will be a complicated document, although I understand each version of it only runs to 17 A4 pages.  This will be followed by the distribution of an information leaflet in mid-May.  A sum of €2 million from the €4.2 million provision is for the information campaign.  Obviously that is being directly run by the Government to distribute the factual information.  There will also be a comprehensive on-line campaign, including a website dedicated to information on the treaty and the use of social media.  This is the briefing note the Taoiseach will read to the sub-committee tomorrow.The Referendum Commission has been established and planning for its campaign is under way.  However, under the Referendum Act 1998, the commission is unable to incur any expenditure until the referendum Bill is passed later this month.  A total of €2.2 million has been allocated for the Referendum Commission.  We must now rush through the Revised Estimates on Friday morning because by the time the legislation is passed by the Dáil and the Seanad next week, there will only be a month to the referendum.  The Referendum Commission, which should be in existence for much longer than a month, has no legal authority to incur any expenditure, so somebody has been doing all that work behind the scenes and the commission will obviously rubber stamp it and authorise payment for it next week.  However, until that happens next Friday, the Referendum Commission cannot engage in any expenditure.It is a rushed way of doing business.  This could have been done two months ago and the information campaign should be under way now.  It will get very helter-skelter during the month of May.  It will be a big rush.  In addition to the leaflets being sent to the houses, the Referendum Commission will publish its information which will also be circulated.  The polling cards will also be sent to houses.  There will be a great deal of activity and it is all very rushed.  The €4.2 million is additional to the cost of holding the referendum, such as the cost of manning the polling stations and the count centres on the day after the referendum.  I am not sure what the overall cost will be but I am sure the Taoiseach will outline it tomorrow.One of the most important issues people are concerned about at European level is what I call the democratic deficit.  This has increased recently.  There have effectively been bloodless coups with the removal of the governments of Greece and Italy, two democratically elected governments, by the European financial power brokers at the European Commission and the European Central Bank.  The governments were removed without an election.  That is very rare and most unusual.  There are now unelected governments in those countries and that adds to the democratic deficit.  At home, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar, adds to it when he says he has no faith in referenda.  He said they are not very democratic.  Indicating a lack of respect for people's critical assessment of these issues, he said they will talk about anything and everything under the sun rather than the content of what they are being asked to vote on.  It is another condescending remark.  Such remarks are among the reasons that referenda are lost in Ireland.  It is important that the Government is coherent and gets its act together.  It is already behind the clock, given that there are only a few weeks to go.As I said earlier, the ECB's mandate must be reformed and strengthened, and it must operate more like the Federal Reserve in the United States.  I wish to refer to some other points that have not been mentioned.  There is no mechanism in the treaty for a country to exit the stability pact.  That is one of its flaws.  A country should have the right to exit if it wishes to do so in ten, 20 or 30 years' time, but there is no mechanism to do so without collapsing the entire process.  There is no mechanism for how to respond if a country seeks a modification to the treaty.  As I mentioned, the potential incoming head of state in France might choose to do this, and I do not know where our referendum will stand in that situation.The treaty provides that a country's deficit shall not exceed 3% of gross domestic product, GDP, and the government debt should not exceed, or is sufficiently declining towards, 60% of GDP.  They are the targets in the treaty and fines can be imposed by the European Court if they are not reached.  Countries whose government debt exceeds 60% of GDP must reduce their debt by an average of one twentieth per year as a benchmark.  This is a critical issue.  In its effort to secure a "Yes" vote the Government must produce financial projections.  This is a financial treaty, but I have seen no proper documents aside from long wordy pages.I do not have time to quote remarks made by Brian Lucey, either on his website or to the Oireachtas committee yesterday, about the trajectory of our national debt.  Most countries that have signed up to the treaty will not have a problem bringing their debt down over a 20 year period to 60% of GDP.  However, Ireland's debt is at 120% so we must reduce it by 60% over those 20 years.  Therefore, we can have no deficit and must run a surplus of at least 3% per annum to reduce our debt under this agreement.  That will amount to €3 billion or €4 billion per annum for the 20 years after we exit the IMF bailout and the transitionary period.  I asked the Oireachtas research service what country in the world has ever reduced its national debt by 60% in 20 years.  It could not find any country that has ever done it aside from Ireland during the Celtic tiger economy.  However, we now know that some of the figures produced at that time were a mirage.  No country in the developed or undeveloped world has been able to achieve that target.The Government must set out how Ireland will live for the next 25 years if it is to meet the debt reduction targets.  Deputy Kieran O'Donnell said earlier that countries do not usually pay off their debt but simply roll it over.  However, this agreement ensures that a country must reduce its debt.  Germany has not paid its debts from World War II but we are expected to reduce our debt over 20 years.  No other country in the west has been asked to do that.  The details of that must be spelt out.  Inflation and growth might make the job easier, but one cannot assume there will be major growth in the years ahead.I am calling on the Government to put forward financial projections based on the debt trajectory to which Brian Lucey has referred.The treaty contains a provision for a country that does not join up by 1 March 2013 to join subsequently.  On the last page of the treaty there is a provision whereby a country that has not signed up by then is free to enter at a later stage.  That would include the United Kingdom and the Czech Republic.  I know there can be no renegotiation by a small country, but could Ireland vote "Yes" in 2013 or subsequently and join at a later date?  Even if we are not on the train when it leaves the station we can get on at a stop down the line.  Article 15 says, the treaty will be open to accession to member states other than those who have already signed up to it.  Article 15 makes provision for countries to join at a later date.  That is important.The voting arrangements must be clarified.  If a country is in breach of its agreement under the treaty, Article 7 says its obligation shall not apply where it is established among the contracting parties whose currency is the euro that a qualified majority of them, calculated by analogy with the relevant provisions of the EU treaties on which the European Union is founded...is opposed to the decision proposed or recommended.  The treaty, therefore, contains a new arrangement for a qualified voting majority to decide if a country is in breach of the terms of the treaty.  The number of countries and the percentage of member states and of the EU population that make up a qualified voting majority must be spelled out.  In this case the qualified majority is analogous, not identical, to the relevant provisions of EU treaties.  A new concept of qualified voting rights is being introduced in Article 7.  We must have clarity on this.I want the issues I have raised to be clarified in the public interest so that we will have the information and be in a position to vote "Yes".  Adequate information on these matters must be provided.  People who do not have information tend to vote "No".  If we want people to vote "Yes" we must give them the answers to these questions.  The questions can be answered in a reasonable manner but I warn the Government not to try to hedge and hide and avoid providing those answers.  If people feel the Government is not fully open with information they may choose to vote "No".Notwithstanding the clause in the treaty and the difficulties of the trajectory of our national debt, politically it is better to be part of this arrangement than to be outside it.  I call on the Government to provide clarity on these issues during the coming month so that when people come to vote on 31 May they can vote "Yes" on the basis of full information on what they are voting about.

#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	594	In every political debate there is a temptation to muddy the waters.  There will be a danger with regard to the stability treaty to make it into something it is not.  While we have conversations about austerity and linking the treaty to household charges, property taxes and water rates we must be genuine and sincere in our approach and inform people of what the treaty is about and not what it is not about.This is a difficult time for many people and they are having to make stark choices.  I know a family who have two children in college and must make the stark choice not to facilitate their third child going to college.  These are the very real choices faced by people.  They are having to decide whether to tax the car or replace the tyres.  That is the grim reality in our economy at present.  There is a temptation to muddy the waters by raising issues unconnected with the stability treaty.  Similarly, I know a tour operator in Donegal who will bring 10,000 German tourists into County Donegal between now and October of this year.  I could argue that the treaty is about encouraging more Germans to come into County Donegal, but it would be disingenuous of me to make that argument.  The treaty is not about encouraging tourism.  Likewise, it is not about austerity.The treaty is about balancing budgets and having a safety checking mechanism among the group of 25 out of 27 countries that have signed an intergovernmental agreement .  It is about putting in checks and balances to ensure solidarity.  It is not just about oversight for our country, which is the argument being made at present.  The treaty is about more than oversight for Ireland.  It will mean collective oversight to ensure that one country does not drag down the others.  That is the first objective of the treaty.The second objective relates to having access to emergency funding.  Like yourself, a Cheann Chomhairle, I am not great at predicting the future.  We do not know what is going to happen in two, three, four or five years time.  We can only put in checks and balances to prevent certain things happening and to ensure that we have access to a firewall of over €800 billion in the European Stability Mechanism.There is an important role for civic society.  I call on people who are leaders in their own communities at community, business or commercial levels to get involved in this debate.  The treaty is a document of only 11 pages.  People can inform themselves and will be informed through the Referendum Commission.  We need collective leadership from civic society.  There is a role for them to play.As a Donegal man coming from a county that voted "No" to Lisbon twice, I will say Donegal people, like many people who voted "No" in the first Lisbon referendum, felt Europe was getting out of hand and out of control and that there was a vacuum with regard to the democratic deficit.  That was the language being used on the doorsteps when I canvassed in both Lisbon treaty campaigns.  This treaty will put control mechanisms in place to ensure the EU does not get out of control and that we do not have two leaders, such as Angela Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy, as the optics of the European project.  The European Union is more than that.  It is about collective ownership and leadership and encouraging and empowering countries such as Ireland to be part of it through our European elected members and through having a more accountable Commission.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	595	I thank Deputy McHugh for sharing his time with me.I welcome the opportunity to say a few brief words in this debate and to commend the Bill to the House and, indeed, to the public on polling day.Twice in my lifetime, and I am sure more often in your lifetime, a Cheann Chomhairle, the public finances were plundered for electoral gain.  The fiscal treaty is a mechanism whereby the political classes will not be in a position to plunder the public purse for electoral gain while consigning people to mass emigration and record levels of unemployment.  This happened in the 1980s.  When I was leaving college most of my classmates emigrated.  Fortunately, many of those people returned in the late 1990s and have families here.  Regrettably, their children are now reaping the whirlwind of poor management of the public finances.  At the core of the debate on this treaty is the putting in place of structures that will prohibit that kind of plundering of the public purse and of raising levels of public expenditure that are not sustainable on the basis of taxes that are transient by nature.We recall what happened in the late 1970s, consigning a generation to emigration and high unemployment in the 1980s.    Regrettably, we see history repeating itself.  The elimination of the boom and bust cycle is the single greatest reason we should endorse the treaty.  It is not a case of capitalism versus socialism.  If my understanding is correct the treaty is being recommended by all member states of various political hues - socialist, capitalist, left wing, right wing, centre left and centre right - so it is not an ideological issue.  Sane finance is never complicated in such a fashion.I wish to raise an issue of housekeeping with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan.  On polling day I do not wish to see polling booths staffed by public servants on secondment from their current employment in receipt of a day's pay for working as poll clerks and presiding officers.  We have 450,000 people unemployed and it is time we made a concerted effort to get them into those positions on polling day.In responding to the debate I would like the Minister to deal with an issue that is critical to the content of the 11 page treaty, namely, structural deficit.  Could he outline what is the acceptable pan-European definition of structural deficit because it varies from state to state?  That will be a critical issue in terms of interpretation of the rigour within which we will have to operate.  I am satisfied that it is not the straitjacket that the "No" campaign invokes.  It is interesting to note that not a single Member from among those advocating a "No" vote is present in the Chamber.  One would have thought that they were so committed to the cause that one of them might at least be present to listen to the debate.  I am satisfied the treaty is not a straitjacket that would prohibit us from having a stimulus budget, for example, if that were necessary at various times in our economic cycle.  Such flexibility is built into the treaty.  Equally, it gives us the same say in respect of the budgets of other states who will endorse the treaty in respect of such matters as we will seek for ourselves.The other issue that is very different about this treaty in comparison with , for example, the Lisbon treaty to which Deputy McHugh referred, is that in the Lisbon treaty we effectively had a veto.  When we rejected the Lisbon treaty in the first referendum, it meant that 26 member states across Europe who had endorsed the treaty up to that point could not proceed.  However, the reality now is that if 12 member states - all of the other member states will ratify the treaty by parliamentary processes - ratify the treaty, it will come into effect.  If we say "No" then we will not be able to hold up the rest of Europe which will move on without us.  That will mean we would stand out from the crowd in Europe at a time when the common currency, which is a critical although not exclusive component of the debate, is a crucial issue.  That is not the kind of signal we should send as a small, open trading economy that is dependent on exports for our economic recovery.  A critical issue to bear in mind is that we do not have a veto.
#TomBarry	unknown-#TomBarry-party	unknown-#TomBarry-dob	unknown-#TomBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	596	I welcome the opportunity to speak in the debate.  First, we must keep it simple.  The treaty, in effect, is about reality and common sense.  It is critical that everyone should sell the treaty by expounding on its virtues.  The treaty is about sensible financial governance, removing doubt and putting certainty at the heart of all we do.I am surprised when I hear so many speakers today advocating a reckless attitude towards business.  I have been involved in business for 20 years.  It upsets me when I hear people talk about business as if they know what they are talking about when they do not.  It is one thing to set up a business but to keep it going is another, especially through these austere times.  However, we are doing it.  Europe has been good to us in many respects, including giving equal rights on pay to women and on many other issues.  However, we seem to forget the good Europe has done for us.  The Government was elected to make hard decisions.  We must do so because we are in a financial quagmire.  At least the ship is on a stable course at the moment.Each business must fulfil seven criteria.  The first is potential.  Other criteria include a business plan, reality, future budgeting and stability.  When all the criteria are in place there is hope for a business to move forward.  No successful business person will vote against the treaty because it is instrumental for the future of their business and for their employees, who form a critical element.The treaty will safeguard against reckless administrations, which we have seen, and future potential for a recurrence of such a situation.  Many previous administrations acted from self-gain or perhaps in some cases through ineptitude.  Perhaps they simply wanted to buy votes.  I hope the treaty will bring an end to such an approach.  There is a requirement to balance our books in the same way as every business.  The Government has introduced the Credit Guarantee Bill to provide partial guarantees for credit and the microfinance Bill.  We are doing what we can but it is essential that the referendum is passed in order for us to move forward.Politics is changing.  We have people on the left who are reckless.  I say that as a business person.  I do not like what happened in the context of the household charge.  Such people did not recognise democracy and they were intimidating in their attitude towards others.  This time around we will be a little harder in our attitude and we will not be bullied or intimidated.  It will not be a case of their stamping their view on everyone else for their gain.Let us make the treaty simple for all those involved in business because it will cost jobs if it does not get passed.  Europe and this country are a base for many American companies.  A total of 200,000 people are employed directly by them and a further 400,000 are employed upstream and downstream of them.  They want to be confident that this country is part of Europe and is moving forward with Europe.  A "No" vote would also mean that interest rates would increase.  Bond interest rates would increase and that would have a knock-on effect on the cost to business.The key challenge to small businesses such as mine and to other businesses is access to finance and the cost of it if one can get it.  We need growth to emerge from the deficit in terms of day-to-day spending.  The treaty will help farming, IT, SMEs and all types of businesses.  They will all be affected.  The treaty is critical for this country and its people.  I challenge anyone who suggests that the treaty will not affect business.  It is easy to speak when does not have to worry about how to pay one's staff for the following week.  It is also easy to criticise the treaty when one does not have to pay all the costs involved in business.  This country can become much more competitive, but that is a challenge for another day.  Without the treaty being accepted, we will hinder our progress.  We will have no safety net and it will cause an impediment with which we do not need to deal.

What struck me when I first looked at the treaty is how short it is.  As has been indicated, it is only 11 pages long.  The most important thing about it in contrast to previous treaties is that it contains key words that are easy to understand.  The clear message I wish to send is that the treaty must be put in a language that is simple and understandable for everyone.I am a small business man, in reality a sheep farmer.  My business has good years and bad years.  During the good years I either reinvest some of my profits back into the business or else I put it to one side because I know I will have bad years.  During the bad years there are two ways I source finance.  I either take it from my savings or, because I have proven to my bank that I am a successful business man, it will give me access to finance.  Sometimes I am in control of my situation, such as the quality of the stock I produce, but at other times I am not in control such as in terms of weather and other such variables.Cuireadh an díospóireacht ar athló.

#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	606	That is correct.  When I was president of a students' union involved in legal battles with SPUC over the distribution of abortion information in students' union magazines, I would never have dreamt that 25 years later we would still be largely fighting the same issues.  When so much has changed in Irish society in the intervening period, legally everything has remained the same.Despite the fact that this is long overdue, I feel privileged to be in a position to be able to move this motion on the Bill today on behalf of myself and Deputies Wallace and Joan Collins in the Private Members' time of the ULA so that we can play our part in what we would have to acknowledge is an historic proposal before this House.  It is the first time in the history of the State that a Bill is being put forward to advance, positively and constructively, the position of abortion rights and to attempt to deal pro-actively with a situation that is so often ignored.  We acknowledge the fact that we are only in a position to do this as a result of the input and assistance that we got from Mr. Brendan Young, Ms Alison Spillane and, particularly, Ms Yvonne Murphy, without whose support this would not have been possible.I think I speak for all of us when I say we are humbled to be moving this motion on the Bill on behalf of the 150,000 Irish women who have been exported from this country since the 1980s to access safe abortions in Britain, without adequate support, away from their families and friends and at significant financial cost, additional emotional trauma and stigma, and whose voices have been sidelined for decades and ignored.  We are saying clearly today: "Not any more."Women are not prepared to sit back and be silent any longer.  We saw that clearly yesterday with the move of Arlette, Amanda, Jenny and Ruth, who over recent days went public and told their stories of the heartbreak of having to leave Ireland to terminate their pregnancies as the foetus would not have lived.  Those women have lifted the lid on this situation in Ireland.  They have been a real inspiration to us and to many thousands of people throughout this country in highlighting the complexities and sensitivities around these issues.  They have given, and we are giving, a clear signal that people are not prepared to endure the pretence and hypocrisy that there is no abortion in Ireland when thousands of women must leave the country every year.  I refer to women who need to access life-saving medical treatment, women who have become pregnant as a result of rape, women whose foetus would not survive the birth, women for whom another child would put the family into poverty, women who feel that they are too young or too old to have children, women who would have lost their job, and women would make that decision for a number of reasons, none of them ever easy and all of them valid.  We absolutely reject the idea that these decisions are ever made lightly as a lifestyle choice.  We know this because the people making the decisions are us - loving mothers, daughters, partners, wives, sisters, friends, etc. - who should be expecting support and assistance from the State, not isolation and condemnation, because the right to control what happens to your own body really is one of the most fundamental human rights of all.Sadly, the Bill does not deal with all of these aspects and all of these cases.  It is being put forward as drafted simply because it is the most straightforward legislation that can be advanced within the confines of the existing constitutional provisions.  Our Bill can be legislated for without any complications and that is why we are putting it forward very much as a first step.  It has been proofed by the international centre for reproductive rights.  We are satisfied that it is well proofed.  No doubt the Government will say there are one or two inaccuracies in it.  That is normal for any new legislation.  The Government itself will dramatically change the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill on Committee Stage.  Equally, that can be done with our legislation; it is not a reason for stopping it.To those who say that this Bill does not go far enough, our response is that we agree.  There needs to be a far greater provision than that which we are providing here today, but that does not negate us taking the first step now.  If we do so, we can immediately improve the position of women and that, in our opinion, would assist in moving the debate forward by allowing the expert group to concentrate on all the other issues and the need for a broader provision than what we have at present.  We do not see any contradiction in that regard.To explain a few aspects of the legislation, the Bill simply legislates for the X case to allow safe abortion in Ireland where the life of a woman is at risk, including the risk of suicide.  We put this forward very much in the knowledge that it is not even 30 years since Ms Sheila Hodgers died in the Drogheda hospital, a woman denied and whose cancer treatment was stopped because it might have harmed her foetus.  That woman died an agonising death.  Her husband had to listen to her screams of pain.  She left behind two young children and a loving husband because our medical system denied her life-saving treatment because she was pregnant.It is 20 years since tens of thousands of citizens took to the streets to object to the internment of a 14 year old girl made pregnant as a result of rape and to stop the State's move to prevent her parents bringing her to England for an abortion.  Twenty years ago, people voted overwhelmingly for the right to travel, for the right to abortion information and overwhelmingly against the overturning of the Supreme Court ruling which declared that it was constitutional in Ireland to have an abortion where the life, as distinct from the health, of a woman was at risk.Ten years ago, again the Irish people voted to reject the attempts to row back on that decision.  Decades of wavering have intervened.  Not a single piece of legislation has been enacted throughout that period to give effect to that ruling.  Sometimes we look back and pat ourselves on the back that we have left behind a country of the Magdelene laundries, of women's babies being basically sold, of the Kerry babies, of Ms Ann Lovett who died secretly giving birth in a graveyard, hidden and unable to talk to people, of symphysiotomy and the crimes to which we had to listen.  We say how we have moved on from all of these matters, and yet successive Governments have allowed a situation where legislation lags behind that change by failing to bring the law up to date with the requirement that exists now.We should acknowledge in truth that the only reason there is not more pressure to change on this issue and the only reason more women have not died as a result of successive Governments' inaction is our proximity to Britain which has acted as a safety valve in that regard.  That is not good enough any longer.  Particularly now in this era of economic austerity when people simply do not have the means to come up with thousands of euro to travel, it disproportionately affects working class women, poorer women, refugee women, of course, and women whose status in this country is insecure and who cannot avail of the option to travel in that regard.The Bill allows for abortion in Ireland where it is necessary to save the life of a women based on the medical opinion of two medical practitioners, one of whom must be a clinical psychologist or a consultant psychiatrist where the risk to the life comes in the form of suicide.  Those who have been lobbying against the Bill and contacting us over the past while, giving vent in the media, etc., have stated that this Bill is not necessary because life-saving treatment is available to women in Ireland already.  Apart from the question of what the big fuss is about if all our Bill is doing is giving this reality an acknowledgement, of course, this is simply not the case.  In Ireland, legislatively, it is still the case that a patient or somebody who provides an abortion could face life imprisonment for doing so except if the life of a woman is in danger.  Precisely because there has been no legislation or policy guidelines, however, this means nothing is in place to allow this to happen.The European Court of Human Rights, which my colleagues will deal with, did not find evidence of a single abortion being carried out on that basis.  We have been deemed guilty of violating the human rights of Irish citizens by failing to provide that legislation.  Even as recently as late 2010, cases have been documented where women were denied life-saving abortions in Irish hospitals despite the wishes and intentions of their medical advisers.  That is a fact.What our Bill seeks to address is those circumstances, and only those circumstances.  If the Bill is not passed, women with life-threatening pregnancies and their doctors will be condemned to remain in exactly the same situation as existed 20 years ago, namely, forced to leave this country and forced to travel.  That point has been recognised in opposition by the Labour Party, Sinn Féin and many Deputies from Fine Gael and the other parties.  It is not good enough to recognise that and then hide behind the fact we have an expert group when we know the establishment of the expert group was delayed and that it will not issue any findings until July of this year.  In effect, with the recess and all the other scheduling issues, this means anything it will come forward with will not see the light of the day for a full year.We have an opportunity now to do something positive.  If the Minister says our Bill is not perfect, and I am sure it is not, let us work together at amending it on Committee Stage.  However, we need this Bill tabled and moved to the next Stage to advance the position for women in this regard.To deal with some other aspects, the Bill provides for a second opinion being available if the woman is not happy with the decision of her medical practitioners.  It provides for a right to appeal, with an obligation on the Medical Council to hear the case in a timely fashion because of the time pressures involved, which is in accordance with best international practice.We also place a duty of care in the legislation on the medical practitioner and the medical institution to provide abortion while, at the same time, we acknowledge the personal beliefs of some people in that regard and, in some instances, a conflict between their beliefs and professional obligations.  This is respected in the Bill which has built into it safeguards to prevent women's access to treatment being frustrated by a practitioner's personal beliefs.  A doctor can object to providing treatment as long as an alternative is available and if his rejection does not endanger the life of the woman who needs the life-saving treatment.  That same clause does not extend to the medical institution, which must provide the care, or to administrative staff, who must do their job regardless of their own beliefs on abortion and so on.We also expressly provide for the fact that efforts must be made to seek consent but that if it cannot be established in line with other life-saving treatment, it will be deemed to have been given.  There are penalties in the Bill with regard to people who would frustrate and try to obstruct a woman from getting access to this treatment in a timely fashion.This debate is not about whether to allow abortion in Ireland.  Irish abortion exists; it just does not take place in Ireland.  That is simply not acceptable in 2012.  We want the hypocrisy to end and we see this Bill as a very important step forward.It is incredibly ironic that we are discussing this on the same day a landmark change is being proposed to the lone parents system and support for children, which is being removed after the child reaches the age of seven.  We very much see this fight in the context of that one.  The fight for the right of women to choose what to do with their own bodies is equally a fight for the right of people to decide to have children if they want them, and the right to have an opportunity to rear their children with respect, dignity, economic security and so on.  That is what a real choice means.  Today is merely a first step to bring our legislation up to date.  It can be a turning point in our catching up with what has been long sought by the citizens in this country.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	607	I am very proud to be part of the introduction of this Bill put forward by the United Left Alliance and Deputy Mick Wallace, the Medical Treatment (Termination of Pregnancy in Case of Risk to Life of Pregnant Woman) Bill 2012.  The Bill is very specific.  It is based on the Supreme Court judgment in the X case.  The girl was only 14 years of age at the time and is now a woman, somewhere in this country or elsewhere.  I wish her well.It is very robust legislation, which Deputy Clare Daly has outlined well.  It has been checked with the international centre for reproductive rights and we have had legal advice on it.  It is definitely a Bill that can be worked on with the support of the Dáil, if we get agreement on it today, which should happen.I want to bring us back in time.  We must think back to 1992, although some in the Chamber might not remember what happened.  On 30 January 1992 a rape was reported to the Garda.  On 4 February the parents of the child sought advice from the Garda about the admissibility of foetal DNA evidence.  On 6 February X and her parents travelled to England and arranged an abortion for the following day.  On the same day an application was made to the High Court for a temporary injunction, which was granted by Mr. Justice Costello.  X and her parents returned to Ireland that night.  On 10 and 11 February the High Court heard in camera the application for a permanent injunction.  On 12 February the story appeared on the front page of The Irish Times and was released into the psyche of the country.  On 17 February Mr. Justice Costello granted a permanent High Court injunction.  On 20 February the parents lodged an appeal to the Supreme Court and applied for an early hearing.  That hearing took place on 24 February, again in camera.  On 25 February the Supreme Court hearing continued.  On 26 February the Supreme Court listed the injunction, with reasons to be given at a later date.In that period of time, as Deputy Daly said, thousands of people came out on the streets demanding that this child had the right to go to Britain for an abortion.  I remember distinctly seeing placards where the country was depicted as being surrounded by barbed wire, expressing the point that women were chained into this country and not allowed to go to Britain for abortions.  The Supreme Court in Attorney General v. X case ruled that a 14 year old girl pregnant as a result of rape faced a real and substantial risk to her life due to the threat of suicide and that this threat could be averted by the termination of her pregnancy.  Therefore, X was entitled to an abortion in Ireland under Article 40.3.3° of the Constitution, which requires the State to have due regard to the equal right of the life of the mother and the unborn.It was very important for me to go through that history and reflect that period because it was a very emotional period.  It was not an abstract discussion or debate but a very real situation where people in this country saw that this child needed and had a right to go to Britain for an abortion in that serious circumstance.  It is very important in this debate to dispel the myth that this legislation is opening the door to abortion on demand.  Article 40.3.3° denies a woman's rights where her health is in danger through a pregnancy with foetal abnormalities, or a pregnancy caused by rape or incest, and denies a woman's right to choose on social or economic grounds.It was a very sad occasion today for me and many others who met the women who have had to face the tragic circumstance of foetal abnormalities.  It was a turning point in that women came out to say this is not acceptable.  They were faced with a situation where they were grieving because the pregnancy would be over and then they had to face travelling out of the country on boats and airplanes like criminals.  This was the main point put across today in outlining the experiences of these women.  I salute Arleth, Amanda, Ruth, Jenny and Siobhán as well as the hundreds of women who are obliged to travel from this country every year and who take the serious decision to terminate their pregnancies.  It is an outrage that this is occurring and that these women are faced with these circumstances.  In many cases these women have been informed that if they gave birth, the child would not survive.  One woman in particular explained that the condition of her pregnancy meant she was crushing the baby.  She did not wish to continue the pregnancy and she believed the best decision would be for her to terminate it.  That was her decision and her choice.  The options were to carry through with the pregnancy or to go to England, a terrible situation to be in.  I cannot imagine having to face such an experience.The point was made clearly at today's meeting that the issue of money is serious.  It costs between €2,000 and €3,000 to terminate a pregnancy in Britain.  The grief and criminality of the experience of these women should not be accepted by any right-minded person in the country.  What kind of society are we living in when we cannot discuss providing abortion for women in these circumstances without anti-abortionists claiming that we are opening the door to abortion up to the last week of pregnancy without any qualification?I would welcome a debate on the broader circumstances in which women find themselves, including such issues as rape, incest, health and foetal abnormalities and the right for women to chose to have an abortion.  Deputy Clare Daly made some poignant comments earlier on which I wish to elaborate.  They related to how these issues affect women now that we are in a recession.  Women cannot access abortion if they do not have the money to travel.  Working women, women on low pay and migrant women cannot leave the country and cannot seek an abortion outside the country.  It is accepted in this country that abortion exists but the view is that it simply does not happen on our doorstep.  We sweep it under the carpet and suggest it can be dealt with elsewhere.  This is outrageous.There have been six successive Governments since 1992.  The Labour Party was in power during this period from 1992 to 1997.  Two referendums were held in which the people endorsed the X case rulings.  There have been three related Government committees and a fourth Government committee has been formed.  Following the outcome of the A, B and C case, the European Court of Human Rights instructed the Government to present an action plan for legislation to allow abortion in Ireland where a woman's life could be in danger because of a pregnancy.  The particular point made related to how the lack of legislation adversely affects a woman who does not have the financial means to seek medical services outside the country and how such women are particularly vulnerable.Apparently, the Labour Party will not support the Bill on the grounds that it does not go far enough.  In our view, there is no contradiction in supporting this Bill or any further legislation to provide for abortion on health or social grounds.  The Labour Party should not hide behind the Minister's expert group and cause further delays in legislation which could help vulnerable women and doctors who wish to help them by providing a legal framework for abortion in Ireland according to the limited circumstances of the X case.I refer to some of the related issues raised in recent days.  Some people claim to represent the majority of people in the country.  However, times have changed and moved on dramatically in the past 20 years.  Independent research into Irish women's and men's attitudes towards abortion was conducted by YouGov plc in 2010.  The research revealed that approximately 87% agreed that termination of a pregnancy should be permitted if the pregnancy seriously endangered the life of the woman.  Some 78% agreed that termination of a pregnancy should be permitted if a woman's health is at risk.  Some 78% agreed that termination of a pregnancy should be permitted if the pregnancy is the result of sexual abuse, rape or incest.  Some 62% agreed that termination of a pregnancy should be permitted if there is evidence of profound foetal abnormality.  Some 41% agreed that termination of a pregnancy should be permitted if the woman believes it is in her or her family's best interests.  Only 3% of respondents believed that abortion in Ireland is not acceptable under any circumstances.  However, this 3% appears to be holding this Government to ransom and has done the same for previous Governments.Another study was carried out on 25 November 2011 dealing with doctor's opinions of abortion.  Under this survey somewhat more than 50% of Irish general practitioners believe abortion should be available to any woman who chooses it.  A study earlier this year of 500 established GPs along with 250 GPs in training revealed that 48% of respondents had held a consultation in the previous six months involving a woman either before or after she had travelled abroad for termination of a pregnancy.  The study, carried out by Dr. Mark Murphy, a GP with the Sligo general practice training scheme, is understood to be the first research to examine the attitudes of GPs toward abortion and their clinical experiences of termination.  The study was based on a postal and e-mail survey of randomly chosen family doctors.  It also highlighted health problems for woman related to the issue.  Some four out of ten respondents believed a woman's health care suffered because of the requirement to travel to have a termination.  GPs reported difficulty with after-care for women affected.  One respondent noted that many women do not attend their Irish GP for after-care because they are ashamed or embarrassed and that often they present too late with infection or bleeding.  Respondents also noted the psychological stress involved.  One respondent commented on how the illegality of the action and having to travel abroad added to the traumatic effects of what was already a complex situation and a decision not taken lightly by women.  Of the established GPs surveyed, some 52% stated that abortion should be available to any woman who chose it and 24% said it should be allowed only in very limited circumstances such as a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother.  Other specific examples cited by respondents included cases of rape or sexual abuse, maternal cancer and cases involving major foetal abnormalities.  Some 11% stated that abortion should never be available while 13% expressed no definite opinion.  This is an important reflection of the thinking of the medical profession on the issue.  Things have moved on in recent years and people have accepted the reality rather than the abstract of women's decisions in this country.It is interesting to note some of the statements sent by e-mail about medical treatments and others to the effect that the Bill represents an attack on vulnerable children.  Many of the same people who sent these will vote for the Social Welfare Bill which will reduce the age for eligibility for children of lone parent payments from 14 to seven years.  This will put more children and families into the poverty trap.  In certain circumstances a person who is not working must sign for jobseeker's allowance and present for work.  What is such a person to do and where will they leave their seven year old child?  They will not leave their seven year old child because that would be wrong.  These people will be in conflict with the State in respect of the jobseeker's allowance.  The other side of the coin involves cases where women are working.  The €60 per week reduction will put them in a difficult situation since affordable child care is not available in this country and there is no after-school care.  Will the same people referred to earlier come out against the Bill to be brought forward by the Labour Party later tonight?  Where is the condemnation of that Bill from throughout society?The CSO survey on income and living conditions in Ireland 2010 showed that the inequality ratio has increased with the top 20% of earners bringing home an income 5.5 times greater than the lowest income group.  The survey also confirmed that children remain the most exposed group with a consistent poverty rate of 8.1% in 2010.  Social Justice Ireland has produced figures to show that 200,000 children are living in poverty, an increase of 92,000 in two years, during one of which the current Government has presided in the Dáil.Another argument is put forward to the effect that dressing up abortion on medical grounds is wrong.  However, this is a medical treatment.  We should debate the issue properly rather than the chaotic debate that has taken place in recent years.  A further argument is to the effect that not permitting abortion in Ireland leads Ireland to be one of the safest countries in which to be pregnant and give birth.  This is not related to the issue under debate tonight and cannot be taken as part of it.  We call on all parties to support the Bill.  The party Whip should be removed and Members should be allowed to support the legislation with a free vote.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	608	This legislation is 20 years too late.  It is hard to credit that successive Governments have failed to deal with the consequences of the Supreme Court judgment in the X case.  It is not as if it was a revolutionary judgment even at the time.  The Supreme Court found that abortion is legal in Ireland when a woman's life is at risk, including from the threat of suicide.  My colleagues and I have brought forward this Bill to provide a legislative basis for the legal termination of a pregnancy in the very limited circumstances where such treatment is deemed necessary to prevent the woman's death.  We know it is not enough, but it is a start.  Six successive Governments have refused to make that start.  We hope that failure will be addressed this week.The right to access abortion is a fundamental human rights issue. The Supreme Court decision 20 years ago was a rational one.  It was compassionate and humane.  It was the right thing to do.  Only a few weeks ago in this House we discussed the horrific nature of symphysiotomy, a violent act carried out on the bodies of women who encountered difficulties in childbirth.  It was a violent act driven by a warped religious ideology, designed to maximise the child-bearing opportunities of the mother with no regard to her future health or suffering.  This was something that took place in Ireland from the 1940s to the early 1990s, which is difficult to credit.  What action has this Parliament taken to redress the wrong done to those women whose lives were irreparably damaged?  What has this male dominated Parliament done to put an end to the urge of men to control women's bodies?  Six successive Governments have refused to do anything about the Supreme Court judgment in the X case.  The unfairness and inequality which characterise Ireland's abortion laws are replicated in the Government's approach to tackling the economic crisis.  Just as our extremely restrictive abortion laws disproportionately and adversely impact upon the most vulnerable who cannot afford to leave the State to avail of the service, the political choices made in the last budget targeted the least well-off in our society, such as lone parents and those with large families and young children.In 2005, three women known as A, B and C initiated a challenge to Ireland's restrictive abortion laws at the European Court of Human Rights, arguing that the criminalisation and inaccessibility of abortion in this State endangered their health, well-being and life and was a breach of their rights under the European Convention on Human Rights.  After much deliberation, the grand chamber of the court announced its unanimous finding, in December 2010, that Ireland's failure to implement legislation on abortion constituted a violation of the convention.  These women asserted that Ireland's abortion laws did not reflect the position of the people.  The referenda in 1992 and in 2002 were attempts by the then Governments to restrict abortion in the State.  Both were rejected by the people.  The appellants argued that Ireland's abortion laws are inconsistent with international consensus.  Forty-three out of 47 Council of Europe countries permit abortion to protect a woman's health.  We are in the dark ages on this issue.The existing restrictions are ineffective.  They have not done away with abortion but merely served to export the problem to England.  Moreover, the situation is discriminatory.  Women travelling to Britain for abortion services risk medical complications because of later, and therefore often surgical, abortions.  A woman travelling abroad for an abortion must first sort out a range of issues, including finding the money, organising child care, negotiating time off work, and making travel and accommodation arrangements.  While dealing with all of this, time is moving on and the agony increases.  Such women are more likely to avail of surgical rather than medical abortion to shorten the period of stay abroad.  Medical abortion is a less invasive procedure but involves a treatment period of three or four days, which is not an option for most women travelling abroad from this country.  Likewise, Irish women are less likely to receive pre and post-abortion medical care due to the limited time most can stay abroad.  On top of all of this, the stress involved for women choosing abortion is further exacerbated by the need to leave their own country to avail of an abortion.  Four such incredible women told their stories to the media and to Members of the Oireachtas this week.  These strong women spoke of how much it pained them to have to leave the State and the feelings of fear and stigma arising from the fact that abortion is criminalised here.  They described the secrecy element, the sense of isolation and the lack of support.My colleagues and I have received a large number of e-mails and letters from people caught in this terrible situation.  One of these letters tells a story which many may not have heard.  I will read it out in full:Please take time to read this e-mail and consider why abortion should be legalised in Ireland.  I am not saying it should be fully legalised, but I also do not think it is enough just to legalise it where the mother's life is in danger.  I will explain as I go.  I had always been someone who said I would never have an abortion.  Unfortunately, I did not know what lay ahead for me.  I was with my husband ten years when we decided it was time to have children.  Much to our delight, after ten months, I finally fell pregnant.  I did everything right, took perfect care of myself as I was trying to conceive.  My bump grew and I began to feel my lovely baby kick me and move about.I finally received an appointment for my first scan at 22 weeks, on Christmas week in 2010, and here it all changed.  When I had my scan I was told that my beautiful daughter had a condition called anencephaly, a neural tube defect which means part of her brain and skull had not formed properly while everything else had grown perfectly normally.  The short of it was that our daughter had no hope of surviving and would die without a doubt.  If she survived the pregnancy, she would probably die at birth or within a few hours.  To say we were heartbroken is an understatement.  We were told in Ireland that I had to carry my baby to full term.  I was told I would not be brought in early; in fact, I would be left to go two weeks over.  I would not be given a Caesarean section and would have to go through the labour.  Alternatively, I could travel to the UK to terminate our pregnancy.How would I cope emotionally?  How could I keep going day by day and feel the baby inside me?  How would I deal with the questions from well-meaning people: "When is your baby due?"  How could I watch my perfect baby struggle and die in my arms?  After much deliberation I felt it would be too difficult to continue with the pregnancy knowing our daughter was going to die and opted for a termination in the UK on New Year's Eve 2010, at 24 weeks.  Because of our laws I was not allowed to receive any help from the hospital here.  I was given one recommendation of a well known UK clinic and we went with this.  I was treated so coldly.  They had no understanding that I did not want to terminate this pregnancy.  I wanted this baby so much but she was going to die.  No medical intervention could prevent this.It was the most difficult thing in my life as I left my home, my comfortable surroundings, and travelled to a strange country.  I was under time pressure because of how far along I was because it took so long to get scanned.This clinic had a policy of not allowing me to see the baby - this is something I have lived with and regretted since - I have found it very hard to cope with the fact that I was not allowed to see my daughter when I know so many others ... were.This situation was difficult enough to cope with without having the added problems of travelling to the UK.  I had to leave my own local hospital where I felt safe, where I knew I could be looked after.  I had horrible cold care in the UK.  You hear so many horror stories of terminations, if my labour was induced early in my local hospital, I knew I would have been safe.On the advice of the clinic, I was told I could book flights home for the same day of the termination.  I have since been told this was a very dangerous [thing to do as to travel after a surgical operation is not recommended]. ...  I could have had all my family around me.  I could have had my own comforts.  I could have seen my lovely daughter and buried her close to me.  Now, I will never know what she looked like and I have no place to visit her.I have tears streaming down my face as I write this e-mail because it truly was the most hurtful thing I ever had to do in my life.  I felt I could not tell most people the truth in case I was judged.  I felt wrong and dirty for travelling abroad.  I felt like I was "getting rid" ... of my baby - she was my much longed for and loved daughter.  Even though I never met her, I had her life planned from the day I found out I was pregnant.  I had hopes and dreams for her and for our family life together and to cope with all that being snatched away from me was difficult enough without my own health system turning their back on me.  Thankfully ... I now have a beautiful newborn baby boy whom I cherish.

It is not good enough for the Government to state the expert group will come up with the answers or that it will sort out the legislation in its own time because it knows best and knows what is good for everyone.  It is not good enough that women will suffer over the coming months because this law will not be changed unless the Government side votes for this legislation.  Such suffering should stop now.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	611	I will begin by thanking the Members opposite for raising this important issue.  I acknowledge they do so from the best of motivations and for the right reasons.  This is an area that touches the lives of many Irish people.  It is an area of real concern to Irish women and despite the many considerable complexities involved, it is a matter about which most Irish people have strong views and beliefs.  Members will agree on certain matters in this Chamber but must disagree on others.  I am sure that everyone present in the Chamber shares my view that, as public representatives, Members have a task to perform.  They must take action to deal with a long-overdue responsibility.  While I note Deputy Wallace's comment that no action has been taken by six successive Governments, I assure Members this will not be the seventh.  Members will have time to consider the many technical issues involved but to first put it in human terms, they must ensure they take the necessary action to protect the lives of women.  They must consider the required action, based on clear information of a clinical, legal, scientific and personal nature that tries to understand the medical and human issues involved.  On a technical level, the pressing responsibility is to take action to deal with the ruling of the European Court of Human Rights in respect of the A, B and C v. Ireland case.  The Government already has moved in a direction that can give confidence that the action it takes will be well thought-out on all the necessary levels.Members will be aware that the court ruling places obligations on Ireland and, on 16 June 2011, an action plan was submitted by Ireland to the committee of members of the Council of Europe.  As part of that plan, Ireland is committed to ensuring the judgment in this case is implemented as expeditiously as possible.  The Government has established an expert group that draws on appropriate medical and legal expertise with a view to making recommendations on how this matter should be addressed properly.  It would be wrong of me to pre-empt the report of the aforementioned expert group before its proposals are to hand.  However, I can state I am confident the group will produce proposals that are sensible, practical and implementable.  I remind Members of the quality of the membership of this group, which is chaired by Mr. Justice Sean Ryan, who in the past has authored the Ryan report.  Moreover, the group comprises many doctors, legal people and other experts.  Notwithstanding this, the Government will do what is the right thing to do, as advised by the expert group, to make progress in this regard as quickly as possible.While this Bill as drafted goes some way towards addressing the A, B and C  v. Ireland judgment, the Government is clear that in its current form it cannot be accepted because it is lacking in certain legal respects.  While I am not, of course, a lawyer, the Government has been advised that, in particular, a serious issue exists in respect of the consent provisions in section 6 with regard to Article 40.3.3° of the Constitution.  Issues of presumed consent are among those being examined by the expert group and require the most careful scrutiny to ensure they are compatible with the Constitution.  Moreover, the offences provisions found in section 7 also require greater specificity than is provided in the current draft to ensure legal certainty and their compatibility with Article 40.6.1°.ii of the Constitution.  This is another matter that is being considered by the expert group.  Apart from the fundamental constitutional issues, it is clear that the proposals as drafted require detailed consultation with medical organisations and in particular with the Medical Council.  The Government therefore opposes the Bill before the House.I again thank the Members opposite for having afforded me an opportunity to remind people the Government is moving to deal with the issue.  I give the House an assurance that the expert group is clear on the need to deal expeditiously with the highly complex issues involved and people can be sure that Ireland will live up to its obligations in this regard.  This group will make its report in the coming months and it does not make sense to pre-empt its advice.I wish to meet our obligations, not simply to the European Union but more importantly to our citizens.  The Government will take the correct action, based on the best advice available to it, to ensure no woman's life is ever put in danger.  The Government will do this based on information, both scientific and personal, but above all to inform the process and outcome with compassion and respect for the women who must face and endure the reality of the current position.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	612	I wish to add my voice to that of my colleague, the Minister for Health, in stating the Government wishes to ensure that pregnant women whose lives are at risk can access appropriate medical treatment in Ireland, including lawful termination of pregnancy.  As Members are aware, termination of pregnancy already is lawful in Ireland when it meets the criteria laid out in the X case ruling, that is, if it is established as a matter of probability that there is a real and substantial risk to the life, as distinct from the health, of the mother and that this real and substantial risk can only be averted by the termination of the pregnancy.  Our medical practitioners acknowledge this possibility.  The Irish Medical Council's ethical guidelines clearly state that in current obstetric practice, rare complications can arise where therapeutic interventions, including termination of pregnancy, are required at a stage when due to the extreme immaturity of the baby, there may be little or no hope of the baby surviving.  I am sure everyone present listened carefully to the details contained in the e-mail which Deputy Wallace read into the record.  In the type of exceptional circumstances such as those which I have outlined, it may be necessary to terminate the pregnancy in order to protect the life of the mother while also making every effort to preserve the live of the baby.  The Irish Medical Council's guidelines also make it clear that risk to life includes the risk to the life of a mother arising from a threat of suicide.We are extremely fortunate in Ireland that we have an exceptional record in respect of maternal mortality.  As the Minister indicated, according to the most up-to-date statistics from the World Health Organization, namely, those published in 2008, Ireland was second in the world in the context of its low maternal mortality rate.  This would seem to indicate that pregnant women in this country receive a very high standard of care.  However, in the A, B and C v. Ireland judgment, the European Court of Human Rights found that Ireland had failed to respect the applicant’s private life contrary to Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, as there was no accessible and effective procedure to enable her to establish whether she qualified for a lawful termination of pregnancy in accordance with Irish law.It is on foot of this judgment, and to fulfil a commitment included in the programme for Government, that on 13 January the Government established an expert group to examine the court's judgment.  This group will recommend a series of options on how to implement the judgment, taking into account the constitutional, legal, medical and ethical considerations involved in the formulation of public policy in this area and the overriding need for speedy action.  The judgment did not find that having to travel in order to access a termination of pregnancy where the pregnancy does not put a woman's life at risk is a violation of human rights.  Therefore, the right of access to abortion in Ireland for medical reasons does not fall within the remit of the expert group.  I have been informed that the deliberations of the group are going well and that we can look forward to its report this summer.Like the Minister, I fully accept that this Bill was brought forward in good faith and for very good reasons.  I sympathise and agree with many of the sentiments expressed on the other side of the House.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	613	I begin by thanking Deputy Clare Daly for bringing this issue before the House.  I fully understand and share her impatience and frustration regarding the fact that action has not been forthcoming on this matter before now.  As the Minister outlined, the Bill will not be supported by those on this side of the House.  However, there are very few people on either side of the Chamber who would deny that there is not a long-outstanding and long-ignored necessity for a regulatory framework to give effect to the constitutional right to termination services when there is a risk to the life of the mother.This is an extremely emotive issue and there are strongly held views on both sides.  Like most people in the House, I respect that fact.  As far as our responsibility goes, however, this is not a matter of morality, religious opinion, personal belief or party policy.  Quite simply, we, as legislators, have an obligation to give legislative or regulatory effect to the will of the people as expressed not in a telephone or opinion poll but rather in successive referenda.  The Constitution gives the right to termination services in certain, albeit very limited, circumstances.  As Deputy Wallace stated, the failure of the Oireachtas and six successive Governments to put in place the necessary framework during the past 20 years has frustrated that right.  It is irrelevant whether said right is widely or rarely demanded.  Regardless of whether one woman or 100 women claim the right to which I refer, it does not matter.  Once the people have spoken, it is our responsibility to provide the necessary framework.As far as we know, each day 12 women leave this country to obtain abortions abroad.  We have no idea how many more women - it is probably a very large number - obtain medication online and self-medicate in order to terminate.  In either circumstance, it is a difficult, lonely decision to take, particularly in the absence of medical, psychological or familial support and without access to medical follow-up.  Whatever the overall number, probably only a tiny fraction of the cases to which I refer would meet the constitutional requirement for termination services in Ireland.  As everyone is aware, such services can only be accessed here in circumstances where a woman's life is actually at risk.  It is beyond my comprehension why there is still an insistence that sick and possibly terminally ill women must undertake arduous, costly and stressful journeys to obtain abroad a service to which they have a constitutional entitlement in this country and in safe and supportive conditions.The failure to provide clarity has not stopped terminations taking place.  It has merely made them less safe and more expensive and stressful.  As previous speakers indicated, the European Court of Human Rights found against the Irish State for its failure to give expression to the constitutional entitlement.  The Council of Ministers has this matter under enhanced supervision until we comply, and the United Nations Council on Human Rights has condemned us.  On several occasions, the Judiciary in this country has called for legislative guidelines of some sort to inform and protect the medical profession as well as the women involved.  Regardless of what others say about us, what matters is what the Irish people say.  They have said, not once but twice, that the law of the land should allow termination services here.  This means that the State must facilitate the entitlement of women in this regard.After 20 years of inaction, we now have a Government that is willing to deal with the A, B and C case.  I welcome what the Minister has said.  As stated earlier, the Constitution makes provision for termination services only in specific circumstances.  The wording of any regulation or legislation to give effect to this must be equally specific, precise and exact.  Every word of any Bill or regulation will be examined, re-examined, picked over and dissected.  We had better ensure that what we introduce complies in every respect with the wishes of the people as expressed in the Constitution.  For that reason, I agree that we must await the opinion of the expert group.  That group has the necessary expertise and has available to it the relevant specialist opinion.  It would be a mistake to think that a simple item of legislation or an equally simple regulation is going to suffice in respect of this matter.  The relevant Bill or regulation will have to define the circumstances in which there is a threat to a woman's life and the point at which that threat actually becomes a reality.It would be foolhardy to believe that meeting the requirements of the European Court of Human Rights and ensuring compliance with the narrow and specific wording contained in the Constitution will be simple or straightforward or that what will be produced will escape the scrutiny of the lawyers.  The latter will not be the case.  Nevertheless, this debate is a valuable first step towards establishing the parameters of the task ahead.  We must await the recommendations of the expert group, particularly as we have asked it to consider this matter.  It would be wrong to deny ourselves the benefit of the expertise of and the specialist opinion available to that group.

The Bill relates to a matter which none of us likes to discuss.  However, discuss it obviously we must.  In the 20 years since the Supreme Court decision in the X case, dramatic changes have taken place in Irish society.  However, the debate on abortion remains fraught.  Following a public outpouring of sympathy and outrage in respect of the original injunction in the X case, the Supreme Court subsequently ruled that abortion is legal where there is a real and substantial threat - including suicide - to the life of a pregnant woman or girl.  Ireland is now a very different place from what it was in 1992.  The Irish public continues to support the right to life of the unborn when it is reassured that women continue to receive the medical treatment they require during pregnancy.Deputy Clare Daly's Bill seeks to provide for the termination of pregnancy where a real and substantial risk to the life of the pregnant woman exists and for the prevention of any curtailment, hindrance or preclusion of such treatment that may arise as a result of the pregnancy of that woman.  If passed, the Bill would allow a medical practitioner to provide any form of medical treatment to a woman, despite its consequences for the life of the foetus, once two medical practitioners agree that there is a threat to the life of the woman or a psychiatrist or a psychologist and a medical practitioner agree there is a risk of her committing suicide.The Government is acutely aware of the sensitive nature of this complex issue and is currently taking steps to deal with it.  It was on foot of a commitment in the programme for Government that the expert group was established in order that it might consider the judgment handed down by the European Court of Human Rights.  This group, which is chaired by Mr. Justice Sean Ryan, has been requested to report to the Government within six months of its establishment.  The Government believes that this is the appropriate forum in which to examine this complex and very sensitive matter.  It is on foot of the fact that the work of the expert group is ongoing that I will be opposing the Bill before the House.  The expert group is due to report back to the Government by means of a written document and within six months of establishment.  As the group was established in mid-January, the report will be due in mid-July.  The group meets regularly and may consult interested parties and additional relevant experts and professionals.Meanwhile, Ireland remains the safest place in the world for women to give birth, with UN figures showing Ireland as a world leader in protecting pregnant women.  The latest UN study on maternal mortality, published in 2010, shows that from 172 countries for which estimates were given, Ireland remains a world leader in safety for pregnant women.  Time and again, international statistics show that Ireland has the lowest number of maternal deaths in the world.  On the other hand, increasing evidence suggests there are serious mental health risks associated with abortion.  A Finnish study in the European Journal of Public Health recently showed that women who had abortions were six times more likely to commit suicide compared with women who had their babies.Abortion is often presented as being pro-woman but what abortion advocates refuse to confront is the devastating impact abortion has on many women.  In 1997 we were convulsed by the C case involving the young girl made pregnant through rape.  The courts again decided that the compassionate solution was to send the girl to the UK for an abortion, but 12 years later the woman at the centre of the case spoke of her devastation and deep regret at having the abortion.  Current Irish medical practice is pro-woman and pro-child and we should keep it that way.  All rights come with responsibilities and these should be explored as we openly and honestly approach abortion from the legal, medical and human rights perspectives of all parties involved.  That includes all of us and especially the mother, father and the child.
#AnneFerris	unknown-#AnneFerris-party	unknown-#AnneFerris-dob	unknown-#AnneFerris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	615	Today, 12 women will have travelled across the water to access abortion services, and tomorrow, another 12 women will make that journey.  This will continue for the foreseeable future, as day in and day out, women are forced to leave their homes to access a service that should be provided to them when they are in need.  The story of abortion in Ireland is long and has, as of yet, no satisfactory ending.  In the past 30 years alone we have had three referenda, committee reports and recommendations and a multitude of legal cases.  I know the Bill before this House today seeks to provide some legislative certainty to the vacuum that has not been filled from these reports, and in that regard I am somewhat supportive of it.  However, I do not feel that this legislation goes far enough.  It is limited in its scope and does not address all of the issues that I think the expert group is obliged to address.The expert group, comprising members with appropriate medical and legal expertise, is due to report in a couple of months, and I hope and assume it will address the wider issues not included in this Bill.  For example, in legislating for the X case, which is what the Bill before us will do, the risk to the life of the mother will be covered but not the risk to health.  The ethical dilemmas in this for doctors are many.  A doctor will intervene when a serious health risk presents and will not wait for a patient's health to deteriorate.  It is also quite clear that a risk to one's health can just as quickly become a risk to life and pregnancy may exacerbate risks to women with pre-existing conditions.It is also important to note that the law of no other country allows for abortion only to save the life but not to preserve the health of the pregnant woman.  Many other points are not addressed by this legislation, including the lack of availability of abortion in cases where there are fatal foetal abnormalities, rape and incest.  Another very significant issue not dealt with by this Bill is the reality of the financial, psychological, and physical burdens that so many women experience when travelling abroad, and this reality must be addressed because there is a face and a story behind each decision made.  Not one of them is taken lightly, and stories of abortion in recent newspaper publications and which we heard today have highlighted some of them.  The face and the heart of a person who goes through with an abortion is given the humanity that can, I feel, be lost when one refers to simple letters of an alphabet like X, C, D and A, B and C.  Therefore, I firmly believe that the expert group should address more than what is contained in this Bill and I firmly believe it has a responsibility to do that.I am a Roman Catholic but I do not need prayers said for my immortal soul because I think women should have access to abortion.  One of the women who spoke so bravely to The Irish Times stated that she believed in a loving God and will not be damned for what she did.  I fully support her, and like her, I will not be damned for standing by my beliefs.  I also believe in the Labour Party and am a proud member of it.  The two are not inconsistent, although some in the media would have people believe they are.  On this issue, as with so many others, this is not about being liberal or conservative but rather doing the right thing when the wrong course would be easier.  As a people, we are all too familiar with what happens when that particular course is taken.I will oppose the Bill, but in doing so, I hope that when the expert group reports, it will make comprehensive recommendations that will be broader in scope than that contained here.  I am grateful that a conversation on this topic has been possible in the Dáil and I thank Deputy Clare Daly for making it so.  I am aware that many in power  would prefer for this to go away so that the stories of abortion can continue without end.  I also note that a Dáil, the vast majority of which is made up of men, is deciding and has decided in the past on the rights of women.  I trust the irony of this is not lost on the House.We must end the practice where 12 women a day have no other option but to travel abroad and I firmly believe that the expert group must deal with the A, B and C judgment in its widest sense and, in doing so, speak truth to power.  I am certain it will have the political support to implement the recommendations if it does so.
#CiaraConway	unknown-#CiaraConway-party	unknown-#CiaraConway-dob	unknown-#CiaraConway-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	616	We personally know the women involved in these issues.  They are our sisters, friends, cousins, neighbours and, in some cases, our mothers.  For a variety of reasons these women cannot continue with their pregnancies and the isolation these women experience heading over the water for an abortion, as described so bravely by a group of women today, exacerbates the difficulty, stigma and silence which forces them to manage their own mental health in isolation and without significant or humane compassion.The Government has published the terms of reference of and named the expert group tasked with addressing the outcome of the A, B and C v. Ireland ruling at the European Court of Human Rights.  The ruling, which dates to December 2010, reaffirms the Supreme Court X case judgment of 1992, and the expert group must now propose concrete measures to implement the ruling of the court and to comply with the wishes of the peopleas expressed in 1992 and 2002.  It is clear that the State cannot ignore any longer the imperative to legislate so that women and girls needing life-saving abortions are guaranteed access to appropriate services in an effective, timely and humane manner.  This requires both legislation to provide for lawful medical treatment and medical guidelines so that doctors can make a practical assessment of what constitutes a real and substantial risk to the life of a pregnant woman.Doctors require workable guidelines on conditions likely to be worsened by the continuation of pregnancy.  Decisions in these cases are not always straightforward, as it is not possible to predict every possible medical condition, but they are always urgent.  In cases where every day counts, doctors must have sufficient room for discretion to allow them to treat their patients.  In many such cases, women are forced to travel overseas without even getting a referral from a doctor outlining their medical history, which is unacceptable.  A doctor would not expect any patient to access any other medical treatment in this way, in particular in the case of a patient with a life-threatening illness.  If it is to give full legal effect to the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights, the expert group must also propose draft legislation and guidelines which ensure the right of patients to access life-saving medical care can never be held hostage to refusal of care by individual doctors, institutions such as hospitals and medical clinics or third parties such as hospital personnel not directly involved in providing the treatment.  We have seen this over the past 20 years.  The expert group also needs to address the lack of a clear framework to examine and resolve differences of opinion between a woman and her doctor or between doctors.  In any such case, the paramount consideration must be that the woman's health is not further endangered by a delay.The rights of pregnant women to privacy, freedom and dignity must be respected and represented in any dispute resolution process.  Doctors must also be free from the fear of criminal prosecution.One of the most chilling issues highlighted by the European Court of Human Rights was that the criminal penalties attached to abortion included life imprisonment.  However, clinical guidelines will be unworkable as long as this law remains on the Statute Book.  Ireland is not the only country in which abortion is a sensitive political issue but one of the few countries which have failed to make legal provision for abortion.Unfortunately, I cannot support the legislation because, like Deputy Anne Ferris, it does not go far enough.  I ask that the expert group take submissions from interested parties on the issue.  Members heard earlier from a group of women who were denied the health care they badly needed when it was determined they were pregnant with babies who could not live outside the womb.  Women such as these must be listened to and engaged with.  I will keep a close eye on the expert group and look forward to its report in July.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	617	I will share time with Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív.I welcome the opportunity to speak to the Bill which addresses the complex and sensitive issue of abortion.  Despite having discussed the issue on a continuous basis, we have not yet arrived at decisions in the context of a legislative framework.  I welcome the establishment of the expert group, an issue addressed previously in the context of our obligations arising from the rulings of the European Court of Human Rights in the A, B and C cases.  The court, in its rulings, noted the burden the implementation of Article 40.3.3o would impose on the State and accepted that this would be a sensitive and complex task.It is important in this debate to acknowledge the complexities of abortion and the diverse views on the issue in society and the Chamber.  The views of those who hold a liberal view on abortion also differ, for example, on the issues of the right to the life of the mother and the child and fatal foetal abnormalities, an issue discussed earlier with a number of women in the audiovisual room.  The women in question outlined the major challenges and difficulties they had experienced as a result of carrying babies who were not capable of living outside the womb.  Several of those who spoke stated they did not want abortion on demand.  It is important when we listen to lobby groups or take part in emotive, heart-rending discussions that we do not take the issue out of context or use it as leverage for a broader agenda.The Bill has clearly been introduced on foot of the findings of the European Court of Human Rights.  As the Minister noted, the legislation has deficiencies, may be at variance with Article 40.3.3o of the Constitution and could give rise to other legal difficulties.  In 1983 the people decided by referendum to insert into the Constitution Article 40.3.3o which declares: "The State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect and, as far as practicable, by its laws to vindicate that right".  As the House is aware, no laws were ever enacted on foot of this amendment and the provision in the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 remain the basic law in relation to abortion.  This has left open the possibility that Article 40.3.3o will have to be interpreted by the courts.  Apart from the 1861 Act, there is no legislation which makes clear what is permissible under the law should there be a potential conflict between the right to life of the mother and that of the unborn.In the X case of 1992 a majority of the Supreme Court members held that if it were established as a matter of probability that there was a real risk to the life, as distinct from the health, of the mother and that this real and substantiated risk could only be averted by the termination of the pregnancy, such a termination was lawful.  The stated risk to the mother's life in this case arose because she had threatened to commit suicide if she had to continue with the pregnancy.  The experience of the 1992 referendum shows the difficulty in providing in a relatively short constitutional provision for a clear prohibition on abortion, while ensuring there is no obstacle to pregnant women receiving all the care and treatment they need.The stand-alone Bill introduced by the Technical Group does not give a balanced or effective legal response to the complex and legal issues which surround the protection of human life in pregnancy.  We need to be sensible about this issue and avoid trying to score political points.  This debate should be above party politics.  We must await the report from the expert group before action is taken and, if possible, all-party support should be secured before legislation or referendums are proposed.Some of the language used in the abortion debate is hurtful and inflammatory.  Those who have had terminations are our mothers, daughters, sisters, nieces and neighbours and the language that is sometimes used can have a devastating impact on individuals.  It behoves all of us, regardless of our view, to use moderate language in a fair and rational manner to convince others of the merits of our argument.  Emotive language can have a destructive impact on those who have had a termination.The issue of abortion has divided society.  As Abraham Lincoln once said, a house divided will not stand.  As a society, we have torn ourselves apart on the abortion issue on a number of occasions and we still have not enacted legislation on foot of three referendums on the issue.  Tonight we are debating a Bill introduced by the Technical Group.The expert group chaired by Mr. Justice Ryan includes a number of eminent individuals from the areas of obstetrics, psychiatry, general practice, law, policy, professional standards and midwifery.  We should await the findings and recommendations of its report which will be published in July.  At that point, we can have a fair and rational debate on all the issues involved and, I hope, arrive at a solution that will address the abortion issue which, as I noted, has been divisive, emotive and destructive at times during the years.In the C case of 1997 the High Court accepted that where evidence had been given to the effect that the pregnant young woman involved might commit suicide unless allowed to terminate her pregnancy, there was a real and substantial risk to her life and such a termination was, therefore, a permissible medical treatment of her condition where this was the only way to avoid such a risk.  At the time the Government decided to produce a Green Paper on abortion and this was published in September 1999.  It was then considered by an all-party Oireachtas committee chaired by the late Brian Lenihan.  More than 100,000 submissions were received by the committee which held hearings with various interested groups and published a report in November 2000.  The evidence given to the committee by psychiatrists highlighted the great difficulty in assessing whether a threat of suicide would be carried out.  This issue requires further discussion and clarity in the context of the Bill before the House.Another referendum was held in 2001, during which we had debates about implantation, the morning after pill and the possibility of ruling out suicide as a reason to intervene, while allowing abortion in cases in which doctors would be required to intervene to save the life of the mother.  We know the result of that referendum.It has been noted that up to 12 women travel abroad daily for a termination.  The all-party Oireachtas committee recommended the introduction of as many supports as possible for women involved in a crisis pregnancy.  We have an obligation to ensure this recommendation is implemented, specifically in dealing with matters such as funding, contraception, education programmes in schools and universities and highlighting the various issues involved with a view to limiting the number of crisis pregnancies.  While the committee's assessment in this matter was rather simple, it is an important recommendation which needs to be addressed.  We should concentrate significant resources on the provision of sex education, advice on contraception and supports for women and girls who find themselves in a crisis pregnancy.My party believes we should await the findings of the report of the expert group chaired by Mr. Justice Ryan which will be published in July.  On foot of its findings, we can have a debate on the issues involved and come to a conclusion in order that we can move on and allow people to live in dignity and without fear.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	618	We will probably not discuss a more emotive issue in the House during the lifetime of the Government.  This is a very difficult issue because it goes to the core of what people believe on two levels.  First, most people generally believe human life should be preserved.  Second, when does the human life we seek to protect start?  This goes to the core of humanistic beliefs.  We all believe in people's right to protection and we have had many debates about protecting children.  We always want to protect their lives and protect them from harm.  There is a fundamental, philosophical difficulty: when does life begin?  When does the protection of human life begin and in what circumstances is it protected?  It is important in this debate that we recognise that people have strongly held views on this issue and that whatever side of the debate they are on, we respect the genuineness of the views of others.What my colleague has said is true.  To a certain extent, this Bill is pre-emptory.  The Government has set up an expert group to look at the issue.  I hope the group will look at it from every angle and review all the medical evidence available in order that we will have well balanced proposals.  I regret the subsuming of the Crisis Pregnancy Agency back into the Department because such an agency can do very good work in counselling and providing supporting as a stand-alone agency.  I am not as convinced that there is a financial saving in subsuming it into the Department.  There has been too much exaggeration of the financial savings to be made in subsuming such bodies.  The agency was able to work outside the Department.  There is a need for a halfway house where an agency can be given independence without the need for a huge infrastructure to back it up.  That is very important.I believe very strongly in the concept of protecting human life.  That is fundamental.  I also believe the child in the womb is a person and that, therefore, there is an obligation to protect that human life.  On the other hand, I also believe it is absolutely vital to be non-judgmental about the decisions people might take and utterly supportive of them.  However, when it comes to the law, the awkward issue is whether we protect the human life in the womb.  Because I believe in protecting in human life, there are two human lives to be protected and what we have to try to do at all times is protect both.  I accept that there are others who take a radically different view and do not see the life in the womb as being worthy of the same protection.  I respect their views, even though I disagree fundamentally and philosophically with that view from a humanistic point of view because I believe in the protection of human life, my definition of which extends to before birth.The Bill focuses on the X case and I hope the expert group will looks at all of the issues arising from it.  For example, one of the issues that never arose in the Supreme Court which took the facts as given was that there was no psychiatric evidence provided as to whether this was the best or only treatment available to prevent the threat of suicide in the case.  I hope the best medical experts will look at this issue once again in the light of the information now available.  It is also important to look at the mental health effects of abortion.  I understand there have been cases in which there has been a link between post-abortion stress and a person's mental health.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	619	I have to ask the Deputy to conclude.  I call Deputy Gerry Adams.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	620	I thank an Teachta Clare Daly for bringing forward this Private Members' Bill which deals with an extremely difficult issue for all concerned, particularly women faced with the situation the Bill is trying to deal with.  There are strongly and sincerely held views on all sides of the Dáil, including within Sinn Féin, and across society on this issue.  For my part, I am not in favour of abortion.  That is my strongly held view.  I am also strongly opposed to any attempt to criminalise or be judgmental of women who have had abortions.  No woman wants to be in that position, but it is a reality faced by Irish women.Irish women are citizens and, like all other Teachtaí Dála, I am here to serve citizens.  As I am a legislator, I have to set aside my personal views and face up to my responsibilities.  I have to deal with the dreadful reality, highlighted by pregnant women confronted with life-threatening conditions, who have had to cope with this awful dilemma.  I have to deal with what is an untenable situation for the medical profession which has been tasked with making medical judgments without legal protection for medical practitioners.  We have to ask ourselves, as elected representatives and legislators, if we really want to leave Irish women and members of the medical profession in the awful predicament caused by the absence of legislation.  Can any of us even begin to understand or imagine how unfair and unjust this is for a woman or young girl?The background to this debate is provided by the X case which provides some painful insights.  It is also an indictment of the way the State treats women and children.  Sinn Féin is not in favour of abortion.  We believe all possible means of education and support services should be in place.  However, in cases of rape, incest and sexual abuse, or in which a woman's life and mental health are at risk or in grave danger, Sinn Féin accepts that the final decision should rest with the woman concerned.  It has analysed the Bill and a number of serious concerns have been raised about aspects of it.  These include the issue of consent which needs to be discussed in some detail.  I note the Minister's remarks on it.  I have just returned to the Chamber having attended the funeral of Deputy Doherty's father in Donegal.  Therefore, I have not had the chance to study the Minister's remarks in detail.  I note, however, that he has raised issues in respect of this matter, as has our group.The Government has stated its intention to bring forward its own legislation, but successive Governments have failed to deal with this issue for 20 years.  In 2010 the European Court of Human Rights ruled that that the State had violated the rights of pregnant women by refusing to allow them to undergo a lawful abortion where that pregnancy could threaten their lives.  Its decision has made it clear that there is an onus on the State to legislate within the terms of the 1937 Constitution for the decision in the X case.  What is certain is that the time has come for legislation to protect in law the rights of women as decided by the Supreme Court in 1992.  This should be done in a reasoned, tolerant and considered matter, with the maximum cross-party consensus.In this spirit Sinn Féin believes the Bill should be allowed to proceed to Committee Stage where, as I said, it would need to be amended to deal with the concerns raised in our party.  I take on board what the Minister said and will consider it overnight.It is important we approach this issue in its broadest social context.  The Government needs to examine whether its policies are pushing increasing numbers of women into positions of vulnerability.  Poor health services and inadequate preventative health programmes will increase the likelihood that women will not know of critical health problems, including cancer, in advance of pregnancy.Tackling violence against women and upholding the right of every woman and young girl to be free from violence and safe in their communities and in their own homes must be a priority.  The Government has yet to sign the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence.We need to ensure the State cares properly for vulnerable young people, including those in care, but it has failed miserly in this regard.  On all of these issues this Dáil needs to stand up for and do what is right for Irish women.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	622	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."As Minister for Social Protection, I am acutely aware of the needs of the people who depend on social welfare and the harsh economic circumstances many individuals and families face.  The Department of Social Protection currently accounts for approximately 40% of all current Government expenditure.  This means that €4 in every €10 that the Government spends is spent on social protection.The Government will spend €20.5 billion on social welfare this year.  The adjustment in social protection spending this year will be limited to €475 million, or just over 2% of the Department's spend.  Next year we have to save a further €540 million.  Balancing the needs of those dependent on social welfare against the money available is extremely difficult but I assure the House that the Government is doing its utmost to protect the most vulnerable in society.Just 70 years ago Europe and Britain were at war.  Despite that it was possible for progressive leaders to think ahead and lay the foundations for a better society.  In 1942 William Beveridge, an English man, set out a programme to eliminate the five giant evils - squalor, ignorance, want, idleness and disease - through the establishment of the welfare state.  It remains today one of the greatest legacies of social democracy.The twin evils that have to be tackled today if we are to create sustainable economic recovery are unemployment and debt.  We all see every day the distress, dashed hopes and hardship they cause.  That is why we are dealing with unsustainable mortgage debt though legal reforms and a new advisory service that will strengthen the hand of householders in dealing with the banks.  However, there is no economic recovery without jobs.The Social Welfare Bill will give legislative effect to certain social welfare measures announced in the Budget Statement of December 2011, which are due to come into effect this year, as well as a number of general or miscellaneous amendments to the social welfare code.  I am also introducing a number of amendments to occupational pension provision in this Bill.Despite improvements made to the one-parent family payment over the years and significant spending on supports to lone parents, a large proportion of lone parents and their children still experience poverty and experience much higher at-risk-of-poverty and consistent poverty rates than other working age adults.In general, the best route out of poverty is through employment.  We recognise that work, especially full-time work, may not be an option for parents of very young children.  However, we believe that supporting parents in participating in the labour market once their children have reached an appropriate age will improve their own economic situations and their social well-being, as well as that of their families.Changes in the one-parent family payment were introduced in 2010 to make payment until the youngest child reached the age of 14.  This Bill contains further changes so that for new recipients, from May 2012, one-parent family payment will be made until the youngest child reaches the age of 12, the age of ten from January 2013, and the age of seven from 2014.  For existing recipients there will be a tapered phasing-out period to enable them to access education and training and to prepare parents for their return to the labour market.Many of those who have been concerned about the measures regarding the one-parent family payment being introduced in this Bill have said that seven is too young and obviously they are concerned about leaving a child alone without adequate child care.  They have said it is too young for a parent to make the first steps back to the workplace and too young for the same parent to return to education or training.  I entirely agree that seven is too young for anyone to seriously contemplate any of these things without there being a system of safe, affordable and accessible child care in place, similar to what is found in the Scandinavian countries to whose systems of social protection we aspire. That is why I am undertaking tonight that I will only proceed with the measures to reduce the upper age limit to seven years in the event that I get a credible and bankable commitment on the delivery of such a system of child care by the time of this year's budget.  If this is not forthcoming, the measure will not proceed.  I will engage with my colleagues, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and the Minister for Education and Skills, to establish a co-ordinated, cross-departmental approach to ensure the required level of services are in place to support lone parents as their youngest child reaches the relevant age thresholds.I am also conscious that all parents have a responsibility to provide maintenance to their dependent spouses and children.  I recognise that many lone parents want to work and to obtain valuable work experience.  Therefore, I will shortly bring proposals to Cabinet to open up JobBridge, the national internship scheme, to lone parents because so many of them have expressed an interest to me in the opportunities available through the scheme.I am introducing a number of amendments to the occupational pension provision in this Bill.  These amendments provide a requirement for defined benefits pension schemes to hold a risk reserve in addition to the funding standard requirements set out in the Pensions Act.The sustainability of pensions into the longer term is a critical issue and the OECD is currently looking at the direction of all pensions policy.  The purpose of these amendments is to underpin further the legislative provision applying to defined benefits schemes generally and which to help provide a secure pension for the members of the defined benefits scheme into the future and ensure the sustainability of defined benefits pensions.  Defined benefit pension schemes are a very important element of pension provision in Ireland.  Following the downturn in the financial markets, the funding standard was suspended in late 2008 to allow the trustees of pension schemes assess the impact of historically high volatility in the financial markets and the significant losses experienced.  The amendments I am introducing facilitate the re-introduction of the funding standard.The proposal in this Bill to introduce a risk reserve will provide a buffer to assist schemes absorb financial shocks in the future and in this regard will enhance the protection of the pension entitlements of scheme members against future volatility in the markets.  It is recognised that many defined benefit pension schemes are in deficit and will need time to recover their funding position.  It is therefore intended to introduce the risk reserve requirement over an extended time period.  The funding standard will be introduced initially and, from 1 January 2016, pension schemes will be required to hold a risk reserve.  Schemes will, however, be given up to 11 years from the re-introduction of the funding standard to satisfy the risk reserve requirement.It is estimated the risk reserve will increase the liabilities of a defined benefit scheme but this will depend on the investment profile of each scheme.  Changes to the funding standard guidelines will give credit to schemes that reduce their equity risk and will assist schemes to satisfy their funding requirements.  Scheme trustees have options in this regard.  Legislation has been introduced to provide for sovereign annuities.  The Pensions Board published guidelines to assist potential providers with the development of sovereign annuity products.  As part of this initiative, the NTMA will issue, subject to market yields, sovereign bonds of a long duration that will allow pension schemes to better match their assets to their liabilities.  In addition, the Pensions Board is giving consideration to the provision of an enforceable employer guarantee to meet the risk reserve requirements.I will be tabling a number of amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage on voluntary contributions for changes in the rules governing access to the facility to pay voluntary PRSI contributions and for transitional arrangements for the gradual reduction in the age limit of the youngest child for the payment of one parent family benefit.  On mortgage interest supplement, I will put in place restrictions on the payment of the supplement to provide that it will not be payable for a person in the first 12 months of the mortgage arrears resolution process as set out in the code of conduct on mortgage arrears applying to mortgage lenders.  The intention is that the financial institution would provide at least 12 months forbearance to borrowers in respect of their mortgage obligations and only after this 12 month period would mortgage interest supplement be available.For data exchange there will be an amendment of section 265(1) on sharing information for student grant purposes to include reference to the Student Support Act 2011.  There will also be provision to ensure that PRSI continues to be payable on income relieved under the special assignee relief programme scheme for income tax purposes and provision to provide clarity on share-based remuneration arrangements on which employer PRSI is not chargeable.  There will also be changes in the financing arrangements for the social insurance fund arising from Government accounting requirements.Provision will also be made to extend the household budgeting facility to include additional energy providers that are regulated by the energy regulator and to extend the list of specified bodies to include housing bodies that stand approved of by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to facilitate rent deductions under the HHB scheme for customers of these housing associations.Under this legislation, it will be a requirement that tenants, who have signed up to the household budget service to have their local authorities differential rent deducted, cannot withdraw from that arrangement without the permission of the local authority.I am changing the basis of calculating entitlement to jobseeker's benefit from a six-day week to a five-day week.Welfare fraud is a serious crime and the Department of Social Protection is doing everything it can to crack down on people who abuse the system.  It is a small number of people but any amount lost to fraud is significant.  When high risk areas are identified targeted control measures are put in place to reduce the risk of fraud and abuse of the system.  The Department has begun the phased introduction of the public services card with key security features, including a photograph and signature, which will be used to authenticate the identity of individuals.  One of the advantages of the public services card is that it will help to reduce fraud and error which result from the incorrect identification of claimants.  Under the existing legislative provisions there is no mandatory requirement for a person to allow for his or her photograph and signature to be captured and reproduced in electronic format for purposes of a PPSN allocation, public services card and claims for social welfare benefits.  I will be proposing a change to provide for the introduction of a new condition for any new claim for social welfare payment that the claimant must satisfy the Department as to his or her identity including allowing for electronic capture of photograph and signature.I am also strengthening the powers of social welfare inspectors to make inquiries in various circumstances at ports and airports and I am strengthening the powers of social welfare inspectors to make inquiries with landlords in connection with rent supplement claims.There are also changes to the revaluation of scheme benefits under the Pensions Act changes to the issue of guidance and further clarifications to section 50 of the Pension Act on the timeframe required to satisfy pension scheme funding requirements.  The proposal to provide a mechanism that requires a pension scheme to wind-up in certain limited circumstances will be brought forward in the next Social Welfare Bill.On amendments to section 250A of the principal Act to provide that information which an authorised officer receives from a financial institution shall be provided to a social welfare investigator for the purpose of an investigation, I have been advised by Office of the Attorney General that this provision is not necessary and is therefore not included in this Bill.I will outline the main provisions of the Bill.  Section 1 provides for the Short Title, collective citations, construction and any necessary commencements and section 2 provides for definitions used throughout this Part of the Bill.Section 3 provides for an increase in the minimum number of paid PRSI contributions required to be eligible to become a voluntary contributor from 260 to 520.Sections 4 and 5 make a number of amendments to the one-parent family payment to introduce restrictions on entitlement for families where the youngest child reaches seven years.  The age limit of the youngest child is gradually being reduced from age 14 in 2011, to age 12 in 2012, to age 10 in 2013 and to age seven in 2014.Section 6 amends and extends the list of bodies that are specified in the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 as being authorised to use the personal public service number for the purposes of carrying out transactions with members of the public, for sharing personal data and information amongst themselves for the purposes of carrying out relevant transactions, and for exchanging data.  The Office of the Pensions Ombudsman is now included and VECs are now specified the purposes of sections 262 to 270 of the Act; they are currently specified for the purposes of section 266 only.Section 7 provides for an extension to the list of payments that have been excluded from the disqualification of concurrent payment where a person is also on a community employment, CE, scheme.  It is now extended to include all weekly and monthly supplements payable under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, that is, if people on community employment can qualify for mortgage interest supplement and the diet supplement, they can receive them.Part 3 and sections 8 to 26 provide for amendments to the Pensions Act 1990.  Sections 8 and 9 provide for the definition of Principal Act for the purposes of Part 3 and for the definition of common terms used in this Act.  Section 10 amends section 7A of the Act to provide that any guidance issued by the Pensions Board or any other person specified by regulation under this Act cannot be changed without the prior consent of the Minister.  Section 11 amends section 34 to clarify that the Pensions Board can issue guidance in relation to the calculation of the transfer value of pension rights.Sections 12 to 24 deal with the introduction of risk reserves into the funding standard for the regulation of defined benefit pension schemes.  The proposed amendment to the funding standard will require defined benefit pension schemes to hold an additional funding reserve in addition to the level of funding required at present.  This amendment will parallel the existing structure and requirements to satisfy the funding standard.  In addition to the actuarial funding certificate submitted at present, the trustees of a pension scheme will now be required to submit an actuarial funding reserve certificate and if either certificate indicates that the scheme does not satisfy the funding requirement, the scheme must, except in certain circumstances, submit a funding proposal to the Pensions Board to restore funding by the next certificate date.  Section 12inserts definitions for the purpose of this Part IV of the Act.Section 13 amends section 41 of the Act to disapply the risk reserve requirement to regulatory own funds schemes as those reserve requirements are dealt with in Part IVB of the Act.  Section 14 amends section 42 of the Act to require relevant schemes to submit an actuarial funding reserve certificate to indicate whether the scheme satisfies the risk reserve requirement.  Section 15 amends section 43 of the Act to specify the date on which the assets and liabilities of the scheme for the purpose of preparing an actuarial funding reserve certificate are assessed and the time frame for submission of the actuarial funding reserve certificate to the Pensions Board.Section 16 amends section 44 of the Act to set the level of reserve required to be maintained by relevant schemes.  The risk reserve will reflect the level of risk undertaken in a scheme's investment strategy.  It will be the aggregate of two amounts.  The first is 15% of the amount of the funding standard liabilities less the value of EU bonds and cash and any other prescribed assets held.  The other is the amount by which the funding standard liabilities would increase on the effective date of the certificate if there was a 0.5% fall in interest rates.  As the Minister for Social Protection, I will have the power to prescribe a higher or lower percentage.  Section 17 amends section 45 to change the reference from section 44 to section 44(1).  This is consequential to the insertion of section 44(2) by section 16.Section 18 amends section 46 of the Act to specify the matters to which an actuary must have regard when completing an actuarial funding reserve certificate, just as the actuary is already required to do when completing an actuarial funding certificate under that section.  Section 19 amends section 47 of the Act to ensure that there is no doubt as to the power of the Minister to prescribe different requirements for different calculations for the purposes of Part IV of the Act.  Section 20 amends section 48 to clarify the scheme liabilities which must be discharged before any resources can be returned to an employer on the wind-up of a scheme and to clarify the benefits to which the purchase of an annuity can apply.Section 21 extends section 49 of the Act to require the trustees of a defined benefit pension scheme to submit an actuarial funding reserve certificate in addition to the submission of an actuarial funding certificate.  If either certificate indicates that the scheme does not satisfy the funding requirements, the scheme must, except in certain circumstances, submit a funding proposal to the Pensions Board to restore funding by the next funding certificate date.  Section 21 of the Bill amends section 49 of the Pensions Act to provide the Pensions Board with discretion to extend this period in circumstances which will be set out in statutory guidance and approved by the Minister for Social Protection.Section 22 strengthens the provision in section 50 of the Pensions Act where the trustees of a defined benefit scheme fail to comply with the funding standard.  Trustees will now be required to report to the Pensions Board within a prescribed timeframe on the measures taken to restructure scheme benefits on foot of a notice issued by the Pensions Board under section 50 of the Pensions Act.  A new subsection (4) is being inserted in section 50 of the Act to empower the Minister for Social Protection to prescribe the guidance issued by the Pensions Board, setting out the form and detailed requirements of an application by scheme trustees to reduce scheme benefits.Section 23 extends section 51A of the Act to include the completion of funding standard reserve certificates in the responsibilities of actuaries in relation to pension schemes.  Section 24 amends section 53E of the Act by deleting the definition of "funding standard liabilities" which is being inserted in section 40 of the Act by section 27.  Section 25 amends section 55 of the Act to require the trustees of a pension scheme to include a statement in the annual report indicating whether the scheme satisfies the funding standard reserve requirements.  If it does not, it must notify the Pensions Board within a time limit which may be prescribed by me.  Section 26 amends section 59G of the Act to require the consent of the trustees to an application of early retirement under the rules of the scheme where the actuary is not satisfied that the scheme satisfies the funding standard reserve requirements.This Government continues to invest heavily in social protection for its citizens in spite of the economic recession.  This reflects the importance attached to supporting the most vulnerable groups in society and to reducing poverty.  This must, however, be balanced against the budgetary demands.  I commend the Bill to the House and I look forward to an informed debate and to hearing Members' views on the measures in the Bill.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	623	I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  I will concentrate on the social protection area and will deal with the pensions issue subsequently.  There are a number of changes in the pensions area and many people will be concerned about them.  They do not appear to affect people immediately but they will further down the road.  They are real and substantial changes which must be acknowledged.There is some benefit to having a cash reserve in pension funds so that not too much of the fund is tied up in property or equities, but one might be concerned that it could be an over-restriction.  Taken in conjunction with the pension levy, which was the raid on pension funds last July for the jobs initiative, it is a further attack on people's investment for their old age.  I will come to that later.  That relates to people who make contributions to their own pension schemes.  However, much of what we are dealing with in this Bill relates to payments from the Department of Social Protection, where the Government is making provision for the payment.  The legislation makes a number of changes and I will comment on some aspects of the Minister's speech, some issues she is looking at and some items she said she will consider in further detail on Committee Stage.  The Bill proposes to increase from 260 to 520 the number of paid PRSI contributions to qualify for the contributory old age pension.  That is a change from five years to ten years.  This may bring the payment into line with some other entitlements, but some transitional  arrangement will have to be made for people who will be short of the 520 contributions.  In the past an arrangement was put in place for self-employed people who came into a similar scheme where, although there was a requirement of ten years' contributions, a half pension was allowed to people who had five years' contributions.  The same arrangement should apply here.  A half pension should be paid to those who have 260 contributions and cannot meet the 520 contributions.  The scheme I refer to also involved a refund of PRSI contributions to people who did not qualify for the full pension because they did not have the required number of contributions.  I hope refunds can be made on the same basis on this occasion.This is a bad step and it is harsh on women.  I am surprised the Minister is doing this.  Many people who have been in the workforce but who left it for a number of years, for a variety of reasons, will find it difficult to make the required number of contributions.  Most of these calculations are based on a person's working life and not just on the average contributions in the last number of working years.  The average is based on one's working life, beginning when one started working and ending at retirement age.  A person's working life will not tally exactly with the actual number of years in the workforce and paying PRSI.  This must be examined.  The measures impacts on women more than on men.  They are the people who will find it hard to make up the extra PRSI contributions.  I know the Minister understands the point I am making.  On one hand, we look at the total number of years in a working life and than at the contributions over a specific period, which are different.The main element of the legislation is an attack on one-parent families.  Again, I am surprised at the Minister introducing this measure.  One-parent families are, by and large, headed by young women.  I know 10% or 15% of one-parent families are headed by men but the majority of them whom I deal with on a daily basis are headed by women.  This is another attack on women.  The Minister may say she is neutral on this issue, but these issues are being raised with me.  These measures apply across the board to men and women but the greater number of people affected in this case are  women.I am talking about the phased reduction in the age limit for the youngest qualifying child in a one-parent family from 14 years to seven years.  The age limit for the youngest child is being reduced in three steps: from 14 years to 12 years in May 2012; from 12 to ten years in January 2013; and from ten to seven years in January 2014.I welcome the Minister's statement that she will proceed with the reduction of the upper age limit to seven years only in the event that she gets a credible and bankable commitment from the Government on the delivery of a system of child care by the time of this year's budget.  If this is not forthcoming the measure will not proceed.  This is an unusual way for Ministers to deal with items of legislation.  The Minister has introduced the legislation but makes it clear she will not proceed with it if she does not get what she wants in the forthcoming budget.  I hope she is not using the children of one-parent families as pawns in pre-budget negotiations between herself and the Minister for Finance.  I welcome the fact that she is prepared not to proceed with this measure but I do not like the fact that single parents and their children will be pawns in budgetary tactics next autumn.  The Minister has said that if she does not get a bankable commitment in the forthcoming budget she will not proceed with this measure.  It does not help the dignity of one-parent families to be used a bargaining chip in this case.  I would prefer if the Minister could say she had achieved her objective rather than put it in a budgetary context.I note some conflict between the Minister's approach to various issues in the Bill and that of the Minister for Finance.  The Bill includes a provision to ensure that PRSI contributions are paid on income relieved under the special assignee relief programme, SARP, scheme for tax purposes.  The SARP scheme is an income tax relief scheme introduced by the Minister for Finance in the budget.  However, the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill will ensure that PRSI is payable on the income.  I suspect the Minister for Social Protection would not have exempted it from income tax either.  A tax free scheme was introduced with bells and whistles on budget day by the Minister for Finance.  We all congratulated him.  If I recall correctly there were two schemes, one for people who were working outside the country for a number of days and the other for people who were coming to work in the country.  The Irish taxpayer was to pay high-flying executives private school fees.  The Minister for Social Protection has now come with a sting in the tail.  These people may not have to pay tax but she will get PRSI from them.  I see a contradiction in the messages sent by the Ministers for Finance and Social Protection to the people who will qualify for the SARP schemes.The Bill also makes provision for clarity on share based remuneration arrangements on which employer's PRSI is not chargeable.  This looks like tidying up, from the Minister's point of view.  On the one hand, I admire her for sticking to her guns and making sure that employee's and employer's PRSI are charged on both those areas.  However, these issues should have been thrashed out on budget day rather than have the Minister for Social Protection clawing back some of the concessions made by the Minister for Finance in the budget.I hope the Minister succeeds in avoiding the proposed reduction in the age limit for one-parent family allowance.  The one-parent family allowance is €188 plus a payment for the children, which is very little.I have always used the rule of thumb that a person in receipt of one-parent family allowance could earn about €160 per week while retaining the full social welfare payment.  The figure may have been slightly lower but when one calculated the disregard and did some rounding up it came to approximately €160 per week.  That figure has now been cut to €146.  That money is being taken from people who are in the most difficult financial situation.Section 6 amends the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act which authorises the use of the personal public service, PPS, number for the purpose of carrying out transactions with a number of other public bodies which share personal data and information among themselves for the purpose of carrying out relevant transactions.  That will be extended to the Office of the Pensions Ombudsman and vocational education committees, for third level grant and education purposes.  I see the purpose of that.  However, I recently submitted a parliamentary question to the Minister for Social Protection on the use of the PPS number.  It was regarding a public service identifier.  I do not know the exact name.  I recently had a case where a person had a PRSI number for years yet when they were changing jobs and were put on emergency tax it was discovered that the tax office did not have a record of the PRSI number.  In checking the matter I submitted a parliamentary question recently to the Minister.  While the Department of Social Protection is the data controller - or someone does it on behalf of the Department - the Revenue Commissioners do not have automatic access to such information.  They receive it as required and they only put the numbers into use as required.  The information is not shared automatically across Departments.  I had not encountered previously that a live PPS number was not live with the Revenue Commissioners even though it had been in existence for years.  The number must be physically clocked in as a live number.  It is not sufficient for it to be live in the Department of Social Protection for it to be valid and in use in other Departments.  Administrative tidying up is required.  If the Minister looks at the parliamentary question I tabled recently she will understand exactly the which to which situation I refer.  I tabled the same question to the Minister for Finance to get his take on the issue as well.  The Minister will see the point I made in that regard.On the exchange of data and information, it would have been preferable if the system had operated more effectively for the exchange of data between the Department of Social Protection and the Revenue Commissioners rather than frightening the daylights out of 155,000 pensioners during the Christmas period when they got letters informing them they might have an increased tax liability.  They were informed by the Department of Social Protection about their level of social welfare payments.  In some situations the tax office was not aware of the level of payment.  In some cases the tax office was not aware a payment was being made and in other cases it was not aware of the full details of the payment which resulted in some people getting letters who had an extra tax liability which was a major shock to them.  Others got letters which were a major shock to them but it transpired that they did not have a taxable income even though the information in the Department of Social Protection was transferred to the Revenue Commissioners.  Some of those who got letters saying they would have to pay more tax were inaccurate.  I accept the sending of the letters was a rushed job prior to the Christmas period.We had a detailed discussion on the matter at the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform immediately when we came back in the new year.  The Department of Social Protection attended and the Revenue.  I do not specifically find fault as I genuinely thought the senior staff in the Department of Social Protection were very competent.  I am always praiseworthy of staff from the Department who appear before the Committee of Public Accounts although I am not always as praiseworthy of some other Departments but, in general, the Department does a very good job in the area.  However, a more immediate exchange of information must be carried out on a more long-term basis.I wish to make one other point on the changes the Minister indicated she was considering making during the course of the passage of the Bill.  I referred to voluntary contributions.  The Minister said she would introduce transition arrangements for the gradual reduction in the age limit of the youngest child.  I hope she will put that off altogether or perhaps the Minster for Finance will bring forward a measure in his budget next year and will inform the Minister for Social Protection of his intention prior to Committee Stage so that there will not be a need for her to proceed with her intention in that regard.Another issue to which I wish to refer is mortgage interest supplement.  It is a difficult issue because it affects those who are in the most difficult situations.  I refer to the restriction on the payment of mortgage interest relief to provide that the mortgage interest supplement will not be payable to a person for the first 12 years of mortgage arrears resolution - in other words, to those people would have been in receipt of mortgage interest supplement.  To get the payment in the first place is quite an achievement.  I have come across several genuine cases of where people got mortgages from banks and were able to pay them at the time but when they lost their jobs they applied for the mortgage interest supplement to the community welfare officers and supervisors while all those further up the line said they should not have taken out the mortgage in the first place.I tabled a parliamentary question on a particular case where a person is paying 6% interest.  The Permanent TSB, which is a State-owned bank, is charging that rate.  The company in the case to which I refer is Start Mortgages, or one of those other mortgage companies that are on a blacklist in the eyes of many people.  Given that the mortgage interest rate a few years ago was higher than the prevailing rate, the community welfare officer and those higher up the line said the individual concerned should not have taken out the mortgage on such an excessive rate in the first place, notwithstanding the fact that if we look at such a mortgage today that kind of mortgage interest rate is compatible with rates being charged by other banks.  However, I understand the logic that one cannot give a person mortgage interest supplement if he or she is not paying the mortgage interest.The Minister might be curious about the next point I wish to raise, which leads me to those who are in a similar situation.  I do not wish to give the Minister a bad idea in this regard but the Minister for Finance has had it already.  I refer to tax relief at source for the same people who are getting mortgage interest relief.  I again tabled a parliamentary question recently asking the Minister for Finance for details on financial institutions that had notified the Revenue Commissioners of accounts that were in arrears.  They must have been in arrears for 18 months, at which time the financial institutions notified the Revenue that the people were in arrears and were not paying their mortgage interest and, by definition, their tax relief at source should be suspended.  I asked him what arrangements are in place, if a person starts paying their arrears, to get mortgage interest relief again.  The situation is that they must apply again for tax relief at source.  I was given the figures by way of correspondence because they were not available in the four days available for the reply to the parliamentary question.  Up to last year 12,000 people have had their tax relief at source discontinued in recent years as a result of not paying their mortgage.  There is logic in that even though the people who are in that situation are getting a double hit in terms of losing their tax relief at source and losing their mortgage interest supplement, which is creating another burden on them.  I urge the Minister to examine the matter again, jointly with the Minister for Finance.  I understand the cold logic involved but it is very difficult in terms of dealing with the people who are in mortgage arrears who have now lost their job.The Minister has also proposed changes to the financing arrangements for the social insurance fund arising from Government accounting requirements.  I would welcome clarification on the matter in due course.  Perhaps in responding to the debate the Minister would explain what that change will mean.The Minister has indicated that she would like to extend the household budgeting facility to include additional energy providers that are regulated by the energy regulator.  That should also include people who will be paying the new water charge in a year or two.  I understand the regulator for water will be the energy regulator.  The Cabinet decided today that Bord Gáis will be the body under the energy regulator which will be concerned with the household budgeting facility.  If Bord Gáis is supplying two services to a household – water and gas -  the Minister should factor that into her calculations.  It could be possible that water services would be privatised, as responsibility for it is being given to a company that is on the list for the sale of State assets.  I will return to the matter on another day with another Minister.  However, there is a case for water charges to be included in the household benefits package because it will be provided by a company providing energy to households and it will be regulated by the energy regulator when it is introduced.  Perhaps a waiver system will be put in place.Another issue that will affect many people is the changing of the basis for the calculation of entitlement for jobseeker's benefit from a six-day week to a five-day week.  People understand what is involved in that regard.  It will make life more difficult for some.  It is another example of the cuts that were announced on budget day.  I do not need to rehearse them.  The Minister knows the list off by heart.  Depending on how much time remains I might get a chance to repeat it.On fraud control measures I would welcome if the Minister could outline the cash savings that have been achieved.  I do not like the word "fraud".  I prefer to use the term "control measures".  In the case of the one-parent family payment, sometimes a person might have earned over the allowed limit and because there is no instant exchange of information between the Revenue and the Department of Social Protection on how much a person is earning one can find that a person has accrued considerable social protection payments that must be refunded to the Department because his or her income has exceeded the level for a number of weeks or months during a particular year.  I do not consider that fraud.  It is an error.  I urge the Minister to ask her staff, in so far as that is possible, not to use the term "fraud" unduly in drafting the Bill.  As the Minister correctly indicated, it is only a small minority of people and it gives fodder to people who question those who are in receipt of social welfare, as most of them are fully entitled to what they receive.  Most of the projections the Minister gives for control savings are on the basis that the payment is to continue for the next 12 months, 18 months or two years.  For several years I have heard figures of €400 million, €500 million and €600 million that have been saved as a result of fraud and control measures.  If one were to factor those in over recent years, the social welfare bill should only be approximately €10 billion at this stage because every year another €400 million or €500 million is being saved.  These are notional savings.  I was a TD for a number of years reading of those savings and by the third or fourth year, the penny dropped and I said that there cannot be savings at this level every year.  Through the Minister's good friends and officials at the Committee of Public Accounts, we got the exact formula the Department uses and how many weeks or months it projects the potential saving to be.  I would ask the Minister to be a little more specific when she speaks about the cash savings in those areas.Another issue the Minister mentions affects her Department as well as other Departments and it is one I also want to raise with her.  The Minister will strengthen the powers of social welfare inspectors to make inquiries with landlords in connection with rent supplement claims.  Obviously, that is a big issue.  For a start, legally all landlords are meant to have registered with the Private Residential Tenancies Board.  The number who are registered, which is almost 70,000, relates to almost 100,000 tenancies because tenants come and go during the course of a year.  If that tallied with the rent supplement, as I think we all would agree, there should be no landlord in receipt of rent supplement who is not registered with the Private Residential Tenancies Board.However, I have seen an insidious move in this issue in recent times by the Minister with responsibility for housing.  The housing forms that are now in vogue in all local authorities state that the person must complete the form in its entirety.  A new supplement has been added to the form in County Laois in recent weeks and I am checking whether it is the case in other local authorities.  I do not know how many questions are on the form, which extends to 16 pages, and the form can be returned to applicants if they do not give the PRTB number of the landlord.  The Government is using tenants in a vulnerable position to get at landlords.  Most of these tenants are on social protection payments because they would not get rent supplement if they were not.  The Government is using them as the meat in the sandwich to get at landlords for enforcement of tax and registration with the PRTB.  It has got to the stage in Laois - perhaps rightly so - and it must be the same everywhere because housing officers do not make unilateral decisions like this, that an application will not be accepted if the address is not registered with the PRTB.  I have come across cases where tenants have had to leave private rental accommodation because the landlords were not registered.  They could not force the landlord to register and they had to leave the flat or apartment, uproot their family and move on again.The funny aspect of the PRTB is that the landlord cannot register the property until the tenant moves in and there is a signed lease agreement.  One cannot register a lease agreement before one has a lease agreement.  The tenant must move in, sign the lease agreement and then that form is sent off to the PRTB where there is often a waiting list.  The tenant is relying in good faith that the landlord will do that and the tenant has no control over this.  These are the Department's clients or customers because they all are on social protection.  If it transpires two or three months later that the landlord has not done that, the tenant must leave that house.  That is very unfair on the tenant.  There should be some other way through the taxation system of getting at an unregistered landlord without using the person on a social welfare payment who is looking for a rent supplement.  I think the Minister gets the point I am making on that issue.I should say I am standing in for my colleague, Deputy Cowen.  When we get to Committee Stage, we will have a number of amendments dealing with this issue.There are 92,000 families in receipt of the one-parent family payment at a total cost to the Exchequer of approximately €1.1 billion, a number of which will be seriously affected by the changes.  The Minister hopes to save €20 million in 2012, and perhaps €100 million in a full year through this reduction combined with other one-parent family payments.  This is a very large and severe figure and I would ask the Minister to do so as sensitively as possible.I would also ask her to reconsider the level of income a person in receipt of that payment can earn without having his or her payment cut because we must encourage people, where possible, to get back into employment, even if it is only part time.  Earnings of €160 a week relate only to a part-time job anyway.  In most cases, it is a few days on a cash register in a filling station or shop, and recipients should be encouraged to take up such employment.The other aspect of the Bill which will occupy many people is the level of reserve required to be maintained by pension schemes.  The reserve will be the aggregate of two amounts and, generally, approximately 15%.  I do not have a problem with that issue.  I note the brokers' association has been on to us and we have suggestions and some amendments to make, but I do not see anything wrong with maintaining a certain amount of cash reserve.  Over the years most of the money was invested in equities and some of it was invested in property, and we all have seen what can happen to equities and property.  It is no harm to have a little old fashioned cash in the bank backing up pension funds.  Perhaps one of the reasons brokers are not too happy with it is that they will not make much commission on money sitting in a bank but, in principle, I agree there should be a certain amount of cash reserve in that area.The Minister must clarify her statement that she will have power to prescribe a higher or lower percentage, and she might tell us whether she will be doing that by statutory instrument or by primary legislation.  If we set a figure of 15% in this legislation and while it is all well and good for the Minister to take this enabling provision to herself, it is not good enough that a fundamental issue like this can be changed behind closed doors, as it were, with a statutory instrument.  Somebody told me that 26,000 statutory instruments passed through the Oireachtas since its inception and I do not think a single one of them has been changed on the floor of the Dáil.  There are 21 days after the Minister signs one in which the Dáil can vote to overturn it, and I do not think that procedure has ever been invoked.  The reason I am coming back to that one-----

#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	625	I am concluding on this, and I thank the Acting Chairman for telling me that.  I am coming back to my first point, that in the private pension area there are approximately 200,000 people on defined benefit schemes and 150,000 people on defined contribution schemes.  Obviously, the latter number is rising because nobody is getting into a defined benefit scheme anymore, and one can understand the reason for that.   The funding of pension schemes will be made that little bit more difficult by having that cash reserve in addition to the pension levy, where the Government decided, by way of a jobs initiative, to take €500 million per annum out of private pension funds last year and the same again this year.  The pension levy is 0.6% of the value of the funds each year for four years which amounts to €2 billion the Minister is taking out of the pension funds.  While the Minister is doing her best to protect the solvency of pension funds, the Minister for Finance was in here last year making sure he would raid them to the extent of €500 million a year for each of the next four years.  While one Minister is trying to help the pension fund business and people's pension provision for the future, at the same time another Minister is doing the direct opposite.We will discuss those matters on Committee Stage.  I hope the Minister can reconsider some of the draconian amendments she is suggesting, especially in terms of the one-parent family payment.

Ba chóir go mbeimís i gcónaí ag díriú orthu siúd atá ag brath ar an Stát ó thaobh pinsin agus leasa shóisialta de, ach is í an fhadhb atá agam ná nach bhfuilimid ag cuidiú leo siúd atá ag brath ar an Stát i gcomhthéacs an Bhille seo, ach a mhalairt.Sinn Féin will be opposing this Bill, regrettably.  There are two parts to this Bill.  One deals with pensions and in the main is welcome.  However, the fact these provisions are tied to odious changes in this Bill, in particular to the one-parent family payment, means that my party must oppose it.I will set the context, which is very interesting.  Hopefully, the Minister will listen to what her party colleague said in regard to similar moves in the past by a Fianna Fáil Government.  Less than two years ago, the Fianna Fáil Government dropped the cut-off age for lone parent payments to 14 years.  Alongside Sinn Féin, the Labour Party objected to this move on the grounds that the necessary supports and services were not in place.  That reality has not changed but now the Labour Party and the Minister are dropping the cut-off age further to seven years.  Where do they think seven year olds will go after school, given that, out of school hours, child care provision is practically non-existent, which the Minister accepted earlier?We are emerging from a decade of revelations about child protection scandals but the Government parties seem to have learned nothing, given they have put such proposals on the agenda today.  The Government clearly believes a child does not need parental care and supervision beyond the age of seven.  If it did, this would not be in front of us.  When it comes to children, this Government is worse than the last.  As I said, the last Government reduced the cut-off age by four years whereas this Government is intent on cutting it by seven years.  Let us not forget that this Bill follows in the wake of budget 2012, which was a targeted attack on lone parents.  The Minister made cuts to their earnings disregards, to payments while on CE and to qualified child payments.  Coupled with the cuts to back to school allowance, rent supplement and fuel allowance, the Minister is guilty of a disproportionate attack on lone parents and their children.Likewise, we are resolutely opposed to the cuts proposed to jobseeker payments.  The affected jobseekers have had their hours reduced as a consequence of the recession but the Minister is punishing them for being in this predicament.  She has claimed they are nervous about entering the world of full-time work, despite economists of all hues unanimously agreeing that any growth in full-time job opportunities is a long way off in this economy. Tá an Bille Leasa Shóisialaigh agus Pinsean 2012 ag teacht anuas ar na hionsaithe ar thuismitheoirí aonair i mbuiséad 2012.  Tá seacht mbliana ró-óg.  Tá sé sin le léiriú ins na scéalta ar fad atá curtha chun cinn ag tuismitheoirí atá sa stad sin agus nach bhfuil ábalta brath ar thacaíocht ina gceantair féin nó ó thuismitheoirí eile nó ó cháirde.  Níl an córas ann chun aire a thabhairt do pháisti tar éis na scoile nó le linn laethanta saoire scoile, do pháistí idir seacht mbliana agus ceithre bliana déag ach go háirithe, ach do pháistí faoi aois a seacht chomh maith.  Níl aon loighic sa mhéid a dúirt an t-Aire níos luaithe, is é sin nach mbéadh aon athrú ar ráta an leasa go dtí go ndéanfar cinnte de go mbeidh na tacaíochtaí sin ar fáil.  Ní cóir go dtiocfadh an t-athru seo os comhair an Oireachtais go dtí go bhfuil na tacaíochtaí sin ar fáil sa chéad dul síos.  Sin mar is cóir an t-athrú seo a dhéanamh.  Nuair a chuirfidh mé leasú chun cinn chun an chuid seo den mBille a scrios, tá súil agam go seasfaidh an t-Aire liom, mar ní chóir go gcuirfear an beart seo chun cinn.  Speaking as Labour Party spokesperson on social protection when the Fianna Fáil Government introduced the legislation lowering the cut-off age to 14, the then Deputy Róisín Shortall, now Minister of State, outlined her party’s position, which was the position it took to the polls last year.  The Labour Party’s assessment of the Fianna Fáil Bill at that stage is even more relevant to the Labour Party’s own hypocritical offerings which we are debating today.  In some ways, I am sorry to have to quote so much from Deputy Shortall but I find myself in agreement with most of what she had to say on the occasion of the introduction of the legislation by the Fianna Fáil-Green Party Government.  She stated:The problem is that the Bill is not about activation; it is about cut-backs and the optics of doing something about long-term welfare recipients.  How can one call it activation when in the first instance there are so few jobs of any description available?  That is the big issue; the jobs are not there.The reality has not changed; in fact, it has got worse.  The jobs are still not there and that remains the big issue.  The live register stands at 434,300, the standardised unemployment rate stands at 14.3% and 185,000 people have been on the live register for more than a year.  We currently have more people who are job-ready than there are jobs.  The European Vacancy Monitor published in January by the DG Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion of the European Commission demonstrates there is currently one vacancy for every 50 jobseekers here.  While Germany, the Netherlands and Austria enjoy record low unemployment levels, Ireland has 300,000 jobseekers actively seeking just 6,000 vacancies, which is 50 jobseekers for every one vacancy, well above the EU average of nine jobseekers for one vacancy.  We can see where our money is going, namely, to create jobs in Germany.Deputy Shortall continued:There is no provision for extra training or for extra after-school care for the children of lone parents.  There is not even a commitment from the Minister on ring-fencing any money that might be saved for helping welfare claimants into work or training.For lone parents, the costs of engagement in activation, training and work are higher because the associated parenting responsibility and costs cannot be shared.  A 2011 report published by the UCD School of Social Justice demonstrates that even during the so-called boom years, after-school provision remained sparse.  It states that between 2002 and 2007 the proportion of households using non-parental child care for pre-school children increased from 42% to 48% whereas the comparable proportion in regard to primary school children remained unchanged at 25%.  If anything, as the recession deepens the availability and affordability of these services is getting worse, not better.Deputy Shortall reminded the Dáil:Lowering the qualifying age was meant to go hand-in-hand with better child care and training services, the introduction of a parental allowance to replace the one-parent family payment and the ending of the ban on cohabitation.  Where are these reforms?  There is no sign of them in this Bill.Nor is there any sign of them in this latest Social Welfare and Pensions Bill.  So strongly did she feel on the issue that she accused the then Minister Deputy Eamon Ó Cuív of doing "the dirty work of the former Minister, Deputy Hanafin".  Given what is in front of us today, the Minister, Deputy Burton, is continuing that dirty work.Deputy Shortall went on to say:The likelihood is that all that will happen is that an extra 12,000 lone parents will transfer to jobseeker payments over the next six years.  This will inflate the live register figures by another 12,000 as people on one-parent family payment are not counted at the current time.  It is hard to know what the point of all that will be.This Bill will add thousands more.The national employment and entitlements service, NEES, and Pathways to Work cannot cope with the current numbers on the live register, and this Bill will compound the situation.  The NEES, which is currently being established, does not have the capacity or the infrastructure to meet the needs of those currently on jobseeker's allowance or benefit.  Adding even greater numbers to this system will only overburden and further stretch an already struggling system which is in the process of reform.Sensitive profiling, strong case management and professional development and learning is vital for service providers as is cognisance of and responsiveness to the needs of those on the live register.  These needs include mental health, educational attainment, literacy, numeracy, parental responsibility and accessibility and mobility needs.  Understanding motivation and coaching and mentoring will be pivotal to the mutual success of the service for users and providers.  The service is resource-intensive and requires significant upskilling and training of existing staff.  Additional staff will be required as well.  There is an acknowledgement of this and this is why the national employment and entitlements service, NEES, will not be in place immediately.  It also requires a cultural shift throughout the Department that will take time.  All of these changes will require additional resources and staff.  To date I have seen no commitment from the Government for additional staff over and above what existed in the various component parts which have been squeezed together to make up the NEES.  None of this addresses the fact that the Government will now add to the numbers on the live register of those who will be obliged to engage the services of the NEES.Previously, Deputy Shortall stated that the single greatest effect of these changes would be to deprive lone parents of the opportunity to take up part-time work.  She was correct.  This was before the 2012 budget put the boot in and ensured that it would be more difficult, if not impossible, for many lone parents to avail of part-time opportunities or some of the training schemes.  The particular rules of the one-parent family scheme, including the earnings disregard and the transitional payments, have enabled a significant proportion of lone parents to engage in work around their parental responsibilities in the past.  The Government has eroded or eliminated many of these rules.  It appears there is a move to merge the one-parent family payment with the jobseeker's allowance or the single working age payment, a regrettable step.The Bill before House represents an attempt to do this.  The jobseeker's allowance scheme uses a measure of several days work to determine the eligibility for payment.  This does not accommodate lone parents who may be able to work for several hours each day while their child is in school and who benefit from such work.  This must be changed and a change to the number of hours worked rather than the number of days worked should have been included in the Bill.  The Minister has announced several amendments including one to reduce the number of days calculable from six to five.  This will represent a significant cut for many of those on part-time or reduced working hours.  Such people are under-employed in our society.The entire jobseeker's allowance scheme and the "genuinely seeking work" condition should be reformed as recommended by the all-party Oireachtas committee last month.  The committee recognised that full-time, secure employment is no longer the norm for the majority of those of working age in modern Ireland.  Many contracts are based on hours rather than full-time employment or a full day of work.  Counting two hours in a given day as if a person worked a full day is no longer appropriate.  I hope the Minister will bring forward amendments to this Bill or changes in the next social welfare Bill to reflect the changes in working practices in Ireland.  The all-party committee concluded that the jobseeker's allowance rule should be changed to take account of hours rather than days.  I understand a further committee report is being prepared by another Deputy which deals with part-time work and under-employment situations.  It is intended that this report is will be discussed and passed at the committee meeting next week.  Perhaps the Minister will take the time to read it.  That report is not authored by myself, unlike the other one.  A Government Deputy is responsible for this work and the draft findings I have read are in line with what I have said to date and what many organisations have highlighted in recent years.The all-party committee also concluded that the 2006 discussion paper proposals for supporting lone parents included an important point of relevance to lone parents and all those of working age.  The paper acknowledged that a full-time working week no longer reflects the atypical working patterns of many in Ireland today, especially women.  This is increasingly the case.  Accordingly, it recommended that to meet the "genuinely seeking work" condition, work amounting to 19 or more hours should be sufficient.  Members from all parties in the Oireachtas committee endorsed my recommendation that the "genuinely seeking work" rule be reformed to make it flexible enough to allow all parents to take up whatever work is available and that could be balanced with parental duties.  This is especially the case for those parenting alone.  The Bill ignores the considered findings of the Oireachtas committee.Out of disgust at the Fianna Fáil proposal to lower the cut-off age, Deputy Shortall asked whether it was Government policy for 13 year olds to have no parental supervision and to be left to their own devices during the three months of their summer holidays.  That was Fianna Fáil policy at the time.  However, it turns out that the policy of Deputy Shortall's Government is for eight year olds to have no parental supervision and to be left to their own devices if the parent is in full-time work.  The Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, complained at the time that there was no allowance made for children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD, challenging behavioural patterns or physical or mental health difficulties.  Deputy Shortall noted that the parents of these children simply could not be in two place at once.  I am putting the question she put to the then Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív.  If the parent of a child in those circumstances is required to be at work, what arrangement will the Government put in place to ensure adequate care and protection is provided for young people at risk?It is not good enough for the Minister to state that she will not proceed with this provision if she does not get a credible and bankable commitment from the Government on the delivery of such a service.  I have seen no such system.  I have seen no sunset clause in the Bill because it does not exist.  There is nothing to suggest the Minister will not proceed with these changes.  Nothing is indicated in the list of amendments, which we have not seen although the Bill is due on Committee Stage next Tuesday.  There is no reference to any such amendment.  The Minister has not guaranteed that any savings will be ring-fenced.  There is nothing here.  This is a fig leaf for the Minister to hide behind for several weeks, just as she has done with the community employment, CE, review which was to be held and finalised in March.  It is the same fig leaf that the Minister has used in respect of the disability allowance.  It is the same fig leaf the Minister for Education and Skills used for the DEIS programme cuts.  It serves only to take some of the heat out of the Opposition for a few months.If the Minister believes the logic of her statement today then she would agree with my proposal to delete these provisions from the Bill in their entirety on Committee Stage and wait until the services are in place before proceeding with the changes.  There is no point in putting this in place and suggesting that at some stage in future the Minister for Education and Skills will put in place an after-school programme.  Such programmes have been promised by every Government under the sun.  They have promised to look after the needs and provide the supports required for children but it has not happened.  Unless the Minister can guarantee that such supports are in place - it is not sufficient to give a commitment in writing - then she should not proceed with the relevant provisions in any shape or form in this legislation.Another highly objectionable trait shared by the Fianna Fáil Bill is that they are both steeped in archaic judgmentalism and prejudice.  In a scathing critique that is equally applicable to the current Bill , the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Róisín Shortall, as a then Opposition Deputy, stated in reference to the previous Bill:Allowances are made for lone parents who have suffered a recent bereavement, but why do they stop there?  Why are other reasons for lone parenthood, such as abandonment or separation treated any differently?  Do people in such circumstances not also need what the Minister describes as time to come to terms with their new status? There would seem to be some element of discrimination ... Do people who have been suddenly abandoned not need the same consideration as people who find themselves suddenly widowed?Summing up her assessment of a Bill that was only half as bad as the current one, she said of the proposal to lower the cut-off age in respect of lone parent payment:It reveals the crude recklessness and devil-may-care attitude of the Government regarding the poor in our society.  Some of the underlying motivation which concerns me in this Bill is that it would seem that it is not about the welfare or protection of vulnerable people, rather, it is about the welfare and protection of the Government.  It is designed to appeal to the prejudices of those sections of the public who believe all lone parents and all jobseekers are sponging off the State.  I do not think the Minister should feed that view.

Last weekend the Labour Party Conference passed the following laudable motion:Conference recognises that the single biggest barrier to the labour market for lone parents is the availability and affordability of child care [ESRI report on Female Participation in the Irish Labour Market 2009] and that the demand for such child care is not being met.Conference recognises that lone parents of both genders often experience difficulty in accessing work, education and training opportunities because of a lack of good quality affordable child care and after-school care. This means that job choices are often limited and low-paid.Conference notes the negative impact that budget 2011 had on lone parents and in particular recognises that the cuts in CE schemes impacted significantly on lone parents.Conference therefore calls on the Labour Party in government to:- Refrain from imposing any further cuts to benefits for lone parent families that would create further barriers to accessing work and education opportunities;- Devise a focused and targeted scheme providing high quality, affordable child care for lone parent families;- Develop a system of mutual obligation, similar to that of Nordic countries where parents are obliged to look for work, and, in return governments are obliged to provide employment and child care supports.We saw it with child benefit and now in regard to lone parent supports - when it comes to child income supports, the Labour Party makes all the right sounds and then does the opposite in government.  I appeal to Labour Party Deputies to think carefully before voting on this Bill.  They clearly understand what is the right thing to do.  The Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, articulated it well in the last Dáil from the Opposition benches, and their colleagues re-affirmed it last weekend at the party conference.  Now it is time for them to have the courage of their convictions by voting against the Bill if the sections the Minister of State rightly identified as unacceptable to her party in opposition are not deleted.It is ridiculous that we have legislation which purports to deal with two specific areas of social welfare provision, namely, lone parent payments and pensions but which the Minister now tells us will include major changes in 12 additional areas by way of amendments on Committee Stage.  As a Whip, I have some idea of the timeframe scheduled for next week in terms of amendments.  I understand Committee and Report Stages will be squeezed into a three-hour window, with a guillotine to be imposed next Wednesday.  This is deemed sufficient time to deal with amendments from other Members in addition to the amendments the Minister has indicated she will bring forward.  That is rushed legislation and it is entirely unacceptable.  I urge the Minister to return to the Government Chief Whip and demand a proper Committee Stage debate with the necessary time allocated to tease out all of the details in full.  I have tried to use my time today to fast-track some of the debate before next week.  I will deal with the proposed cuts in job seeker's allowance and benefit when the amendments are presented.  I hope the Minister understands that in terms of any changes in regard to days worked and so on, unless she moves towards the hour mechanism rather than days, it will end up in a cut for those who are underemployed or in part-time work.In regard to the regulatory provisions relating to defined benefit pension funds, the Bill is a missed opportunity and should go much further.  In this regard, I acknowledge the Minister's commitment to address some of the other changes required in terms of pensions in the next Social Welfare Bill.  The provisions may have the effect of encouraging some of the funds to invest more prudently and in Ireland's economic recovery, but that is not guaranteed.  Irish pension funds fell much harder than those in other countries in large part because they invested so disproportionately in equities.  That they continue to do so suggests they have learnt very little either from the dotcom crash in the early 2000s or the latest financial crash.  I support the direction in which the Minister is moving, but stronger legislative provisions will be required to ensure greater diversification and prudence in the future.  Likewise, this Bill should have been used to ensure more private sector pension funds, currently estimated by the Irish Brokers Association to be valued at some €80 billion, are invested into specific, strategic and employment-intensive investment initiatives here in Ireland.  A greater degree of such investment would create jobs and help to dig us out of the hole we are in.  I acknowledge the changes that have been made but a great deal more must be done.Unfortunately, the Acting Chairman has indicated that I have run out of time.  I hope the same will not happen on Committee Stage where we will be debating the vast range of issues we have discovered are to be included in a Bill which was originally intended to deal with only two or three.  I ask the Minister, in her summing up, to outline how she will give effect to the commitment she made earlier.  Will she agree to delete the provision whereby the cut-off point in respect of lone parent support is to be reduced to seven years?  In the absence of this and other changes, I am opposed to the Bill.

#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	631	I was somewhat surprised by the Minister's opening contribution in the Chamber this evening when she announced her intention to implement the cut reducing to seven years the age limit for the lone parent allowance but stated she recognises that seven is too young to be left without a backup in respect of adequate child care.  It is too young for a parent to make the first steps back to the workplace and too young for the same parent to return to education or training.  The Minister stated: "I entirely agree that seven is too young for anyone to seriously contemplate any of these things without there being a system of safe, affordable and accessible child care in place, similar to what is found in the Scandinavian countries."  As the previous speaker pointed out, Members have heard this for years but the Minister proposes to try to ascertain whether it can be brought in within two years.  I put it to her this simply is a way to maintain the Government's commitment to the troika on cuts and savings while at the same time covering the Minister's political base and alleviating the pressure that was being brought to bear on her by organisations such as Barnardos, the National Women's Council of Ireland and OPEN.  Such groups seemingly had good contacts previously with the Minister with regard to the lone parent payments and so on.  Deputy Ó Snodaigh also made some excellent points on comments made by former backbenchers in the Dáil while in opposition about cuts to the lone parent allowance and how it would affect badly that group of people and children.Ultimately, only approximately €7.6 million will be saved by this cut because within the space of a few years, the age limit has been reduced from nearly 18 in 2010 to seven years by 2014.  I consider this to constitute the virtual abolition of the lone parent allowance and is yet another attack on a group of people who are known to be particularly vulnerable.  The European Union's survey of income and living conditions in 2009 showed that in Ireland, 16.6% of lone-parent families live in consistent poverty, as against a rate of 5.5% among the population as a whole.  Moreover, when one talks of lone-parent families, one is referring to one in five Irish families and one in five children.  I also ask the Minister to note that 86% of parents in this position are women.I do not know whether the Minister saw the programme but on last night's edition of "Tonight with Vincent Browne", the economist Jim Power made a stupid, ignorant and offensive remark about lone parenting being a choice.  While one might expect something like that, he is supposed to be well educated through our State-supported education system and to display a little more intelligence.  It demonstrates there is an attitude among elements of the better-off and those who are well sheltered from the crisis who believe that people in receipt of welfare benefits, including lone parents, are making lifestyle choices, that is, they are too lazy to work and are milking the welfare system for whatever it is worth.  This definitely was indicated by the comment made last night by the aforementioned economist, Jim Power.  It was an absolutely disgraceful reaction.  Unfortunately, such reactions and attitudes are reinforced by Ministers talking about lifestyle choices or massaging the figures to fraudulently claim there is widespread fraud within the social welfare system.  In fact, the majority of the approximately 200,000 lone parents work.  In 2009, approximately 90,450 people were in receipt of lone parent payments and of that number, 60% were working, most of whom were women working part-time.The main reasons lone parents are poor include low-paid employment, the problem of affordable child care - with which the Minister is familiar - the lack of family-friendly work arrangements and the lack of after care.  I note the Minister states she intends to address the latter, although she will bring in this legislation anyway, thereby forcing many lone parents into part-time work.  Such work tends to be in low-paid minimum wage jobs and tend to be in those areas covered by the joint labour committee, JLC, agreements.  These are the very workers whose wages and conditions are being attacked by the Government.  Another problem facing lone parents is gaining access to training or further education.  This means of securing a better paid job again faces the same barrier, namely, the lack of affordable child care.  The cost of child care in Ireland is approximately twice the European Union average cost and consequently, Ireland does not have affordable child care.At the time of the last budget, the Minister stated the best route out of poverty was through paid employment and she reiterated this point in her opening contribution this evening.  There are two ways in which to consider this statement.  The first is to state that it is true.  If the aim is to secure jobs with decent pay and conditions, this implies a serious commitment by the Government to create employment and not the Mickey Mouse schemes and spin that have been evident thus far.  It also implies real action to provide affordable child care, training, skilling and opportunities for further education.  I believe the JobBridge initiative was even being criticised at the Labour Party conference over the weekend for its inadequacies in respect of providing people with skills and the manner in which it is being used.  I note the Minister now suggests that lone parents also are be included in this scheme.On the other hand, this statement could be a cover for cutting welfare costs by driving people into low-paid minimum wage jobs and into the arms of ruthless exploitative employers.  While they still would be trapped in poverty, as a statistic to the State they would be off the live register.  I believe the latter possibility to be the approach of the Government.  I am greatly concerned by this approach and note that those who attended the meeting held today with representatives of the National Women's Council of Ireland, Barnardos and OPEN will have encountered a highly disgruntled and angry group of people who believed they had been completely disregarded by the Minister in respect of this cut to the child's age with regard to the receipt of lone parent payments.  It constitutes a clear attack on these people and on children.The only other point I wish to make in this regard is that I oppose the reduction of the basis on which jobseeker's benefits are calculated from six days to five days.  This again will affect those whose access to jobs, full-time work and so on already has been affected and this measure should not be brought in.  The Minister should reverse this measure and my group certainly intends to table an amendment to so do.  I intended to focus my remarks on the one-parent family payment because this constitutes the crucial part of this Bill.  I believe the Minister is making a mistake and if she really believed what she has stated in this Chamber, she would delay bringing in this cut for three or four years after which, if the adequate child care facilities were in place, she could attempt to make that decision.

However, those principles are very much under threat and at times, one can discern the manner in which they have been maligned and that those of us who are guided by principles of justice and fairness are almost perceived to be figures of fun who trot out such cliches.  However, across the River Liffey in the constituency of Dublin Central, I can see where they are not cliches because there are plenty of examples of unfairness and injustice.  Decisions undoubtedly have been made by the Government - regardless of the intention - arising from which the needy and vulnerable are suffering disproportionately.  Again, I note terms such as "vulnerable" and "needy" are almost looked upon scornfully by certain sections of society and in the media.  Some people in society are not unduly affected by the cuts.  I refer to Members of this House, as well as people in certain positions in State, semi-State and private organisations.  They are not unduly affected and the significance in this regard lies in the word, "unduly".  Obviously, no one wishes to pay additional taxes, direct or otherwise but one must accept that some people can afford to pay more.  This brings one to a fairer system of taxation in which those who earn more pay more.  Were the State to have such a fairer system of taxation, it would not be making demands on those who are dependent on social welfare.  In part, this pertains to the sacred cow of the 12.5% corporate tax rate.  One cannot even consider a slight increase in the rate, which would realise significantly more income.  At the very least, one should ensure that the full 12.5% is collected.Various crises in the country have led to the term, "the new poor".  People are now entering the social welfare net who would not have been part of that net until recently and consequently, massive demands are being placed on the services.  I consider the main criterion to be that social welfare payments should go where they are most needed and that one should not ask those who are totally dependent on social welfare to face any additional burden in respect of further taxes, be they direct or indirect.The most significant aspect of the Bill is the targeting of payments to one-parent families.  As a result of what is envisaged, such payments will eventually cease when the children involved reach the age of seven years.  Like previous speakers, I acknowledge the "Seven is too young" campaign.  Has there been much engagement between the Department and organisations which work directly with women and children who are particularly vulnerable or is everything guided by the economics and figures involved?  A particular report recommended that seven years was a good age at which to cut this payment and suggested lone parents were stuck in a poverty cycle.  It also stated there was a need for incentives to move such parents away from social welfare and towards work.  There is a need to respect the rights of lone parents whose choice is to remain at home.  They must be supported by means of a social welfare payment which allows them to live in dignity.  Comparisons were made with the position in the Nordic countries which have very extensive support systems in place for lone parents who wish to work outside the home.  I acknowledge what the Minister said about trying to ensure there would be adequate supports available in this country in time.  On the question of where are the jobs for people who wish to move, I do not know whether the JobBridge scheme is going to realise the results for which the Minister is hoping.We have been informed that some 700,000 people, including 200,000 children, are living in poverty in this country.  I acknowledge the work of Social Justice Ireland on this matter.  It has produced figures which indicate that those among the poorest 10% of the population have an average disposable income of €210.  This compares with an average disposable income of €2,276 for those in the richest 10%.  Earlier today the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade discussed the issue of development aid and considered the question of sustainable and shared growth in developing countries in Africa in the context of not increasing the grip of the class system.  We need to look to ourselves in the context of this matter.  Social Justice Ireland has proposed that we broaden the tax base and eliminate those tax breaks which solely benefit those on the highest incomes.When one considers lone parents, one is obliged to wonder how representative are the memberships of the Dáil and the Seanad of those in this group.  One is also obliged to ask how many officials in the IMF and the ECB are lone parents.  I am sure those who are have massive support systems in place and are not obliged to deal with the predicament which many lone parents in this country face.  We continue to make allowances for and pay obscene salaries and bonuses to bankers and directors.  However, we cannot maintain the lone parent allowance at a level which would allow lone parents to retain an element of dignity in their lives.Community employment schemes provide services for many lone parents.  I hope the review will lead to the schemes being strengthened and the elimination of the fears of many of those on such schemes.  Disallowing supports to lone parents entering community employment schemes - I refer, in particular, to some of the very vulnerable women on the schemes in my constituency of Dublin Central - makes a savage statement of discrimination against them and their children.  Those to whom I refer need more, not fewer, supports.  Such supports must come in the form of realistic opportunities in training and education in order that the women concerned do not end up being exploited within the shadow economy, be it black or grey.On the pension legislation and the attempts to extend further protection to individuals and families, I wonder whether the Government is going far enough in putting in place stringent regulations to ensure pension funds will have sufficient reserves in order that pensions will be fully protected.My penultimate point relates to rent supplement and I hope social welfare inspectors will take on board what I have to say.  Dublin Central is plagued by rogue landlords who are charging exorbitant rents for accommodation which is both appalling and overcrowded.  I hope action can be taken to tackle this matter.  I am concerned about tenants who are in receipt of rent supplement and who, through their anti-social behaviour, are causing absolute havoc in communities.  It seems local authorities are powerless against these individuals.  At least in the context of local authority housing, there are procedures which can be employed by officials to deal with tenants who engage in anti-social behaviour.  There is too much happening under the radar in respect of this matter.Earlier this evening I launched a photo exhibition depicting people who had previously worked on Dublin's docks.  Obviously, the men in question are all now well advanced in age.  They were employed for all of their working lives on the docks where they engaged in extremely hard work in difficult conditions.  They paid their taxes and reared their families and are now dependent on their pensions and social welfare payments.  It was heartbreaking to hear men who had worked in appalling conditions on the docks acknowledging that they were afraid that further inroads would be made into their pensions.  As I travelled to Leinster House after the launch, I was very conscious of that group of elderly people who were completely dependent on their pensions.  They cannot take any more cuts and do not deserve to do so.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	634	It is probably ironic that we are debating this Bill on the same day on which I introduced a Private Members' Bill designed to allow for abortion.  In the run-up to its introduction, many were clamouring and demanding rights for so-called unborn children.  I contrast this with the virtual silence on the deprivation and dire straits many children born in this country experience on a daily basis.  A report in yesterday's edition of The Irish Times indicated that, according to the Irish health behaviour in school-aged children survey, in 2010 one in five children in this country had either gone to school or bed hungry because there was not enough food in their homes.  This represents a massive increase on the previous figure.  In the main, the children to whom I refer are in the lower socio-economic groups and generally quite young.All of the studies and many of the slightly off-mainstream media outlets have focused on the dramatic rise in the level of inequality in Ireland during the current recession.  People in receipt of jobseeker's allowance, lone parent's allowance, etc., are among those experiencing the highest levels of deprivation.  In recent years and in statistical terms, the gap between the rich and the poor has widened unacceptably.  This was graphically highlighted in the case of lone parents, even prior to the most recent budget.  The National Women's Council - thanks to the great work of many of the campaigning groups - was able to reveal at the time that it was lone-parent households which had reported the highest levels of deprivation in Irish society.  Almost 63% of individuals from these households experience one or more forms of deprivation.  This compares with a figure of 29% for those who experience more than one form of deprivation at an overall State level.  Over 44% of individuals in lone-parent households experience two or more forms of deprivation.  It must be remembered that 98% of lone parents are women.  I do not believe it is possible to repeat these statistics often enough.  It is absolutely necessary to view the Bill in context of the fact that the most vulnerable, deprived, marginal and poorest people in our society are lone parents.What does the Government propose to do about this matter?  It has introduced the Bill which actually makes matters worse.  This legislation represents what is probably the most dramatic shift in social policy that has ever taken place in Ireland in the treatment of children and parents.  It is astounding that the very group which survey after survey has deemed to be the most vulnerable in society is being targeted to shoulder the brunt of the cuts in this instance.  It has come as a real shock to those - mainly women - who are in the position of being lone parents and the groups which represent them that these proposals have emanated from a Department which is headed by someone who is both a woman and a Labour Party Minister.  People are finding this really difficult to take.  What is happening is extremely ironic, particularly when considered in the context of the speech the Minister made when she was her party's spokesperson on finance prior to the previous budget when she made the point that it was reprehensible that cutbacks had been targeted at women and children.  She attributed this to the fact that the senior ministerial position was not occupied by a woman, yet here she is in the driving seat and bringing forward what is probably the most regressive measure relating to lone parents and vulnerable children that has ever been introduced.  What is happening is disgraceful, particularly when one considers that those who caused the economic crisis, namely, those who engaged in speculation and profiteering in the property market and irresponsible bankers, have left the country to shoulder a massive financial burden.  The price being demanded is being put on the shoulders of women and children, which is absolute madness.We must take a step back.  The groups campaigning against this Bill have done us a great service by isolating the shift in policy to which this is leading.  The group is Seven is too Young! , and the group does not argue this wilfully.  The argument is well founded in international research taking in areas like the United States, where similar legislation has been introduced and the impact of that shift has been devastating to poorer women and their children.  We saw very good articles in the newspapers last week signed by leading academics, quoting international research, which indicates that leaving people in a position with no proper child care support means low-income one-parent families are left with the option of either living with children in poverty or taking up very low-paid work and neglecting young children at home.  The problems caused by this for society in the long run are almost unquantifiable.  It is truly anti-family and anti-women, and this is exemplified in the level of deprivation that already exists.Previous all-party Oireachtas committees dealing with such issues have argued that there should be no reform of social welfare policy until child care and other supports are in place, which has not happened yet.  The idea of pushing lone parents into non-existent training schemes for jobs that are not there - forcing them to abandon children at home when they reach seven years old - is absolutely ridiculous.  Even at this late hour I appeal to the Minister to abandon the process, as it is very narrow-minded and will cause significant problems for lone parents.  It is completely the wrong way to deal with the economic crisis, as we should be implementing more support rather than less.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	635	I am delighted to be able to comment tonight on the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2012 and I wish the Minister well on her first year in office.  I worked with her in committee for the four years of the previous Government and it is a significant change for her to go from Opposition spokesperson to Minister.  She has reformed some aspects of the Department, and she has a certain understanding of these issues as she is a woman and was in opposition for so many years.  I thank her for the effort being made on certain new schemes and some bold measures she is taking on.  I ask her to stand up for herself and not be afraid of Fine Gael attacks from the likes of Deputy Charles Flanagan, who mentioned that she must have a death wish for the Government.  I know she has no death wish and wants to get her policies implemented.  I know she has some very good officials working hard in the Department.  I do not know why the Acting Chairman finds that funny as he is from south Tipperary as well.The Minister has a very complex Department with a significant budget.  There are pressures arising from the representatives of the troika being in town today but the Department needs a root and branch review.  There should be an evaluation of where funds are going.  We have seen headlines in the newspapers regarding social welfare fraud, and there is some, but I would love to know its extent.  It is easy to say it is there but we can compare that fraud with the blackguarding and criminality that was evident in banks and institutions of the State.  Nobody has been arraigned or brought before any court arising from those actions.  There is no sign of it either and I know how frustrated the Minister and her colleague, Deputy Rabbitte, are about that.  I was frustrated with the last Government in that respect also.  The issue sticks in the craw of people, as certain individuals seem to be able to laugh all the way to the bank; they are laughing from inside the banks and abroad as well.  We can only consider how people are pursued for social welfare fraud from such a perspective, and it is very hard for people to stomach it.  The problem must be tackled with an eye to fairness, equity and respect, and I wish the Minister well in that regard.I urge caution, particularly with regard to community employment, CE, schemes, of which I am a passionate supporter.  I know the Minister did her best in Cabinet to fight off the attacks on such schemes but although she promised a review, it is not happening.  We are still in the wilderness and facing a 66% cut in training budgets.  We cannot survive that.  I have said privately and publicly that we could survive with half the funding and we would take a 30% cut.  We cannot take a 66% cut as volunteer bodies cannot afford to keep going.  They cannot keep the doors open, paying insurance and everything else, with that cut.I seek progress on the issue of PRSI for the self-employed.  We need those people to stay in business, although many have already gone out of business.  We have heard bad stories of people left with bad tastes left in their mouths because they paid PRSI, taxes and VAT in good times while looking after their staff, which most people involved in small businesses do.  They work very close and have tight-knit operations.  When everything went belly-up, everybody got some support except those people who created jobs; these are the innovators, the shakers and the makers and without them we will not be able to revive the country.  We must consider this issue seriously.  Those people will pay into a system to provide for a rainy day and would have had to do so anyway.  They have now lost whatever pensions or savings they had and have been left penniless and destitute.  Banks, the Revenue Commissioners and sheriffs are persecuting them, which is deplorable.  We must examine the matter.  We have a new poor, and the people I described comprise it, along with small farmers and others.Rent supplement must be reconsidered, and local authorities which provide housing would be more in touch with that issue.  The system is widely abused and we saw for years that when the payment was increased, rents were also increased.  People are now being told to negotiate rents with landlords, which is fair enough, although it is not easy if the money is not there.  Sometimes it cannot be done and some landlords may tell a tenant to get lost or demand that the balance be paid in cash out of meagre social welfare payments.  There is fraud ongoing in that respect.  Some of these people are not easy to handle or deal with as they are above and beyond ordinary people, who may be nervous and intimidated because they may be moved from their house and not have a home for their children.I have already mentioned how the pension funds seem to be raided for everything.  I know the National Pensions Reserve Fund was seriously raided for the so-called bailout, which was more of a clean-out at the time.  I was told this morning there was a statement on Tipperary radio that we would raid the pension fund in order to fit water meters but I was told that Siemens offered to fit those meters free 18 months or two years ago.  I am not saying there are any free lunches and nor would I expect any but I would like a thorough evaluation of how we can gain value for money with a competitive process for people fitting those meters.  A sister-in-law of mine was on the television news tonight in connection with a story about a group scheme in Monaghan, where meters were bought for €60 and fitted for €100.  How can we be told the cost will be closer to €400?

I will debate the issue with the Acting Chairman any time and on any radio station.  We must be very careful about the pension fund, which was hard-earned and is there for the rainy day.  It should not be whittled away and repaid over the next 20 years.We must look again at the cut to lone parents and I support the Seven is too Young! campaign.  I compliment the Minister on the JobBridge scheme and I thank her for meeting representatives of Muintir na Tíre on Friday.  There is much scope to support community groups through unemployed people who want to give their time to such organisations.  We are only talking about €50 extra per week but these people want to give of their time and use the valuable knowledge they have gained through degrees and diplomas.  It is a good scheme that must be expanded.There should be caution exercised on the sick pay issue with regard to private employers.  Such people are fading like the snow from the ditch in winter and we must support and reinvigorate their efforts.  We cannot be too harsh on them, as we are at present.  I am referring not to this Department in particular but to several others; for example, a transport Bill was introduced in the Seanad today with another punitive set of measures dreamed up by a former Minister, Noel Dempsey, in his prime.  That Bill should be shredded because business owners will not be able to afford new punitive taxes and levies on lorries.  Road hauliers provide valuable employment but they are on their knees.  Agricultural contractors are struggling and banks are removing their overdrafts so they cannot get the credit to run their operations.  These people may have temporary employees for summer work, like the tourist industry, and they will not be able to afford the sick pay scheme.  I am not arguing that sick people should not be looked after but we cannot go from cover for two or three days to cover for four weeks.  It is not possible.The Chairman is looking at me intently so my time must be nearly up.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	640	In relation to publication, the Taoiseach has given a commitment that legislative measures associated with the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union (Stability Treaty) will be made publicly available in advance of the referendum. While a decision has yet to be taken on the publication date for the ESM Treaty ratification Bill it will be consistent with this commitment.The European Stability Mechanism (ESM) Treaty was signed by all Euro Area Member States on 2 February, subject to ratification. It provides "that the granting of financial assistance in the framework of new programmes under the ESM will be conditional, as of 1 March 2013, on the ratification of the Stability Treaty by the ESM Member concerned" and on implementation of the balanced budget rule as specified in the Stability Treaty within the agreed timeline (one year after entry into force of the latter).This reflects the outcome of discussions in which Ireland participated actively and constructively.  The linkage between the ESM and Stability Treaty ratification was accepted in the interests of securing agreement on the ESM and its acceleration into force by July 2012. In the negotiations, the Government sought to ensure that it was made clear that the link between ratification of the Stability Treaty and the ESM Treaty applied only to new applications for assistance under the ESM, and that it will not affect the transfer to the ESM of undisbursed amounts under the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) for Ireland and other programme countries. The Government also sought to ensure that sufficient time was provided for ratification of the Stability Treaty before the link enters into effect.While the Government did not actively seek to include the link between the two Treaties, it did suggest that before creating any such link that careful consideration be given to any possible market implications. However, it is entirely logical and reasonable that a country receiving the support of its partners under the ESM should be prepared to run sensible budgetary policies as required under the new Treaty.

On that basis, the reply which was provided on the 28 February 2012 is set out below:    I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the information requested, estimated by reference to the income tax year 2011, is set out in the following table:Range of Gross IncomeNumbers€30,001 —€49,999498,261€50,000 —€70,000231,794€70,001 —€100,000148,428€100,001 —€150,00070,892€150,001 —€200,00018,656Over €200,00021,506It should be noted that the income ranges shown in the above table relate to Gross Income as defined in Revenue Statistical Report 2009.The figures are estimates from the Revenue tax-forecasting model using actual data for the year 2009 adjusted as necessary for income and employment trends in the interim. These are, therefore, provisional and likely to be revised.It should be noted that a married couple who has elected or has been deemed to have elected for joint assessment is counted as one tax unit.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	642	The Central Bank indicated in October 2011 that IBRC should not increase its usage of financing arrangements provided under open market operations with the ECB. At the end of 2011, IBRC had €2.1 billion borrowed under open market operations from the ECB. Furthermore the bank had €40.1 bn of Emergency Liquidity Assistance from the Irish Central Bank. The provision of this ELA by the Central Bank of Ireland to IBRC is subject to the on-going non-objection of a majority of the ECB's governing council. It is therefore clear that IBRC remains eligible to enter into financing arrangements with the Central Bank and Eurosystem.The ECB expressed a preference that IBRC would finance the bond in the market with a bank that was not in majority State ownership. Accordingly, IBRC and the State approached Bank of Ireland and proposed that Bank of Ireland enter into a repurchase agreement in respect of the Government bonds issued as settlement for the 2012 promissory note instalment. After negotiations and having carefully considered the commercial benefits and risks associated with the transaction, Bank of Ireland agreed, subject to stockholder approval, the key terms of the transaction.The transaction can be financed by Bank of Ireland, through standard ECB money market operations using the Government bonds issued which are Eurosystem eligible.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	643	The Commission on Credit Unions submitted its Report to me on schedule on the 31 March 2012.  The Report was presented to Government yesterday and it was published this morning.I welcome the Report and commend the Commission for its professional approach to the review of the sector. The agreement of all Commission participants to recommendations on issues such as restructuring and a strengthened regulatory framework for credit unions is a very positive outcome.The Report of the Commission is a substantial document with recommendations on a broad range of issues.  It begins by setting out the key features of credit unions in Ireland, their history and development.  It then examines the financial position of the sector and considers findings from a survey of credit unions, a public consultation and a separate efficiency study of the sector.  It provides an overview of alternative financial co-operative models in various countries across Europe and North America and it considers future models for credit unions in Ireland.  The Report incorporates the recommendations of the Commission's Interim Report, published in October 2011, with regard to deposit protection, resolution, stabilisation, restructuring and liquidity and initial recommendations on legislation, regulation and governance.The key additional recommendations in the Report are in relation to sector restructuring, the details of the proposed new legislative and regulatory framework, and new governance requirements for credit unions.I will now examine the Report in detail and will be informed by its recommendations in the preparation of reformed credit union legislation for publication by the end of June.The Deputy refers to Parliamentary Question No. 157 of 28 February 2012 where he asked if I might consider introducing a legal framework whereby credit unions, who are unhappy with lending restrictions imposed on them by the Registrar of Credit Unions, have access to an appeals mechanism.  I indicated in my response at that time that I had asked the Commission on Credit Unions to consider if there is a need for an appropriate appeals mechanism for regulatory directions under the Credit Union Act 1997.The Commission has recommended that regulatory directions issued by the Central Bank under Section 87 of the Credit Union Act 1997 should be appealable to the Irish Financial Services Appeals Tribunal.  I will consider this recommendation in the context of the forthcoming credit union legislation.

In the light of recent developments on redundancies issues I am presently considering how best to progress the review.  I also indicated that I would not consider it appropriate to publish incomplete interim data at this stage.As I have stated previously, I fully recognise that there is a real public interest in the levels of remuneration at the covered institutions and have committed to placing the details underpinning the review into the public domain.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	645	Tax revenue returned to growth in 2011 for the first time since 2007 and excluding some technical adjustments that have positively impacted on tax revenues, taxes are up an estimated €758 million (10.1%) year-on-year and are €351 million (4.4%) ahead of profile in the first quarter of 2012. It is encouraging to see that income tax is running marginally ahead of profile. The tax figures for Quarter 1 2012 show a good start to the year and highlight the robust nature of the Budget 2012 tax forecasts. A number of new measures were introduced in Budget 2012 including the VAT measures and the removal of over 330,000 from the charge to the USC. Given these policy changes and the continued economic uncertainty, the solid performance of VAT and Income Tax is welcome, particularly when no income tax increases were introduced in Budget 2012.As regards possible explanations for income tax running ahead of profile, the latest available employment data from the Quarterly National Household Survey relating to Q4 2011 showed that employment increased marginally between Q3 2011 and Q4 2011 — the first time a quarterly increase in employment was observed since 2007. While this is encouraging, it is too early to draw conclusions and I will wait on further data to inform my views regarding developments in the labour market. Furthermore, the latest earnings data, also relating to Q4 2011, showed that weekly earnings fell by 1½% year-on-year.While there are signs of improvement in the labour market, we are all too aware that there is a long way to go to reduce our unacceptably high unemployment rate and provide jobs for our people. The Jobs Initiative and subsequent Action Plan for Jobs demonstrate this Government's commitment to our goal of delivering sustainable employment growth.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	646	There are significant advantages to the settlement of the March 2012 promissory note installment with the new Government bond including:This payment was included in our debt repayment schedule for 2012 and this proposal removes the requirement for the exchequer to settle in cash, the €3.06 billion promissory note installment.There is a significant cash flow benefit to the Exchequer in 2012 and our long term debt sustainability is enhanced.This will have an approximate €90m impact on the general government deficit in 2012 which is small relative to the overall benefit of the removal of the requirement for the Exchequer to settle €3.06 billion in cash.The €3.06 billion of Programme funding that would otherwise have been used to make the promissory note payment should potentially allow greater flexibility around when and at what level Ireland returns to the capital markets. However, our thinking on the timing of that return to the markets remains unchanged as a result of this transaction.As noted by the Governor of the Central Bank in his appearance before the Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform Committee: "There is a very definitive gain in debt sustainability. The net effect of this transaction is to reduce the economic cost for the State as a whole of refinancing this payment."While this development in relation to the end March payment is a positive development we must keep our eye on the greater benefits which would derive from the re-engineering of the promissory note and also the potential improvements for the continuing banking sector which could also stem from the ongoing technical discussions.It is for these reasons that we must look at the recent developments as what would be an initial step to facilitate a project where, if we are successful, it will be in the medium term rather than immediately. These discussions will continue and the Government is focused on developing an alternative solution to the promissory note arrangement in IBRC. The ongoing discussions may also explore options to refinance the long term Government bond issued in settlement of the March 31 payment.  We all want to arrive at a successful conclusion that is in the interests of Ireland and the EU.

This is an issue of the utmost concern and the Government is taking a number of significant measures to address the problem.However, the vast majority of homeowners wish and continue to meet their mortgage obligations and it is important to maintain, as far as possible, that situation.  The approach of Government to the mortgage arrears problem has been clear and it is that those mortgage holders who can meet their obligations should do so and that appropriate assistance should be afforded only to those mortgage holders, or other borrowers, who are experiencing real and genuine difficulty in meeting their commitments.  The measures being implemented to assist mortgage holders in difficulty include personal insolvency reform, the implementation of the "mortgage to rent" initiative, direct engagement with individual mortgage lenders on their mortgage arrears resolution strategies and the development by lenders of realistic options for their customers that are experiencing mortgage difficulty and the provision of a mortgage advisory function.The recent IMF World Economic Outlook report, and its chapter on household debt, is a very useful contribution to the range of measures being considered to address the global economic situation.  However, it should be noted that the examples examined in the report in the chapter dealing with household debt related to particular countries and times, and that some of the debt restructuring examples investigated were more successful than others.  The particular circumstances of each individual case, therefore, was a relevant factor in the outcome of the action.  Therefore, while one should seek to learn from previous examples, it is also important to exercise caution in drawing general conclusions from the report and applying them to the current Irish economic position.  Indeed, in their public comments on the report, the IMF staff indicated that they were not stating that such a blanket approach should be taken in the case of Ireland and indeed indicated that, in cases of constrained fiscal space, which unfortunately is the position Ireland currently faces, that a targeted case by case debt restructuring approach may be the most appropriate approach.  This case by case approach is consistent with the recommendations of the "Keane Report" on which the Government approach to address this problem is broadly based.  The current funding situation of the Irish fiscal and banking sectors are also relevant factors to be borne in mind.  Ireland is maintaining close contact with the IMF, and the other Troika authorities, in the development of its personal insolvency reform proposals and also on the wider approach to tackle mortgage arrears problem, and will take full account of their views in the further development and implementation of these proposals.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	648	Settlement of the 2012 Promissory Note instalment to IBRC with a Government bond was not completed by end-March for the purposes of the Exchequer Statement. The end-March Exchequer Statement recorded activity up to and including the last working day of the month which was Friday 30th March.Under the terms of the Promissory Notes, as the due date for payment of 31st March fell on a Saturday, the settlement date fell into April. This improved significantly the Exchequer position at end-March relative to the same period in 2011.The Government bond that was issued to settle the 2012 Promissory Note payment to IBRC will be reflected in the end-April 2012 Exchequer Statement which must align with what will be recorded in the statutory Finance Accounts for 2012. While the precise details of how to reflect the transaction are presently being examined, the important point is that settlement of the payment with a Government bond means that the State did not have to make a cash payment in respect of the 2012 Promissory Note payment to IBRC.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	649	As a result of the March 2011 PCAR Irish Life and Permanent plc. t/a Permanent TSB ("PTSB") was required to raise total additional capital of €4 billion. In July 2011 €2.3 billion of this requirement was injected by way of a placing of shares to the Minister for Finance, leaving the Minister with his current holding of 99.24%. At this time a further €400 million was also injected into the company in return for a Contingent Capital note bringing the total State contribution to €2.7 billion. In addition the company also raised €0.2bn from internal capital raising measures. While the company also completed a liability management exercise which generated additional core tier 1 capital this did not improve the bank's overall capital position due to the existing capital treatment of its investment in the subsidiary Life Company. After all of these actions the remaining capital requirement for the company is €1.3bn.    It was intended that the remaining capital requirement would be satisfied on completion of a successful disposal of Irish Life, with any shortfall provided by the State if that arose. The sale of Irish Life was suspended on 25th November 2011 due to the extreme levels of volatility being experienced in the eurozone at that time.Following the suspension of this sale process, we have decided that a government purchase of Irish Life is the most effective mechanism to finalise the recapitalisation of the company by 30 June 2012 in line with the commitment in the Memorandum of Understanding with the Troika. The High Court issued a Direction Order on 28th March 2012 allowing me to purchase Irish Life from Irish Life and Permanent Group for a total consideration of €1.3 billion. The Direction Order is not yet effective due to the receipt of a number of applications to have the Order set aside but I will be strongly defending these challenges and am hopeful that the acquisition will be completed before 30 June 2012.The company is a valuable asset for the State and will continue to be managed on an independent commercial basis to ensure that value, and we will continue to work to dispose of it as soon as market conditions permit.It is my intention to use the powers available to me under the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act 2008 to acquire Irish Life and complete the recapitalisation of PTSB. The 2008 Act is an act to ‘provide for' financial support by the Minister in respect of certain credit institutions of which Irish Life and Permanent Group Holdings is one.   Section 6 of the 2008 Act permits me to provide financial support (whether directly or indirectly) to those credit institutions up to June 2017.

These measures include the new temporary reduced rate of VAT of 9%, aimed primarily at the tourism sector, the halving of the lower rate of employers PRSI and small additional amounts of current and capital expenditure. The levy raised €463 million of its targeted €470 million in 2011 for the purposes outlined and has, therefore, very largely achieved its funding purpose for that year. I believe the pension fund levy is operating effectively. However,  in common with other tax measures, its operation will be reviewed by me in the context of next year’s Budget and Finance Bill.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	651	My Department is currently updating its macroeconomic and fiscal assessment for the forthcoming Stability Programme Update (SPU). The SPU will give an update of, amongst other things, the General Government deficit estimate for 2012, taking account of all of the latest available economic and fiscal data, both positive and negative. The SPU will be published at the end of the month.  On foot of the Exchequer Returns for the first quarter of the year, I am confident that we will meet our budgetary targets for the year.The end-March Returns show that taxes have made a good start to the year, performing better than expected in the first quarter and close to 4½ per cent ahead of profile on an underlying basis. While voted expenditure showed some pressures, I am confident that it will be actively managed within agreed limits and I know that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform will be stressing upon colleagues the importance of adhering to the 2012 spending targets, as was done in 2011. It is worth noting also that the end-March Returns show that Exchequer debt servicing expenditure in the first quarter of the year was €70 million less than profiled.The Government has repeatedly stated its absolute commitment to adhering to the 8.6 per cent of GDP General Government deficit target for 2012.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	652	The imposition of lending restrictions is the responsibility of the Registrar of Credit Unions, who is the independent regulator for credit unions.  Within his independent regulatory discretion, the Registrar acts to support the prudential soundness of individual credit unions, to maintain sector stability and to protect the savings of credit union members.As Minister for Finance, my role is to ensure that the legal framework for credit unions is appropriate for the effective operation and supervision of credit unions.  It would not be appropriate for me, as Minister for Finance, to comment on the placing or removing of lending restrictions.  I believe that such action would represent interference in the work of the independent regulator.The Registrar of Credit Unions advises me that in order to protect the savings of members in credit unions and ensure that credit unions focus on such risks when making lending decisions, lending restrictions have been placed on a number of credit unions as their financial position has deteriorated. The individual credit union lending restrictions currently in place are reviewed on a regular basis and if a credit union can demonstrate an improved financial position then such restrictions can be eased.  The number of restrictions eased following such review is small which reflects the significant challenges in the sector.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	653	The Irish banks have been recapitalised to meet the requirements of the Central Bank of Ireland's 2011 Financial Measures Programme, which incorporated a 3 year stress test to 2013, and was among the most thorough and demanding such tests ever performed in Ireland or indeed anywhere.  The  Central Bank's 2011 stress test was fully endorsed by our external partners that the loan loss assumptions made reflected a high degree of conservatism and underpinned the robustness and credibility of the exercise overall.   Any investment by the NPRF in Irish banks is made on foot of a Ministerial direction.  No such directions have been provided to the NPRF since the recapitalisations of AIB and Bank of Ireland that were completed in July 2011.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	654	I am informed by the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) that the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed between the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) and CIC International, a subsidiary of China Investment Corporation, China's sovereign wealth fund, provides that the parties will seek to work together in exploring investment opportunities in Ireland. The MOU builds on the existing dialogue between the NTMA and CIC International, and provides a framework for future co-operation in terms of exchanging information and identifying suitable investment or co-investment opportunities for CIC in Ireland.The NTMA believes the MOU represents a major initiative for enhanced co-operation and engagement in areas of common interest. CIC International is a financial investor and seeks stable and sound financial returns over the long run. It believes the MOU will be of valuable assistance to it in identifying and assessing potential opportunities in Ireland.

However, the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union will come into force on 1 January 2013, provided that twelve Contracting Parties whose currency is the Euro have deposited their instrument of ratification, or on the first day of the month following the deposit of the twelfth instrument of ratification by a Contracting Party whose currency is the Euro, whichever is the earlier.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	656	Last year, the Government established a Fiscal Advisory Council which is to report periodically on the fiscal position. In that context, I welcome the recent publication of the Council's second Fiscal Assessment Report.   I note the Council's warning that a further €400 million in consolidation measures may be necessary to meet the 8.6 per cent of GDP General Government deficit target this year.It is of course extremely important that we adhere to the deficit targets which have been set and that we restore sustainability to the public finances as soon as possible. In this context, Government will take the views of the Council into consideration.On the other hand, I am very conscious of the impact that a larger adjustment could have on economic activity. In striving to restore sustainability to the public finances, we must also be mindful of protecting the emerging economic recovery and seek to strike the right balance between the two. This balancing act is difficult.In relation to the need for more consolidation this year to meet our Budget targets, I don't believe that this will be necessary based on the first quarter Exchequer Returns.The Returns show that taxes have made a good start to the year, performing better than expected in the first quarter. While voted expenditure showed some pressures, I am confident that it will be actively managed within agreed limits and I know that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform will be stressing upon colleagues the importance of adhering to the 2012 spending targets, as was done in 2011.We will of course continue to closely monitor all economic and fiscal developments and will take the measures necessary to meet our targets.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	657	I propose to take Questions Nos. 32, 229, 230 and 258 to 260, inclusive, together.The latest data from the Central Bank indicates that at the end of December 2011 there were around 769,000 residential mortgage loan accounts in the State and that, of these, around 70,900 were at least 91 days in arrears.  I am informed by the Central Bank that it does not provide a county breakdown of those accounts in arrearsWhile the vast majority of homeowners continue to meet their mortgage commitments, the Government is fully aware of the increasing stress that some homeowners are facing arising from difficulties in meeting their mortgage commitments.  This is an issue of the utmost importance for the Government.  A Government subcommittee, chaired by An Taoiseach and including all relevant Ministers, has been established to ensure that a high priority is assigned to this important issue.  At official level, this work is being progressed by a high level Steering Group.  The key task of this group, which is chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and which also includes senior officials from the other relevant Government Departments and the Central Bank, is to coordinate the implementation of the various recommendations of the "Keane Report" as approved by Government.  Significant progress has been made on this.  The Department of Justice and Equality has published a general scheme of a Personal Insolvency Bill.  A significant number of contributions have been received on the general scheme, including recommendations and a detailed report from the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality arising from its hearings on the Scheme, and these will be considered by Government as it finalises the Bill.  On the "mortgage to rent" initiative, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government has been working on the development and implementation of a pilot scheme with AIB and Cluid and a number of cases are now being processed.  There has also been significant Central Bank engagement with individual mortgage lenders on their mortgage arrears resolution strategies.  These initial plans were received towards the end of 2011 and since then they have been the subject of detailed contact between the Central Bank and banks.  The Central Bank has now set out some key deliverables and dates for specific actions it wishes banks to undertake, including a requirement for banks to approve the resolution options they will make available and the provision of greater information on the level of their unsustainable mortgages.  On the provision of a mortgage advisory function, the Department of Social Protection is working with the relevant agencies within its remit and detailed consideration is now underway on the most appropriate and efficient mechanism for the delivery of this service having regard to the other financial, budgeting and public service information and advice mechanisms already in place and proposedIn addition to the above, the Central Bank's revised Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears remains a key framework to govern the relationship between lenders and borrowers who are in arrears, or facing arrears, on their mortgage and this continues to provide very important and much needed protections.  These include a restriction on the imposition of charges and/or surcharge interest by lenders on a mortgage account in arrears to which the Code applies and in respect of which the borrower is co-operating reasonably and honestly with the lender.  In this regard the Central Bank has published a useful guide for consumers on mortgage arrears "Mortgage Arrears — A Consumer Guide to Dealing with your Lender" and this is available on the Central Bank website.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	658	Regarding the situation in Greece and Portugal, their public funding needs are being met through loans from their EU partners and the IMF.  As part of this external funding, both countries have agreed to a consolidation strategy to correct their excessive deficits within a pre-determined timeframe.   I am conscious of the decline in market sentiment towards Spain in recent weeks.  However, I am encouraged by the fact that the new Spanish government is committed to correcting its excessive deficit by next year, and my Eurogroup colleagues and I have noted the recent fiscal consolidation measures that are being implemented in order to achieve this.  In addition, it is worth pointing out the reforms — notably in the labour market — that are being introduced; so the authorities are being pro-active in addressing the situation.In terms of the euro area as a whole, my view is that all Member States must stay on the agreed path.  We must continue to implement the ‘five-point' strategy agreed last year — involving inter alia   addressing difficulties in the European banking system and enhancing governance — so that we continue to build on the momentum that has become evident in the first quarter of this year.Finally, in relation to Irish Government bonds, longer term yields remain (as per mid-April) at just under 7 per cent, which is a substantial decline from the peak of around 14 per cent in July last year.  The improvement in market sentiment towards Ireland reflects the substantial progress that is being made.  Specifically in terms of our Programme, we have met all our targets and we have also seen the economy returning to growth and an increase in tax revenues.  Importantly, yields have not varied significantly in recent weeks, so while it is important not to be complacent, it is fair to say that confidence in Ireland is being maintained.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	659	The NAMA SPV, National Asset Management Agency Investment Limited (NAMAIL) was established to facilitate the participation of private investors in NAMA. 51 per cent of the shares of NAMAIL are held by three private investors, and as a consequence NAMAIL is classified as outside of government for the calculation of general government debt.As one of the private investors is Irish Life and as Irish Life is now in public ownership, Eurostat has made enquiries as to the ownership status of NAMAIL. My Department has been working closely with NAMA to find a solution which ensures that NAMAIL remains in private ownership and that NAMA is not included in the calculation of government debt. I cannot comment further at this stage as the details of this process are commercially sensitive.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	660	The Commission on Credit Unions submitted its Report to me on schedule on the 31 March 2012.  The Report was presented to Government yesterday and it was published this morning.I welcome the Report and commend the Commission for its professional approach to the review of the sector. The agreement of all Commission participants to recommendations on issues such as restructuring and a strengthened regulatory framework for credit unions is a very positive outcome.The Report of the Commission is a substantial document with recommendations on a broad range of issues.  It begins by setting out the key features of credit unions in Ireland, their history and development.  It then examines the financial position of the sector and considers findings from a survey of credit unions, a public consultation and a separate efficiency study of the sector.  It provides an overview of alternative financial co-operative models in various countries across Europe and North America and it considers future models for credit unions in Ireland.  The Report incorporates the recommendations of the Commission's Interim Report, published in October 2011, with regard to deposit protection, resolution, stabilisation, restructuring and liquidity and initial recommendations on legislation, regulation and governance.   The key additional recommendations in the Report are in relation to sector restructuring, the details of the proposed new legislative and regulatory framework, and new governance requirements for credit unions.I will now examine the Report in detail and will be informed by its recommendations in the preparation of reformed credit union legislation for publication by the end of June.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	661	The Deputy may be aware that a working group was set up between officials of my Department, the IRHA and some members of the Oireachtas.  This working group is discussing a number of issues of concern to the haulage industry.  I am sure the Deputy will understand that I cannot pre-empt the outcome of those discussions which are ongoing. I should point out that a fuel rebate system, as sought by the IRHA, could not under EU law be restricted to Irish licenced hauliers but would have to be extended to all vehicles intended exclusively for the carriage of goods by road with a maximum permissible gross laden weight of not less than 7.5 tonnes. In addition, the rebate would have to include the carriage of passengers by a motor vehicle of category M2 or category M3 as defined in Council Directive 70/156/EEC.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	662	The Credit Union Bill is due to be published by the end of June 2012.    The Commission on Credit Unions submitted its Final Report to me on 31 March 2012. The Report, which was published this morning, includes recommendations in relation to prudential requirements, governance, stabilisation, restructuring and amendments to the Credit Union Act 1997.  I will now examine the Report in detail and will be informed by its recommendations in the preparation of the credit union legislation.Among other things, the Commission has recommended that the new credit union legislative framework should provide the Central Bank with the power to make regulations that set prudential controls, limits, standards and requirements. The Commission has further recommended that, when making these regulations, the Central Bank should undertake a regulatory impact analysis which should involve full and meaningful consultation with credit union representative bodies as well as individual credit unions.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	663	The lending institutions in Ireland, including those in which the State has a significant shareholding, are independent commercial entities. It is not appropriate for me, as Minister for Finance, to comment on or become involved in the detailed mortgage position of  mortgage holders.The Central Bank has advised me that they have no role in interest rate setting; neither does the Central Bank regulate 'financial products'. However, given the high profile nature of the mortgage market in the current environment, all mortgage lenders have been requested to submit to the Central Bank all changes to their mortgage products in advance of offering such products to their customers.I welcome the positive move by one of the mortgage lenders to allow customers to transfer a tracker rate mortgage to another mortgage so as to facilitate moving home.In an examination of tracker mortgage switching practices, the Central Bank identified a number of concerns in relation to the level of disclosure and transparency when customers moved from tracker rate mortgages to other forms of mortgages.  The Central Bank subsequently included specific provisions in the revised Consumer Protection Code, which came into effect on 1 January 2012.Further details of the review and a press release on the examination of tracker mortgages is available on the Central Bank's website www.centralbank.ie.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	664	As the Deputy is aware the Government is committed to delivering a return to a successful vibrant economy. In this context I have indicated on a number of occasions that there is no private sector involvement for senior bank paper or Irish Sovereign debt without the agreement of our external partners. This commitment has been agreed with out external partners and is now the basis on which Ireland's future financing strategy is built. This strategy is working well as evidenced by the reduction in pricing of Irish Sovereign debt in the secondary markets and the successful bond exchange offer by the NTMA.As indicated the Government is committed to reviewing the approach to the Promissory notes with a view to reducing the overall cost to the State. The Troika have agreed to engage in a process with Irish Officials to produce a common paper which will consider all options for restructuring the notes in terms of the source of funding, the duration of the notes, the interest rate etc.While the development in relation to the end March Promissory Note payment is positive, we must continue to work towards the greater benefits which would derive from the re-engineering of the promissory note. There are potential improvements for the banking sector which could also stem from the ongoing technical discussions.It is for these reasons that we must look at the recent developments as an initial step in a process. This is a medium term project. The Government is focused on developing an alternative solution to the promissory note arrangement in IBRC. We want to arrive at a successful conclusion that is in the interests of Ireland and the EU.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	665	Firstly, I wish to inform the Deputy that the lending institutions in Ireland, including those in which the State has a significant shareholding, are independent commercial entities. In addition, the Central Bank is independent in the carrying out of its supervisory functions of regulated financial institutions. The Central Bank of Ireland issues mortgage arrears statistics every quarter which set out the mortgages arrears for the industry by number of accounts and balance in arrears.  The balance includes the value of the outstanding mortgages including arrears, accrued interest, and any unpaid customer fees and charges including legal costs, where such are added to the balance outstanding. I have been informed by the Central Bank that they do not have details of the figure in the arrears amount that is made up of compound interest and late payment penalties. Published statistics areavailable on the Central Bank website: http://www.centralbank.ie/press-area/press-releases/ Pages/ResidentialMortgageArrearsandRepossessionStatisticstoDecember2011.aspx
In July 2011, the Central Bank published the findings of a themed inspection of mortgage lenders which examined compliance with the requirement of the revised Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) specifically relating to charges on mortgage accounts in arrears, and the related "Letters of Direction" issued by the Central Bank.  These Letters of Direction instructed mortgage lenders to refrain from imposing interest surcharge on arrears and other specific charges arising on a mortgage account in arrears to which the revised CCMA applies, and in respect of which, a borrower is co-operating reasonably and honestly with the lender in the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process from 1 January 2011.  Provision 9 of the CCMA refers to the restriction from imposing such charges. Lenders have been notified individually of the charges to which this provision applies.Further details may be found at the following link: http://www.centralbank.ie/press-area/press-releases/Pages/CentralBankMonitorsLendersCompliancewiththeRevisedCode.aspx

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	666	As the Deputy is aware, a working group was set up between officials of my Department, the IRHA and some members of the Oireachtas to discuss a number of issues of concern to the haulage industry including the matter of fuel smuggling. As I am sure the Deputy will appreciate, I cannot pre-empt the outcome of the working group discussions which are still ongoing.  However, I am well aware that illegal activity in the form of diesel fuel laundering does pose a serious threat to the Exchequer. Fuel laundering involves large-scale removal of markers from rebated mineral oil, which is subject to a reduced rate of mineral oil tax on condition that it is not used in road vehicles.   This form of tax evasion is a matter the Revenue Commissioners and the Government take very seriously, particularly given the current economic climate.Revenue employs a broad range of compliance and enforcement strategies to detect and counteract illegal practices involving mineral oils. These include ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem; development and sharing of intelligence with agencies on both sides of the border; the conduct of intelligence driven operations using covert surveillance to identify oil laundry locations; seizure of illicit product, laundering equipment and vehicles; physical sampling at road checkpoints; closure of unlicensed or improperly licensed outlets and seizure of stock, and prosecution of those involved in illegal activities in relation to mineral oils.In 2010, Revenue enforcement staff detected four oil-laundering plants in this jurisdiction and seized 228,000 litres of laundered oil. In addition, nine retailers were found dealing in laundered oil and eight haulage companies were detected using it in their vehicles. There were four court convictions in 2010 for laundered oil offences.In 2011 nine oil laundries and 327,000 litres of laundered fuel were seized, together with nine oil tankers and twenty-nine other vehicles. Sixteen persons were arrested in the course of these operations and files have been sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions, who has to date issued directions to prosecute on indictment in respect of two of the cases.   In addition, a further 718,181 litres of illicit mineral oil has been seized, the large majority from retail outlets or in the course of delivery to such outletsRevenue is currently engaged in a vigorous campaign targeting specific locations nationwide, with the intention of immediate closure of unlicensed outlets and the challenging of other instances of non-compliance. As part of this drive, warning letters have been issued to unlicensed retail outlets and a number of these have been effectively closed down by the actions of Revenue enforcement teams. This campaign is ongoing and Revenue is in the process of seizing illicit product and closing down a further number of unlicensed or otherwise illegal retail outlets.Revenue is currently reviewing its enforcement options to ensure that its action against this illegal activity continues to be as effective as possible. The matters being addressed include the potential development of an enhanced fuel marker. In this regard, close liaison has been established with HM Revenue and Customs. Consideration is being given also, in the context of the forthcoming Finance Act, to possible changes in the law, particularly from the point of view of the control of the supply of oil, which would enhance the capacity to combat this illegality.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	667	The legislation necessary to facilitate the introduction of sovereign bonds/annuities was enacted in the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2010. Sovereign annuities can only be purchased by the trustees of occupational pension schemes (both defined benefit and defined contribution schemes) and such products must be certified by the Pensions Board as being suitable. Detailed guidelines setting out the certification conditions required for these products have been prepared and published by the Pensions Board.The introduction of sovereign bonds will broaden the range of options available to pension scheme trustees to ensure the future solvency of pension schemes for all scheme members by providing scheme trustees with a choice to match their scheme liabilities against any certified European annuity and put pension schemes on a more secure footing.   It is expected that this will relieve some of the current funding difficulties of defined benefit schemes and may also encourage pension trustees to move some of their assets from equities to bonds which would be welcome as part of a prudent and de-risking investment policy direction.The NTMA informs me that it has reached agreement with the pensions industry — the pension funds and the insurance companies who sell annuities to them — on the structure of a new type of bond which will facilitate the creation of long term annuities based on the Irish Government bond yield curve. The new structure is for amortising bonds with maturities potentially ranging from 15 to 40 years which pay the investor an equal amount each year over the life of the bond rather than the usual annual interest (or coupon) payment followed by the repayment of principal at maturity. The NTMA stands ready to provide these bonds to the pensions industry as soon as the industry is in a position to invest in them and the products that the industry proposes to offer are certified by the Pensions Board.On 5 April 2012 the Minister for Social Protection published new draft legislation, the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2012, which provides for the introduction of a risk reserve into the funding standard for pension funds. The Minister for Social Protection stated: “The Funding Standard, which has been in abeyance for some time will be restored initially and will provide an allowance for the purchase of sovereign annuities and bonds. The requirement to provide for a risk reserve will take effect from 1 January 2016.”   The NTMA expects that the restoration of the funding standard following the enactment of the legislation will create the conditions in which the trustees of pension schemes will actively consider the option of investing a certain amount of their funds in Irish Government bonds, including the new amortising bonds, and in sovereign annuities based on those bonds.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	668	At Budget time, the Government carefully considered the various options open to it in terms of taxation. One of the key objectives of the Government is to get people back to work. The VAT rate change was implemented in order to deliver additional revenues for the Exchequer, as must be done if we are to continue to reduce the deficit in our public finances. Government also recognised however that indirect taxes have a less adverse impact on economic activity and employment, which is why Budget 2012 focused on indirect taxes, such as VAT, rather than on income tax.Notwithstanding that the VAT rate change implemented in the Budget was estimated to deliver an additional €560 million in revenues in 2012 in static terms, the Budget 2012 forecast for VAT receipts, at €9,995 million, represented just a €254 million or 2.6 per cent increase on the 2011 outturn. This is because the imposition of a budgetary adjustment package, of which the VAT rate change is one element, has negative economic implications in the short-run. It takes money out of the economy.The VAT rate change and indeed other factors such as uncertainty and balance sheet rebuilding are expected to impact on household spending with consequential negative implications for tax receipts. This is the negative economic buoyancy from the imposition of consolidation.At the end of March €3,291 million in Exchequer VAT receipts had been collected, a €182 million or 5.8 per cent increase on the same period last year. This is a solid start to the year in terms of VAT collection but we must acknowledge that March is the first month to reflect the direct impact of the VAT rate increase. This is because receipts paid to the Exchequer in January and February related primarily to activity in the November/December 2011 trading period, when the rate increase was not in place. That said, it is the case that VAT receipts in the month of March alone were €152 million higher than in March 2011.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	669	As part of the ongoing surveillance of fiscal policies within the EU, a harmonised approach to determining the structural balance has been developed between the Member States and the EU Commission.  Using this harmonised methodology Member States are required to present point estimates of the structural balance for the forecast period in their Stability Programme Updates.  It is on that basis that my Department has in the past published these technical figures, based on its assessment of the headline deficit and the macro-economic situation.   The methodology is somewhat complicated, but in general terms involves decomposing the government balance into its cyclical and structural components.  Under this approach, the cyclical component of the headline balance is generated from estimates of the economy's position in the cycle — the so-called output gap — together with estimates of the sensitivity of the public finances to the economic cycle.  This cyclical component is then netted from the headline balance in order to arrive at the structural balance.More details, including the econometric equations used to calculate the output gap, are available on the website of the European Commission's Directorate General for Economic and Financial Affairs.Finally, it is worth stressing that there are health warnings to all estimates of the structural balance, especially for a small, open economy such as Ireland where large structural changes have occurred in recent years.  It is also the case that under the harmonised approach, not sufficient recognition is given to the particular unique features of our economy.  Some of the problems associated with the harmonised approach have been outlined by my Department in the various Stability Programme Updates that have been published in recent years.

Ultimately the pricing of financial products, including standard variable mortgage interest rates, is a commercial decision for the management team and board of each bank, having due regard to their customers and the impact on profitability, particularly where the cost of funding to each bank, including deposit pricing, is under pressure.Neither the Central Bank nor the Department of Finance has a statutory function in relation to interest rate decisions made by individual lending institutions at any particular time. However, I can confirm to that PTSB did pass on, in full, the ECB rate reductions announced in late 2011 to customers holding standard variable rate (SVR) mortgages and also reduced further their LTV standard variable rates to align them with the SVR.As part of the recent Memorandum of Understanding ("MOU") dated 10 February 2012 with our External Partners, it was agreed that the authorities will make a decision on the proposed way ahead for the company by the end of April 2012. Much work has been completed by the new management in PTSB and officials in my Department to develop this strategy for discussion with the Troika over the course of the on-going April review mission. As you would expect the strategy will consider all aspects of PTSB's current and future approach to its business. It would be premature for me to discuss possible outcomes of those discussions at the present time.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	673	The Insurance Compensation Fund (ICF) operates under the Insurance Act 1964. Its purpose is to protect policy holders in the event of their insurer becoming insolvent. It is an industry financed fund. However because the scheme is not pre-funded, the Act provides for the Exchequer to advance monies on the recommendation of the Central Bank  in circumstances where insufficient funds have been generated by an industry levy to cover a large demand.Under the Insurance Act 1964 the responsibility for deciding whether the ICF has sufficient funds available to it to at any particular time is a matter for the Central Bank. Where in the  Bank's opinion the state of the Fund is such that financial support should be provided for it, it determines an appropriate contribution to be paid to it by each insurer calculated as a percentage, not exceeding 2% of the aggregate of the gross premiums paid to that insurer in respect of policies issued in respect of risks in the State. On the basis of its assessment of the Fund late last year the Central Bank concluded that a levy should be applied to industry with effect from 1 January 2012 under section 6 of the Insurance Act 1964.  It is expected that this levy will raise in the region of 65m euro a year.Where there is likely to be a shortfall in the ICF, the Bank has the power to recommend to me that I advance monies to the Fund to enable payments out of it to be made expeditiously. Any advance made by me will be recouped over time from the Fund.In the case of Quinn Insurance Ltd the Central Bank made such a recommendation, and as a consequence 696m euro has been advanced by me to the Fund. A further 33m euro will be advanced at the beginning of June.It is expected that the ICF will start repaying the Exchequer in 2014 when the levy begins to accumulate. This will continue until the Exchequer advance has been repaid. It should be noted that a commercial rate of interest applies to the Exchequer advances.

These forecasts turned out to be broadly in line with the preliminary figures for 2011 provided in the latest Quarterly National Accounts published last month. The recent Q1 Exchequer Returns illustrate that tax receipts are in line with expectations.  This demonstrates the robustness of the Budget day forecasts and provides assurance that we are on course to meet 2012 and 2013 targets.The latest available employment data is from the Quarterly National Household Survey relating to Q4 2011. This showed that employment increased marginally between Q3 2011 and Q4 2011 — the first time a quarterly increase in employment was observed since 2007. While this is encouraging, it is too early to draw conclusions and I will wait on further data to inform my views regarding developments in the labour market.As is required by all Member States, Ireland will be providing a Stability Programme Update (SPU) to the European Commission by the end of April. As part of this process, my Department is reassessing the macroeconomic and fiscal outlook which takes into account all the latest available information. This re-evaluation will be contained in the SPU.

They are among the poorest countries in the world, both ranked in the bottom 10% in the 2011 United Nations Human Development Index.Irish Aid has been working in Uganda since 1994 and has made a significant contribution to the development and the fight against poverty and hunger.  Despite economic progress in recent years, Uganda remains an extremely poor country struggling with chronic poverty.  In 2010 and 2011, the budget for Ireland's bilateral aid programme to Uganda was €33.25 million annually. The programme targets priority areas such as the provision of health services for people living with HIV and AIDS, measures to improve access to education, and a programme that is helping to strengthen Governance and Justice Systems for the citizens of Uganda.  The strategy also addresses hunger and vulnerability in Karamoja, the most disadvantaged region of Uganda and a priority area for our bilateral support.Ireland's programme in Uganda has achieved important results across a range of sectors.  Irish Aid has, for example, strongly supported the national education programme which now has 8.3 million pupils in primary schools compared to 2.5 million in 1997. Irish Aid has also helped to rehabilitate and build eleven primary schools and two teacher training colleges in Karamoja.  With Ireland's support, the HIV/AIDS prevalence rate in Uganda has been cut to 6.4% compared to 18% in the 1990s and 150,000 people with HIV and AIDS in Uganda are now accessing life saving anti-retroviral drugs.In addition to funds provided through our bilateral programme in Uganda, Irish Aid support is also channelled through Irish NGOs and missionaries. In 2011, NGOs received over €6.2 million for long-term development work in Uganda, and almost €1 million was provided to missionaries for their work.Malawi was officially designated the ninth Programme Country for Ireland's aid programme in 2007.  The country suffered two major famines in the last decade and over half of the population live below the national poverty line.The focus of our programme in Malawi is on hunger and nutrition, and food security.  It concentrates on the needs of the poorest and most vulnerable communities. Support is provided for the improvement of crop productivity and sustainable farming practices, and to improve nutrition especially among women and children, enhance household resilience to the impacts of climate change and strengthen democratic accountability.Funding for the programme in Malawi amounted to €10.4 million in 2010 and €11.5 million in 2011.  In addition to this bilateral programme, Irish Aid provided €4.7 million in 2010 and  €3.7 million in 2011 to NGOs and missionary groups for their development work in Malawi.I visited Malawi in February and saw at first hand the contribution Ireland is making in improving the lives of the poorest and most vulnerable communities.  For instance, I saw that our support of the Malawi Farm Input Subsidy Programme has provided subsidised seeds and fertiliser to 1.4 million poor farmers.  This has resulted in the production of a significant national maize surplus in 2010 and 2011 and a dramatic reduction in the number of families who do not have enough food.  I also saw how Irish Aid's partnership with the NGO, Concern Universal, has helped 135,000 people in two districts to access nutritious food, reduce malaria and improve access to anti-retroviral treatment for HIV infection. I was pleased to see that this effective programme is now being successfully rolled out across other districts.It is important to note that in both Uganda and Malawi, Ireland uses defined instruments of support earmarked for specific development initiatives. The aid programmes are implemented in cooperation with a range of different partners including international and local NGOs, research institutions and Government bodies.  Irish Aid has rigorous planning, monitoring, evaluation and audit mechanisms in place. This ensures that all funds are spent effectively and are used for the purposes intended. Regular and robust audits are carried out by independent audit firms as well as by Irish Aid's Evaluation and Audit Unit, including internal auditors based in Uganda and Malawi.Improving governance, supporting human rights, reducing corruption and building democracy and accountability are integral to Ireland's development aid programme and to our engagement with Government and local authorities.  At every appropriate opportunity, at political level and through our Embassies on the ground, we raise our concerns with the authorities. Most recently, while in Malawi, I raised our concerns about the treatment of civil society and opposition party leaders and I underlined to the Government of Malawi the importance of adhering to international principles.  Since then, the Government has expressed our condolences on the death of President Mutharika, and welcomed the peaceful, constitutional transition of power, with the appointment of President Joyce Banda.  The approach of the new President, in the early days of her new administration, gives grounds for hope that issues we, other aid donors and civil society organisations have been raising will be addressed in a positive manner in the period ahead.In Uganda, our Embassy has also consistently raised at the highest level our concerns in relation to a number of issues, including the proposed anti-homosexuality Bill currently pending in the Ugandan Parliament. We have emphasised that this issue has the potential to undermine Uganda's human rights reputation both domestically and internationally.Ireland's development aid programmes operate in some of the most difficult environments in the world, but I am satisfied that the planning, monitoring, evaluating and audit systems which we have in place provide the best assurance that our aid is being used effectively and efficiently and is making a real difference for the peoples of Uganda and Malawi.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	676	The Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) is the principal global policy-making body on gender equality and advancement of women.  The theme of the 56th session of the Commission was "the empowerment of rural women and their role in poverty and hunger eradication, development and current challenges".  Despite extending the negotiations beyond the scheduled session the Commission failed to adopt agreed conclusions on the theme.The failure to reach agreement cannot be narrowed to any one topic or attributed to any one delegation.  There were difficulties throughout the negotiations in reaching consensus on language in relation to a number of terms and concepts, such as harmful traditional practices including early and forced marriage and female genital mutilation/cutting, the provision of comprehensive sexuality education, and the importance of attaining the highest attainable standard of health including sexual and reproductive health for women and girls.  Previously agreed language and key concepts from international agreements on gender equality and women's rights were questioned by some states and references to broadly ratified treaties were opposed by some delegations; these concepts and positions were strongly defended by other delegations including the EU.Ireland participated in the negotiations through the EU group, represented by the EU Delegation. Prior to CSW, Ireland contributed to the EU strategy paper for CSW which set out the EU's objective of preserving and strengthening the international agreements and commitments on gender equality and the empowerment of women by pursuing a rights based approach to gender equality and the empowerment of women and by countering attempts to undermine international human rights obligations.  Ireland made substantive comments on the draft agreed conclusions which were integrated into the EU's position before and during the negotiations.  During the negotiations, Ireland supported the EU negotiator by proposing compromise language and providing references to previously agreed language.  Ireland also negotiated the resolution on Women, the Girl Child and HIV and AIDS on behalf of the EU group and worked closely with the EU Delegation in striving for coherence between this resolution, the agreed conclusions and other resolutions.Ireland co-hosted a very successful side event with Malawi on "Gender and Nutrition: supporting rural women to improve nutrition".  The panellists included: Ms Kathleen Lynch, T.D., Minister of State with responsibility for Equality, Disability, Mental Health and Older People, H.E. Mr Brian Bowler, Malawian Ambassador to the United nations, Dr Grace Malindi, Adviser to the National Association of Smallholder Farmers in Malawi, Mr Anthony Lake, Executive Director of UNICEF and Chair of the Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN) Lead Group, and H.E. Ms Anne Anderson, Irish Ambassador to the United Nations.   The outcome document can be found at: http://www.dfa.ie/uploads/documents/New%20York%20PM/report%20of%20csw%20side%20event%20on%20gender%20&%20nutrition.pdf.The side-event contributed to the increased attention to nutrition in the resolutions, in particular the resolution on Maternal Mortality which contained the first reference to the global Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN) Movement in a negotiated United Nations document.  This language was proposed by Ireland through the EU Delegation.  Ireland has been a key player in SUN, which aims bring together governments, development partners, international organisation, civil society, business and academia in support of countries' own efforts to tackle hunger and under nutrition, in particular in children during the crucial "1,000 Day Window" between pregnancy to age two.It is very disappointing that the CSW did not reach agreement on a text which could have set out strong commitments to empowering rural women and to ensuring their rights.  Rural women throughout the world deserve better than this.   For our own part, Ireland engaged constructively with EU partners throughout the negotiations in efforts to find compromises while continuing to defend internationally agreed commitments on gender equality and the empowerment of women.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	677	In November 2011 the European Commission published proposals for a revision of the EU Transparency and Accounting Directives. One of the aims of the new proposals is to improve transparency among EU multinational companies involved in extractive and logging industries in developing countries. The proposals are also aimed at reducing the administrative burden on small and medium-sized companies. The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is leading the Government's engagement on these proposals, but they are also of relevance for our overall development cooperation programme and international development policies.   I am aware of the comments on the proposals by Irish development Non-Governmental Organisations, and their desire to ensure that the proposals will be effective in increasing transparency and accountability in the extractive industry sector.Among the proposals being discussed is the introduction of a system of reporting by multinational companies of payments to governments, including the reporting of taxes, royalties and bonuses, which would show a company's financial impact in each country. This would provide a better insight into payments to governments by EU multinationals in connection with their work in local oil and gas fields, mineral deposits and forests, leading to increased transparency and accountability.The EU Competitiveness Council met on 20 February 2012 to discuss the proposals.Discussions are continuing at working group level, and a number of options are being considered. At a recent meeting of the Committee of Permanent Representatives in the European Union, Ireland supported the more ambitious of two suggested transparency reporting options.  This would provide for project-by-project reporting by multinational companies.  I expect that these proposals will be considered further by the Competitiveness Council and the European Parliament in the coming months.

However, on the basis of the preliminary examination to date, I understand that any comprehensive solution proposed would require a major overhaul of the existing technology system and would involve significant capital expenditure.  Given the pressures on the public finances, I believe there may be challenges in taking on a project of this size in the immediate future.   I should also point out that the development of a fully online passport application system does not come without risk.  The changes required would be radical, complex and, ground breaking internationally.  No leading Passport Agency worldwide has developed a comprehensive online application system.  Some passport agencies have provided a system that allows applicants print down a form and return to the relevant agency.  However, it is interesting to note that the leading passport agencies internationally have not progressed significantly beyond this stage.It is in this context that I have also asked the Passport Service to consider whether some short-term improvements can be made in this area.  The existing passport system was built ten years ago using the best technologies at the time.  The complex format of the passport application form, which includes a unique barcode and drop-out colours, was designed to maximise application scanning accuracy.  There have been technology advances over this period, which, if adopted, may provide options to simplify the process for adults to renew their applications.  The Passport Service is currently examining the feasibility of introducing a new scanning solution, within existing resources.  This may open up the possibility of providing a downloadable form to applicants.  However, given that over 600,000 passport applications are submitted annually, it is essential that any new approach is considered with care.

As a result of an overall restructuring and rationalisation within my Department, the Development Cooperation Division has now assumed major new responsibilities for our overall political and trade promotion relations with sub-Saharan Africa and a number of countries in Asia where we have an aid programme.  The Division will now be balanced between Limerick and Dublin and it is not proposed to relocate the Limerick office back to Dublin.

This remains the position.   I also stated that the Passports Act 2008 requires, among other things, that a person must be an Irish citizen before the Minister for Foreign Affairs can issue a passport to that person.  It is, therefore, incumbent on each applicant to demonstrate, through the submission of documentary evidence, his/her entitlement to Irish citizenship.In this particular case, no such entitlement has been demonstrated in respect of section 6A of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 as amended.  I would, therefore, suggest at this stage that the parents of this child should pursue the question of their child's entitlement to Irish citizenship with the Department of Justice and Equality, which is responsible for such matters.  In the event that such an entitlement can be established and thereby demonstrated, the parents should then apply for a passport submitting the relevant and new evidence of the child's Irish citizenship.

I would also expect the Colombian authorities to seek to protect the remaining members of Mr. Ruiz's family and, indeed, any citizen who may be vulnerable to attack in relation to the issue of land restitution.On a wider level, I continue to believe that dialogue with the government of Colombia, bilaterally and with our EU partners, offers the best way to further the objectives of supporting democracy and improving the human rights situation there.I am aware of and share the concerns which have been expressed over human rights in Colombia, in particular the vulnerable position of trade unionists and human rights activists, as well as the very large number of Colombian people who were displaced over the course of decades of conflict and terrorism.  I underlined these concerns when I met the vice-president of Colombia when he visited Ireland on 24 January.The Victims' Rights and Land Restitution legislation (2011), which builds on the Justice and Peace Laws (2005) constitutes a crucial step in the efforts to push forward the peace process, and will, if fully implemented, provide reparation for more than four million victims of the long-standing armed conflict in the country.Together with our partners in the European Union, Ireland will continue to support the efforts of the Colombian government.  The Government will continue to liaise with the Colombian authorities through our embassy, based in Mexico City.

The Committee also includes civil society representatives:  the Africa Center for Open Governance (Kenya), the Instituto de Estudos Socioeconômicos (Brazil), the Instituto Mexicano para la Competitividad (Mexico), the International Budget Project,  MKSS (India), the National Security Archive (US), the Revenue Watch Institute and the Transparency and Accountability Initiative, Twaweza (Tanzania).  I understand that Brazil will host a meeting of the OGP this year.  The aim of the organization is to promote progress by participating states in relation to enhanced transparency and anti-corruption measures.To my knowledge, the Government has not been in receipt of any approach by the OGP to join the organisation and the question of possible participation by Ireland has not yet been examined.Ireland participates at EU level, and within the OSCE, OECD, Council of Europe, and the United Nations frameworks, in efforts to promote cooperation on, and improvement in, transparency and anti-corruption measures.   We ratified the UN Convention Against Corruption in 2011 and are also a party to the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention.  During the Nineteenth Session of the UN Human Rights Council in March 2012, Ireland co-sponsored a resolution on "The role of good governance in the promotion and protection of human rights", which was adopted by the Council.  This encouraged States to ratify the UN Convention Against Corruption and emphasised the role of good governance in the full realisation of human rights, sustained economic growth, sustainable development and the eradication of poverty and hunger.In advance of any decision relating to membership of OGP and a possible commitment of resources, it would be necessary to examine the potential added value of membership, in consultation with the other relevant Government Departments.

As with all Presidencies, Ireland's programme will be framed within the context of the overall EU agenda and will, to a considerable extent, be determined by the progress made by the preceding Danish and Cypriot Presidencies.  However, there are a number of clear overarching priorities that will form the backdrop to our Presidency programme.  The principal focus across a very wide range of policy areas and Council formations will be on stimulating sustainable economic growth and job creation across Europe.  The Irish Presidency will also work to finalise agreement on those aspects of the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) process that remain outstanding at the start of 2013.  The MFF will set out the EU budget for the period 2014-2020 and has linkages to many policy issues of direct national importance to Ireland including the Common Agricultural Policy, the Common Fisheries Policy and Horizon 2020 (the EU's future framework programme for research and innovation).  The Presidency will make every effort to contribute to the restoration of macroeconomic stability across the EU through the implementation of the Union's new economic governance rules and procedures.  In this context, Ireland will have the responsibility for managing in Council the European Semester, the process through which Member States coordinate their economic and budgetary policies. Work will continue at all levels of Government over the coming months to refine and develop the programme, in close cooperation with partner states, the European institutions and civil society.There has been substantial engagement at both official and political level with Lithuania and Greece, Ireland's Trio partners, over the past year.  This coordination will intensify throughout the remainder of 2012.  I have met with my Lithuanian colleague on two occasions over the past six months, and the Minister of State for European Affairs has also met with her counterpart a number of times.  We look forward to further meetings with our Greek partners after the general election in Greece in May.  Irish, Lithuanian and Greek officials in Brussels and in capitals are also working closely with the Council Secretariat to develop the Trio Presidency programme which will be published in late 2012.At this stage of planning approximately 170 meetings will be held in Ireland during the Presidency. This figure includes up to 11 informal Ministerial meetings that will take place across a range of policy areas.  Work is ongoing to identify and plan related events and initiatives and a clearer picture on the numbers and types of events being planned will emerge shortly. Several large conferences are being planned in Ireland during the Presidency to reflect the main jobs and growth agenda of the Presidency including in areas such as the use of information technology in areas such as health, research and innovation, and telecoms.The Government is aiming to run a cost-effective Presidency and every effort is being made to control costs. During the last Irish EU Presidency in 2004 the expenditure involved in setting up multiple venues for Presidency events was considerable. As a cost-reducing measure and reflecting the approach now adopted by other Member States, the Government has decided to limit the number of meetings held in Ireland, including at Ministerial level, and to concentrate meetings, to the extent possible, in a small number of State-owned venues.The programme for Government makes a clear commitment to restoring Ireland's standing as a respected an influential member of the EU and the wider international community.  Ireland's Council of the Presidency of the EU during the first six months in 2013 will be a critical element of this process.  The Government looks forward to using the Presidency to define and promote policy and legislation that can benefit the lives of millions of citizens in Ireland and across the EU.

We aim to ensure that, when requested, Ireland is represented at an appropriate level in international observation missions for elections and constitutional referendums.  Irish observers participate primarily in missions organised by the European Union and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), but have also been involved in missions organised by the Council of Europe, the United Nations and the Carter Centre.  When a request for electoral observation is received, the Department seeks expressions of interest from all observers on the election roster.  A list of suitably qualified observers is then drawn up, taking into account the length of time since their last mission as well as any specific criteria for the mission, including country and regional experience and relevant language proficiency, if applicable.  Attention is also given to contributing to the OSCE's commitment to achieving a better gender balance on missions, as well as the need for Ireland to increase the number of experienced observers on our roster.The OSCE has decided to send a limited election observation mission, comprising 10 long-term observers, for the parliamentary elections in Serbia on 6 May.  Ireland is providing one member of this observation team.  A full OSCE election observation mission will observe the parliamentary elections in Armenia on 6 May.  Ireland was asked to nominate long-term and short-term observers to participate on the mission.  One Irish long-term observer is currently in Armenia, and it is planned to provide a further eight Irish short-term observers.

We aim to ensure that, when requested, Ireland is represented at an appropriate level in international observation missions for elections and constitutional referendums.  Irish observers participate primarily in missions organised by the European Union and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), but have also been involved in missions organised by the Council of Europe, the United Nations and the Carter Centre.There are currently 300 people on the Department's Election Observation Roster.  The roster is not open for new members at present, but, given the interest in participation and the need to identify new members with specific skills, especially language skills, I have asked officials to review the working of the roster and to prepare proposals on future membership.  This review is nearing conclusion and I will decide on proposals for future membership of the roster in the near future.There is at present no formal process for leaving the election observation roster, but members can ask to have their membership deactivated.  In order to address a shortage of observers with strong language skills, a recruitment drive for French and Spanish speakers was held between 2008 and 2010.  Since 2008 there have also been some new members who qualify for inclusion based on their status as public representatives.  There is no upper age limit for membership of the roster and observers of all ages participate on missions once they have been certified as fit by their doctor.  A full list of the numbers of people who have joined or left the roster between 2008 and 2011 is provided in tabular form below:YearNumber of new observers joining the rosterNumber of memberships deactivated2008312009920105201151

The Ambassador and officers in the Embassy in New Delhi, which is accredited to Sri Lanka, have also been very active in pursuit of progress in this difficult case. I met with his wife and daughter on 29th   of February last.  At that meeting I agreed to write once again to my counterpart in Sri Lanka and to urge, on behalf of the Irish Government, that the person named by the Deputy, either be released or charged as soon as possible.  I also undertook to raise this personally with my Sri Lankan counterpart should I meet him at any international meetings where we may both be in attendance.

The Department is very conscious of the need the achieve value for money and is in full compliance with national and EU procurement regulations.    A table outlining the contracts to consultancy firms for 2011 and the first quarter of 2012 is provided below. The vast majority of the contracts are consultancy services for Irish Aid. Given the overall scale, range and diversity of the Irish Aid programme, as well as the firm commitment to the highest quality, accountability and evaluation, it is necessary to complement the in-house capacity with specialised skills and advice. External consultants are engaged only where specialised knowledge and skills are not available within the Department and where independent appraisal, audit, monitoring and evaluation of programmes and projects is required. A key criterion in the selection of professional service providers is the extent to which they can provide value for money for the taxpayer. The level of expenditure on consultancy services is constantly monitored to ensure that it does not exceed the level required for the proper management, oversight, monitoring, evaluation and audit of the aid programme.ConsultantConsultancy TitleContract ValueDelap and WallerProfessional services rendered regarding installation of passport machines in the Passport Office, Molesworth Street, Dublin.€5,651Fitzpatrick AssociatesDevelopment of a DFAT Evaluation Plan€21,275Cathy GaynorProvision of Technical Assistance in the Development of new Evaluation Guidelines for the Evaluation Section in DFAT€15,700Bernie CrawfordExternal Consultant for Fellowship Selection Committee Meetings€3,500Deirdre FarrellExternal Consultant for the Development Education Grants Committee Meetings€4,600Ruth O DohertyExternal Consultant for the Development Education Grants Committee Meetings€6,210MB ConsultingAssessment of Public Expenditure Frameworks — Mozambique€11,000Prof James PhelanConsultancy to Lead Implementation of an Independent Evaluation of the Agricultural Sector Development Programme Tanzania€18,000Mary CorbettTechnical Support for Food Security and Nutrition€45,000Marcel GroganAudit NGO Partners in MAPS 2009€22,500Ivan CrowleyShort Term Support for Country Strategy Paper Development Process in Tanzania€7,875Kevin MooreSpecial Economic Zones Consultancy€8,500Paul SheaneSpecial Economic Zones Consultancy€4,000Stefanie MeredithReview of IA Support for Product Development Partnerships€7,125Samia SaadReview of IA Support for Product Development Partnerships€7,125Paud MurphyDevelopment Education Reviews€7,80080:20:00Development Education Reviews€8,450Eilis MurrayDevelopment Education Reviews€5,850ISOSDevelopment Education Reviews€31,010Mores StephensReview Ministry of Education National Implementation Framework III 2011-15€15,000Pat McMullinThe Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR)€33,250John GeraghtyThe Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR)€7,500Marie-Katherine WallerMainstreaming, Negotiation and Advocacy: Capacity Building within Irish Aid€4,200MB ConsultingRevise and Consolidate the PFM Action Plan — Mozambique€5,000Bernard McLoughlinReview of the Irish Aid Centre€6,000Cathal HigginsPreparation of draft document that will govern the programme of the education sector budget support towards school infrastructural development — Karamoja.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	691	Ireland continues to support the right to self-determination of the people of Western Sahara, and the continuing engagement of the United Nations in the search for a political solution in the territory based on the principle of self-determination.  UN Secretary General Ban's Personal Envoy for Western Sahara, Christopher Ross, has convened several rounds of informal talks, most recently last month in the US. Personal Envoy Ross is also due to visit Western Sahara and the wider region in May for talks, a development which I very warmly welcome as it will represent the first such visit by the SG's Personal Envoy to the territory.In his latest report to the Security Council issued just last week, SG Ban reported that the parties remained committed to the negotiating process and agreed to continue discussing specific subjects of mutual interest such as natural resources, demining and confidence building measures.  The parties held a meeting on natural resources in Geneva last November and a meeting on confidence building measures in January this year. They have agreed to meet again in June and July this year for informal negotiations.  I regard both sides' commitment to dialogue as constructive and positive, and hope that this process can engender a degree of trust between the two sides that will enable progress on the political questions where there has been no progress to date.The major obstacle remains Morocco's refusal to allow a referendum in the territory which would include an option of independence for the people of the Western Sahara. This has been provided for in a number of UN peace plans, and it is difficult to see that there can be any genuine self-determination without such a referendum.  I would also encourage the two parties to engage in the initiative, suggested by the UN Secretary General, of convening a group reflecting a wide cross-section of the population of Western Sahara inside and outside the territory for consultations and dialogue as a way of generating new ideas to present to negotiators, as all efforts to break the political stalemate must be fully explored.Addressing human rights issues is also a key ingredient to the successful resolution of the conflict.  Morocco has committed itself to providing unqualified and unimpeded access to all special procedures of the Human Rights Council but has not yet formally extended a standing invitation to all special procedures mandate holders.  While I welcome Morocco's engagement with three special procedure mandate holders, I call on the Moroccan authorities to give full and immediate effect to its commitment to engage with the HRC Special Procedures.  More regular and ongoing monitoring of the human rights situation in the territory than can be provided for through the HRC special procedures is also desirable.  I would therefore welcome the inclusion of a broader human rights monitoring mechanism in the mandate of MINURSO, the UN peace-keeping mission in Western Sahara.  This has been discussed at the Security Council but agreement has not, to date, been reached.Ireland will continue its dialogue with both Morocco and the Polisario, through the Moroccan Ambassador and the local Polisario representative, to encourage support for the UN Secretary General's good offices mission and the efforts of Personal Envoy Ross to achieve some measure of political progress and increased confidence between both sides.

The reminder service sends an e-mail, to those who have registered, three months before a passport is due to expire.  Registration is simple and merely requires those interested to record their name, e-mail address and the expiry date of the passport.  It is possible to register a number of different passports (e.g. all members of a family) using the one e-mail address with the reminder e-mail detailing which passport registered is about to expire.  The reminder e-mail also provides details of how to renew the passport, where to obtain passport application forms, etc. 
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	693	I wholeheartedly welcome and support the UN-Arab League Special Envoy Kofi Annan's peace plan.  It offers the only realistic basis for resolving the current crisis in Syria and bringing the unacceptable violence to an end.  Ireland's strong support for the Annan peace plan was clearly articulated at the meeting of the Friends of the Syrian People which took place in Istanbul on 1 April. I urge full implementation of the plan by all sides in Syria and a complete cessation of violence as mandated by the six point plan.As called for by Special Envoy Annan, a ceasefire came into effect on 12 April. Regrettably, not all violence has ended and, in particular, there continue to be disturbing reports of the Syrian regime continuing offensive operations in the cities of Homs and Hama.  I urge an immediate halt to offensive operations by the Syrian armed forces, a withdrawal of these forces to barracks and a complete halt to any use of heavy weaponry against urban population centres.The Annan Plan needs to be implemented in all its aspects, if Syria is to emerge from this crisis and enter on a process of meaningful political reform and transition. I urge the Syrian authorities not only to halt the violence and withdraw troops to barracks but also to fulfil their other commitments under the plan, in allowing full humanitarian access, releasing all political detainees and allowing media operate freely throughout the country. The Syrian opposition, both within and outside of Syria, also has its responsibilities to end the violence and help facilitating a political process get underway. Once a complete and sustained ceasefire is in place, I hope all factions in Syria will be prepared and will be facilitated in engaging in serious and meaningful dialogue aimed at bringing about a political transition which addresses the legitimate aspirations of the Syrian people.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	694	The key distinguishing feature of Ireland's bilateral relationship with the Philippines is the extent and contribution of the Filipino Diaspora in Ireland, many of whom are employed in health care roles in HSE hospitals and nursing homes.For many decades Irish Catholic missionary orders, in particular the Columban Fathers, have worked in educational development and social justice in the Philippines and although the number of Catholic priests and sisters is now in decline and ageing, their contribution to the Philippines has been very significant.Ireland does not have a resident Embassy in Manila.  Our ambassador in Singapore is currently accredited to the Philippines.  Ireland does however have a long established honorary consulate in Manila which looks after the consular needs of Irish citizens who are resident or travelling in the Philippines.  The embassy of the Philippines in Dublin, established in 2009, will close shortly as part of a global cost cutting campaign being carried out by the Philippines government.Total merchandise trade with the Philippines in 2011 was valued at €208.8 million (exports were worth €177.7 million and imports were worth €31.1 million).  Total trade in services with the Philippines in 2010 was worth €105 million (exports were worth €89 million and imports were worth €16 million).  Our embassy in Singapore is currently working with the Department of Agriculture of the Philippines to resolve some outstanding issues arising from a welcome decision in 2011 to remove the prohibition on the importation of Irish beef.In the context of the meeting of EU and ASEAN foreign ministers in Brunei on 26-28 April, my colleague the Minister of State for European Affairs, Lucinda Creighton, hopes to meet with the Secretary for Foreign Affairs of the Philippines, Albert del Rosario.  This will provide a useful and timely opportunity to exchange ideas on a range of issues of mutual interest.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	695	I propose to take Questions Nos. 79 and 80 together.Ireland's aid programme prioritises the fight against global poverty and hunger, with a particular focus on the world poorest countries in sub-Saharan Africa. The programme is central to our foreign policy, enjoys strong cross-party and public support and reflects the values of the Irish people, and our long term interests globally. Ireland's aid programme is internationally recognised as being one of the best in the world — the OECD Development Assistance Committee describes our programme as "cutting edge" and a champion in making aid more effective.I am aware of the results of the Dochas/Ipsos MRBI opinion poll published in late 2011.  The survey, which was commissioned by Dochas — the umbrella group of Irish development NGOs — found that despite the economic downturn, almost 80% of respondents expressed strong support for overseas aid.  I welcome such support which is a public validation of the quality and direction of our aid programme.Our Programme for Government contains a clear commitment to supporting the aid programme, and to the UN target of providing 0.7% of Gross National Product (GNP) for Official Development Assistance (ODA).In the current year, the Government has provided a total of €639 million to ODA, which is expected to represent over 0.5% of GNP.  Given the unprecedented difficult economic conditions and fiscal constraints currently facing the country this allocation represents a real commitment by the Government, and the people of Ireland, to the aid programme and, more importantly, to assisting the world's poorest people.  We can be enormously proud of this achievement at this time.The Government is ambitious for and committed to the aid programme.  We are determined it will maintain and build on its high international reputation, and that it continues to build the foundation of real change, future prosperity and well being in the lives of many of the world's poorest people.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	696	In November 2011, the Government announced its decision to close Ireland's resident Embassy to the Holy See, along with our Embassy in Tehran and our Mission in Timor Lester. This decision, taken with the greatest regret and reluctance, was driven by economic factors deriving from our need to cut public expenditure and focus the modest resources of our diplomatic service on economic recovery.   The choice of Missions for closure followed a comprehensive review of the diplomatic network, in which particular weight was given to the economic return from Missions, and their role in rebuilding Ireland's reputation abroad.As regards the Holy See, the logic for closure was based on the fact that the Embassy is not involved in consular services or trade promotion and that essential issues of Church-State relations could be handled relatively well by a non-resident Ambassador.This decision will not be reversed in the immediate term. The unavoidable budget cuts and reduction in staff numbers which necessitated the closure are still in effect and my Department has neither the staff nor the financial resources to reverse the mission closures decided upon by the Government last November.However, as the economic situation improves and in the context of the regular review of our diplomatic network, it may be possible to revisit the matter at some time in the future.

In cases where suitability is established, NAMA will facilitate contact and negotiations between its debtor/receiver and the housing authority.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	698	The Travel Agents Margin Scheme, which is provided for in Articles 306 to 310 of the EU VAT Directive, was introduced with effect from 1 January 2010. Detailed discussions with the travel industry were carried out prior to the introduction of the scheme which is a standard EU-wide Scheme in operation in most Member States of the EU.   The scheme deals with the activities carried on by travel agents who act in the capacity of a principal when supplying certain travel services such as transport, accommodation, etc, which they have bought in from third parties for onward supply to travellers. Travel agents covered by the scheme are liable to VAT on their profit margin on the services provided rather than the full consideration they receive in respect of the supply of these services.The nature of the scheme means that the travel agent only has an obligation to account for VAT on the profit margin in the country where he/she is established.  The travel agent has no further VAT obligations in places where the travel services are supplied. The travel agent cannot recover any VAT charged when he/she purchases the travel services but this is because VAT is only accounted for on the profit margin when the services are supplied on to the traveller. The VAT treatment applied under the margin scheme has the same effect as for ordinary traders who account for VAT on the full consideration charged for a supply of goods or services and recover VAT on the purchase of those goods or services. There is no double taxation. Similarly travel agents like other traders can recover VAT on deductible overheads incurred by them in connection with their taxable supplies.The scheme has benefits for a travel agent in terms of complying with his/her VAT obligations.  In the absence of the scheme a travel agent could have compliance obligations across many Member States of the EU with a resultant increased administrative burden.

VAT is governed by the EU VAT Directive, with which Irish VAT law must comply.  Article 78 of the VAT Directive provides that the taxable amount shall include "taxes, duties, levies and charges, excluding the VAT itself".In this respect, where a supply of service, such as a gas bill, includes carbon tax, VAT law dictates that VAT should be calculated on the carbon tax element of the charge as well as the charge for the service.  The same situation applies in the case of other excises, including for example excises on petrol, auto-diesel, tobacco and alcohol products.Guidance in relation to the VAT treatment of the total consideration receivable by a supplier is set out in the VAT Guide.

It is clear, however, that the scope for loss of tax revenue from illegal activity in the fuel market is significant, and that this criminality also threatens legitimate businesses and the environment. Combating it is, therefore, a key priority for the Revenue Commissioners, who have undertaken extensive enforcement action against both fuel launderers and those selling laundered fuel. This action will continue, and Revenue will be assisted in this important work by the legislative action which I took in the recent Finance Act to enhance the control and supervision of the supply chain for fuels.   Revenue is an integrated tax and customs administration and it is not possible to  disaggregate resources deployed exclusively on policing fuel laundries.The Revenue Commissioners have around 2,000 staff engaged on activities that are dedicated to target and confront non-compliance. These activities include audit, assurance checks, anti-smuggling, debt management, investigations, prosecutions and anti-avoidance.  The Revenue Commissioners have assured me that, notwithstanding the reduction in overall staff levels in accordance with Government policy on public service numbers, tackling non-compliance such as fuel laundering, the on-going sale of laundered fuel and use of laundered fuel remains a key priority.The prosecution of tax-related criminal offences involves a number of public bodies including Revenue, State Solicitors and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. It would not be possible, therefore, to provide information on the overall expenditure on prosecuting offences.

The following Tables 1 and 2 give an indication of the Divisions to which the initial appointments were made and the number of internal or external appointees:DivisionTotalInternalExternalBorder Midlands and West44—Corporate Affairs and Customs11—Corporate Services211*Dublin Region33—East and South East Region22—Information and Communications Technology321Investigations and Prosecutions11—Large Cases514Planning11—Revenue Legislation Services22—South West Region33—27216DivisionTotalInternalExternalBorder Midlands and West945Corporate Affairs and Customs211Collector General’s532*Corporate Services11—Dublin Region853East and South East Region312Information and Communications Technology33—Investigations and Prosecutions413Large Cases1046Planning44—Revenue Legislation Services651South West Region651613724*Two external appointments were by redeployment from elsewhere in the public sector.  The balance were by way of open recruitment competitions.These appointments were made to replace the loss of key skills and experience in Revenue at a time of significant staffing reductions.  Since January 2009, Revenue staffing numbers have reduced by 850 staff (-13%).  Despite the appointments set out in Tables 1 and 2, since January 2009 the numbers serving have reduced at Principal level by 38 (26%) and at Assistant Principal level by 120 (2%).External open recruitment has been an important source for the replacement of critical skills and experience in Revenue and I know that the Commissioners are keen to carry out further open recruitment at these levels.  However, the Employment Control Framework process to which Revenue is subject in line with Government policy to reduce public service numbers severely restricts the extent to which Revenue can add additional headcount by way of open recruitment.However, I recognise the need to replace the loss of key skills and experience in Revenue while meeting the existing Employment Control Framework allocations.  I have asked the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to consider reducing Revenue's target staff numbers over a longer period of time, whilst at the same time allowing Revenue some scope to replace critical skills and experience.  This request is under consideration and, in the meantime, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has sanctioned the replacement of some critical posts in Revenue, including at Principal and Assistant Principal Officer level included in the above tables.

In Ireland the zero rate applies to printed books, including atlases, children's picture, drawing and colouring books and books of music. Under the EU VAT Directive, all digitised publications, regardless of their rate when printed (for example, a book liable at zero rate), are treated as the supply of a service liable at the standard rate of VAT. E-books, online newspaper subscriptions and online information services purchased via download over the Internet are also considered the supply of services liable for VAT at the standard rate. There is no option under EU VAT law to apply the zero rate to e-books.

The VAT rate depends on the nature of the good or service supplied and must accord with the EU VAT law.   Irish VAT law provides that the following are exempt   from VAT:the provision of services by a funeral undertaking;grave digging services; andthe sale of cremation plots and burial plots from a cemetery that was opened more than 5 years prior to the date of sale.Some fees charged by cemeteries are liable to VAT.  These include:Opening and Reopening fees:  These fees are in the nature of permission granted by a cemetery for a specified grave in the cemetery to be dug to receive an interment of ashes or a coffin.  Such fees are liable at the standard rate of 23%.Permit fees:   These fees are in the nature of a permission to erect a memorial (typically a headstone and surround) on a grave.  Such fees are liable at the standard rate of 23%.Plot sales:  The sale of cremation plots and burial plots from a cemetery that was opened within 5 years prior to the date of sale.  Such fees are liable at the reduced rate of 13.5%.The VAT issues raised by the Deputy are explained further in the Revenue publication VAT Guidance Note for Public Bodies (eBrief 56/2010) available on the Revenue website www.revenue.ie.

This process would also require Member States to submit draft Budget Plans to the European Commission by 15 October each year to aid the consultation process. The current timetable fits with this draft requirement.Secondly, in order to construct budgets that are underpinned by the best available data, it is necessary to wait until late in the year to finalise economic and fiscal forecasts. For example, most of our Corporation Tax receipts are received into the exchequer each year in November.  Each month of extra macroeconomic data also helps to improve the accuracy of forecast that underpins the annual budget.In relation to the Retail Industry, the Programme for Government states that the standard rate of VAT will not exceed 23%. This commitment should ensure greater certainty surrounding consumption decisions and limit sentiment affects relating to Christmas trading volumes.

The purpose of this review is to determine if there was a way to reduce the overall cost to the State. Part of the capitalisation of IBRC was provided using promissory notes as consideration.While the development in relation to the end March Promissory Note payment is positive, we must continue to work towards the greater benefits which would derive from the re-engineering of the promissory note. There are potential improvements for the banking sector which could also stem from the ongoing technical discussions.It is for these reasons that we must look at the recent developments as an initial step in a process. This is a medium term project. The Government is focused on developing an alternative solution to the promissory note arrangement in IBRC. It is too early at this stage of the process and indeed it would be inappropriate to predetermine what a successful outcome will look like or to indicate how the various stakeholders have or may react to various proposals We want to arrive at a successful conclusion that is in the interests of Ireland and the EU.

Ultimately the pricing of financial products, including standard variable mortgage interest rates, is a commercial decision for the management team and board of each bank, having due regard to their customers and the impact on profitability, particularly where the cost of funding to each bank, including deposit pricing, is under pressure.Neither the Central Bank nor the Department of Finance has a statutory function in relation to interest rate decisions made by individual lending institutions at any particular time. However, I can confirm to that PTSB did pass on, in full, the ECB rate reductions announced in late 2011 to customers holding standard variable rate (SVR) mortgages and also reduced further their LTV standard variable rates to align them with the SVR.As part of the recent Memorandum of Understanding ("MOU") dated 10 February 2012 with our External Partners, it was agreed that the authorities will make a decision on the proposed way ahead for the company by the end of April 2012. Much work has been completed by the new management in PTSB and officials in my Department to develop this strategy for discussion with the Troika over the course of the on-going April review mission. As you would expect the strategy will consider all aspects of PTSB's current and future approach to its business. It would be premature for me to discuss possible outcomes of those discussions at the present time.

It is a matter for the board and management to determine and implement such policy in their organisation. Therefore, commercial decisions in relation to IBRC are solely a decision for the bank.   IBRC have informed me that KPMG Corporate Finance and Davy Corporate Finance ran a joint sales process to sell Siteserv which was in severe financial difficulties and was unable to service or pay back its loans to IBRC. The sale process was initiated by Siteserv and overseen by a subcommittee of the Siteserv Board. The sale process involved two stages and IBRC was briefed after each stage. The Board of Siteserv, as advised by KPMG Corporate Finance and Davy Corporate Finance, recommended the successful bid as representing the best return for IBRC. The Board of the bank are satisfied that this is the case.

That response provides a very detailed account of all contracts and fees paid by NAMA since its inception to end January 2012.I am advised by NAMA that in the short timeframe available for this question they were not able to collate relevant data for the intervening period since January 2012. However, I have requested that NAMA furnish that information to me as soon as practicable at which point I will forward that to the Deputy within a week.

NAMA further advises  that it reimburses the NTMA in respect of the costs of these services attributable to NAMA.   The NTMA does not maintain an internal press office. Instead, it has appointed an external service provider (following a public procurement process) to provide a full press office service (including out-of-hours service) for national and international media across all the NTMA's business areas: funding and debt management, the National Pensions Reserve Fund, the National Development Finance Agency, the State Claims Agency, NewERA and NAMA.The NTMA put these arrangements in place during 2010 in light of a very significant increase in the volume of media queries. The costs of the service are primarily a factor of the volume of media activity. The costs attributable to NAMA (including VAT) were €63,032 in 2010 and €135,948 in 2011.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	711	I propose to take Questions Nos. 97, 98, 184 and 232 together.The Fiscal Compact is a key part of the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union   agreed at the end of January.The Fiscal Compact requires inter alia   that the structural deficit of each Member State be at its country-specific medium term objective (MTO), and that Member States ensure rapid convergence towards their MTOs.  The limit for the MTO is set at a deficit of no more than 0.5% of GDP, although in the case of countries with a very low ratio of public debt the limit for the MTO can be a deficit of up to 1% of GDP.The structural deficit is that part of a country's government deficit which will not be eliminated by economic recovery.  However, a difficulty arises in measuring this structural deficit — it cannot be measured directly and, instead, must be estimated.  While there are a variety of ways to do this, a harmonised approach has been developed within the EU and this is used in assessing compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact.  It is important to stress that all estimates of the structural balance are subject to uncertainty, especially for a small and very open economy like Ireland's.  In line with the Stability Treaty, the Commission will provide clarity on the time-frame for convergence, taking into consideration country-specific sustainability risks, that participating Member States will be required to respect.  Progress towards and respect of the MTO is to be evaluated on the basis of an overall assessment, with the structural balance as a reference.  In that context, we will work to ensure a practical approach is pursued.In practical terms, running a broadly balanced structural budget means that, over the full economic cycle, the public finances are balanced.  The headline fiscal balance can, of course, fluctuate on a year-to-year basis in line with the economic cycle.Focusing on the structural budget position can help prevent the boom-bust approach to budgetary policy that, unfortunately, has characterised our situation over the past decade or so.  As such, this is to be welcomed.From a wider perspective, the fiscal compact will help ensure sustainable public finances in all participating Member States, helping to safeguard the stability of the euro area and the EU as a whole, which is in all of our interests.Finally, in relation to the so-called "debt-brake", I'm assuming that this is a reference to the automatic correction mechanism that contracting parties to the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union   are required to put into national legislation.This automatic correction mechanism is to be based on a common set of principles to be proposed by the European Commission, concerning in particular the nature, size and time-frame of the corrective action to be undertaken.  The automatic correction is to be triggered in the event of a significant observed deviation from the country-specific medium-term budgetary objective (MTBO) or the adjustment path towards this MTBO.Finally, I would point out the Taoiseach has given a commitment that legislative measures associated with the Treaty will be made publically available in advance of the referendum.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	712	Ireland, as with other countries, has experienced an increase in the cost of petrol and auto-diesel. The increase in fuel prices is an international phenomenon. Fuel prices are driven by a number of factors including the price of oil on international markets, exchange rates, production costs and refining costs. The rise in oil prices over recent periods reflected additional factors such as geopolitical uncertainty in Northern Africa and the Middle East with potential supply disruptions.The excise rates (including the carbon charge) in Ireland on motor fuels are 58.8 cent per litre of petrol and 47.9 cent per litre of auto-diesel. However, our rates remain lower than many of our main trading partners and significantly lower than our nearest neighbour the UK. The rates for petrol and auto-diesel were increased with effect from 7 December 2011, arising from an increase in the carbon charge for those fuels from €15 to €20 per tonne of CO2 emitted. This represented an increase of less than 1.5 cent per litre in the case of petrol and just over 1.5 cent per litre in the case of diesel, when VAT is included. The rate of VAT that applies to those fuels increased from 21% to 23% with effect from 1 January 2012.The Exchequer yield from excise, as excise is set at a nominal amount, does not increase as the price of fuels increase. On the other hand, the yield from VAT per litre of fuel, as VAT is set as a percentage of the price, increases as the price of fuels increase.  However, in this regard it should be borne in mind that to the extent that spending in the economy is re-allocated to petrol and other oil products, and away from other VAT liable spending, and to the extent that the overall level of economic activity is reduced by higher oil prices, there may be little or no net gain to the Exchequer.It should also be noted that businesses are of course entitled to reclaim VAT incurred on their business inputs, including VAT incurred on fuel. For example, VAT incurred on auto-diesel and marked gas oil (MGO or green diesel) used in the course of business is a deductible credit for business in the Irish VAT system. VAT on petrol can not be deducted/reclaimed.There are no plans for temporary taxation adjustments, as to do so, could lead to significant costs to the Exchequer. The issue of rising fuel prices was discussed by EU Finance Ministers at an ECOFIN meeting last year where they reconfirmed the approach taken in 2005 and again in 2008, when oil prices were very high, which endorsed a coordinated approach towards not making distortionary fiscal adjustments.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	713	As I have stated before, the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) Treaty, was signed by Euro Area Member States on 2 February 2012. The original version of the Treaty was signed on 11 July 2011, but it has been modified to incorporate decisions taken by the Heads of State and Government (HoSG) of the Euro Area on 21 July, 9 December 2011 and 2 March aimed at improving the effectiveness of the mechanism. These decisions included the agreement on the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance (Stability Treaty) in the Economic and Monetary Union.In my previous replies to the Deputy on this issue, I outlined that the original ESM treaty, signed in July 2011, needed to be updated to take account of the additional flexibilities agreed by the HoSG for the EFSF in late July 2011. As I also outlined there were further developments in Europe, particularly in relation to the Stability Treaty, by the time discussion on the revised ESM Treaty had resumed.Our approach to these negotiations was informed by the need to secure agreement on the revised ESM Treaty, including the additional flexibilities and the commitment to a review of its capacity. We viewed these as positive developments which are in Europe's interest and in Ireland's interest. In this context, it is worth noting the review of the ESM capacity, recently conducted by Eurogroup Finance Ministers, has resulted in the agreement to expand the level of support funding to €700 billion.While the Government did not actively seek to include the link between the two Treaties, it did suggest that before creating any such link that careful consideration be given to any possible market implications. The linkage between the ESM and Stability Treaty ratification was accepted in the interests of securing agreement on the ESM and its accelerated entry into force by July 2012. In the negotiations, the Government sought to ensure that it was made clear that the link between ratification of the Stability Treaty and the ESM Treaty applied only to new applications for assistance under the ESM, and that it will not affect the transfer to the ESM of undisbursed amounts under the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) for Ireland and other programme countries. The Government also sought to ensure that sufficient time was provided for ratification of the Stability Treaty before the link enters into effect.The Stability Treaty is part of a broader package of measures aimed at improving confidence in the Euro Area, which include the ESM. As I have said in previous replies, it is entirely logical and reasonable that a country receiving the support of its partners under the ESM should be prepared to run sensible budgetary policies as required under the new Treaty.  That is the basis of the linkage. We believe the linkage between the Treaties will further contribute to confidence, solidarity and financial stability in the euro area.

Generally, individuals who have paid mortgage interest on loans taken out on or before 31 December 2003 have not qualified for mortgage interest relief since the tax year 2009. However, some claimants, who took out loans in late 2003 but did not make their first payment of home loan interest until 2004 have been granted mortgage interest relief through the Tax Relief at Source system (TRS). Such individuals will continue to be granted relief through the TRS system.

Accordingly, I am not in a position to supply the information that the Deputy seeks in this instance.I have taken note of the Deputy's suggestion of the possibility of transferring staff between State supported institutions.  I would note, however, that the present voluntary redundancy scheme on offer at IBRC — which is the only such scheme on offer presently — precludes certain areas which are pivotal to that bank's operation and which are more likely to have staff with the skills sought at the other covered institutions.

I have no role in the day-to-day commercial and operational decisions of the banks, which include these matters. These decisions are taken by the board and management of the institution. Notwithstanding the fact that the State is a significant shareholder in the institution, I must ensure that the bank is run on a commercial, cost effective and independent basis to ensure the value of the bank as an asset to the State, as per the Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies agreed with the EU Commission, the ECB and the IMF.   The Government is acutely aware of the increasing financial stress that some households are facing in the current environment. However, we have observed that free banking offerings have changed significantly in recent times across the industry and that the bank must remain competitive in order to return to profitability and viability. I am informed that AIB considers its proposal to be competitive and in line with the market.

However, the VAT system, as governed by the EU VAT Directive, operates a system of rebates of VAT paid for persons registered for VAT and it is possible that a retailer of alcohol can be in a situation of net VAT gain as a result of below cost selling, this is not a loss to the Exchequer or an additional benefit to the retailer, it is merely how VAT is charged.VAT is a tax on the value added to a supply and the collection and recovery of VAT takes place at each stage of the chain of supply from manufacturing to retailer.  Under EU and domestic VAT rules traders who are registered for VAT collect VAT on the goods and services that they sell.  In turn such traders are entitled to recover the VAT they incur on their business inputs used in the purchase or production of goods or delivery of services.  Consequently, if there is a decrease in value at any stage in the process the trader is entitled to a refund of the excess of VAT incurred over that collected.

Both banks were required to sanction lending of at least €3 billion in 2011, €3.5 billion this year and €4 billion in 2013 for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs. I can confirm to the Deputy that both banks have achieved their 2011 targets.  In addition to the lending targets imposed on the banks,the pillar banks are required to submit their lending plans to the Department and the Credit Review Office (CRO) at the beginning of each year, outlining how they intend to achieve their lending targets. My Department, in conjunction with the CRO, subsequently analyses the plan and meets the banks to discuss any issues of note. The banks also meet with my Department and the CRO on a quarterly basis to discuss progress. The monthly management meetings with the pillar banks also provide a forum for the issue of SME lending to be raised by my Department.I should stress however that the Relationship Frameworks with the banks provide that the State will not intervene in the day-to-day operations of the banks or their management decisions including with respect to pricing and lending decisions. These frameworks are published on my Department's website at http://banking.finance.gov.ie/presentations-and-latest-documents/.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	722	As I said in a reply to the Deputy on 22 November last, the decisions financial institutions operating in Ireland make on the interest rates they charge to customers are commercial decisions for the institutions concerned. Interest rates are determined by a broad range of factors including ECB base rates, deposit rates, market funding costs, the competitive environment, and an institution's overall funding. I have no statutory function in relation to business interest rate decisions made by individual lending institutions at any particular time.The Financial Regulator and Deputy Governor of the Central Bank stated in his response of 11 November 2011 to the Taoiseach on the issue of passing on mortgage interest rate adjustments following ECB actions, that the power to exercise close regulatory control over retail interest rates is not sought by the Central Bank. Similar principles apply in relation to business interest rates. The Deputy Governor has indicated that the Central Bank will, within its existing powers and through suasion, engage with specific lenders which appear to have standard mortgage variable rates set disproportionate to their cost of funds.He has indicated that experience of such controls in the past and in other countries does not encourage the Central Bank to believe that such a regime would be advantageous in net terms as the banking system recovers its normal functioning. Binding controls tend to reduce availability of credit and channel it to the most creditworthy customers, starving smaller and less secure customers from credit. The Regulator indicates that this could have a chilling effect on the entry of sound competitors into the market. By absolving banks from their responsibility to price risk accurately, binding interest rate controls would, especially during this recovery phase, impede progress towards the re-establishment of bank management practices that can ensure a healthy and free-standing banking system no longer dependent on the Government for bail-outs.In conclusion, it is vital that the banks continue to make credit available to support economic recovery. However, it is not in the interest of the banks, businesses or the economy for finance to be provided unless the business is viable and has the capacity to meet the interest payments and repay the sum borrowed.

The SIF will channel commercial investment from the National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF) towards productive investment in the Irish economy. As well as money from the NPRF, the SIF will seek matching commercial investment from private investors and target investment in areas of strategic significance to the future of the Irish economy.I am informed by the National Treasury Management Agency, as Manager of the National Pensions Reserve Fund, that the NPRF announced in November 2011 a commitment of €250 million to a new Irish infrastructure investment fund which is seeking up to €1 billion from institutional investors in Ireland and overseas and which will invest in infrastructure assets in Ireland, including assets designated for disposal by the Government and commercial State enterprises and also new infrastructure projects. Marketing of this fund in Ireland by Irish Life Investment Managers and abroad by AMP Capital commenced in the first quarter of 2012.  Normally the period from commencement of marketing of an investment fund targeting illiquid assets to closure of financial commitments by investors in such a fund can extend up to one year. In parallel, AMP Capital, the infrastructure manager of the fund, has commenced a process of building a pipeline of appropriate investment opportunities.The NPRF has also committed €450 million to finance the national roll out of domestic water meters.In addition, the NPRF is actively supporting the development of the market for venture capital in Ireland through its continued participation in Innovation Fund Ireland in conjunction with Enterprise Ireland.  On 15 March 2012, the Minister for Enterprise, Jobs and Innovation announced the commencement of the second call for expressions of interest from appropriately qualified international venture capital managers.Further involvement of the NPRF in the SIF is expected to require the amendment of the investment policy of the NPRF, which is set out in the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000. Officials of my Department are liaising with the National Treasury Management Agency, which is the Manager of the NPRF, in identifying and drafting the necessary amendments to the legislation and I expect to bring forward proposals for amending legislation as soon as possible once that work is completed.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	725	The overall objective of the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union is to support economic growth by ensuring the sustainable evolution of public finances in Member States over time.  Article 1 of the Treaty, for instance, states that a key objective of the fiscal compact is to support the achievement of the EU’s objectives for sustainable growth, employment, competitiveness and social cohesion.  So in this sense I see no reason why the level of trade would decrease — if anything, the Treaty could boost trade between Member States over time. 
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	726	The proposed personal insolvency reforms are one of the key measures to address the mortgage arrears problem.  However, the approach of the Government on this issue has been clear and it is that mortgage holders who can meet their loan obligations should continue do so and that appropriate assistance should only be afforded those mortgage holders, or other borrowers, who are experiencing real and genuine difficulty in meeting their commitments.   Accordingly, the general scheme, in the form of draft heads, of a Personal Insolvency Bill, as published by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence, contains strict eligibility criteria to avail of the measures proposed and also provides that the non judicial Personal Insolvency Arrangement option, which is proposed to address unsustainable secured debt, will only be available if other less intrusive options, such as the proposed Debt Relief Certificate or the Debt Settlement Arrangement — both of which exclude secured debt from their remit — are not viable alternatives to make a borrower solvent.In particular, the personal insolvency proposals are not intended to provide for any blanket write down of debt either to address the issue of negative equity or otherwise.  Therefore, it is very premature at this stage to attribute significant and general write downs in Irish mortgage portfolios to this proposed legislation, not least when the Bill remains to be finalised and approved by Government.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	727	The European Stability Mechanism (ESM) Treaty, was signed by Euro Area Member States on 2 February 2012. The original version of the treaty was signed on 11 July 2011, but it has been modified to incorporate decisions taken by the Heads of State and Government (HoSG) of the Euro Area on 21 July, 9 December 2011 and 2 March aimed at improving the effectiveness of the mechanism.    In order to further improve market confidence and in accordance with the agreement reached at the Euro Summit on 9 December 2011 and reiterated on 2 March 2012, the HoSG have reassessed the adequacy of the overall EFSF/ESM lending ceiling of €500 billion.  The Eurogroup concluded its review of the ESM capacity on 30 March and agreed in principle the following:That the ESM will be the main instrument to finance new programmes as from July 2012. The EFSF will, as a rule, only remain active in financing programmes that have started before that date. For a transitional period until mid-2013, it may engage in new programmes in order to ensure a full fresh lending capacity of €500 billion.The current overall ceiling for ESM/EFSF lending, as defined in the ESM Treaty, will be raised to €700 billion such that the ESM and the EFSF will be able to operate, if needed, as described above. As of mid-2013, the maximum lending volume of ESM will be €500 billion. The combined lending ceiling of the ESM and the EFSF will continue to be set at €700 billion.In addition €49 billion out of the EFSM and €53 billion out of the bilateral Greek loan facility have already been paid out to support current programme countries. All together the euro area is mobilising an overall firewall of approximately €800 billion, equivalent to over $1 trillion.

When I receive the paper I will be in a position to assess the appropriateness or otherwise of publishing the paper.

However, as indicated, once I have had the opportunity to review and assess the paper I will be in a position decide on publication.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	729	As the Deputy will be aware the Promissory Note arrangement is essentially an arrangement between the Government and IBRC. The Government has provided Promissory Notes to IBRC and undertaken to repay the principal and interest payments in accordance with a repayment schedule. However, the Promissory Note is accepted as collateral for the Exceptional Liquidity Assistance (ELA) by the Central Bank of Ireland and as such there is an implicit link between the current repayment schedule on the Promissory Note and ELA provided by the Central Bank.  Any discussions in relation to ELA would of necessity have to include the ECB.   The EU Commission and the EU heads of Government are one step further removed from the initial arrangement between the Government and IBRC. However given our approach to addressing the heavy debt burden, involving the Troika in developing a technical solution or range of solutions and given that possible alternative sources of long-term funding may involve a number of parties, it is not unreasonable to assume that a solution may require the approval or acquiescence of Member States. However, it is important to await the outcome of the technical review to properly assess what is required to get an appropriate solution in place. In the meantime the Government will avail of every opportunity to garner support for the work in hand and for a positive outcome for the country.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	730	I assume the Deputy is referring to the opening address by Governor Honohan to the Central Bank Conference on the SME Lending Market on 2 March 2012.   Although the Governor makes the point that "credit conditions for SMEs are tougher in Ireland than anywhere elsewhere in the euro area both in terms of cost and availability", he goes on to state that the "Government has arranged to recapitalise the main banks with fiscal injections almost unmatched — as a percentage of national GDP — in world history.  The Central Bank, supported by the Eurosystem, has provided open-ended liquidity to ensure that shortage of liquid assets cannot have been a constraint on lending.  True, the EU-IMF agreement requires deleveraging by the banks, but the authorities are closely monitoring this deleveraging to try to ensure that, as intended and agreed with the Troika, it falls mainly on non-core business (mostly abroad) and run-offs.  The intention is the deleveraging would not affect credit availability for the recovery at home."As the Deputy is aware, one of the key priorities of the Programme for Government is to ensure that an adequate pool of credit is available to fund SMEs in the real economy during the restructuring and downsizing programme. The Government has introduced a number of policy tools to assist in this objective:The banking system restructuring plan creates capacity for the two Pillar Banks, Bank of Ireland and AIB, to provide lending in excess of €30 billion in the next three years.  SME and new mortgage lending for these banks is expected to be in the range of €16-20bn over this period. This lending capacity is incorporated into the banks' deleveraging plans which allow for repayment of Central Bank funding through asset run-off and disposals over the period to 2013.The Government has imposed lending targets on the two domestic pillar banks for the three calendar years, 2011 to 2013. Both banks were required to sanction lending of at least €3 billion in 2011, €3.5 billion this year and €4 billion in 2013 for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs. Both banks achieved their lending targets for 2011.In addition to the lending targets imposed on the banks, the pillar banks are required to submit their lending plans to the Department and the Credit Review Office (CRO) at the beginning of each year, outlining how they intend to achieve their lending targets. The banks also meet with the Department and the CRO on a quarterly basis to discuss progress. The CRO is also available to review cases where credit facilities up to €500,000 are refused, withdrawn, or offered on unreasonable conditions.The Central Bank published a revised statutory Code of Conduct for Business Lending to Small and Medium Enterprises (SME Code) setting out new requirements for lenders when dealing with SMEs in, or facing, financial difficulties which came into effect from 1 January 2012. A full review of the SME Code will be undertaken in 2012.The Temporary Partial Credit Guarantee Scheme aims to provide much-needed credit to job-creating SMEs who currently struggle to get finance from the banks. It is intended to address market failure affecting commercially viable businesses in two specific situations — namely, where businesses have insufficient collateral, and where businesses operate in sectors with which the banks are not familiar — and provide a 75% State guarantee to banks against losses on qualifying loans to firms with growth and job creation potential. Initially, the scheme will facilitate up to €150m of additional lending per annum to SMEs, in addition to the lending targets set for the pillar banks. The Scheme will be demand-led, and take-up and performance will be closely monitored. For every €150million of additional lending, the Scheme is expected to benefit over 1800 businesses. The cost of the Scheme per €150million of lending is €6.38million. However this does not take into account benefits to the exchequer this lending will bring in terms of increased tax receipts and decreased social welfare payments. When these benefits are taken into account, the net gain to the Exchequer is over €25million per €150million of lending.A Microfinance Fund to provide loans to small businesses is also being developed within the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation for establishment shortly. It is anticipated the Micro Finance Loan Fund will generate up to €100million in additional micro-enterprise lending which will benefit more than 5,000 businesses over a ten year period.In summary, as the Governor noted in his speech in answering the question "what are the authorities doing about access to credit?", he acknowledged that the response is "a whole lot".It is vital that the banks continue to make credit available to support economic recovery. However, it is not in the interest of the banks, businesses or the economy for finance to be provided unless the business is viable and has the capacity to meet the interest payments and repay the sum borrowed.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	731	I wish to make clear that I and my colleagues in Government are deeply concerned that draft confidential information on the Irish economy became public for a second time earlier this year and at the manner in which this information was put into the public domain.    As the Deputy will be aware, this information was contained in a European Commission document. However, it is still disappointing. We are in a Programme of financial support with the EU and the IMF.  As part of this Programme, reports are prepared on Ireland by the Commission. As the European Commission's Dublin representative said "Commission staff strive to ensure that reports are prepared with the utmost accuracy and that confidentiality is preserved in advance of publication".Following each review mission by the external partners, the Irish authorities agree updated Programme documents, specifically the Letters of Intent, the Memorandum of Understanding on Specific Economic Policy Conditionality, the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies and the Technical Memorandum of Understanding. These are discussed between the partners and authorities in draft format before being signed and published.On becoming aware of the recent leak, and the internal Commission process that they have in place my officials have again raised our serious concerns with the Commission.I also again contacted Commissioner Olli Rehn to express my disappointment regarding the leak and to enquire about steps taken to ensure confidentiality of documents in the future. The issue has also been raised at senior official level with the German authorities. We must nevertheless recognise that we remain in a Programme, and continue to rely on the support of the External Partners.  In expressing our concern, we need also to continue working with our partners.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	732	This Government considers that the labour market represents its biggest challenge and accordingly is giving top priority to job protection, job creation and supporting the unemployed.  In this regard, my colleague the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation recently published an Action Plan on Jobs.   The European Commission released its Interim Economic Forecast for the EU on 23 February 2012. While some economies are forecast to grow, the Commission believes that GDP will remain unchanged in 2012 in the EU as a whole while the euro area will undergo a mild recession with GDP falling by 0.3%.Obviously, as a small open economy whose recovery is being driven by exports, Ireland will be affected by the weak growth outlook for Europe, though competitiveness improvements evidenced in recent years will provide some support.  I would also point out that, as some of our exports are by their nature quite capital-intensive, the impact on employment levels of a slowdown in export growth will be more muted than would otherwise be the case.Ireland's Stability Programme Update, which will contain updated economic and budgetary forecasts for the period 2012-15, will be published at the end of April. The aforementioned developments in our main trading partners, along with other information that has become available since Budget time, will inform these forecasts.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	733	Considerable progress has been made in respect of Greece over the last number of weeks.  For instance, its public debt has been restructured and a new programme of external financial assistance has been agreed.   Putting Greece on a sustainable path is a key part of addressing the euro area crisis, and I do not agree that focusing on Greece has prevented European leaders from concentrating on growth and employment.  This is evidence from the fact that an agenda for growth was agreed at the same time as the Stability Treaty — this is no accident and Ireland was among those seeking to ensure that the growth agenda moved in parallel.Last year, a five-point strategy was agreed at European level in order to help resolve the euro area crisis, involving inter alia   addressing the problems in the European banking system and tackling difficulties in individual Member States.  It is my view that we need to vigorously implement this agreed approach to ensure that we continue to build on the progress made at European level over recent months.

In return for committing to an asset disposal programme of up to €3bn, which is a more ambitious target than we had originally provided for in the Programme for Government, the Troika has agreed to the retention of one-third of the proceeds for reinvestment in the economy. My colleague the Minister for Public, Expenditure and Reform, Brendan Howlin T.D., announced details of the disposal programme in February and work is now progressing on its implementation.     The programme documents which were laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 14th February set out the commitments in this regard.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	735	The question of whether there is a credit crunch underway across Europe has been a subject of discussion in recent months, both at a European level and in wider public forums.  This was largely the result of the sharp contraction in lending in the Eurozone during December.  During this period of heightened stress, many financial institutions experienced great difficulty in raising funds in the inter-bank market, and subsequently there was a significant tightening of the credit supply to both companies and households.   Following this contraction in December, the flow of credit in both January and February has markedly improved, due in large part to the European Central Bank's (ECB) Long Term Refinancing Operation (LTRO).  Recently released figures by the ECB indicate that loans to households and companies increased significantly in January, while only falling slightly in February; the February figures failing to account for the second round of LTRO which was only released on the 29th of that month. These are signs of an improvement in lending across the Eurozone, and continuing attention will be focused on the situation in an effort to further improve lending conditions while banks continue to raise capital, deleverage assets and also to roll funding commitments.As stated recently by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB, it is inaccurate to say that the liquidity is simply being deposited back in with ECB.  The rise in the deposit facility is an accounting identity — as the ECB lends out more money which raise its assets, its liabilities must also increase by an equal amount.  Additionally, the banks which have placed deposits with the ECB are not identical to the banks that drew down the funding, indicating that the liquidity provided is circulating throughout the system as intended. It is also important to note that the purpose of the LTRO was to maintain price stability across the Eurozone and to prevent the onset of a credit crunch.  These efforts were taken to return confidence to the financial environment across Europe, and as stated by the ECB, it may take several months before the full impact of this additional liquidity becomes available to businesses and households.

The MOU builds on the existing dialogue between the NTMA and CIC International, and provides a framework for future co-operation in terms of exchanging information and identifying suitable investment or co-investment opportunities for CIC in Ireland.    The NTMA believes the MOU represents a major initiative for enhanced co-operation and engagement in areas of common interest. CIC International is a financial investor and seeks stable and sound financial returns over the long run. It believes the MOU will be of valuable assistance to it in identifying and assessing potential opportunities in Ireland.As the MOU is a commercial agreement between the NTMA and CIC, the Deputy will appreciate that the details are confidential and commercially sensitive.

Therefore, as such charges are not tax deductible, there is no requirement to bring forward legislation to amend section 836 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.

For ease of reference the relevant pages are:InstitutionPagesAllied Irish Banks380 thru 384Bank of Ireland157 thru 168IBRC148 thru 153IL&P60 thru 65In addition to the information contained in the 2011 Annual Report, I am informed by Allied Irish Banks that there are three (3) other individuals who are in receipt of total remuneration including pension contribution of over €500,000 on the basis of pre-existing contracts.  None of these individuals are in receipt of a base salary of over €500,000.Previous Government policy on remuneration at the covered institutions was dictated initially by the recommendations of Covered Institutions Remuneration Oversight Committee.  On foot of these recommendations the then Government decided to implement a base salary cap of €500,000 on senior executives.  Consequent on the State's investment in AIB in December 2010 this policy was extended so that no employee may earn aggregate remuneration (excluding pension contributions) but including without limitation annual base salary, bonuses and variable pay components in excess of €500,000.Following on the State's further investment in AIB, BoI and IL&P of Summer 2011, this policy — which is present Government policy — was amended further to state that no employee may receive total aggregate remuneration (excluding pension contributions) but including without limitation annual base salary, employment bonuses, commission payments and fringe benefits in excess of €500,000.The Government's bona fides in this area have been honoured by the remuneration packages agreed recently for the respective Chief Executive Officer positions at AIB and Permanent Trustee Savings Bank being contained within these parameters.When setting such thresholds, the Deputy will appreciate that cognisance has to be taken of the contractual situation of those employees already in situ.   Accordingly, some individuals at the covered institutions are still in receipt of remuneration packages exceeding these limits on the basis of pre-existing contractual rights or having taken some reductions but still above the threshold.  In instances such as these, there are provisions in the agreements underpinning the State's investment in the institutions that for a period of at least two years the remuneration of those individuals may not increase, unless otherwise required by law and any proposal to increase such persons remuneration after that time will be subject to agreement.

The objective of agreeing rent abatement in the first instance is to support the short-term viability of a business which is intrinsically viable but experiencing difficulties arising from current economic conditions. In cases where there is genuine hardship which can be ameliorated by rent abatement, NAMA achieves two significant benefits. Firstly, it helps  preserve the value of the collateral supporting its loans by ensuring that tenants remain in business and continue thereby to generate rental income. Secondly, it safeguards jobs and economic activity in general.Any short-term loss of rental income arising from rent abatement and any short term decrease in the value of the asset where there is rent abatement, therefore, is likely to be more than offset by these long-term benefits.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	750	The Government is fully aware of significant difficulties some homeowners are facing in meeting their mortgage obligations and it is committed to advancing appropriate measures to assist those mortgage holders who are experiencing real and genuine difficulty.  These include measures recommended in the "Keane Report" such as significant personal insolvency reform, the implementation of "mortgage to rent" as a social housing response, Central Bank engagement with individual mortgage lenders on their mortgage arrears resolution strategies and the development and provision by lenders of specific solutions to assist their customers experiencing mortgage difficulty and the provision of a mortgage advisory function.   While the Government and the Troika are in ongoing contact on the further measures the Irish banking system and the State could deploy to further enhance the stability of the banking sector, there are currently no specific proposals under active consideration for a measure, along the lines adopted in respect of the National Asset Management Agency, to specifically provide direct assistance to mortgage holders experiencing difficulty meeting their mortgage obligations.  Accordingly, given the significant number of variables that would have to be considered and decided if such a proposal was envisaged, it is not possible to provide an estimate of the potential cost to the Exchequer of such a proposal at this time.

It went on to state that "AIB will not be making any further public comment until the consultation process with staff representatives is concluded."   As these discussions are continuing, with the assistance of the Labour Relations Commissions, the Deputies will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment directly on some of the issues raised in these questions which form part of these negotiations.In any of my public pronouncements on the issue, I have been at pains to point out that all parties involved in this most sensitive of issues for individuals need to be treated with utmost consideration and respect and this most certainly includes the State which have contributed in excess of €20bn to the bank.It is deeply regrettable, for all concerned, that the proposed action of shedding some 2,500 jobs has had to be taken but it is an inevitable consequence of the necessary restructuring of the banking system to render it fit to better serve personal and business customers throughout the economy.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	753	I am advised by NAMA that it has established three panels of legal firms to advise it on various aspects its business, including legal due diligence associated with the loan acquisition process, enforcement and corporate legal services. In view of the relatively small size of the Irish legal sector, it is possible that some of these firms also provide services to individuals or companies whose interests could include litigation against NAMA.    I am advised that large professional firms typically work for a variety of clients and operate procedures to ensure that potential or actual conflicts of interest are identified and managed. Measures taken by firms include the creation of ethical barriers, more commonly referred to as Chinese Walls, between different divisions of a firm to avoid conflicts of interest. Any professional services firm which supplies services to NAMA is under a continuing obligation to notify NAMA of any potential or actual conflict of interest that may arise.Section 45 of the NAMA Act 2009 deals with professional standards in the provision of services to NAMA by expert advisers and service providers and I am assured by NAMA that this is being complied with. NAMA have also advised me that it is satisfied that in all cases involving the provision of such services potential conflicts of interest have been avoided or have been appropriately managed.

In relation to the remaining party, the company did advise on certain aspects only. The company in question is not acting for the State (or State owned entity) in relation to this matter and therefore no conflict of interest can arise.

I am advised by NAMA that for any contracts that fall outside the scope of the Regulations, the Agency adopts a competitive process designed to achieve value for money.   I am advised by IBRC that it has an established, Board approved, Group Procurement Policy in accordance with best practice, which observes certain procurement requirements insofar as is practicable given the commercial realities of a bank. This Group Procurement Policy necessitates that once a requirement to award a contract for a good or service has been identified, and once an approved budgetary provision has been established, the requirement should go through a formal procurement process. IBRC is not subject to legal obligations in respect of public procurement. I am advised by IBRC that it has taken legal advice on this matter.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	756	Since nationalisation there has been an extensive re-structuring of the governance and management of IBRC.  As of today, none of the current executive or non-executive directors of the Bank were involved with the Bank prior to nationalisation. None of the direct reports into the Group Chief Executive, Mike Aynsley, were direct reports to the previous Chief Executive at the end of 2008. In addition, of the 50 most senior people employed pre-nationalisation, 34 have since left the Bank.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	757	It is the case that our General Government debt to GDP ratio has increased significantly in recent years. This is due to a combination of the sharp downturn in economic activity since 2007, four years of large budget deficits and the significant level of State support that it has been necessary to provide to the banking sector. Budget 2012 estimated the end-2011 General Government debt to GDP ratio at 107 per cent. By contrast, at end-2007, the ratio was just 25 per cent.    Since 2009, the State has injected a gross sum of approximately €64 billion into the banking sector, equivalent to just over 40 per cent of 2011 GDP.It must be borne in mind however that close to €21 billion of this was provided from the National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF) and so had no direct effect on General Government debt.In addition, receipts from the fees for the Bank Guarantee, which amount to just under €2.9 billion so far, as well as a further €1 billion in Exchequer receipts from the sale of the part of the NPRF shareholding in Bank of Ireland have helped to mitigate this gross cost somewhat.While acknowledging that the State's debt level is currently very high and has increased significantly over the last four years, in part due to the requirement to support the banking sector, the Government is implementing policies which both consolidate the budgetary position and foster economic growth. Stabilising the debt is one of Government's key policy objectives. It is my view that our debt is sustainable provided the correct policies are followed and implemented.The Deputy will also be aware that in terms of banking related debt, the Government is keen to examine what can be done to lessen the impact on the sovereign of debt resulting from the banking crisis. A key part of this is to find the most cost effective way of resolving IBRC over the medium term. In this regard, technical discussions between officials are ongoing at present in relation to the IBRC Promissory Notes.Budget 2012 estimated that the General Government debt to GDP ratio would increase further this year and next, peaking at just under 120 per cent in 2013, before declining to around 115 per cent by 2015. A revised estimated 2011 General Government debt outturn as well as updated forecasts for the period 2012-2015 will be contained in the forthcoming Stability Programme Update which will be published before the end of April.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	758	This is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners. The Deputy will be aware from previous representations in this matter that the tax debt in question arose from invalid repayment claims submitted by the person concerned. Revenue views this very seriously and given the circumstances giving rise to the debt and notwithstanding the personal circumstances of the person concerned, there will have to be a significant payment towards the debt and Revenue will have to be assured that any balance, with interest, will be paid in full over a reasonable timescale. I am advised by Revenue that in that context therefore, the offer recently made to them is entirely unacceptable.

The addition percentage is calculated annually by the CSO and the Revenue Commissioners in accordance with EU guidelines, to reflect the amount due tofarmers had they been registered for VAT.   In this respect, as the farmers' flat rate scheme is administrative only, VAT revenue does not accrue to the State from the scheme.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	762	On 29 March 2012 a direction was issued by me under section 14 of the NAMA Act 2009. It directed that NAMA adopt all reasonable measures to facilitate the short-term financing, in the amount of circa €3.060 billion, of Irish Bank Resolution Corporation Limited. This was to be achieved by entering a transaction on appropriate commercial terms, collateralised by an appropriate Irish Government bond with a maximum duration of 90 days. The power of NAMA to engage in this transaction is provided for in section 12(2)(R) of the NAMA Act 2009. A copy of this direction was laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas on the same day.    I am satisfied that this transaction is necessary for the achievement of the purposes of the Act and that it is within the existing powers and functions of NAMA. The relevant purposes are those set out Section 2(B) of the NAMA Act 2009 and in particular subparagraphs (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) and (vii).
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	763	The position is as I stated in my Budget day speech, that the new measure fulfils the Government's commitment contained in its Programme for Government to increase the rate of Mortgage Interest Relief to 30 per cent for first-time buyers who took out their first mortgage in the period 2004 to 2008.  This was the period during which house prices peaked.    I have sought to be as flexible as possible within the constraints pertaining.  Under the current tax legislation Mortgage Interest Relief is granted from the date the first mortgage interest payment is made.   The legislation has been amended for this particular measure to also include mortgage draw-down as a qualifying event for the rate increase.  This means that a mortgage holder will qualify for the increased rate if they made their first mortgage interest payment in the period 2004 to 2008 or   if they drew down their mortgage in that period.Unfortunately, based on the information provided, the person in question does not qualify for the increased rate of relief.  However, he should still continue to qualify for the current rates of relief for first-time buyers.  It should be noted that Mortgage Interest Relief is set to be abolished at the end of 2017.As with all time limited reliefs, there will always be people who just miss out, and that is why I have been as flexible as possible with the legislation.  However, I do not intend to extend the parameters of the measure any further as it would become less targeted and more costly.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	764	I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, following clarification, the course concerned, a Higher Diploma in Science and Computing, is a post graduate course and qualifies for relief under section 473A Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.   I am further informed by the Revenue Commissioners that relief for the fees paid has now been granted to the person concerned.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	765	The Central Bank has informed me that it does not regulate the outsourcing by regulated financial service providers of any functions in relation to the repossession of machinery and vehicles.    In terms of any type of agreement between the banking sector and outsourcing firms I wish to advise the deputy that the Relationship Frameworks with the banks provide that the State will not intervene in the day-to-day operations of the banks or their management decisions and it is a matter for the respective individual boards and management to determine and implement operational policy in their organisations.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	766	I am advised by the institution that a 20% reduction was applied to the salaries of senior management in the former Anglo Irish Bank immediately post nationalisation. These adjusted lower salaries have remained in place in the organisation for subsequent replacements to those roles.     I am further advised that the total remuneration paid to the top 50 individuals in the organisation in 2009 has reduced by 15% as at March 2012. In addition, total staff costs in the organisation have reduced by 48% from end 2008 to end 2011; this includes 6 months of additional cost resulting from the merger with INBS in 2011.I understand that further reductions in pay levels for individual staff in IBRC (the entity tasked with winding down the former Anglo Irish Bank and INBS) have been considered by the Directors of the Bank and a decision has been reached not to implement cuts at this time. The Bank informs me that this decision not to pursue further pay cuts was based on the reality that staff retention is a critical issue for IBRC and is subject to review in the light of changing circumstances. I understand from the Bank that since nationalisation there has been a 60% reduction in total headcount in the combined Anglo Irish Bank and INBS organisations from close to 2,250 in January 2009 to 919 today.It should also be noted that IBRC does not operate a performance based incentive plan to retain individuals throughout the remaining wind down period of the entity.I am informed by the Bank that staff members are being regularly headhunted by banks and other organisations because of their particular and often unique skills in asset recovery. The skills of those individuals who stay with IBRC during its remaining life are integral to the successful delivery of the Bank's asset recovery programme on behalf of the State and, by extension, the taxpayer.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	767	Notwithstanding the fact that the State is a significant shareholder in the institution, the bank should be run on a commercial, cost effective and independent basis to ensure the value of the bank as an asset to the State, as per the Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies agreed with the EU Commission, the ECB and the IMF.    It is a matter for the individual board and management to determine and implement operational policy in their organisation. Therefore, such matters are solely a decision for the bank. I have no role in the day-to-day commercial and operational decisions of the banks, which include these matters.

I have asked my officials to bring forward proposals for an appropriate amendment at the Committee Stage of the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Bill 2011   to provide for this regime. In relation to the details supplied in the Deputy's question, I have been informed by the Central Bank that a provisional liquidator has been appointed to the company concerned. It will be a matter for the liquidator to establish the amounts owed to customers and to distribute any available monies accordingly.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	769	As I have stated previously, all matters in relation to the administration of mortgage interest relief through the tax relief at source (TRS) system are matters for the Revenue Commissioners.    On that basis I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, based on the information available to them, the person concerned has received the full relief to which he is entitled.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	770	I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that a person carrying on a business is required, under section 886 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, to keep all records that are required to ensure that a full and detailed tax return can be made. The section also requires that the records be kept on a continuous and consistent basis so that they are not written-up from memory retrospectively or selectively.    I am further informed by the Revenue Commissioners that on making an annual  tax return  a person is required to provide extracts from the business accounts for the accounting period which forms the basis year to which the tax return relates.In the absence of such accounts a person would not be in a position to complete the return form in the required manner. In general, business accounts include a trading and capital account together with a balance sheet. However, in the case of a small trader, as for example in the circumstances outlined, an income and expenditure account would suffice, providing it contains the information required to be included on the tax return.Although the accounts need not be submitted with the return, they must be retained (together with supporting documentation) for six years as they may be requested by Revenue for the purpose of an assurance check or an audit.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	771	I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that as the limits prescribed under Section 9 (€9,525), Section 11 (€15,875) and Section 13 (€15,875) of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers   (Tax Concessions) Regulations (S.I. 353 of 1994) relate to the VRT and VAT paid on a vehicle, there are no provisions whereby additional VRT or VAT may be repaid in excess of these limits.  However, if the prescribed limits have not been reached in full on the vehicle and the vehicle is subsequently purchased by another "qualifying person", any VAT paid on the transaction will be refunded to the "qualifying person" subject to the limits outlined above.    Where a vehicle has obtained full relief or the prescribed limits have been reached under the relevant provisions and the vehicle is subsequently purchased by another "qualifying person" for their use the vehicle still qualifies for relief from motor tax and the fuel rebate.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	772	I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners, who are responsible for the collection of tobacco products tax, and for tackling the illicit trade in cigarettes and tobacco, that there is no internationally recognised method for precisely determining the amount of tax lost as a result of the illicit trade in cigarettes. However, a survey commissioned by Revenue and the Office of Tobacco Control in 2009 estimated that 20% of cigarettes consumed in the State had not been taxed in this jurisdiction. This figure was further broken down as 14% illicit product and 6% legally imported by passengers arriving into the State from other jurisdictions.  A similar survey in the last quarter of 2010 confirmed these estimates.  A further survey has now been completed and the results will be published shortly.  Based on the estimate of 14%, the loss to the exchequer from illicit cigarette consumption during 2009 and 2010 would be in the region of €250m (excise duty + VAT), per year.   The Revenue Commissioners inform me that Revenue loss estimates are not available for the period 2005 to 2008 as there were no such surveys commissioned in respect of those years.I am aware of a number of other studies on the extent of the consumption of illicit cigarettes in Ireland, including those conducted by or on behalf of KPMG, the Irish Tobacco Manufacturers Advisory Committee (ITMAC) and the Irish Heart Foundation.   Revenue has assured me that they are confident that the findings of the annual surveys, which are conducted independently by a third party market research company on behalf of both Revenue and the Office of Tobacco Control (now the National Tobacco Control Office) are robust.  These surveys specifically differentiate between illicit cigarettes and legal non — Irish tax paid cigarettes.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	773	The Deputy will be aware that the Revenue Commissioners are responsible for the collection of tobacco products tax, and for tackling the illicit trade in cigarettes and tobacco. The Commissioners inform me that they regard the tackling of the illicit tobacco trade as a high priority area. The strategy employed by Revenue to tackle this illicit trade is multi-faceted. It includes ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem, developing and sharing intelligence on a national, EU and international basis, ongoing review of operational policies, development of analytics and detection technologies, optimum deployment of resources at point of importation and inland, in order to intercept the contraband product and to prosecute those involved.   Interception at the point of importation is achieved through a combination of risk analysis, profiling, intelligence, and the screening of cargo, vehicles, baggage and postal packages.  Revenue enforcement officers also target this illicit trade at the post-importation level by carrying out intelligence-based operations and random checks at retail outlets, markets and private and commercial premises.  In July 2010, Revenue launched a series of nationwide tobacco ‘blitz'-type operations, which concentrated additional Revenue resources at ports, airports and at various inland retail points, including markets for the purpose of identifying illicit tobacco products. To date, Revenue has conducted nine such national tobacco blitz operations resulting in the seizure of 34.6m cigarettes and 1,715 kgs of tobacco.Revenue carries out regular multi-agency operations, particularly in relation to large maritime importations and in checks at inland markets and also works closely with the European Anti-Fraud Office, OLAF, in their efforts at tackling the illicit sale of tobacco at an international level. Revenue also provides, and receives, intelligence from other Customs Administrations. This international cooperation, and sharing of intelligence and expertise plays an important role in combating illegal tobacco smuggling on the global level.In 2011, a total of 109.1m cigarettes with a retail value of €45.95m and 11,159 kgs of tobacco with a retail value of  €4m were seized by Revenue.  In addition to this Revenue obtained one hundred and three convictions relating to cigarette smuggling, with fines of €136,300 imposed and thirty-one custodial sentences, of which twenty-one were suspended. There were a further fifty-seven convictions relating to the sale of unstamped tobacco products with fines of €115,850 imposed and fourteen custodial sentences, of which seven were suspended.  The Revenue Commissioners have established a high level internal group, chaired at Commissioner level, to examine the risks related to tobacco products tax evasion and to oversee and optimise the detection of contraband and counterfeit tobacco products. This group has promoted a number of initiatives aimed at counteracting the illicit trade in tobacco. These include the adoption of a comprehensive tobacco strategy, which is underpinned by annual action plans. This 3-year (2011-2013) strategy, which is published on Revenue's website www.revenue.ie, includes a number of programmes, which are designed to complement each other in targeting the supply and demand sides of the market for contraband tobacco in Ireland.Revenue's strategic level plans include the taking of steps to ensure that the legitimate trade remains compliant, delivering more effective and visible interventions through enhanced capability and better deployment of its resources, further development of cooperation and intelligence sharing at organisational, national and international level, a commitment to prosecute all serious cases of tobacco tax evasion and a focus, in partnership with other Government agencies, on reducing the demand for contraband tobacco.Revenue works closely with the legitimate tobacco industry, including individual manufacturers and ITMAC, to identify current trends and trading patterns with a view to identifying illicit cigarettes on sale in the State. Periodic meetings are held between ITMAC and representatives from the three Revenue Divisions involved in policy, collection and enforcement of tobacco taxes. There is also close co-operation and sharing of information between Revenue and the Office of Tobacco Control, which is an office of the Department of Health. Revenue also works closely with An Garda Síochana through established and effective channels of communication and joins forces with them in multi-agency operations, where appropriate.Legally binding agreements have been signed between the European Commission and member states (including Ireland) on the one hand and the four major global tobacco manufacturers on the other, with the objective of instituting formal cooperation arrangements to combat cigarette and tobacco smuggling.  The manufacturers include Philip Morris International (PMI), Japan Tobacco International (JTI), British American Tobacco (BAT) and Imperial Tobacco Ltd. (ITL).  The agreements include the provision of enhanced support to European law enforcement bodies in the battle against the illegal trade in tobacco products.  This support also includes the testing on request of selected seized tobacco products to establish whether they are genuine or counterfeit. Under these agreements, the four tobacco manufacturers appear before representatives of the European Commission and the member states on an annual basis to report on the progress of the agreed cooperation commitments.I am satisfied with the extensive interaction, communication and co-operation already undertaken by Revenue in relation to tobacco smuggling and I am also satisfied that Revenue is willing to pursue additional worthwhile measures to tackle the illicit tobacco trade.  Nevertheless, I will ask my officials to consider whether the proposed committee would add in practice to the fight against tobacco smuggling.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	780	The one-parent family allowance was introduced in the late 1970's and replaced the housekeeper allowance which was available to certain one-parent families.  The original underlying objective of the relief was to support labour market participation of single and widowed parents and to provide a means of support to those families. The one-parent family allowance was converted into a tax credit in 2001.   A single person, whether widowed, a surviving civil partner, single, separated or divorced or formerly in a civil partnership which has been dissolved and with a dependent child or children may, subject to compliance with the conditions governing the credit, be entitled to claim the One-Parent Family Tax Credit and an extended standard rate tax band that is €4,000 per annum greater than the single standard rate tax band of €32,800. The value of the credit is €1,650 per annum.  The One-Parent Family Tax Credit, where due, is given in addition to the basic personal tax credits.  The One-Parent Family Tax Credit, therefore, provides individuals who are in one-parent family situation with the same basic personal tax credits as both a married couple, or a couple in a civil partnership, who are living together.To qualify for the tax credit and the extended standard rate tax band, a qualifying child must be resident with the individual claiming the credit and that individual must not be living with his or her spouse or civil partner or cohabiting with another person.The tax credit is not available to cohabiting persons.  The reason the credit is withdrawn where parents enter into a cohabiting relationship is because they do not meet the policy objective of the measure, namely, to provide additional support for single parent families in order to promote labour market participation.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	781	The tax credits and allowances available to married couples with children (including civil partners with children) are as follows (it is to be noted that these credits and allowances, apart from the home carer's credit, are available regardless of whether or not the person is married, if the person meets the qualifying criteria):—Incapacitated child tax credit— This is available in respect of a child who is permanently incapacitated by reason of physical or mental infirmity, or if over 18 was so incapacitated before reaching age 21 or was in full-time education at the time of the incapacity.Home carer’s tax credit— This is available to married persons and civil partners who are jointly assessed and where one spouse or civil partner works at home to care for children, the aged or incapacitated persons.Employed person taking care of incapacitated individual— This is available where a person is employed to take care of a family member who is totally incapacitated by physical or mental infirmity.Medical expenses relief— Qualifying health expenses incurred by an individual in respect of a child qualify for tax relief.Medical insurance relief— Relief is allowed in respect of qualifying premiums for health insurance paid in respect of a dependant child.Relief for the long-term unemployed (known as “Revenue job assist”)— Additional relief is allowed on a tapering basis in respect of each qualifying child over a 3-year period of claim. The tax credits and reliefs available to married persons with children, as set out above (with the exception of home carer's tax credit), do not differ to those available to cohabitating couples with children.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	782	As the Deputy is aware, the banking system restructuring plan creates capacity for the two Pillar Banks, Bank of Ireland and AIB, to provide lending in excess of €30 billion in the next three years.  SME and new mortgage lending for these banks is expected to be in the range of €16-20 billion over this period. This lending capacity is incorporated into the banks' deleveraging plans which allow for repayment of Central Bank funding through asset run-off and disposals over the period to 2013.   The Government has imposed lending targets on the two domestic pillar banks for the three calendar years, 2011 to 2013. Both banks were required to sanction lending of at least €3 billion in 2011, €3.5 billion this year and €4 billion in 2013 for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs. Both have indicated that they have achieved their 2011 targets. The pillar banks are required to submit their lending plans to the Department and the Credit Review Office (CRO) at the beginning of each year, outlining how they intend to achieve their lending targets. The banks also meet with the Department and the CRO on a quarterly basis to discuss progress.I would accept that the amounts sanctioned by the banks are but one measure of the provision of credit. However these amounts are within the control of the banks themselves and are therefore an appropriate target for the banks. The targets are kept under constant review in the context of levels of economic activity.Data provided by the Central Bank indicates that the drawdown of new lending by non-financial SMEs from credit institutions in Ireland was €3.1 billion in 2011.  Figures for the equivalent period in 2010 show drawdowns of €3 billion. Excluding SMEs in the property related sectors these figures show drawdowns of new lending of €2.2 billion in 2011, roughly equal to amounts drawn down in 2010.I would point out that the drawdown of funding is at the discretion of the borrower. There are many factors affecting whether or not funding is drawn down, such as changes in market conditions or company restructuring. The recent Mazars Survey of SME Lending, conducted on behalf of my Department, found that the most frequently cited reason for not availing of approved credit was ‘not needed at present time'.With regard to the decline in lending to households, Irish households have been reducing their levels of debt since early 2009.  In the years preceding the financial crisis, Irish household debt as a percentage of disposable income increased to become one of the highest levels in Europe.  As some commentators have noted, including the IMF in their most recent World Economic Outlook, high levels of debt can impede economic recovery. Households can be more susceptible to distress from increasing interest rates and declining incomes.  In more recent years Irish households have recorded a greater percentage decrease in debt than any other European country. This is as a result of increased repayment of loans and more consumer reliance on current income rather than credit to fund purchases.  This is normal behaviour by households in declining economic circumstances and the expectation is that Irish households will continue to reduce their debt levels over the next number of years.I would also draw the Deputy's attention to the latest quarterly mortgage lending data, published by the IBF, which shows the number of new mortgages increased for three consecutive quarters in 2011.  Whilst the number of new mortgages is significantly below peak levels, this is the first time since Q4 2005 that the number of new mortgages has increased in three consecutive quarters and suggests some tentative signs of stabilisation in the mortgage market.

The Anglo/INBS capital contribution impacted in full on the GGB in 2010. The consideration for the Anglo/INBS capital contribution was €30.6bn of promissory notes. These Promissory Notes are an amount due from the State to IBRC. Each year, on 31 March, €3.06bn is paid by the Exchequer to Anglo/INBS as part of the scheduled repayments of the promissory notes. The first such repayment was made on 31 March 2010.***The Exchequer cost of the 2011 BoI recap is shown net of share sale to private investors (Completed in October, 2011)As the Deputy will be aware, the banks were required to raise a total of €24 billion as a result of the Central Bank's 2011 Prudential Capital Assessment Review (PCAR). However, primarily as a result of successful private equity contributions, asset sales and burden sharing with bondholders the Government only had to inject €16.5 billion into the relevant institutions.In addition, the State is committed to acquiring Irish Life for €1.3 billion to complete the recapitalisation of Irish Life and Permanent. It is expected that the proceeds of an onward sale of Irish Life in due course will reduce the amount the State has committed to the bank recapitalisation.In relation to personnel and commercial debt, there is on-going and detailed engagement between my Department and the covered institutions. The current and projected capital requirements of the institutions form part of this engagement and these are monitored and assessed on an on-going basis. The PCAR carried out in 2011 by the Central Bank independently assessed the capital requirements having regard, among other things, to the asset quality and the potential impact of such asset value/quality in base and stressed case scenarios.However, the Banks' policy in relation to credit decisions is a matter for the management and board of the institution. I have no role in the day-to-day commercial and operational decisions of the banks, which include these matters. These decisions are taken by the board and management of the institutions. Notwithstanding the fact that the State is a significant shareholder in the institutions, the banks are run on a commercial arm's length basis as per the Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies agreed with the EU Commission, the ECB and the IMF.

It is a statutory body established under the NAMA Act, 2009 and has no minimal capital requirements. I should clarify that I am advised by NAMA that it is not balance sheet insolvent.   As with any business, the key obligation for the Agency in terms of solvency, is to ensure it continues to have sufficient cash to meet its short term funding obligations. At 31 March 2012, the Agency had liquid resources of €4.6 billion, comprising cash of €3.6 billion and short-term Irish Government bonds (maturity of less than one year) of €1.0 billion. This was after the repayment of Senior Bonds of €1.25 billion during 2011 and the full repayment of the €299 million loan provided by the Central Fund to NAMA on its inception.The main charge in the 2010 financial statements was a €1.49bn loan impairment loss. This is an unrealised loss with no short term cash impact on the Agency. However, this loss did reduce the amounts of capital and reserves of the Agency. NAMA is expected to still continue to have positive reserves at end 2011.

The position is that the new measure fulfils the Government's commitment contained in its Programme for Government to increase the rate of Mortgage Interest Relief to 30 per cent for first-time buyers who took out their first mortgage in the period 2004 to 2008.  This was the period during which house prices peaked.I have sought to be as flexible as possible within the constraints pertaining.  Under the current tax legislation Mortgage Interest Relief is granted from the date the first mortgage interest payment is made.   The legislation has been amended for this particular measure to also include mortgage draw-down as a qualifying event for the rate increase.  This means that a mortgage holder will qualify for the increased rate if they made their first mortgage interest payment in the period 2004 to 2008 or if they drew down their mortgage in that period.As with all time limited reliefs, there will always be people who just miss out, and that is why I have been as flexible as possible with the legislation.  However, I do not intend to extend the parameters of the measure any further as it would become less targeted and more costly.It should be noted that individuals who took out qualifying loans in 2009 as first-time buyers are currently receiving mortgage interest relief and will continue to qualify for relief up until end 2017.

One of these measures is the "mortgage to rent" initiative.  This is a social housing response for people in the most distressed situation with their mortgage and whose home and household circumstances would be appropriate for social housing support.  Significant progress has been made on this initiative by my colleague Ms Jan O'Sullivan, TD, Minister for Housing and Planning.  A pilot scheme, utilising AIB and the Cluid housing association, has been developed by her Department and a number of cases are now being processed.  In addition, some other "mortgage to rent" cases have been advanced in respect of mortgages provided by other lenders.  It is the intention of Government to further advance this initiative in the coming months as part of the overall package of measures which are being put in place to address the mortgage arrears problem.  These include the measures that are being overseen by the Central Bank as part of the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Strategies which the Bank has required all mortgage lenders to prepare, including the specification of a timeline for the implementation of specific initiatives such as mortgage to rent by banks as a means of assisting their customers in mortgage difficulty.

As the Deputy will be aware, Relationship Frameworks were published for each of the covered banks at the end of March, 2012. These frameworks ensure that their core businesses will be run on a commercial, cost effective and independent basis designed to ensure the value of the banks as an asset to the State, as per the per the Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies agreed with the EU Commission, the ECB and the IMF.AIB, following its combination with EBS, is considered to be one of two universal pillar banks in the Irish financial system.

The Bank took various steps to raise this required capital including a rights issue.I directed the National Pension Reserve Fund (the "NPRF") Commission to participate in the Bank's rights issue.

I am further advised that the comparable figure at end 2008 was thirty three (33).   Previous Government policy on remuneration at the covered institutions was dictated initially by the recommendations of Covered Institutions Remuneration Oversight Committee.  On foot of these recommendations the then Government decided to implement a base salary cap of €500,000 on senior executives.  Consequent on the State's investment in the bank in December 2010 this policy was extended so that no employee may earn aggregate remuneration (excluding pension contributions) but including without limitation annual base salary, bonuses and variable pay components in excess of €500,000.Following on the State's further investment in July 2011, this policy — which is present Government policy — was amended further to state that no employee may receive total aggregate remuneration (excluding pension contributions) but including without limitation annual base salary, employment bonuses, commission payments and fringe benefits in excess of €500,000.The Government's bona fides in this area have been honoured by the remuneration packages agreed recently for the respective Chief Executive Officer positions at AIB and Permanent Trustee Savings Bank being contained within these parameters.While I accept the Deputy's premise that a salary of €250,000 is a considerable amount of money to pay an individual I do not accept, for a variety of reasons, that the pay ceilings introduced for CEOs of Semi States and Senior Public Sector posts should apply at the bank at this time.  The bank, which is one of the two universal pillar banks in the Irish financial system, continues to operate as a separate economic unit with independent powers of decision and functions independently from me as Minister in relation to its day-to-day operations.  My objective is to support remuneration levels which, having regard to the capital and financial position of the bank, are balanced and sufficient at all levels across the organisation in the current market to attract, motivate and retain the type of experience and talent which is required to achieve its objectives — the primary one being to protect and enhance the value for the Exchequer in relation to the substantial investment made by the State.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	801	Under the regime of flexible options on retirement first introduced in 1999, the options to invest in an ARF or to receive the balance of a pension fund in cash (after payment of the "tax-free" lump sum and subject to tax, as appropriate) are subject to conditions. The conditions include the requirements that the individual be over 75 years of age or, if younger, that the individual has either a guaranteed level of pension income ("specified income") actually in payment for life at the time the option is exercised or, alternatively, (if the individual does not wish to purchase an annuity) that he or she place a maximum set-aside amount or the remainder of the pension fund, after taking the "tax-free" lump sum, if less, into an Approved Minimum Retirement Fund (AMRF).Finance Act 2011 increased the guaranteed level of pension income required from the previous fixed amount of €12,700 introduced in 1999, to a variable amount equal to 1.5 times the maximum annual rate of the State Pension (Contributory) at the time the option is exercised, bringing the "specified income" limit to €18,000 per annum at present. Equally, the maximum set aside amount for investment into an AMRF was changed from a fixed level of €63,500 to a variable amount equal to 10 times the maximum annual rate of State Pension (Contributory) —€119,800 at present. These changes were made in the context of the extension of the flexible (ARF) options on retirement to all main scheme benefits from Defined Contribution pension arrangements. These and related changes were signalled in the National Pensions Framework document published in March 2010.The purpose of the "specified income" limit is to ensure, before an individual has unfettered access to their remaining retirement funds via an ARF, or the cash option mentioned above, that they have the security of an adequate guaranteed income in their own right throughout their retirement. A further change introduced in Budget and Finance Act 2011 is that the specified income test can be met at any time after retirement and before age 75 and not just at the point of retirement as was the case previously.To qualify as "specified income", the pension or pensions' income must actually be in payment — pensions anticipated at some time in the future cannot be brought into the reckoning until they commence to be paid. As the specified income requirement is essentially a personalised test, only guaranteed pensions income paid to the individual in his or her own right can be taken into account. Pensions paid directly to the spouse of an individual or pensions/allowances received on behalf of a spouse or dependant may not be included.  I have no plans to change these requirements in the manner suggested in the question. However, I have received a number of representations about the scale and timing of the increase in the specified income limit and I will examine these matters again without prejudice in the context of next year's Finance Bill.

This working group is discussing a number of issues of concern to the haulage industry.  I am sure the Deputy will understand that I cannot pre-empt the outcome of those discussions which are ongoing.I should point out that a fuel rebate system, as sought by the IRHA, could not under EU law be restricted to Irish licensed hauliers but would have to be extended to all vehicles intended exclusively for the carriage of goods by road with a maximum permissible gross laden weight of not less than 7.5 tonnes. In addition, the rebate would have to include the carriage of passengers by a motor vehicle of category M2 or category M3 as defined in Council Directive 70/156/EEC.

Talks have been taking place between Allied Irish Banks and the Department of Finance in relation to the severance programme.The Bank's policy in relation to recruitment, be it temporary or full-time positions, is a matter for the management and board of the institution. I have no role in the day-to-day commercial and operational decisions of the banks, which include these matters. These decisions are taken by the board and management of the institution. Notwithstanding the fact that the State is a significant shareholder in the institution, the bank is run on a commercial arm's length basis as per the Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies agreed with the EU Commission, the ECB and the IMF.However, the Bank has informed me that it continues to hire staff where it has gaps in its skills and expertise, or where the Bank needs to provide additional resources in high demand customer facing areas. Many of the resources will be on a temporary basis to support the stabilisation of the Bank as AIB implements its change programme. A small number of retired senior managers (less than 20) have been re-employed on temporary contracts to cover gaps in the Bank's skills and expertise where this has not been readily available from the market.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	804	Based on information my Department has received from the Revenue Commissioners, some €207 million of receipts previously returned as PRSI income have been reclassified as income tax in the first quarter of the year.   The basis of the income tax/USC/PRSI collection system is that employers make a payment on account, usually every month, to the Revenue Commissioners. A full reconciliation of the split between income tax/USC/PRSI is made when the statutory P35 return is made by employers the following year (return due in February).The reclassification was carried out by Revenue on the basis of the 2011 P35 returns from employers.  Such adjustments are a normal feature of Revenue's reconciliation process following the end of the year. The scale of the adjustments for 2011 was greater than for previous years however because of the impact of the USC on the overall split between income tax and PRSI.This reclassification is largely responsible for the surplus in Exchequer income tax receipts compared to profile in the first quarter of the year. However the subsidy which the Exchequer makes to the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) is also higher than expected, because PRSI income is behind target, largely as a result of the reclassification. As a consequence, the net voted current expenditure of the Department of Social Protection (D/SP), which includes the subsidy to the SIF, is also ahead of profile.It is important to note that the overall Exchequer impact of the reclassification is neutral — what is gained in income tax is counterbalanced through higher net voted current spending.

The applicant was advised on 2nd March 2012 that, as the maximum allowable amount of €15,875 had been refunded on this vehicle already, no additional refund of VAT could be made.  Furthermore, where the VRT on a vehicle has already been fully refunded/remitted at an earlier date under the scheme, there is no residual VRT available to be refunded on a subsequent sale of that vehicle to a second qualifying person.  The upper limit of €15,875 is prescribed under the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations (S.I. No. 353 of 1994).In cases where a vehicle has obtained full relief or the prescribed limits have been reached under the relevant provisions and the vehicle is subsequently purchased by another "qualifying person" for their use, the vehicle still qualifies for relief from Motor Tax and the claimant is also entitled to repayment of Excise Duty on fuel. The person (details supplied) is entitled to these concessions and will be informed accordingly.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	806	I propose to take Questions Nos. 207 to 209, inclusive, together.I am advised by the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI) that they require all credit institutions authorised and operating in Ireland to maintain a minimum level of solvency on an on-going basis. The prevailing EU standard is the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD) which has been transposed into Irish law by Statutory Instruments 660 and 661 of 2006. In simple terms, the CRD requires banks to hold capital equivalent to 8% Total Capital as a percentage of risk weighted assets. In broad terms, this is a "higher" level of solvency than that which is provided for under the Companies Acts.In the case of the Irish banks subject to the Central Bank's Prudential Capital Assessment Review (PCAR), additional capital above the minimum solvency requirement has been required to be raised and held. The quantum of additional capital required has been calculated with reference to higher on-going capital standards (e.g. 10.5% Core Tier 1) and to the PCAR stress test, which included items such as the capital impact of planned deleveraging, future funding and liquidity needs, future loan impairment provisions, operating income projections and other additional stresses.The CBI was of the opinion that Irish banks needed to be capitalised well in excess of minimum internationally agreed regulatory levels to protect against any future shocks to the financial system and to restore confidence in Irish banks.  The PCAR 2011 announced on 31 March 2011, required the Irish banks to raise €24 billion of additional capital, which for conservatism included equity and contingent capital buffers totalling €5.3 billion.Following the publication of PCAR 2011, the Government committed to meeting the recapitalisation requirements of the Irish banks to ensure that the Irish banking system is returned to health. We agreed with the CBI and the External Partners that a period of time would be allowed to meet this requirement, to ensure appropriate private sector involvement and thereby reducing the cost of the recapitalisation to the taxpayer.  These actions included seeking further significant contributions from subordinated debt holders, by the sale of assets to generate capital and by seeking private sector investors.  This reduced the recapitalisation cost in 2011 to €16.5 billion.It was previously intended that the outstanding €1.3 billion capital requirement for Irish Life and Permanent plc. would be partially satisfied on completion of a sale of Irish Life. Following the suspension of the sale process in November 2011 it has now been agreed with our External Partners that the recapitalisation will be completed by end-June 2012 and it has also been decided that a State acquisition of the company would be the most effective mechanism to complete the recapitalisation.

It is managed and controlled by the Central Bank Commission.    The Minister for Finance is the sole subscriber to and holder of the Central Bank's capital. The Central Bank's surplus income is payable to the Exchequer in accordance with regulations made in accordance with section 32H of the Central Bank Act 1942.The members of the Central Bank Commission are the Governor and the Secretary General of the Department of Finance, appointed by the Government, the Deputy Governors, appointed by the Central Bank Commission and between 6 and 8 ordinary members appointed by the Minister for Finance. The current members of the Commission are: Prof. Patrick Honohan, Mr. John Moran, Mr. Matthew Elderfield, Mr. Stefan Gerlach, Mr. Michael Soden, Mr. Alan Ahearne, Ms Blanaid Clarke, Prof. John Fitzgerald and Mr. Des Geraghty.In accordance with section 32L of the Central Bank Act 1942 (as amended by the Central Bank Reform Act 2010), the Central Bank submits a performance statement annually to the Minister for Finance which is then laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	808	The information the Deputy seeks — names and details of Directors (including public interest directors) at the covered institutions, remit, performance and terms and conditions — is available in the recently published Annual Accounts for 2011 of the 3 respective covered institutions — namely Allied Irish Banks, Bank of Ireland and Irish Life and Permanent.The legislative power to appoint such directors arises from the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) [CIFS] Scheme 2008.  Originally there were twelve (12) such appointments — two (2) at each of the then six (6) institutions.  While the individuals were nominated by the then Minister for Finance the appointments are made and remunerated by the respective boards of the institutions.  With the changed status of some of the institutions over time six directors, at the institutions cited above, remain in situ.As regards the responsibilities of directors, I am advised that the legal position is that any director appointed to the board of the covered institutions, whether under the CIFS Scheme or otherwise, is subject to the requirements of company law in relation to the discharge of their responsibilities as a company director.  As such, the director is legally bound to act in what he or she believes are the interests of the separate legal entity that is the institution itself.  These are the director's so called fiduciary responsibilities.In light of the foregoing and the scope for actual and perceived conflicts between the fiduciary duties of the directors of financial institutions under company law and the wider public interest in circumstances that those institutions have received huge financial support from the State, legal clarity, not just to the role of the public interest director but to that of the entire boards of those institutions, was brought under the provisions of Section 48 of the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act 2010.  It provides that the overriding duty of all directors, at the covered institutions, relates to the public interest as set out in the Act.The recently agreed and published Relationship Frameworks between the Minister for Finance and the covered institutions specify that the board of the institution must ensure strict compliance with its regulatory and legal obligations arising under the Act.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	809	The Central Bank of Ireland is responsible for financial regulation in Ireland. The Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority (the Financial Regulator) ceased to exist on 1 October 2010 with the commencement the relevant provisions of the Central Bank Reform Act 2010, which created a single structure within the Central Bank controlled and managed by the Central Bank Commission. The powers and functions of the Financial Regulator were subsumed into the Central Bank of Ireland.   Under sections 19 and 23 of the Central Bank Act 1942, as amended in 2010, the terms and conditions of employment of the Central Bank Governor and the Deputy Governor (fulfilling the role largely filled by the former office of Financial Regulator) are matters for the Central Bank Commission.  Therefore, I am not privy to the contractual arrangements that apply.  However, I am informed by the Central Bank that both positions are subject to the Ethics in Public Office Act and the Central Bank's Code of Ethics and Behaviour.  It would not be appropriate for me to comment on the contractual position of individuals who have held these posts previously.Finally, regarding reckless trading and personal liability, the obligations of managers of regulated financial service providers imposed by Irish financial service legislation are in addition to any obligations imposed on them by other law. As regards the Companies Acts, financial institutions are in the same position as all other companies.The Central Bank has referred a number of issues to the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement concerning appropriate standards of behaviour on the part of a number of institutions. These issues are currently the subject of investigations by the Director of Corporate Enforcement and the Garda Síochána.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	810	I should point out to the Deputy that there is no "Irish euro"; the euro is the common currency of the Member States in the eurozone.    The amount of euro banknotes on the balance sheet of the Central Bank of Ireland represents Ireland's share of total euro banknotes in circulation. Ireland is currently allocated 1.46 per cent of the total euro banknotes in circulation based on its fully paid up share of the capital of the European Central Bank (ECB). Euro banknotes are backed by assets which relate to Eurosystem monetary policy operations, and primarily comprise loans provided to credit institutions and securities (Government bonds) purchased in connection with monetary policy operations. The income earned on assets backing the euro banknotes in circulation is pooled by all Eurosystem National Central Banks and distributed back to these national Central Banks in accordance with their respective share of the ECB's capital.The issue of euro banknotes is not subject to quantitative or other limits.   Banknotes are printed in accordance with a pooled production system within the European System of Central Banks.  Under this system, the ECB coordinates the annual banknote requirements of the eurosystem with the National Central Banks and allocates banknote production.The Central Bank of Ireland is typically allocated one denomination per year. Under this pooled production arrangement, the Central Bank of Ireland printed 114.37 million €5 banknotes in 2011. The balance of Ireland's euro banknote requirements are drawn from the pooled production system within the European System of Central Banks.There are currently 16 printing works fully accredited by the ECB to print euro banknotes. In Ireland our production allocation of euro banknotes is printed by the Central Bank of Ireland. All accredited printing works must report progress on the production of banknotes to the ECB on a regular basis.The Deputy also asked whether there is any legal or other requirement that loans advanced by banks should be underpinned by assets or deposits of any kind held by those banks. I am advised by the Central Bank that, as part of its approach to monetary policy implementation, the ECB requires credit institutions in the euro area to hold compulsory deposits on account with national Central Banks. The amount of required reserves to be held by each institution is determined by its reserve base. The reserve base of an institution is defined in relation to prescribed elements of its balance sheet.Banks are also required to meet the solvency requirements of the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD) which implements the Basel II capital framework in the European Union. By requiring banks to hold minimum levels of capital to absorb unexpected losses that a bank may face, capital requirements provide for continuing bank solvency so that they can continue to provide credit and other functions into the economy.The Central Bank of Ireland is responsible, in accordance with the legislation transposing the CRD into Irish law, for the regulation and supervision of the capital, or solvency, requirements of banks in Ireland. Irish banks are required to calculate capital requirements and maintain a minimum level of own funds in accordance with the CRD as a cushion against credit and other risks and to absorb unexpected losses that a bank may face.In addition to capital requirements imposed under the CRD, I am advised that the Central Bank, as part of its prudential oversight of banks in Ireland, imposes qualitative and quantitative requirements on banks in relation to the management of liquidity risk.Arising from the recent financial crisis, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision adopted amendments to the Basel capital framework in December 2010 to significantly increase the quality and quantity of capital held within the banking system relative to banks' risk-weighted assets and to impose standard liquidity requirements. These changes, known as Basel III, will require amendments to the Capital Requirements Directive which will be implemented in due course in the EU.The Deputy also asks whether money generation is carried out as a short or long-term liquidity measure or for the purposes of quantitative easing to facilitate banks within the State. The Central Bank has advised me that the majority of Eurosystem liquidity provision takes the form of collateralised loans to eligible counterparties, which include Irish banks.

As such it is not the role of Government to review licence conditions imposed by the Central Bank in its regulatory capacity. I have been informed by the Central Bank that it does not comment on the individual licence conditions imposed on specific credit institutions and that once a licence is issued it becomes the property of the relevant credit institution and thus the Central Bank retains no right to publish copies.   However, pursuant to Section 12(1) of the Central Bank Act 1971, the Central Bank publishes a register of licensed institutions on its website.The Central Bank does not impose any general restrictions on foreign credit institutions operating in Ireland, however, the Central Bank has the power to impose specific licence conditions on any domestic or foreign credit institution licensed to operate in Ireland.Section 7 of the Central Bank Act 1971 (as amended) provides that ‘Subject to the provisions of this Act, a person, other than a Bank, shall not, in or outside the State, carry on banking business or hold himself out or represent himself as a banker or as carrying on banking business or on behalf of any other person accept deposits or other repayable funds from the public, unless he is the holder of a licence'.  Under section 58 of the Central Bank Act 1971, contravention of section 7 is an offence.In the event of a customer being affected by a credit institution operating in breach of regulatory requirements, that customer has in the first instance the option of seeking redress from the institution in question. Failing that or if the customer is not satisfied with the outcome, there is the option of bringing the dispute to the Financial Services Ombudsman or the Courts. Whether or not the customer is successful in securing redress for any loss suffered would depend on the circumstances of the case.I would like to inform the Deputy that I propose to shortly bring forward amendments at Committee Stage of the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Bill which will introduce greater clarity for customers seeking compensation for losses arising from the failure of a credit institution to comply with its obligations.Failure to comply with the conditions of a banking licence could result in administrative sanction by the Central Bank.  The Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Bill 2011 provides that such a sanction may include suspension or revocation of a banking licence.Section 11 of the Central Bank Act 1971 sets out the grounds for revocation of a bank licence including if the holder becomes unable to meet his obligations to his creditors or suspends payments lawfully due.

There are a number of liquidity ratios in place affecting banks that have to be complied with and reported to the Central Bank of Ireland.  They would include Loan to Deposit Ratios (under PCAR, they are targeted to be 122.5% at the end of 2013) and Liquidity Coverage Ratios.  A new regulatory regime, under Basle III, will also seek to ensure that there is a Net Stable Funding Ratio that is satisfied.  Irish banks will continue to have to satisfy these international standards for liquidity on their balance sheets.

Banks would typically have raised unsecured and secured funding.  Deposits would be an example of the former and securitisation or covered bonds an example of the latter.  If there was to be secured transactions, there would have been full due diligence from a legal and accounting perspective including any issues relating to compliance with loan agreements and any required notice to or consent from borrowers.

I have been advised by the Central Bank that Chapter 11 of the Consumer Protection Code sets out in detail what records (and compliance with same) a regulated financial entity must keep on behalf of a borrower.Under section 11.6 of that Chapter, a regulated entity must retain details of individual transactions for six years after the date on which the particular transaction is discontinued or completed. A regulated entity must retain all other records for six years from the date on which the regulated entity ceased to provide any product or service to the borrower.If a borrower is in dispute with regard to the paying off of a loan and the lack of records to verify this, that matter should be referred to senior management in the regulated entity for examination and resolution. If satisfaction is not received, then the matter should be referred on to the Financial Services Ombudsman, who can investigate in an impartial and independent manner the complaint from the borrower.

There are no requirements on the banks in relation to ‘default insurance' and it is left to each bank management to determine their own, appropriate strategy.   The Central Bank of Ireland sets reserving requirements for financial institutions and have issued guidelines in relation to provisioning.

The Frameworks were prepared in the context of EU and Irish competition law considerations and commitments made in connection with the EU/IMF Programme for Financial Support for Ireland.The Frameworks provide, inter alia, that each bank will continue to operate at arm's length from the State; each bank will remain a separate economic unit with independent powers of decision; the board of each bank will determine the bank's strategy and commercial policy, including the adoption of its business plan and budget; and the State will not intervene in the day-to-day operations of the banks or their management decisions including with respect to pricing and lending decisions.I expect the Board and management team of each of the banks to conduct their commercial operations in a prudent and sustainable manner which seeks to create commercially oriented credit institutions.  This will ensure the maximisation of value of the banks as an asset to the State and the taxpayer.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	817	I am advised that the process of issuing new bonds is normally through underwriting, where one or more securities firms or banks form a syndicate buying the entire bond issue from the issuer and then re-selling to investors. Primary issuance is arranged by these syndicates who contact potential investors and advise the bond issuer in terms of timing, tenor and pricing of the bond issue. The bond issuer will likely have little knowledge of the original owners of the bonds; also these initial investors may over time sell the bonds to other investors.Bonds are usually issued in bearer form which means that the purchasers of the bonds are unknown, with the bonds usually held by a securities depository company (e.g. Euroclear and Clearstream). When paying interest and principal the bond issuer will transfer the required funds to the securities depository company who in turn will pay the funds through to the bondholders.The function of the securities depository company is to receive the appropriate interest or principal payment for the entire bond issue from the issuer and to distribute the required amounts to the individual bondholders. This is a standard process for all such issuances. Therefore throughout this entire process the bond issuer is unaware of the individual bondholders' details.I am satisfied that advice provided by the ECB is based purely on its merits having regard to the role and function of the ECB. Further, I understand that the Members of the ECB Executive Board are, as one would expect, subject to stringent conflict-of-interest protocols.

The Board is responsible for achieving the Business Plan and the Minister will play no role in day-to-day operational and commercial matters relating to its achievement, except to the extent he believes it is necessary to do so in order to realise the Objectives, in which case the Board shall comply with such instructions or policies as the Minister may issue.The relationship Framework further provides that the bank shall obtain the prior consent of the Minister before appointing auditors or any third party financial or legal advisers where their appointment or work is, in the view of the Minister, material to this Relationship Framework, the realisation of the Objectives or the achievement of the Business Plan or the Legacy Plan (the "Advisers"). All work undertaken by such Advisers shall be consistent with the Objectives. The Board shall comply with any instructions given by the Minister in relation to the use by Anglo Irish Bank of Advisers.In the case of the appointment of the Company referred to in the question the Minister's prior approval was not sought nor were his views on whether the appointment was material to the Relationship Framework sought. It was considered at the time by the bank that the appointment of the Company was "normal course business", of limited duration, the engagement did not constitute the appointment of financial or legal advisors and that the scope of the engagement was consistent with the Objectives and the requirements of the Restructuring plan. As indicated in the response to a previous Parliamentary Question my Department was aware of proposals to engage the Company from late October 2010.As the Deputy will be aware the Relationship Framework has been revised in recent weeks to reflect the evolving role and relationship with IBRC having regard to the Restructuring Plan approved by the EU Commission. A copy of the revised Relationship is published on the Department's website http://banking.finance.gov.ie/wp-content/uploads/Irish-Bank-Resolution-Corporation1.pdf.

I have sought to be as flexible as possible within the constraints pertaining.  Under the current tax legislation Mortgage Interest Relief is granted from the date the first mortgage interest payment is made.  The legislation has been amended for this particular measure to also include mortgage draw-down as a qualifying event for the rate increase.  This means that a mortgage holder will qualify for the increased rate if they made their first mortgage interest payment in the period 2004 to 2008 or if they drew down their mortgage in that period.Unfortunately, based on the information provided, the person in question does not qualify for the increased rate of relief.  However, he/she should still continue to qualify for the current rates of relief for first-time buyers.  It should be noted that Mortgage Interest Relief is set to be abolished at the end of 2017.As with all time limited reliefs, there will always be people who just miss out, and that is why I have been as flexible as possible with the legislation.  However, I do not intend to extend the parameters of the measure any further as it would become less targeted and more costly.

I am informed by Revenue that they have established that the loan in question was drawn down within the qualifying period 1 January 2004 to 31 December 2008 and that the individual is entitled to the increased 30% rate.Revenue is currently working with lenders to give effect to mortgage interest relief at source measures encompassed in the 2012 Finance Act.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	827	Employment data are presented in net terms and information on gross flows into and out of employment is not available, making it difficult to assess the number of jobs created by any policy initiative.  Having said that, I think it's fair to say that there are tentative signs of an improvement in labour market conditions.  For instance, the latest data show that employment increased by 0.6 per cent (the equivalent of 10,000 jobs) in the final quarter of last year, the first increase in four years, and I am encouraged by this.  In addition, there has been a modest fall in the Live Register in the opening months of this year.So leaving aside the fact that quantifying the impact is difficult, I am confident that the measures introduced by the Government in May, such as reducing the rate of VAT in the high value added tourism sector, are playing an important role in both creating and sustaining employment.Finally, I want to reiterate that addressing the difficulties in the labour market remains the Government's biggest challenge and, accordingly, Government is giving its highest priority to job protection and job creation.

The purpose of this review is to determine if there was a way to reduce the overall cost to the State. Part of the capitalisation of IBRC was provided using promissory notes as consideration.  While the development in relation to the end March Promissory Note payment is positive, we must continue to work towards the greater benefits which would derive from the re-engineering of the promissory note.  There are potential improvements for the banking sector which could also stem from the ongoing technical discussions.It is for these reasons that we must look at the recent developments as an initial step in a process.  This is a the medium term project.  The Government is focused on developing an alternative solution to the promissory note arrangement in IBRC.  We want to arrive at a successful conclusion that is in the interests of Ireland and the EU.

The Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland, Mr Patrick Honohan attended the recent ECB meeting of Central Bank Governors.  The Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland has since appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform on Tuesday 27 March 2012.  Pursuant to Section 19A (2) of the Central Bank Act 1942, as amended (the "1942 Act"), the Governor has sole responsibility for the performance of the functions imposed, and the exercise of powers conferred, on the Bank by or under the Rome Treaty or the statute of the European System of Central Banks (the "ESCB") and of the ECB (the "ESCB Statute").Article 10 of the ESCB Statute outlines the operation of the Governing Council. Key provisions to note are, (a) Article 10.1 of the ESCB Statute which states that the Governing Council shall comprise the members of the Executive Board of the ECB and the governors of the national central banks of the Member States whose currency is the euro, (b) Article 10.2 which outlines the voting mechanisms of the Governing Council and (c) Article 10.4 which provides that the proceedings of Governing Council meetings shall be confidential, however the Governing Council may decide to make the outcome of its deliberations public.It should be noted that in carrying out the functions of the Bank imposed by the ESCB Statute, the Governor is subject to Article 7 of the ESCB Statute which provides that "neither the ECB, nor a national central bank, nor any member of their decision-making bodies shall seek or take instructions from Union institutions, bodies, offices or agencies, from any government of a Member State or from any other body".

This survey is the latest of three surveys jointly commissioned by Revenue and the Office of Tobacco Control in the Department of Health in order to estimate the proportion of cigarettes consumed in the State that had not been taxed in this jurisdiction.  The earlier surveys were in respect of the years 2009 and 2010 and these estimated that 20% of cigarettes consumed in the State had not been taxed in this jurisdiction.  This figure was further broken down as 14% illicit product and 6% legally imported by passengers arriving into the State from other jurisdictions.  Based on the estimate of 14%, the loss to the exchequer from illicit cigarette consumption during 2009 and 2010 would be in the region of €250m (excise duty + VAT), per year.  There is on-going close co-operation and sharing of information between Revenue and the Office of Tobacco Control in relation to their respective areas of responsibility in relation to all aspects of the tobacco market.I am advised that a group composed of representatives of the Department of Health and the Health Services Executive is undertaking a review of tobacco policy and that it will consult with other relevant public bodies, including the Revenue Commissioners, in the course of its work.

I am sure the Deputy will understand that I cannot pre-empt the outcome of those discussions which are ongoing.  I should point out that a fuel rebate system, as sought by the IRHA, could not under EU law be restricted to Irish licensed hauliers but would have to be extended to all vehicles intended exclusively for the carriage of goods by road with a maximum permissible gross laden weight of not less than 7.5 tonnes.

In the case of a betting exchange established in the State, the commission charged to customers is chargeable to VAT at the standard rate of 23 per cent.  An exemption from VAT will apply, however, in the case of a remote betting intermediary, within the meaning of section 64 of the Finance Act 2002, in respect of the supply of services the consideration for which consists of commission charges that are subject to betting intermediary duty imposed by section 67B of that Act.  The coming into operation of betting intermediary duty, and the exemption from VAT for the supply of services to which that duty applies, are subject to Ministerial commencement orders.  The making of those orders would follow the enactment of the proposed Betting (Amendment) Bill that is being drafted at present and which will provide the regulatory framework for the licensing of remote betting intermediaries and bookmakers.

a) Cost of Tax Credits, Allowances and Reliefs 2008 and 2009
The following table IT 6 shows the estimated cost in terms of revenue forgone of the personal tax credits and the main reliefs and deductions allowable under the income tax system.  A number of reliefs which apply both to individuals and companies is also included and the cost shown in relation to these reliefs covers income tax and corporation tax.An adjustment is included in the cost figures applying to income tax to compensate for incomplete numbers of tax returns on record at the time of compiling the estimates.The tax credits and reliefs listed in the table serve varying  purposes.  Many are essentially structural reliefs through which individual tax liabilities are adjusted to reflect relative taxable capacity.  The main personal tax credits are a good example of this since they may be regarded as part of the progressive income tax structure representing a band of income chargeable at a zero rate.  Others, such as relief for interest paid in full or investment in corporate trades, are tax-based incentives in favour of specific  groups or activities which are designed to promote certain aspects of public policy.In computing taxable profits, account needs to be taken in some way of the depreciation of capital assets incurred in earning those profits.  To this extent, the figures in the table of the "costs" of capital allowances should not be regarded as measuring a "loss of tax revenue" on profits.  To compute such "loss", regard would have to be had to the excess of the amount of the capital allowances at current rates over the amount of the normal allowances.The figures shown for the basic personal tax credits (married, single and widowed) are the costs of these tax credits as if all other tax credits and the exemption limits did not apply.  They do not include individuals who are not on Revenue records because their incomes are below the income tax thresholds.  The cost figures for the exemption limits are based on the excess of the exemption limits over the basic personal tax credits.The figures of cost are for 2008 and 2009 and all figures are based on tax due in respect of assessments for each year and not on tax receipts within that year.The figure against each credit or allowance represents the additional tax which would become payable if the tax credit or allowance were withdrawn assuming no consequent change in the behaviour of taxpayers (for example, in relation to the reliefs for savings), or the amounts of payments (for example, interest payable on certain savings schemes might need adjustment to take account of the new tax liability).The numbers of claimants of each credit or relief are shown for both years to the extent that they are available.  The numbers included are the taxpayers who would be adversely affected by the withdrawal of the respective credit or relief.In the calculations, each tax credit or allowance has been dealt with separately and on the assumption that the rest of the tax system remained unchanged.  It would be therefore inaccurate to calculate the effect of withdrawing all the credits, reliefs and allowances by simply totalling the figures.  For example, the costs shown for capital allowances and stock relief are also calculated on the basis of separate withdrawal of these reliefs.  Their combined cost would be greater than the sum of the separate costs because allowances are not always fully set off against available profits.  For instance, a person with €1,000 gross trading profits, €1,000 capital allowances and €1,000 stock relief would pay no tax if either of the reliefs were withdrawn but would pay tax on €1,000 profits if both reliefs were withdrawn.  In this case, the cost of each relief separately is nil but the combined cost is tax on €1,000.  Basic data is not available to enable an estimate of the combined cost of these reliefs to be made.The figures for estimates based on tax returns have been grossed up to an overall expected level to adjust for incompleteness in the numbers of returns on record at the time the data was extracted for analytical purposes.Apart from the artists exemption, these figures do not take account of the application of the restriction of reliefs originally provided for in section 17 of Finance Act 2006, which took effect from 1 January 2007.  The restriction was extended by Section 23 Finance Act 2010.Finally, the estimates shown in many cases are tentative and are subject to revision in the light of later information.

c) Notes on Table IT 6
(1) Figures accompanied by an asterisk * are particularly tentative and subject to a considerable margin of error.(2) The cost figures for the exemption limits are based on the excess of the exemption limits over the basic personal tax credits.  They include the cost of marginal relief for taxpayers whose incomes are not greatly in excess of the exemption limits.(3) The figures shown for the basic personal tax credits (married, single and widowed) are the costs of these tax credits as if all other tax credits and the exemption limits did not apply.  They do not include individuals who are not on Revenue records because their incomes are below the income tax thresholds.(4) Arising from the change over to Tax Relief at Source the figures relate to the number of policies issued.  These include policies where subscriptions were paid by businesses on behalf of their employees.(5) Part of the cost of contributions to Permanent Health Benefit Schemes is not identifiable as a result of the move to a "net pay" basis for contributions by PAYE taxpayers from 6 April 2001.(6) See the following  note on  "Green Paper on Pensions" for background commentary on the basis of the cost figures.(7) "Other" relates to borrowings for purposes such as acquiring an interest in a company or partnership.(8) The income on which the cost of  exemption from income tax for charities, colleges, hospitals, schools, friendly societies, etc. is based includes dividend income on which income tax deducted at source has been repaid, other investment income, payments received under covenant, donations by the PAYE sector to approved bodies together with the associated tax relief and donations by the self-employed and corporate sectors to approved bodies and approved sports bodies.  Information is not available about other income received gross.(9) The cost figures for relief for certain Sports Persons are based on income tax self assessment returns and for donations to Approved Sports Bodies are based on income tax and corporation tax self assessment returns.(10) In the absence of other information, tax has been assumed at the standard rate of income tax even though a different rate might be more appropriate.(11) The costs and numbers for the Exemption of Statutory Redundancy Payments are based on external data.  From 2009 the "numbers" indicate the numbers of claims received in the year and not the numbers of claims approved.(12) The costs included for corporation tax are by reference to accounting periods which ended in the years 2008 and 2009.(13) The cost shown for capital allowances does not include any cost associated with "unused capital allowances", that is, capital allowances which are not absorbed by a company in the accounting period in which they arise because they exceed the amount of the company's profits of that accounting period which are available for offset.  Unused capital allowances can be offset as losses against taxable profits arising in the previous accounting period and against certain profits arising in future accounting periods and can be offset against the profits of another company in the same group of companies.  It is estimated that €3587 million and €5373 million of unused capital allowances were claimed in respect of 2008 and 2009 accounting periods respectively but as the proportion of this item which is included in previous years losses and in group relief is not separately identifiable a reliable estimate of the cost of the capital allowance element cannot be provided.(14) The tax cost shown for section 23 type relief is the estimated ultimate tax cost relating to the total allowable expenditure in respect of claims made in 2008 and 2009 tax returns for the first time.  The cost shown is for income tax cases only.(15)  the cost shown for manufacturing relief for 2008 is compiled using the basic data available but for  technical reasons associated with a system redesign it is understood to be  understated by at least €100m.(16) The costs shown for R&D is for claims for R&D on corporation tax returns for accounting periods ending in 2008 and 2009.  However, the cost  for 2009 includes the amount of credit allowed against 2009 tax together with the amount offset against tax of previous accounting periods and as payable credits.
d) Note on Green Paper on Pensions — Review of estimates of cost
As part of the work on the Green Paper on Pensions, a review was carried out of the current regime of incentives for supplementary pension provision with a view to developing more comprehensive and reliable estimates of the cost of reliefs in this area.  The review examined, among other things, the current reliefs and incentives for investment in supplementary pensions and the data available on which to base reliable estimates of the costs in revenue foregone to the Exchequer.The review drew on newly available 2006 aggregate data on contributions to pension schemes by employers and employees arising from a P35 initiative introduced on foot of provisions that were included in Finance Act 2004 with a view to improving data quality.  Estimates of the cost of tax for private pension provision updated for 2008 and 2009 are included in table IT6.The breakdown and make-up of these estimated costs of reliefs differ from presentations of costs in this area for years prior to 2005 in a number of respects and are not directly comparable.  further details on the cost of tax and other reliefs and the changes in the methodology are contained in pages 106 and 107 of the Green Paper on Pensions which is available at www.pensionsgreenpaper.ie.
e) Estimate of cost of certain property-based tax incentives and incomes exempt from tax for 2008 and 2009

Certain property-based tax incentives and incomes exempt from tax  — uptake and estimated potential cost to the Exchequer in terms of income tax and corporation tax forgone based on 2008 and 2009 tax returns
Provisions were included in the Finance Acts of 2003 and 2004 to enable new statistical data on the uptake of tax relief for certain property-based tax incentives and incomes exempt from tax to be obtained from tax returns.  This information, derived from changes introduced by the Revenue Commissioners to income tax returns and corporation tax returns for 2008 and 2009, is set out in the following tables.The figures shown include the amounts claimed in the year but exclude amounts carried forward into the year either as losses or capital allowances, and include any amounts of unused losses and/or capital allowances which will be carried forward to subsequent years.Tax Incentive/Income Exemption 2008Amount ClaimedAssumed maximum tax cost €mNumber of claimants€m€mUrban renewal230.887.03,367Town Renewal61.624.2998Seaside Resorts16.16.41,091Rural Renewal88.435.72,803Multi-storey car parks16.86.6134Living Over the shop6.42.681Enterprise Areas6.32.5138Park and Ride1.80.721Holiday Cottages36.914.8844Hotels305.5116.41,996Nursing Homes48.419.8734Housing for the Elderly/infirm7.43.0179Hostels1.680.6922Guest Houses0.290.1210Convalescent Homes1.40.532Qualifying Private Hospitals30.212.3342Qualifying sports injury clinics4.11.760Buildings Used for certain child care purposes30.312.2519Qualifying Mental Health Centres0.10.03Student Accommodation60.023.5814Caravan Camps1.50.610Mid-Shannon Corridor Tourism Infrastructure1.80.712Exemption of profits or gains from Greyhounds0.00.010Exemption of profits or gains from Stallions92.315.1192Exemption of profits or gains from Woodlands51.013.62,492Exempt Patents (Section 234, TCA 1997)198.351.71,209Totals1,299.2452.618,111Tax Incentive/Income Exemption 2009Amount ClaimedAssumed maximum tax cost €mNumber of claimants€m€mUrban renewal233.893.13410Town Renewal45.418.31,001Seaside Resorts13.35.3875Rural Renewal70.028.02,653Multi-storey car parks13.25.2130Living Over the shop4.11.766Enterprise Areas5.42.1118Park and Ride2.00.820Holiday Cottages34.713.9786Hotels263.2102.11,906Nursing Homes54.421.6750Housing for the Elderly/infirm6.82.8145Hostels0.730.314Guest Houses0.240.18Convalescent Homes1.30.528Qualifying Private Hospitals30.512.5346Qualifying sports injury clinics3.61.567Buildings Used for certain child care purposes30.812.5527Qualifying Mental Health Centres0.10.01Student Accommodation48.319.1751Caravan Camps0.60.22Mid Shannon Corridor Tourism Infrastructure0.60.22Exemption of profits or gains from Greyhounds0.00.05Exemption of profits or gains from Stallions2.00.432Exemption of profits or gains from Woodlands48.214.43,570Exempt Patents (section 234, TCA 1997)260.771.71,268Other Totals52.61,226.619.5447.863519,116These figures do not take account of the application of the restriction of reliefs originally provided for in section 17 of Finance Act 2006 and which took effect from 1 January 2007. The restriction was extended by Section 23 Finance Act 2010.
Notes:
The figures shown  relate to the various reliefs/incentives and exemptions as specified in the 2008 and 2009 form 11 and CT1.There were concerns that in some instances the new, separately categorised data on property incentives may not have been correctly entered on the Tax returns.  Revenue drew the attention of the relevant tax practitioner bodies to these deficiencies to rectify them in future returns and also increased awareness among its own staff involved in processing tax  returns of the need to ensure, through closer examination of the returns, that they are correctly completed.The estimated costs have assumed tax foregone at the 41% rate in the case of income tax and 12.5% in the case of corporation tax.  This means the figures shown correspond to the maximum Exchequer cost in terms of income tax and corporation tax.  However, the actual Exchequer cost could be lower, particularly in relation to the exempt income items, as the income could be subject to deductions for allowable expenses and other costs thereby reducing the level of income that would be actually  subject to tax.Some of the costs shown above are included in the costs shown for capital allowances and section 23 relief in Table IT6.  However, exempt income included above is not part of capital allowances.
f) Note on reliefs in respect of which costs are not currently quantifiable or are negligible or are not identifiable within total aggregates.

Examples of this type of relief would include:
Relief from averaging of farm profits;Exemption for income arising from payments in respect of personal injuries;Exemption of certain payments made by Haemophilia HIV Trust;Exemption of lump sum retirement payments;Relief for allowable motor expenses;Tapering relief allowable for taxation of car benefits in kind;Reduced tax rate   for authorised unit trust schemes;Reduced tax rate   for special  investment schemes;Exemption of certain grants made by Údarás na Gaeltachta;Relief for investment income reserved for policy holders in life assurance companies;Relief for various business related expenses such as staff recruitment, rent, legal fees, and other general expenses;Exemption in certain circumstances on the interest on quoted bearer Eurobonds;Exemption of payments made as compensation for loss of office;Exemption of scholarship income;Exemption for income received under Sceim na bhFoghlaimeoiri Gaeilge.

This working group is discussing a number of issues of concern to the haulage industry.  I am sure the Deputy will understand that I cannot pre-empt the outcome of those discussions which are ongoing.  I should point out that a fuel rebate system, as sought by the IRHA, could not under EU law be restricted to Irish licensed hauliers but would have to be extended to all vehicles intended exclusively for the carriage of goods by road with a maximum permissible gross laden weight of not less than 7.5 tonnes.  In addition, the rebate would have to include the carriage of passengers by a motor vehicle of category M2 or category M3 as defined in Council Directive 70/156/EEC.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	840	Review missions to Ireland by the three external partners, the EU, the ECB and the IMF (the Troika) take place on a quarterly basis.  As the Deputy may be aware, a mission is currently in progress which began yesterday, Tuesday April 17th and will continue until Thursday April 26th.  Verification of the relevant quarterly targets forms a key part of the mission.  The Government has repeatedly stated its commitment to the Programme targets.  Meeting these conditions on time and on target, is the best way to ensure that we emerge successfully from this programme, which is our primary focus.  That will mean that we can return safely to the financial markets for funding in as timely a manner as possible. This is one of the principal objectives of the programme.  The Government's commitment to the Programme does not stop us from seeking and agreeing changes to aspects of the programme.  We have already done this successfully.  The Government will continue to do so at the appropriate time.Following each review mission, and arising from detailed and lengthy discussions with the Troika team during it, revised versions of the programme documents, including the Memorandum of Understanding on Specific Economic Policy Conditionality, are prepared by my officials before being submitted to the External Partners.  It would be premature at this stage to comment on the possible outcome of these discussions.However, it  is also important to note that the relevant programme documents are made publically available at the end of the process.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	841	The debate around the adequacy of monitoring of private borrowing and lending during the years 2002 and 2008 has been addressed in various reports and studies into the Irish banking crisis.  These reports from Professor Patrick Honohan, Messrs Regling and Watson and the Nyberg Commission identified that poor supervision, an overly-deferential attitude by regulators, poor assessment of risks and a lack of follow-through on enforcement, all played a part in the financial crisis and set out the problems that needed to be addressed in the banking regulation area.While these reports disclosed the shortfalls in both Regulatory and Financial Stability policy, the Central Bank, in its Financial Stability role, did assess the level of borrowing and lending in the system and highlighted its concerns in its regular publications.I am not in a position to comment on the monitoring role of the Central Banks of other EU countries.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	842	My Eurogroup colleagues and I are acutely aware of the need for Member Sates to remain on the agreed fiscal path.  We are also conscious of the institutional deficiencies that played a significant part in creating the crisis, and I think its fair to say that substantial progress has been made in terms of retro-fitting the necessary tools and mechanisms to make the monetary union function better.  We also have a shared understanding regarding the need to vigorously implement the 'five-point' strategy agreed at European level last year, so that we continue to build on the positive momentum that became evident in the first quarter of this year.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	843	As the Deputy will be aware, Ireland's progress in implementing its programme targets is assessed through a quarterly review process.  The mission element of the sixth review started this week.  Our record of programme implementation has been second to none, a fact repeatedly acknowledged by the EU and IMF authorities.  It is also recognised more widely.  Each review is subject to approval by euro area/EU Finance Ministers and this has been provided without difficulty on each occasion.The success of our programme implementation has also been recognised by the financial markets.  Our 10 year bond yields have remained below 7% for a number of weeks now.  In addition, the NTMA has successfully re-engaged with the markets through the recent bond swap.  These are all positive indications.  They reflect our resolve successfully emerging from our programme at the end of 2013, and to resume financing ourselves in the financial markets.In this context it is important to recognise that our progress is made possible by the solidarity of our fellow EU Member States.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	844	The annual rate of CPI inflation was 2.2 per cent in March.  One of the key factors underlying this figure was higher fuel prices, partly reflecting external developments over which we have no control.  On an EU harmonised basis, prices in Ireland also rose at an annual rate of 2.2 per cent in March, compared with 2.7 per cent in the euro area as a whole.  In terms of the year as a whole, my Department expects HICP inflation to average 1.9 per cent this year, which is lower than current projections for the euro area as a whole.So our relative price competitiveness continues to improve, and this will enhance our growth prospects.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	845	Substantial progress has been made in terms of improving our competitiveness.  Relatively lower price inflation over the last number of years means that Irish price levels have fallen relative to our major trading partners.  At the same time there has been a significant improvement in our cost competitiveness.  On foot of these positive developments, we have seen a recovery in our exports as well as an improvement in inward foreign direct investment, and I am encouraged by this.  Having said that, further improvements in competitiveness are clearly needed in order to make significant inroads into the unacceptably high rate of unemployment that we are currently faced with.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	846	The first quarter Exchequer figures show that we are on course to reach the 8.6 per cent of GDP deficit target — in general government terms — for this year.  While there are no economic targets per se the Government is pursuing an agenda to facilitate the return of sustainable economic growth, and in this context the resumption of economic growth last year is encouraging.  Furthermore as the Deputy will be aware the Government does publish a set of economic forecasts, covering a wide range of macro-economic variables.  For instance, the current forecasts are for real GDP and GNP growth of 1.3 per cent and 0.7 per cent this year respectively.  These forecasts are currently being re-assessed and updated forecasts will be published in the Stability Programme Update  at the end of this month.In terms of comparison with other EU Member States, there is considerable diversity with regard to economic forecasts for this year.  However, for the EU as a whole, GDP is projected to be flat for this year.In relation to whether other Member States are on course to meet their fiscal targets, clearly it is too early to be definitive at this stage.  However, what I can say is that all Member States remain committed to correcting their excessive deficits within their country-specific timeframes, and to pursue policies that will underpin future economic growth.

The EU currently provides up to 50% (65% for approved applications submitted between 1 May 2009 and 31 December 2011) of approved programme funding, with the remainder being met from national funding sources.Since 2009 six applications have been approved by the European Commission, three of them in respect of eligible redundancies at the Dell, Waterford Crystal and SR Technics companies and various ancillary enterprises and a further three applications in relation to redundancies occurring within specific subsectors of the construction industry.A decision is awaited from the European Commission in relation to the seventh and most recent application submitted by my Department on 29th February 2012 in support of 592 workers made redundant at the TalkTalk call centre facility in Waterford and at a number of ancillary enterprises.  The programme of measures contained in the application has been estimated at €5.39m in total.While the eligibility periods for the delivery of EGF co-financed supports under the Dell, Waterford Crystal and SR Technics programmes have closed, the certified final expenditure figures which are required to be submitted with the Final Reports on these programmes remain subject to final approval and official programme closure by the European Commission.In this context, information regarding final approved draw down of expenditure by the EU is available in respect of one EGF programme to date, the Waterford Crystal programme, arising from the response of the European Commission to the Department's submission of the relevant Final Report and statement of certified expenditure.  The relevant expenditure figure is an initial calculation received by way of debit note from the Commission and is subject to confirmation upon official closure of the programme by the EU.Final Reports for the Dell and S R Technics programmes have also been submitted by the Department and the Commission's responses with regard to the approval of certified expenditure figures submitted therein are currently awaited.The three construction programmes are still in operation and final reports are due for submission to the European Commission not later than 9 December 2012.

The Act requires that a school Code of Behaviour shall specify: (a) the standards of behaviour that shall be observed by each student attending the school; (b) the measures that may be taken when a student fails or refuses to observe those standards; (c) the procedures to be followed before a student may be suspended or expelled from the school concerned; (d) the grounds for removing a suspension imposed in relation to a student; and (e) the procedures to be followed relating to notification of a child's absence from school.The Act also requires that the school code of behaviour is prepared in accordance with Guidelines issued by the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB).  The Guidelines set out a framework of good practice to assist primary and post-primary schools in developing their code of behaviour or in strengthening an existing code and are available on the website of the NEWB: www.newb.ie.

The number of such posts allocated from year to year changes due to a number of factors including increasing or decreasing enrolments.Legacy posts were retained by 140 Band 1 and Band 2 schools over and above their entitlement under DEIS for the 2011/12 school year.  The school referred to by the Deputy is a DEIS Band 1 School but was not among the 140 DEIS Band 1 and Band 2 schools included in the recent report on legacy posts.  The school was originally allocated a concessionary post under a previous disadvantage scheme but with the introduction of DEIS in 2005, this post became part of the school's teaching allocation to implement the more favourable pupil teacher ratios of 20:1 and therefore it was not retained by the school over and above its entitlements under DEIS.  Since this post is part of the schools overall DEIS allocation for the last six years, the school staffing allocation has not been impacted by this particular budget measure.Applying the new dedicated staffing schedule for Band 1 schools to implement the more favourable pupil teacher ratio of 20:1, this school is due to lose two mainstream classroom teachers due to falling enrolment over its September 2010 enrolment.  I wish to clarify that this school would lose these posts regardless of any reforms to the teacher allocation process due to falling enrolments.The allocation processes also include an appeals mechanism under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules.  The appeal procedures are set out in primary circular 0007/12.For the coming school year the existing staffing appeals criteria have been extended to enable some limited phasing arrangements for schools where the combination of budget and reform measures impact in a particularly adverse manner on a school's overall allocation.  The closing date for submission of appeal was 23 March, 2012.The school to which the Deputy refers has submitted an appeal.The final staffing position for all schools at primary level will ultimately not be known until the Autumn.  At that stage the allocation process will be fully completed and any appeals to the Staffing Appeal Boards will have been considered.

#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	860	The Modern Languages in Primary Schools Initiative has been a pilot scheme involving approximately 550 schools that has operated since 1998.The decision to end the scheme took account of a 2008 Report by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA). The report identified serious issues with curricular overload at primary level.The NCCA's advice recommended for the present modern languages should not be part of the Primary School Curriculum as an additional and separate subject. The advice in relation to curriculum overload predated the wake up call on literacy and numeracy triggered by the PISA results. I am taking that advice on board and with particular regard to the demands on time in school that will result from a heightened focus on literacy and numeracy.The primary curriculum is currently being reviewed by the NCCA in the context of the National Literacy and Numeracy Strategy. The €2.5 million in savings from this measure will go towards the cost of implementing the new National Literacy and Numeracy Strategy. The 17% of primary schools at present in the Initiative, which have had even more time demands than others in a crowded curricular space, should as a result be better placed to deliver under the strategy.Given the priority of literacy and numeracy I have acted on the 2008 advice about overload and could not justify either the continuation of the initiative in the existing schools or its expansion to all schools even if funding was not an issue.

#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	864	The correspondence referred to by the Deputy relates to three amendments sought to the Education (Amendment) Bill which is currently before this House.The first seeks to ensure that a person could not be employed in place of a registered teacher without this being governed by Ministerial regulation.  In fact, if the Minister does not make regulations specifying the circumstances in which an unregistered person may be employed then such a person cannot be employed. The Oireachtas is only permitting this to be done by regulation and not by any other instrument.  Therefore this is not considered necessary.The second amendment seeks to clarify that an unregistered person is not a teacher.  In response to concerns raised by a number of its branches, I indicated at the recent INTO Annual Congress that I intend to change this section in the legislation to make it clear that an unregistered person will not be employed "in a teaching position" but rather that his or her employment will be "in place of a registered teacher".Finally on the issue of section 8 of the Bill, it is the view of the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government that it is legally necessary that the wording of section 30 of the Teaching Council Act 2001 contain a reference to the qualification of that section by the proposed section 24(8) of the Education Act 1998.  The inclusion of a cross-reference to the amendments contained within Section 23 and 24 of the Education Act is simply a technical provision to fulfill this.

#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	869	I am aware of the views expressed in the correspondence supplied.The cost of the response to residential institutional abuse was estimated to exceed €1.36 billion and it is likely that this estimate will be exceeded as the actual expenditure on the Redress Scheme and associated litigation was almost at the projected final provision of €1.1 billion at end 2011.The Government believes that this cost should be shared on a 50:50 basis, between the State and the congregations who were responsible for the management of institutions. The contribution of the 18 congregations under the 2002 Indemnity Agreement amounted to €128 million. As the Deputy will be aware the congregations were called upon to make further substantial contributions following the publication of the Ryan Report. In 2009, they offered some €110 million in cash and offered to transfer property, mainly in the health and education sectors, that they valued at €235.5 million, to various State agencies and voluntary organisations. If all of these properties were acceptable to the State and their values confirmed, the congregations' offers would fall short of the €680m contribution required to realise a 50:50 share by at least €200m. Of the properties offered to the State, 12 have been identified as of potential immediate benefit and the transfer of these properties is being pursued. The value of these 12 properties, based on the congregations' own valuations is approximately €60m.Following consideration of the issues involved by the Government I met with representatives of the 18 congregations who were party to the 2002 Indemnity Agreement either on 22 July 2011 or on dates since then. At those meetings I expressed my disappointment that their offers fell well short of the contribution required. I am continuing to pursue the 50:50 division with the management bodies involved and have proposed the transfer of school infrastructure to the State for the benefit of the taxpayer as one mechanism to allow those involved the opportunity to shoulder their share of the costs.The Deputy will be aware the Government is proceeding with the legislation to establish a Statutory Fund to support the needs of survivors which will be financed from the cash contributions offered, of up to €110m and I am pleased to note that the Bill was published yesterday.

Existing eligible children, who are not attending their nearest school, will retain their school transport eligibility for the duration of their primary education cycle provided there is no change to their current circumstances.   Sample surveys undertaken by Bus Éireann show that the majority of children are in fact attending their nearest school, so this change will not have any practical impact on the majority of children.   This change means that greater consistency will be introduced in relation to planning for school places which is already based on local demographic trends, current and projected enrolments, recent and planned housing developments and the capacity of existing schools to meet demand for places.

The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support, which now includes a requirement for them to have regard to an overall cap on numbers of posts available.  Schools have been advised to make applications to the NCSE for resource teaching and SNA support for the 2012/13 school year by 16th March, 2012. Schools will subsequently be advised by the NCSE of their allocation for the 2012/13 school year, based on the number of valid applications received and in the case of SNA support, the extent of the care needs of qualifying children.   It is open to schools to contact their local SENO in this regard, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.

It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools that are not in a position to admit all pupils seeking entry to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act 1998. In this regard a board of management may deem it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular age group or to children living in a particular area or on the basis of some other criterion.  In formulating an enrolment policy a school must, however, ensure it is lawful and applied fairly to all applicants.  Section 15 2(d) of the 1998 Education Act requires a Board of Management to publish, in such manner as the Board with the agreement of the Patron considers appropriate, the policy of the school concerning admission to and participation in the school.    The Deputy will be aware that last June, I launched a discussion paper on school enrolment. The document, “Discussion Paper on a Regulatory Framework for School Enrolment” contains suggestions on how to make the process of enrolling in schools more open, equitable and consistent.   I have made it clear that the paper was not meant to be prescriptive, nor have any decisions been made as to what elements will be contained in any final regulations or legislation.   The purpose of the paper was to lead and provoke debate on enrolment policies and practices.  I invited education partners and interested parties to submit their views to my Department by the 28th of October last and my officials are now co-ordinating the submissions received.  The feedback from this consultation will help inform the nature and scope of a new regulatory framework for school enrolment.

This means that from the 2012/13 school year, school transport eligibility for pupils will be determined by reference to the distance they reside from their nearest post-primary education centre having regard to ethos and language.  Existing catchment boundary pupils who are not attending their nearest post primary centre will retain their transport eligibility for the duration of their post primary education cycle provided there is no change to their current circumstances. Siblings of these pupils may apply for transport on a concessionary basis only in accordance with the terms of the Post Primary School Transport Scheme.  The changes to the Post Primary School Transport Scheme will be applied equitably on a national basis.

However, only one Degree allowance is payable at any one time, with the rate of the allowance being determined by the level of the Degree achieved.  Where a particular allowance is regarded as a post-based allowance then the allowance is conditional on having the qualifications suitable for the post and fullfilling the requirements of the post.  The special needs allowance is an example of this.  There are other allowances such as Degree allowances which are paid to qualified teachers regardless of the duties being carried out.  As there is a wide range of allowances there are also differing criteria agreed for their allocation and their retention.   In terms of Board of Management allowances, such allowances are available to school principals who act as secretaries to Boards of Management as provided for under circular 79/2007.  Regarding secondment allowances, in accordance with a 2003 arbitration report a standard pay structure for seconded teachers working temporarily out of school on national support service programmes was put in place. This structure provides for four payment categories, as follows:Category One — Directors of Major National Programmes (or equivalents);Category Two — Coordinators of National Syllabi and Course Support Services, Regional and Deputy Directors of Major National Programmes, ICT Advisors (or equivalents);Category Three — Assistant National Coordinators of National Syllabi (or equivalents);Category Four — Curriculum Trainers/Tutors (or equivalents):  A public service-wide review of allowances, announced by the Government as part of Budget 2012, is currently being led by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Pending the outcome of that review, and subject to very limited exceptions, allowances are not payable to new beneficiaries.

The Children's Allowance is payable to teachers recruited before the 1st January 1980 who have an eligible child or children.  An eligible child is defined as a child, stepchild or legally adopted child of a teacher who is; dependent on the teacher; aged 16 years or under; or aged under 21 years and in receipt of full-time education or is a disabled child.   A teacher may only receive either the Gaeltacht allowance or the Teaching Through Irish allowance. Both allowances are never paid simultaneously to any teacher.  The annual values of these allowances are €3,063 and €1,583 respectively. For new appointees after 1 January 2011 the values of these allowances are €2,757 and €1,424 respectively.

As set out in this House last October, each person appointed to a recognised teaching post should be registered with the Teaching Council, and have qualifications appropriate to the sector and suitable to the post for which s/he is to be employed.  However, from the information supplied, it appears that the individual referred to by the Deputy may not be employed in such a teaching post.  The Teaching Council's regulations are set out on its website and currently require a person who wishes to register as a post primary teacher in the VEC sector to have a minimum standard of a degree or its equivalent.  From 1 April 2013, a person applying to be entered on the register as a teacher in a VEC school will also need a qualification in post primary teacher education as set out in Regulation Four.  With effect from the same date, a person applying to be entered on the register as a teacher in the further education sector must have attained a Council approved further education teacher education qualification in accordance with Regulation Five.  The recognition of teacher qualifications in this State is now a matter for the Teaching Council, the body with statutory responsibility for establishing and maintaining standards in the teaching profession.  Accordingly, it would not be appropriate for me to intervene in individual cases.  The matter should be taken up with the employer, Kerry VEC in this case, who is responsible for the terms and conditions of employment and may also be taken up directly with the Teaching Council.

#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	898	I propose to take Questions Nos. 327 and 366 to 369, inclusive, together.On 12 March last I announced details of 219 new major school building projects which will begin over the next 5 years as part of a €2 billion capital investment programme.  These new projects were in addition to 56 major school building projects already announced for 2012.  This five year plan details when those major projects will proceed to construction.  The projects announced will account for the bulk of the capital funding available in each of those years.  Total school enrolments are expected to grow by around 70,000 students between now and 2018 — by over 45,000 at primary level and 25,000 at post primary.  Second level enrolment is expected to continue to rise until at least 2024.  Recent birth rate data published by the CSO shows there were nearly 20,000 births registered in the first quarter of 2011.  This is the highest number of births registered in a quarter since the series began in 1960.  It is vital that the schooling system is prepared to cope with these increasing numbers.  Therefore, the Government's priority is now to focus on major school projects to meet these demographic demands.As such enrolment increases are not uniformly distributed nationally, my Department has carried out a study of the country using data from the Central Statistics Office, the General Register Office and the Department of Social Protection in addition to recent schools' enrolment data to identify areas where it is projected that there will be significant future enrolment increases.  The information used is the most accurate and up-to-date information available.  In view of the need to ensure that every child has access to a school place, the delivery of major school projects to meet the demographic demands nationally will be the main focus for capital investment in schools over those years.  For purposes of the 5 Year Plan, new school building projects as well as major extensions have been identified and prioritised on the basis of meeting demographic needs in areas where such needs have been identified.  In that regard, the current status of projects already in architectural planning, including the project referred to by the Deputy, was also considered.Due to the financial constraints imposed by the need to prioritise the limited funding available for the provision of school accommodation to meet the demographic requirements, it has not been possible to advance all applications for capital funding concurrently.  As outlined above, the information used in drawing up the 5 year plan is the most accurate and up-to-date information available.  Therefore, the Department considers that a formal appeals process is not required.  The building project for the school referred to by the Deputy is at an advanced stage of architectural planning.  Planning permission, which is an integral part of stage 2(b), has been obtained and the design team is working on completing the stage 2(b) submission.  School building projects currently in architectural planning, including the project referred to by the Deputy, will continue to be advanced incrementally over time in the context of the funding available.  However, in light of current competing demands on the Department's capital budget, it is not possible to progress this project to tender and construction stage at this time.

My Department has published the staffing arrangements at primary and post primary level for the coming school year, 2012-13.  The relevant circulars, Primary 0007/2012 and Post Primary 0009/2012 are available on my Department's website.  At post primary level and in accordance with existing arrangements, where a school management authority is unable to meet its curricular commitments within its approved allocation, my Department considers applications for additional short term support, i.e., curricular concessions.  The allocation processes at both primary and post primary level also include an appeals mechanism under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules.  The appeal procedures are set out in the circulars referred to above.  For the coming school year the existing staffing appeals criteria have been extended to enable some limited phasing arrangements for schools where the combination of budget and reform measures impact on a particularly adverse manner on a school's overall allocation.  The Appeal Boards operate independently of the Department and their decisions are final.  The final staffing position for all schools at primary and post primary level will ultimately not be known until the Autumn.  At that stage the allocation process will be fully completed and any appeals to the Staffing Appeal Boards will have been considered.

The current position of such projects may be viewed on my Department's website, www.education.ie, which is updated regularly.  Projects are grouped into various categories including projects at application stage, in architectural planning and at tender and construction stage.  The Five Year Plan, which may also be accessed on my Department’s website, prioritises new school building projects, as well as major extensions in areas where a demographic need has been established.  In view of the funding constraints imposed by the need to prioritise available funding to meet additional demographic requirements, it is not possible to progress all projects within my Department’s building programme concurrently.  Accordingly, it was necessary to prioritise school building projects referred to above for purposes of the Plan.  As set out in the Plan, 219 major school building projects will proceed to construction over the lifetime of the Plan as part of a €2 billion capital investment programme.  These projects are in addition to the 56 major school building projects already announced to proceed to construction during 2012.

The question of an annual cost in maintaining  the school in this accommodation does not therefore arise. For the same reason, there is no additional cost associated with maintaining the school in this temporary accommodation between now and 2015-16.  As the Deputy is aware, last month, I announced details of the new major school building projects where construction is expected to commence over the next five years as part of a €1.5 billion major school project capital investment programme and I am pleased to confirm that the school concerned was included in that announcement to commence construction in 2015-16.  My Department will be in communication with the school in relation to the next steps to be taken, at the appropriate time, as the project progresses through the various stages of the architectural planning process.

The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.  The NCSE also has a role to assist parents in identifying suitable school placements for children with special educational needs and can provide a valuable support in this regard.  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.  With regard to the home tuition application, the child in question is not eligible for tuition and a letter to this effect issued to his parents at the end of March.

The next review for the schools referred to by the Deputy is due from 1 July 2012 and this review will determine the level of expenditure on the accommodation to 2014-15.  My Department has sought the assistance of, and is working closely with, the relevant Local Authority to identify and acquire a suitable site for the proposed primary school in Ardee.  Due to commercial sensitivities attaching to site acquisitions generally, it is not possible for me to comment further at this time.  As outlined in the recently announced Five Year Plan, it is expected that the project for the school in Ardee will progress to the construction stage of the architectural planning process during 2014-15.  Details of all projects on the Five Year Plan are published on my Department's website, www.education.ie.

There has been no change as to how these distances are measured.  As in the past for all cases, the shortest most direct route to the institution attended is measured.  I understand that a range of mechanisms can be used, for example, online mapping such as AA Route Planner and Google Maps.  If the distance is disputed, the matter should be taken up with the grant awarding body concerned.

This includes the detail of the reform of the allocation process which is designed to bring a more equitable distribution of existing posts between schools.  The new arrangements incorporate a long overdue updating of the GAM (learning support) allocation for all schools.  This inevitably involves changes to existing clustering arrangements whereby a teacher is shared between schools.  A further change is that schools in any locality are being empowered to cluster and arrange their GAM resources in a manner that best suits their local needs.  There are also new and separate arrangements for how resource hours for individual pupils are converted into teaching posts in schools.  The requirement for resource hours in a school varies from year to year depending on the number, if any, of its pupils with autism etc.  Small schools generally have a lower requirement for resource hours.  The new arrangements take account of the later timescale for the allocation of these hours necessitated by individual assessment by the NCSE.  All of the changes are designed to enable a more efficient operation of the teacher allocation and redeployment process in the new climate of a fixed ceiling of teacher numbers.The Deputies will be aware that Budget 2012 provided for the phased withdrawal of approximately 428 posts allocated to some schools under disadvantage programmes prior to the introduction of the DEIS Initiative in 2005.  As already announced, the withdrawal of 192 posts from primary schools outside DEIS Band 1 and 2 and from DEIS second level schools will proceed, including the 38 posts from 15 Non DEIS schools.  The staffing circular 0007/2012 also includes an appeals mechanism for schools to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeals Board. The existing staffing appeals criteria have been extended to enable limited phasing arrangements for schools where the combination of budget and reform measures impact on a particularly adverse manner on a school's overall allocation. Schools that are due to lose three or more posts as a result of a combination of the budget and reform measures will be able to apply to the Staffing Appeals Board with a view to seeking to have a portion of the loss in posts deferred to the 2013-14 school year.  The first meeting of the Appeals Board takes place this week and the Boards of Management of the applicant schools will be notified of the outcome of appeals as soon as possible thereafter.  The Appeals Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.  The final staffing position for all schools will ultimately not be known until later in 2012. At that stage the allocation process will be fully completed and any appeals to the Staffing Appeals Board will have been considered.

Up to the end of 2006, my Department expended a total of €802,802 in relation to this organisation, which expenditure includes the costs of the associated co-ordinator. The annual funding provided over the last five years, from 2007 to 2011, is set out in the attached table.  This funding has been provided to the organisation to provide an information and referral service for former residents of Industrial and Reformatory Schools wishing to access the range of services introduced in response to residential institutional abuse, following the then Taoiseach's apology to victims of childhood abuse in 1999.  The funding provided by my Department is channelled through the City of Cork VEC and expenditure of these funds is monitored by a co-ordinator engaged by the VEC on behalf of my Department.   Expenditure receipts are provided to the co-ordinator along with annual accounts of the organisation.   My Department receives details of the receipts and copies of the annual accounts.As with all survivor groups funded by my Department, this organisation is required to apply to my Department for funding on an annual basis and, in doing so, is required to set out its list of activities in the previous year and the proposed activities for the current year in the context of the provision of an information and referral service to include the numbers of former residents contacting or availing of the service.  As Deputies will be aware, this organisation receives the majority of its funding from the Health Service Executive.  As advocated by the Comptroller and Auditor General in his Special Report No. 74 of September 2010, my Department liaises with the HSE to ensure a co-ordinated approach to its funding and that no duplication of funding arises.In the wider context, I previously announced that as responsibility for information for survivors will be taken on by the proposed Statutory Fund, funding of survivor groups by my Department will cease.  Accordingly, while my Department is continuing to fund survivor groups pending the establishment of the Fund, Deputies will be aware that the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Bill, which provides for the establishment of a Statutory Fund to support the needs of survivors of residential institutional child abuse, was published yesterday.    The continued funding of groups is being reviewed in this context.

The Group has been meeting regularly to drive the process forward.  The Heads of a Bill have been approved by Government and will shortly be referred to the Office of the Attorney General for drafting purposes.  A public consultation process with key stakeholders has recently been completed.  In addition, a number of projects are currently being undertaken to ensure the smooth integration of the further education and training sectors.  Following the establishment of SOLAS, FÁS Training Centre staff will be integrated into the appropriate Vocational Education Committees. The staff of SOLAS will initially comprise of remaining FÁS staff not transferring to the VECs, essentially staff currently working in central administration in FÁS head office.  The exact number will depend on the timing of the transfer to SOLAS.  Given the complex elements involved, including enacting appropriate legislation, it is expected that the process of establishing SOLAS will be completed by the end of 2012.

The five year programme announced recently is focused on meeting those demographic needs. In that context, it was not possible to advance all applications for capital funding concurrently.   The building project for the school referred to by the Deputy is currently at an early stage of architectural planning. The Design Team are currently working on the Stage 2a Submission (Developed Sketch Design). School building projects currently in architectural planning, including the project referred to by the Deputy, will continue to be advanced incrementally over time within the context of the funding available. However, in light of current competing demands on my Department's capital budget, it is not possible at this time to progress this project to tender and construction stage.  In the meantime, for works that are of a very urgent nature, it is open to the school authorities to consider if the works in question might qualify for funding under my Department's Emergency Works Scheme. An emergency is deemed to be a situation which poses an immediate risk to health, life, property or the environment which is sudden, unforeseen and requires immediate action and, in the case of a school, if not corrected would prevent the school or part thereof from opening.

For communities served by one 'Stand Alone' school, where transfer of patronage is not an option, the report makes recommendations aimed at ensuring such schools are as inclusive as possible and accommodate pupils of various belief systems.   The report suggests the development of a protocol which would facilitate all schools in developing clear policies accessible to parents on how they manage diversity and ensure an inclusive and respectful environment for all their pupils.   I have asked that the Education Partners and interested parties examine the report and take time to reflect on and digest the recommendations and to submit their views to me.

Almost 3,700 of these places are provided by Vocational Education Committees (VECs) in just over 100 Youthreach centres. The majority of the remainder of places are provided by FÁS in Community Training Centres.  Learners in Youthreach receive a weekly training allowance and can access childcare supports. Basic skills training, practical work training and general education to enable them to progress to further education and employment are features of the programme.  Participants complete tailored programmes, which may include Junior Certificate and Leaving Certificate subjects, but are mainly made up of modules at Levels 2 to 4 on the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ).I chair an Implementation Group which is drawing up an Action Plan for the establishment of SOLAS, which, when established, will operate under the aegis of the Department of Education and Skills and co-ordinate and fund the wide range of further education and training programmes around the country.  The funding of those programmes, including Youthreach, will be a matter for discussion between my Department, SOLAS and VECs, who will ultimately be responsible for the delivery to the public in an integrated way of both further education and training programmes.

The General Scheme was also published at that time. Following discussions with my Department and relevant stakeholders, the committee prepared a report which I responded to at a meeting of the committee on 25 January 2012. The General Scheme has now been referred to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government for formal drafting.  The General Scheme does not incorporate the provisions of the Youth Work Act 2001 which is a substantive piece of legislation in its own right. Rather, it is likely that amendments will be made to that Act to reflect the establishment of education and training boards and the dissolution of vocational education committees. This is something which my officials will pursue with the Parliamentary Counsel's Office as part of the drafting process.

Information in respect of the current school building programme along with all assessed applications for major capital works, including this project, is available on the Department's website at www.education.ie.  In view of the need to ensure that every child has access to a school place, the delivery of major school projects required to meet demographic demand will be the main focus for capital investment in the coming years. In the context of the need to prioritise available funding for the provision of additional school accommodation, it is not possible therefore to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of this school project at this time.   The Department has been advised by the school of issues with the temporary accommodation. A technical assessment will be required so that the matter can be further considered. Department officials will be in contact with the school authorities shortly in this regard.

My Department has no role in relation to processing applications for enrolment to schools.   My Department provides for a range of placement options and supports for schools which have enrolled pupils with special educational needs in order to ensure that, wherever a child is enrolled, s/he will have access to an appropriate education.   The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) Special Education Needs Organisers (SENOs) can assist parents to identify appropriate educational placements for children with special educational needs.  Parents may contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs and to seek assistance in identifying placement options, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.  Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of my Department. Only where an appeal under Section 29 is upheld, may the Secretary General of my Department direct a school to enrol a pupil.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	928	I propose to take Questions Nos. 373 to 377, inclusive, together.The building project for the school referred to by the Deputy is currently at an advanced stage of architectural planning. The school's Design Team are currently working on the Stage 2b Submission (Detailed Design) which, on completion, will be forwarded to my Department for review.  The cost incurred in the design stages of the building project amounts to €309,000, mainly in design team fees for work to date.  On 12th March last I announced details of 219 new major school building projects which will begin over the next 5 years as part of a €2 billion capital investment programme. These new projects were in addition to 56 major school building projects already announced for 2012. This five year plan details when those major projects will proceed to construction. The projects announced will account for the bulk of the capital funding available in each of those years.  Total school enrolments are expected to grow by around 70,000 students between now and 2018 — by over 45,000 at primary level and 25,000 at post primary. Second level enrolment is expected to continue to rise until at least 2024.Recent birth rate data, published by the CSO show there were nearly 20,000 births registered in the first quarter of 2011. This is the highest number of births registered in a quarter since the series began in 1960. It is vital that the schooling system is prepared to cope with these increasing numbers. Therefore, the Government's priority is now to focus on major school projects to meet these demographic demands.  As such enrolment increases are not uniformly distributed nationally, my Department has carried out a study of the country using data from the Central Statistics Office, the General Register Office and the Department of Social Protection in addition to recent schools' enrolment data to identify the areas it is projected that there will be significant future enrolment increases. The information used is the most accurate and up-to-date information available.In view of the need to ensure that every child has access to a school place, the delivery of major school projects to meet the demographic demands nationally will be the main focus for capital investment in schools over those years.   For purposes of the 5 Year Plan, new school building projects as well as major extensions have been identified and prioritised on the basis of meeting demographic needs in areas where such needs have been identified. In that regard, the current status of projects already in architectural planning, including the project referred to by the Deputy, was also considered.  Due to the financial constraints imposed by the need to prioritise the limited funding available for the provision of school accommodation to meet the demographic requirements, it has not been possible to advance all applications for capital funding concurrently.   School building projects currently in architectural planning, including the project referred to by the Deputy, will continue to be advanced incrementally over time within the context of the funding available. However, in light of current competing demands on the Department's capital budget, it is not possible to progress this project to tender and construction stage at this time. Therefore, I do not propose to meet delegations, such as that requested by the Deputy, regarding individual school building projects.  Under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 school authorities are responsible for managing safety, health and welfare in schools and for having a safety statement in place in their schools, to identify possible hazards, assess the risks to health and safety and put appropriate safeguards in place. In practical terms, individual school authorities are best placed to assess the detail of their own health and safety requirements and there are many information sources such as Codes of Practices, guidelines, legislation and standards available to support them in this task.  In the meantime, if the condition of the accommodation referred to is of concern to the school authorities and the works are of a very urgent nature, it is open to the school authorities to apply for funding under my Department's Emergency Works Scheme.An emergency is deemed to be a situation which poses an immediate risk to health, life, property or the environment which is sudden, unforeseen and requires immediate action and, in the case of a school, if not corrected would prevent the school or part thereof from opening. Details of the Scheme, together with an application form for grant assistance, can be accessed on my Department's website at www.education.ie.   I also wish to advise the Deputy that where an immediate enrolment need in an area has been identified, e.g. the appointment of an additional teacher and where school’s existing accommodation cannot provide for this growth, the Department will be prepared to consider applications by schools for capital funding for additional classrooms mainly on a devolved basis.

The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has developed an ICT framework which sets out a structured approach to ICT in curriculum and assessment. This sets out the types of learning appropriate for students during the period of compulsory education, and provides a guide to teachers for embedding ICT across the curriculum. Therefore, it is not time bound. The overall implementation of ICT in schools is supported by the National Centre for Technology in Education which provides for extensive training and guidance for schools on the integration of ICT into teaching and learning.   To further support teachers in using ICT in the curriculum, the NCCA developed the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) in the Primary School Curriculum: Guidelines for Teachers as a supporting document to the Primary School Curriculum 1999. The guidelines were launched by the Department of Education and Science (DES) in 2004. At post-primary level, one of the Statements of Learning in the Framework for Junior Cycle reform is to ensure that all students "use ICT effectively and ethically in learning and in life". The forthcoming Junior Cycle reform will allow for the introduction of optional school developed short courses of 100 hours duration. This will provide opportunities for schools to progress the provision of courses to enhance students' ICT skills which will be embedded in all their learning.   There is also a Transition Year option in relation to "Having Fun with Computer Programming and Games" and, under the ICT Action Plan which I launched earlier this year, this is being expanded nationally.  Computer Aided Design (CAD) and Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM) are also significant components in the syllabuses of Technology and Design and Communication Graphics.

I wish to inform the Deputy that the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment advises that ICT is not a stand alone subject but rather a tool to be integrated into the teaching and learning of all subjects. Computer literacy is seen to be a "necessity in a large majority of professions" (EUROSTAT news release, 26 March, 2012).  These views are in keeping with international practice.  €92m has been provided in infrastructural ICT grants to schools. In fact, all post primary schools will be connected to a 100Mbps broadband service by the end of 2014, providing for improved integration of ICT in learning.  In addition, the NCCA has developed an ICT framework for schools setting out the ICT skills which students should acquire at different levels across the curriculum. The focus for schools is on using ICT (a) as a tool in learning and (b) to improve learning across the curriculum.This NCCA framework is supported by extensive digital resources on the Scoilnet website, an e-learning handbook for teachers, by professional development programmes for teachers as well as by investment in ICT infrastructure.  One of the Statements of Learning in the Junior Cycle reform is to ensure that all students "use ICT effectively and ethically in learning and in life".  There will also be the opportunity for schools to provide short courses.  These reforms will present further opportunities for strengthening ICT across the curriculum.  There is also a Transition Year option in relation to "Having Fun with Computer Programming and Games"and, under the ICT Action Plan which I launched jointly with Industry in January 2012, this is being expanded nationally.  Computer Aided Design (CAD) and Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM) are also significant components in the syllabuses of Technology and Design and Communication Graphics.

The provision of funding for ICT equipment is one strand of the ICT in Schools Programme.  The Programme addresses four key themes:internet access for schools (broadband since 2005)teacher professional development in ICTICT infrastructure deployment in schoolsdeployment of curriculum-relevant digital content and software for use in the classroom.Since the inception of the ICT in Schools Programme significant investment has been made.  Between 2009 and 2011 inclusive, some €126m has been allocated under the programme, including €92m in ICT Infrastructure Grant funding. Schools received a block grant of €1,700 (€2,550 if DEIS), plus a per-capita grant for pupils enrolled at 30th September 2009. Grants averaged about €14,000 per school at primary level and €61,000 per school at post-primary. Grants were issued on a devolved basis, with expenditure to be undertaken by schools themselves (or by each VEC in the case of VEC schools). Schools were asked to prioritise equipping each classroom with a teaching computer and digital projector, after which they can spend any remaining balance on other ICT equipment and software according to local needs.  The table below shows the number of schools which benefited under the grant scheme.20092010Number of Primary Schools aided3,2153,273Number of post-primary facilities aidedN/A832(including Youthreach Centres, former children’s detention centres and stand alone PLC facilities)To help schools make the most of their investment, the Department arranged a number of key supports in tandem over this period, including:annual delivery of approximately 12,000 ICT CPD places for teachers on Department-funded courses, primarily through the Education Centre networkdissemination of an e-learning handbook, supported by national delivery of e-learning seminars for school leaders [providing schools with a comprehensive approach to multi-annual ICT planning and enhancing local leadership capacity to get the most from ICT]delivery of the schools broadband service and its helpdesk to more than 96% schoolsdeployment of central national procurement arrangements accompanied by simplified procedures, giving schools the benefit of centrally negotiated terms and conditionsdelivery of a national internet safety programme and its associated website (www.webwise.ie)collaborative development, procurement and dissemination of curriculum-relevant digital content, delivered mainly through the national portal for ICT in education www.scoilnet.ie.This investment has delivered significant improvements in the infrastructural base nationally.  An ICT in Schools survey will be carried out this year. The results of this survey will assist my Department in the drawing up of a new ICT plan in line with the commitment in the Programme for Government.   As the Deputy will appreciate, my Department is not currently in a position to commit additional resources to ICT capital investment having regard to other priorities.  The capital allocation for this year is focused primarily on meeting essential capital costs under the Schools Broadband Programme. The total allocation to the ICT in Schools Programme for 2012 is €13.8m and this allocation allows the programme to remain focused on maintaining priority services.   The Government has approved the roll out of 100mbps broadband to all post primary schools. The national roll-out will be completed over three stages with 200 schools being connected by September 2012, a further 200 being connected next year and the remaining 250 schools being connected in 2014. Integrating ICT into teaching and learning in schools remains a priority for my Department.

Computer Aided Design (CAD) and Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM) are also significant components in the syllabuses of Technology and Design and Communication Graphics.Opportunities are being provided for students in our post-primary schools through the provision of places in ICT companies in Ireland so as to promote the ICT sector as a career choice Business and IT interests place a greater emphasis on improved uptake and performance in mathematics and the sciences in general at the post-primary level than on provision of a specialist courses in computer science.  In particular, those recruiting for the IT and Innovation industries emphasise that what they are looking for in potential employees is the general skill base of students, their disposition towards problem solving and their capacity to apply existing scientific and mathematical knowledge and processes in new and unforeseen contexts. In general terms, they consider this of greater value than specific knowledge of developments in computer science. There would be some concern that the provision of computer science as a subject could divert attention and effort away from the aim of increased and improving participation in mathematics and science.   The ICT Action Plan which I launched in January in collaboration with ICT Ireland, Irish Software Association, American Chamber of Commerce (Ireland) the HEA and Expert Group on Future Skills Needs, while referring to post-primary sector, concentrates on ICT upskilling at further and higher education. The increase of 29% in student acceptances onto computing course is encouraging. The short term aim is to reskill and provide conversion programmes for some 750 graduates with qualifications and skills in other cognate disciplines.

The nature and depth of the content varies between the different institutions.  The Teaching Council, which has statutory responsibility for the review and accreditation of programmes of initial teacher education, has published criteria and guidelines for initial teacher education providers. These form a bridge between the Council's policy and the development and implementation of reconceptualised programmes of initial teacher education in Higher Education Institutions, providing clarity for HEIs to enable them to ensure that their programmes meet the Council's accreditation requirements.  In the criteria and guidelines, ICT in Teaching and Learning is set down as one of the mandatory elements to be included in all ITE programmes.  The reconceptualised and extended Bachelor of Education programmes which must meet the Teaching Council's criteria and guidelines are scheduled to commence in September 2012.

These arrangements are outlined in, and are governed by, my Department's circular 58/2006.  The circular is available on my Department's website.   The person referred to by the Deputy was employed by two different schools during the period 2005-2011.  The person ceased employment with the first school in 2007 by way of resignation.  No redundancy situation existed in that school at the time and the vacant post was filled by another SNA.  The person referred to by the Deputy was subsequently employed by another school for 4 years (2007-2011).  When the post became surplus to the allocation of SNA resources to that school, the post was made redundant.  My Department issued a redundancy payment to the person in line with the agreed arrangements as outlined in circular 58/2006, i.e. the period of service reckonable for redundancy payment purposes will only consist of the period of the Special Needs Assistant's continuous service in the school in which she/he was last employed. The redundancy payment was calculated in accordance with the terms outlined in the circular.
#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	945	In terms of sectorial applications in support of redundant workers under the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF), a financial contribution from the EGF may be provided to an EU member state where there have been at least 500 redundancies, over a reference period of 9 months in a given NACE 2 (economic activity) sector and where it can be demonstrated that the redundancies have resulted from, for example:A substantial increase of imports into the EU for a given sector,A decline of EU market share in a given sector,Relocation of an undertaking to a third country,Global financial and economic crisis (temporary derogation between 1 May 2009 and 31 December 2011).The Department as the EGF Managing Authority monitors redundancies across all economic sectors including the banking and financial services sectors with a view to making a sustainable EGF application where possible. The first EGF applications in support of redundant workers at Dell, Waterford Crystal and S R Technics were made in 2009, with three more applications in the construction sector being made between June 2010 and February 2011. In assessing the feasibility of making an EGF application in the banking and financial services sectors, it is considered by the Department that the majority of the redundancies have been as a direct result of the global financial and economic crisis. Exploratory work undertaken by the Department, particularly from mid-2010 and continuing into 2011, based on the established collective redundancy monitoring system and following contacts with industry and the Department of Finance, seemed initially to indicate some potential for the making of an application in the banking sector but not in the financial services sector, in line with the required NACE 2 sectoral categorisation required under the EGF.However, upon subsequent detailed investigations, data available on actual confirmed redundancies in the banking and financial services sectors did not suggest to the Department that there were sufficient redundancies such as to sustain an EGF application at that time. Therefore, no application has been made to date in support of redundant workers in either the banking or financial services sectors. While there may be significant redundancies in these sectors in 2012, the European Council decision of 1 December 2011 to oppose the extension of the temporary derogation which allowed applications to be made on the basis of the rationale of the global economic and financial crisis beyond 31 December 2011, has now effectively ruled out the making of EGF applications in support of redundant workers in these sectors. Ireland and many other Member States had sought to retain the derogation but this was ultimately blocked by a sufficient minority of Member States. Developments in this regard will be kept under review by the Department should any change in the prevailing circumstances emerge over time.The Department continues to monitor collective redundancies across all sectors nationally in order to assess whether sustainable EGF applications can be made in those cases where all relevant EGF regulatory criteria are met.

The NCSE has published statistics in relation to resource allocations as at August 2010 on its website www.ncse.ie. In respect of resource allocations for pupils with Physical Disabilities enrolled to mainstream schools, 4,151 pupils with physical disabilities were allocated additional teaching support and 2,042 pupils were allocated access to Special Needs Assistant (SNA) support at that time. The NCSE notes that these figures cannot be added as many pupils who receive additional resource teaching support are also in receipt of SNA support. It should also be noted that some children with physical disabilities may also be included under the category of multiple disabilities. There are also categories for children with visual impairments and hearing impairment. In relation to the number of pupils with intellectual disability who are enrolled to mainstream schools, I wish to advise the Deputy that all mainstream primary schools have been allocated additional teaching resources under the General Allocation Model (GAM) to cater for children with high incidence special educational needs, including mild and borderline mild general learning difficulties. It is a matter for school authorities to determine how these hours are utilised to support eligible pupils. My Department therefore does not hold details of the number of pupils being supported through this mechanism. It is therefore not possible to identify the total numbers of pupils enrolled in mainstream schools who have some form of intellectual disability.I can advise the Deputy that the NCSE developed estimates on the prevalence of special educational needs as part of its process to advise the Minister on the implementation of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN), Act 2004. The Council estimated at that time that up to 18% of the school going population may have a special educational need, as defined under the EPSEN Act, while a more recent NCSE Report: A Study of the Prevalence of Special Educational Needs (2011) estimates that this figure may be even higher that 18% of the pupil population.

The ASF aims to complement the existing PE curriculum in schools.Since 2009, 875 primary schools, 125 post-primary schools and 4 Youthreach Centres have registered for participation in the programme. Some 110 schools have been awarded their flags in 2010 and 2011. It is expected that another 200 schools will have been awarded an ASF by the end of this current year. A full list of schools which have been awarded an active flag is available on the active school flag website (www.activeschoolflag.ie and click the ASF locations button). The list of schools which have applied to participate in the programme this year is being compiled and will be forwarded to the Deputy. The high level of participation by schools in the programme is indicative of the desire of teachers and schools to ensure that children are as active as possible. Active, enjoyable engagement in physical activity at a young age plays an important part in the development of habits that will contribute to good health and well-being in the long-term.

As a general principle it is good practice that where clarification on an issue pertaining to a particular science is required in the context of policy considerations, the views of professionals, qualified in that science to acceptable standards, will be sought. It is not however desirable that views and comment on a particular matter of science will be reserved exclusively to those trained in the science. Such a restriction would have the potential to exclude the views of many stakeholders, interested parties or indeed professionals qualified in related disciplines.  Moreover, it is not considered appropriate or indeed possible to limit debate on any matter of public policy to those with either qualifications or interest in the policy matter as to do so would obstruct to legitimate roles of a range of interested parties, including members of the Oireachtas and decision making bodies such as the Courts.

The programme is available in twenty hour and forty-five hour units. It features inputs from agencies such as the ambulance service, fire service and An Garda Síochána, as well as providing for visiting speakers, trips out of school, projects and case studies. The programme provides for an introduction to road safety for pedestrians, cyclists, motorcyclists and motorists, and covers such issues as seatbelts and airbags, driver fatigue, drink/drug driving, enforcement, basic first aid at road crashes, emergency services and rehabilitation. The programme is also supported by digital resources, including DVD support and access to international websites on road safety issues. Relevant Driver Theory Test learning is included at the end of each module. The programme does not include driving lessons. Under the revised Junior Cycle framework, schools will need to ensure that their students cover 24 Statements of Learning.  One of the Statements of Learning is that the student should "take action to safeguard and promote their well-being and that of others".  It is a matter for schools to determine how this might be implemented. It is, for example, open to schools to develop short courses at local level addressing this Statement of Learning including, should they so wish, curricular activities in relation to road safety. My Department will continue to work with the Road Safety Authority to strengthen the role of schools in promoting road safety even further

There are 24 Statements of Learning in the new Junior Cycle Framework.  It will be a matter for schools to determine, from the range of subjects and short courses on offer, how these statements of learning will be met. Reform will be introduced on a phased basis. All of the existing subjects are being continued, and Irish (except where there is an exemption), English and Mathematics will remain core full subjects. To start with, a revised syllabus in English will be implemented as a first step in the process, for students beginning junior cycle in 2014, for first examination in 2017. Groups of subjects will be implemented on a phased basis each year after that. Schools will also have the option of providing locally developed short courses of 100 hours, supported by exemplars developed by the NCCA.  A cap of 8 is being placed on the number of subjects which can be taken for examination purposes, to apply on a mandatory basis from the 2017 examination. Into the future, students will be able to take 8 subjects or 7 subjects with 2 short courses or 6 subjects and 4 short courses. Subjects will be assessed by means of a written examination set and marked by SEC, and a portfolio marked by the class teacher in the school, moderated by the school and subject to external moderation on a sample basis by SEC. Short course will be assessed in the school.

Establishing the appropriate suitability criteria that are relevant and appropriate to a particular contract is, of course, a matter for the contracting authority concerned. This is because the contracting authority is in the best position to gauge the appropriate levels of financial capacity that are appropriate to the needs of that specific contract.In this regard, tenderers must declare that they have the necessary capacity to carry out a contract and must be in a position to produce the necessary documentation when requested.  That documentary evidence (e.g. bank statements, audited accounts, proof of professional indemnity, etc.) need only be produced when a tenderer has been short-listed or is coming under consideration for the award of a contract. Contracting authorities are advised to check these issues throughout a procurement process up to the point of awarding a contract to ensure that such circumstances have not changed.  If the financial situation of the tenderer has changed they can be excluded from any further participation in the competition.Any tenders received from companies in receivership are considered on their own merits, taking account of the circumstances of the case and the provisions of the relevant tender competition.

Public procurement procedures require applicants to meet certain standards when applying for public contracts.  The criteria upon which contracting authorities may exclude applicants from the award procedure of public contracts are set out in Regulation 53 of SI 329 of 2006European Communities (Award of Public Contracts) Regulations 2006 and Article 45 and Recitals (34) and (43) of 2004/18/EC, the EU Directive on the co-ordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts, public supply contracts and public service contracts.  Before an applicant, in relation to certain breaches is excluded, the applicant may make a case and provide supporting evidence as to why it should not be excluded.  The contracting authority must consider this evidence before deciding whether to exclude or include an applicant.In qualifying for inclusion in tender competitions for public contracts, applicants must submit signed declarations stating that none of the circumstances outlined in Regulation 53 of SI 329 or Article 45 of 2004/18/EC apply.

Central to this is the protection and presentation of the significant collection of medieval carved stone features within the remains of the friary and the desirability of improving visitor access to the site.The project commenced with an analysis of the damaged and decayed carved stonework by a stone conservation specialist. The stonework was then removed for consolidation and repair and, on completion, it will be mounted on display plinths accompanied by information panels. The site of the 18th century church, which was built within the walls of the medieval nave, is the best location to provide a roofed sheltered environment for the protection and presentation of the medieval sculptures. The design of the modern roof reflects the original profile of the church and its lightweight structure will have a minimal impact on the original walls. The materials used externally match the fabric of the adjoining historic buildings.It is anticipated that all works will be completed by mid June this year. The site will then be opened to the public and there will be no entrance charge. A guide service will be provided from that date to the end of September.

The works in question involve excavating a stretch of channel at the new Dry Bridge structure in order to facilitate the draining of the flood plain upstream of that location into the River Suir when an extreme event occurs in Clonmel. This floodplain, which is dry in normal circumstances, is fed by various natural flowpaths when the Suir is in flood. One of these flowpaths was referred to in the documentation for the flood relief scheme that was put on public display by the technical term a 'spillway'. The works will improve the efficiency of this existing flowpath or spillway.

The new licence will be for a 20 year period and will involve an upfront payment to the State, with some of the payment being used to help fund the building of the proposed new National Children's Hospital.  The ongoing provision of a fixed percentage of annual lottery turnover for good causes will be a condition of the licence; this percentage is to be retained at 30.5% which was the level that applied in 2011.In relation to existing agents of the Lottery, I am cognisant of the essential role which retailers play in the operation of the National Lottery.  I am also aware of the importance to retailers of income from the Lottery, particularly in the present economic climate.  I can assure the Deputy that the position of retailers will be taken into consideration in the context of the arrangements for the next Lottery licence and in this regard officials of my Department will meet with the retailers' representative bodies to ascertain their concerns.

Funding of €100,000 was approved by the OPW to the council earlier this year under the scheme to undertake works to the embankments at Cromane Lower (north — end).With regard to the works at Rossbeigh Beach, Glenbeigh, the council submitted an application under the scheme in 2011 for funding of €350,000 to strengthen and extend rock armour revetment at this location.This Office has recently finalised its review of the eligibility criteria for coastal protection works, and will be writing to the council to request that a revised application be submitted for the project under the new criteria.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21584	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	971	I propose to take Questions Nos. 434, 451 to 453, inclusive, 457, 470 and 473 together.Vodafone Ireland announced on 22 March last that it had completed a review of the company's current contracted mobile call centre operations. The company has stated that, following this review, it will be adopting a new model for its mobile customer care, resulting in a move to a new provider, Teleperformance.    I have been assured that the transfer of service will observe the Transfer of Undertakings — Protection of Employees (European Communities (Protection of Employees on Transfer of Undertakings) Regulations 2003) Regulations.I met with a delegation from the Communications Workers' Union and Oireachtas members, on 5 April last, and discussed the effects of the proposed transfer on the employees concerned and the possible longer term implications of the move for the sector and for the regions in question.Vodafone Ireland and Rigney Dolphin, the current provider of the contracted service, have entered a six-week consultation process with employee representatives prior to the new arrangements taking effect.  Therefore, it would be inappropriate for me to comment further on the matter at this point.  I should point out, however, that the State's industrial relations machinery, including the Labour Relations Commission, is available to assist in this process, if requested.While the situation that has arisen on this occasion is regrettable, it is nevertheless reflective of the competitive forces that affect our economy and sector concerned.  Notwithstanding this, other positive moves such as the announcement last month by PayPal of the creation of 1,000 jobs in Dundalk, which is being supported by the Government through IDA Ireland, is a very encouraging sign for the Louth region.The issue of statutory redundancy payments is a matter for the Minister for Social Protection.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21584	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	972	The Temporary Partial Credit Guarantee Scheme is to operate under the De Minimis State Aid rules as agreed by the Government in November.  The De Minimis State Aid framework provides a basis for swift implementation of such a Scheme.Operating within the scope of the De Minimis State Aid regulations places limits on the range of options available in terms of the extent and pricing of the support which can be provided. It also places some limitations on the business sectors and loan purposes which the Scheme can support.  Primary production in agriculture, horticulture and fisheries are excluded from the scope of the scheme in the light of particular restrictions under the De Minimis State Aid rules.The relevant regulations are:Commission Regulation (EC) No 1998/2006 on the application of Articles 87 and 88 of the Treaty to de minimis aidCommission Notice on the application of Articles 87 and 88 of the EC Treaty to State aid in the form of guarantees (2008/C 155/02)Furthermore, the Scheme is a targeted intervention to address specific market failure where a business is unable to secure lending due to a lack of security required for conventional collateral based lending.The evidence is that currently, the agricultural sector is not experiencing a significant market failure in relation to collateral based lending in comparison to other industry sectors. The Government agreed that the absence of security was less likely to be an issue in agriculture than in many other sectors, as at least for owner farmers there would be the underlying asset of the farmland and buildings, and thus there would be proportionately fewer agriculture borrowing propositions to which the principal underlying rationale for the Scheme would apply.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21584	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	973	The position is that Vodafone tendered for its Mobile Customer Service work in 2012.  Rigney Dolphin was the incumbent provider with 290 full-time-equivalent positions at Vodafone's offices in Dundalk and Dublin.  A French company, Teleperformance (also Vodafone's UK provider) won the new tender.  Teleperformance has operations in Newry, Co. Down.  I understand that this change has arisen out of Vodafone's on-going review of customer care and the necessity for the company to provide services as cost effectively as possible.  As the Deputy can appreciate the market for these types of contract is extremely competitive.Vodafone Ireland has advised that it envisages that all of Rigney Dolphin staff based in Vodafone will transfer as employees to Teleperformance and that the transfer will observe the Transfer of Undertakings — Protection of Employees (European Communities (Protection of Employees on Transfer of Undertakings) Regulations 2003) Regulations.The Regulations require that in a transfer situation, both the original employer and the new employer inform employee representatives of the reasons for the transfer and the date on which it will take effect.  There is also a requirement to advise employees of the legal, economic and social implications for them of the transfer.  This information is required to be given no later than 30 days in advance of the intended date of the transfer.I understand that Vodafone Ireland and Rigney Dolphin are entering a six-week consultation process with employee representatives, prior to the new arrangements taking effect and therefore, it would be inappropriate for me to comment further at this point.As always, the State's industrial relations machinery, including the Labour Relations Commission, is available to assist in this process, if requested and it goes without saying that the State enterprise agencies, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland, and Louth County Enterprise Board will continue to make every effort that they can to develop new employment opportunities for Dundalk.Recent developments such as the announcement last month by PayPal to create 1,000 jobs in Dundalk, which is being supported by the Government through IDA Ireland, demonstrates that Dundalk provides the key skills and business infrastructure required by global leaders such as PayPal and is an encouraging sign for the future.

In this instance the salary advertised for the post was €30,000 but   this did not correspond with the salary proposed for this application.The applicant was notified of this decision in writing and of their right to appeal this decision within 21 days.  To date no such appeal has been received in the Employment Permits Section.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21584	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	975	I propose to take Questions Nos. 438 and 455 together.Industrial action by 110 workers at the Irish Cement production plants at Platin, Co. Meath and Castlemungret, Co. Limerick began on 3rd April last.I understand that the Labour Court's most recent Recommendation of January 2012 in relation to this dispute was the culmination of a protracted dialogue between the company and the group of unions representing the workers on restructuring issues that had already involved three successive Labour Court Recommendations.The Labour Court noted in its Recommendation of last January that it was not in a position, on the basis of the information provided through a report of a Financial Assessor undertaken following agreement between the parties, to make a definitive recommendation on an adjustment of pay rates and pay structures for the future. The Labour Court had, accordingly, urged the parties to engage with each other regarding the total cost base of the company.The Labour Relations Commission was subsequently closely involved in facilitating talks between the company and the group of unions which were aimed at finding an agreed solution to the matters in dispute. That process of dialogue proceeded to the stage at which proposals for a settlement of the dispute were rejected by the trade unions concerned and a work stoppage commenced.According to the company, pay rates in the company have remained unchanged since 2008 and currently are 60% higher than the average industrial wage for unionised staff, despite the unprecedented deterioration in the Irish construction sector.According to the Irish cement group of unions, the company has insisted that a pay cut is implemented before outstanding bonuses are paid.I would urge the parties involved in this dispute to have regard to the continuing availability of the industrial relations dispute resolution bodies to assist them in seeking a settlement and in addressing the underlying challenge of a major restructuring of the company in the face of the dramatic changes in the building industry.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21584	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	977	The Programme for Government contains a specific commitment to enact legislation to regulate certain practices in the grocery goods sector .   I intend to give effect to this commitment by including an enabling provision in the legislation currently being prepared by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to merge the National Consumer Agency and the Competition Authority, which will allow for the introduction of a statutory Code of Practice in the grocery goods sector.The principles of better regulation require that proposals for legislative change to the regulatory framework are subject to a Regulatory Impact Analysis. It is intended that a detailed Regulatory Impact Analysis will be carried out prior to the introduction of a statutory Code of Practice in the Grocery Goods Sector. I would point out that a number of the elements of the impact analysis have already been carried out through the various public consultation exercises in 2009 and in 2011.The Government considers it important that there is balance in the relationship between the various players in the grocery goods sector. The Government intends to introduce a Code of Practice that achieves such a balance and is committed to ensure that the legislative process allowing for the promulgation of a Code fully takes into account the interests of all stakeholders in the grocery goods sector, including the interests of the consumer.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21584	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	980	The achievement of balanced regional growth continues to be a core objective of Government.  Promoting entrepreneurship and facilitating the key infrastructural needs of Irish enterprise across all regions is vital to ensuring a vigorous pipeline of new business leaders, new business ideas and entre-preneurial activity.Enterprise Ireland activity in Co. Kerry is focussed on the creation of new jobs through supporting entrepreneurs to set up new High Potential Start-Up Companies, on the retention and creation of new jobs in existing companies through support of company development plans, and in enhancing the innovation capability of Ireland at a national and regional level through support of research in companies and third level institutions.In 2011, there were 3,602 people employed in 124 Enterprise Ireland client companies in Co. Kerry, with 117 of these jobs created during that year.  The financial support provided by Enterprise Ireland to its client companies in Co. Kerry totalled almost €2.6m in 2011.   Additionally, Enterprise Ireland has provided funding of over €2.2m, as well as other supports, for the development of incubation facilities at the Institute of Technology, Tralee.The Tom Crean Business Centrealso  provides incubation space for Enterprise Ireland clients in the start-up phase of their business.  Enterprise Ireland co-funded the support of a Development Manager for the Centre for two years. The agency is also supporting the Institute of Technology and the Tom Crean Centre in the delivery of the “New Frontiers”   Programme which is due to commence in May 2012 in Tralee, with up to 12 High Potential Start Up businesses. This programme will run over a six-month period and provides structured business development modules and mentored guidance to assist the participants to develop their business ideas and business plans which may be eligible for further Enterprise Ireland or other financial/soft supports.Enterprise Ireland has also approved funding totalling more than €1.7m towards the construction and development of several Community Enterprise Centres in Co. Kerry over the past number of years, including Killarney Technology Innovation Centre, Iveragh Coop Farmers Mart Society Ltd., and Kenmare Mart Enterprise Coop Society Ltd.I am confident that the initiatives being pursued by Enterprise Ireland will continue to support employment opportunities Co. Kerry.

I am informed that an uncharacteristic delay of two weeks occurred in responding to this communication. As soon as this was brought to the attention of the agency, they acted immediately.The agency has offered to meet with the promoter to discuss his proposals in more detail.  However, the promoter has not taken up the agency's offer of a meeting to date.  The agency would be happy to engage with the promoter to discuss his proposal if he still wishes to do so.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21584	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	982	The Deputy's question concerns a dispute between the company and twenty employees in relation to a claim for enhanced redundancy terms in excess of the employees' statutory redundancy entitlement, following the acquisition of the company and the closure of its Dublin offices in 2011.I understand that the company has complied with its obligations in respect of statutory redundancy payments and that a total of 35 redundancy rebate claims have been made to the Department of Social Protection in respect of the company concerned.The Labour Court conducts hearings on trade disputes and issues recommendations setting out its opinion on the dispute and the terms on which it should be settled. The Labour Court is a court of last resort in the industrial relations process, and it is expected that the parties come to the process in good faith and consequently are prepared to give serious consideration to the Court's recommendation.However, the system of industrial relations in Ireland is essentially voluntary in nature and recommendations of the Labour Court are not legally binding.  Neither the Labour Court, nor I, can compel a company to comply with such recommendations.  Ultimately, responsibility for the settlement of a trade dispute rests with the parties to the dispute.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21584	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	983	On the 22 March last, Vodafone Ireland announced that it had completed a review of the company's current contracted mobile call centre operations. The company has stated that it will be adopting a new model for its mobile customer care, resulting in a move to a new provider, Teleperformance.  As part of the changes, 27 Vodafone roles and 290 contract roles currently provided by Rigney Dolphin will transfer to Teleperformance.I have been in contact with Vodafone Ireland and the company has advised that it envisages that all of Rigney Dolphin staff based in Vodafone will transfer as employees to Teleperformance and that the transfer will observe the Transfer of Undertakings — Protection of Employees (European Communities (Protection of Employees on Transfer of Undertakings) Regulations 2003) Regulations.Vodafone Ireland and Rigney Dolphin have now entered a six-week consultation process with employee representatives prior to the new arrangements taking effect. Therefore, it would be inappropriate of me to comment further on the matter at this point. The State's industrial relations machinery, including the Labour Relations Commission, is available to assist in the process, if required.In relation to job retention schemes, the Employment Subsidy Scheme (Temporary) was introduced in December 2008, to help employees maintain their jobs while at the same time assisting employers to retain their productive capacity.  The European Commission approved the introduction of the scheme under the "Temporary framework for State Aid measures to support access to finance in the current financial and economic crisis".  The Framework was brought in on a temporary basis to allow Member States increased flexibility to assist companies in the real economy that were facing difficulties in accessing finance as a result of the economic downturn.  This temporary framework was limited to a two-year period and it expired at the end of 2010.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21584	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	984	The retail sector has been impacted by a shift in consumer spending patterns and an overall reduction in the level of consumer spending as a result of the recession.  Statistics published by the Central Statistics Office at the end of March show that the volume of retail sales — including the motor trade — decreased by 1.9% over the period February 2011 to February 2012.Nonetheless, the retail sector provides employment to 262,000 people in Ireland and is an essential part of our economy, both nationally and at a local level.  The Action Plan for Jobs includes a number of measures which will help to support employment the retail sector.  These include:measures to improve access to finance for business;the promotion of greater use of ICT to enhance productivity and increase on-line trading;the enactment of legislation to reform the statutory wage setting mechanisms;provision of funding for the up-skilling of workers in the sector;supports for management development and mentoring;the introduction of legislation to allow for the introduction of a Statutory Code of Practice for Grocery Goods undertakings;acceleration of the programme of revaluation of commercial premises, which will provide a basis for the adjustment in commercial rates.Local Authorities have also been asked to exercise restraint in the setting of commercial rates for 2012 and I understand from my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Mr Phil Hogan TD, that almost all have responded positively.Other initiatives which the Government introduced as part of the Jobs Initiative last May will also continue to help support employment in the retail sector.  These include the halving of Employer's PRSI on earnings up to €356 per week and the reduction in the 13.5% VAT rate to 9% on certain goods and services.

Concerning the other aspects of the Deputy's question, this information is not readily available and would entail the investment of scarce resources to compile the information requested.  A rough estimate would indicate that approximately 10% of written answers involved the subsequent provision of information directly to Deputies. This follow-up information is provided primarily by Agencies of the Department.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21584	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	986	Officials from my Department have contacted representatives of the Administrator of the company on several occasions since the announcement of the closure of the stores.  The representatives confirmed that the business and assets of the company were sold on 1 April 2012.  Despite this sale, the company remains insolvent.  The purchaser has indicated that, for economic reasons, it does not intend to retain any of the Republic of Ireland stores at this time.I am informed that, prior to their closure, all the Republic of Ireland stores were operating at a loss, as the leases had been negotiated at the height of the market, and it was not viable for these stores to continue trading.  Regrettably, there would appear to be no prospect of these stores re-opening.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21584	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	987	Rents are just one element of overhead costs that affect businesses.  The National Competitiveness Council reported in its Competitiveness Scorecard 2011 that Ireland experienced a fall of 22% in rental costs for prime industrial sites in 2010, with a decline of 12.3% in prime office space rental costs.  These were the largest annual declines experienced across the countries benchmarked, and both marked a continuation of falling prices seen since the peak in 2007.  Nonetheless, the existence of upward-only rent reviews in leases has been cited as one of a number of issues that is affecting businesses at present.  The impact of the recession and a changing marketplace were also stated to be factors which led to the closure of the company referred to by the Deputy.The Land Conveyancing and Law Reform Act 2009 abolished upward-only rent reviews for all new leases signed on or after 28 February 2010.  However, upward-only rent review clauses continue to apply to leases which were entered into prior to that date.  Despite extensive consideration by the Government, it has not proved possible to develop a targeted scheme to tackle upward only rent reviews in existing business leases which would not be vulnerable to a legal challenge or require compensation to be paid to landlords.However, in Budget 2012, the Minister for Finance, Mr. Michael Noonan TD, gave a commitment that downward pressure will be placed on commercial rents in respect of which NAMA has acquired the loan on the underlying property.  NAMA has developed a Guidance Note for dealing with tenants' difficulties arising from upward-only rent reviews in relation to its own portfolio of property.  This provides an opportunity for NAMA to approve rent reductions where it can be shown that rents are in excess of current market levels and a tenant's viability is threatened.  The policy also provides for the appointment of an independent valuation of market rent where necessary.Minister Noonan recently informed the House that NAMA had received 114 applications for rent abatements prior to issuing the Guidance Note, of which 113 applications were approved and one was refused.  Minister Noonan was also informed by NAMA that, since 6 December 2011, it had received a further 40 applications for rent abatements under the terms of the Guidance Note.  By 27 March last, 5 of these applications were approved, another 2 were ineligible as they related to properties which are not held as security by NAMA, with the remaining 33 applications still under review.Separately, the Department of Justice and Law Reform has continued to progress the recommendations of the Working Group on Transparency in Commercial Rent Reviews since it reported in July 2010.  Businesses can make use of the Rent Review Arbitration Code, which was drawn up by the Working Group to help to resolve issues at a lower cost, in considerably less time, and in a less adversarial way for the parties concerned.

Accordingly, I have forwarded your question to the Chief Executive of the LRC and asked that he respond directly to you on the matter insofar as it relates to that body.In the 12 months to 31st March 2012 the number of determinations issued by the Employment Appeals Tribunal was 4,043. In the same period the number of Employment Rights Determinations issued by the Labour Court was 246.  The National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) does not issue judgements or determinations.  It does have a role in the enforcement of determinations of the other employment rights bodies.The mechanism for enforcing determinations of the Employment Appeals Tribunal and Decisions/determinations of the Labour Court/Rights Commissioners is prescribed in the relevant legislation under which the decision/determination is made.  Generally, this involves an application to the Circuit Court for an order directing compliance, or instituting proceedings in the District Court as the case may be.The legislation also prescribes who may apply to the courts to enforce the determinations.  In most cases determinations are enforced by or on behalf of the complainant.  However, in some instances the Minister may, if he considers it appropriate, apply on behalf of a party when requested to do so. The National Employment Rights Authority (NERA), initiate these proceedings on behalf of the Minister.Unless a request to enforce a determination/order had been made to me as stated I would not be aware of any enforcement proceedings or voluntary compliance in respect of an order/determination.  Therefore, I am not in a position to supply figures for the number of employers who complied with the determinations of the bodies concerned.  The only detail in this regard that is available to me relates the number of cases in respect of which requests were made to the Minister during the past 12 months.

In order to reach this target it will be necessary to implement radical reform across Government and the economy to make it easier for businesses to establish, thrive and create jobs.IDA Ireland is the Agency charged with the attraction of foreign direct investment (FDI) to Ireland, while Enterprise Ireland is responsible for developing indigenous industry. Client companies of both agencies employ over 6,000 people in permanent employment in Counties Longford and Westmeath.Enterprise Ireland client companies located in Counties Longford and Westmeath were paid €4.3m in 2011 for job creation and retention and business development purposes.  In addition, Innovation Vouchers were awarded to 30 companies based in these counties during 2011.  This Enterprise Ireland run scheme awards eligible companies €5,000 worth of research and development with knowledge providers such as the local Athlone Institute of Technology. Shasta Ltd. in Co. Longford and Nopsar Ltd in Co. Westmeath are High Potential Start-Up (HPSU) companies that recently received investment from Enterprise Ireland.IDA Ireland has strong relationships with its client companies and works closely with them in order to ensure their long term sustainability and encourage their growth, development, broadening of their mandate and continuing re-investment in their sites.With the improved infrastructure that is now in place, a significant number of people commute within the Midlands Region and a project win in one Midlands town has a positive impact on the other surrounding areas due to the close proximity of all main locations. It must be acknowledged, however, that there is intense international competition to win FDI, which is mainly dominated by Metro City Regions with populations in excess of 1 million.  Ireland has one Metro Region, the Greater Dublin area, so in order to achieve balanced regional development IDA Ireland focuses on promoting Gateway locations within each Region as the areas of critical mass and highlights the opportunities provided by Hub locations which are within commuting distances of these Gateways.  In that context, the Midlands Gateway of Mullingar, Tullamore and Athlone is a key focus of IDA Ireland and the agency markets the Midlands Gateway for new Greenfield investments through its network of overseas offices. While IDA Ireland seeks to influence the location of investments it must be remembered that, ultimately, it is the investor who decides where to locate.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21584	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	994	An Exchequer allocation is provided each year under the Estimates process for the funding of the County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs). Allocation of funding to individual CEBs is conducted each year by the Central Coordination Unit (CCU) within Enterprise Ireland. In determining these allocations, a systematic approach is adopted by the CCU to ensure the maximum degree of objectivity and equity of treatment.  This approach involves the provision of funding on the basis of a standard allocation to each CEB, as well as an extra allocation that is determined mainly by population but which also takes account of issues such as local unemployment trends, capacity to spend, existing commitments and regional spread.The Exchequer allocation is made in the context of the overall public finances and in 2012 amounts to €26.386m, of which €15m is available for direct grants and training, mentoring and advice services to micro-enterprise clients.  The balance of €11.386m in Pay and Non-Pay costs is also instrumental to the full delivery of support services to the micro-enterprise sector, as this allocation encompasses staff costs associated with delivery of general business advice and information to clients, the conducting of site visits by staff to ensure that grant conditions are being met, etc. This represents a strong investment in the micro-enterprise sector, notwithstanding the additional level of demand on CEB services generated in the current difficult economic climate.As part of the CCU's ongoing management of available funding during the year, the Unit will continue to monitor CEB spending. Should any surplus funding become available, this will be reallocated by the CCU to any Boards that are in a position to spend additional funds, subject to thorough assessment of the rationale and the justification for the level of funding being requested.Information on the Exchequer allocations for the individual CEBs for 2012 is in a table:CEBs and Exchequer Capital Funding Allocations 2012Grants (‘Measure 1’)“Soft Supports” (‘Measure 2’— enterprise development)Total Exchequer Capital AllocationPayNon-PayTotal Exchequer Current AllocationCarlow€171,585€175,380€346,965€123,160€105,367€228,527Cavan€180,328€184,317€364,645€302,898€94,973€397,871Clare€201,308€205,760€407,068€153,377€89,217€242,594Cork City€202,274€206,748€409,022€191,498€100,605€292,103Cork North€188,078€192,238€380,316€88,511€73,346€161,857Cork South€260,427€266,187€526,614€277,892€144,923€422,815Cork West€178,567€182,516€361,083€262,605€117,627€380,232Donegal€222,302€227,219€449,521€302,645€111,844€414,488Dublin City€409,668€404,794€814,462€305,930€127,965€433,895Dublin South€271,996€278,012€550,008€239,037€63,565€302,601Dún Laoghaire€244,263€249,665€493,928€304,215€147,448€451,662Fingal€275,751€281,850€557,601€260,007€107,372€367,379Galway€265,021€270,882€535,903€175,378€123,142€298,520Kerry€214,733€219,482€434,215€281,650€72,821€354,471Kildare€245,674€251,107€496,781€155,388€83,410€238,798Kilkenny€191,047€195,273€386,320€258,697€79,876€338,573Laois€183,944€188,012€371,956€197,878€92,551€290,429Leitrim€147,105€164,293€311,398€272,599€64,467€337,066Limerick City€172,656€176,475€349,131€266,293€95,475€361,768Limerick County€209,718€214,356€424,074€253,082€84,028€337,109Longford€164,167€167,798€331,965€210,710€68,400€279,110Mayo€207,823€212,419€420,242€59,228€76,325€135,553Meath€233,317€238,478€471,795€306,156€105,545€411,701Monaghan€174,427€178,285€352,712€233,817€67,973€301,789Offaly€182,303€186,233€368,536€274,423€79,420€353,843Roscommon€176,050€179,943€355,993€120,195€83,695€203,890Sligo€176,704€180,612€357,316€263,709€78,851€342,560Tipperary North€179,063€183,023€362,086€267,852€95,000€362,852Tipperary South€187,745€191,898€379,643€171,427€72,523€243,950Waterford City€167,874€171,587€339,461€106,467€114,528€220,996Waterford County€177,509€181,435€358,944€115,803€64,520€180,323Westmeath€186,567€190,693€377,260€263,348€105,335€368,683Wexford€214,840€219,592€434,432€217,820€80,206€298,026Wicklow€210,634€215,292€425,926€300,823€105,013€405,836Centralised CEB Network Enterprise Development Activities€279,901€202,398Total€7,279,599€7,440,500€15,000,000€7,864,270€3,319,332€11,386,000Data source: CCU Allocations.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21584	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	995	The Action Plan for Jobs has set a target of supporting the creation of 100,000 net new jobs over the period 2012 to 2016, with the longer term objective of having 2 million people at work by 2020. In order to reach this target it will be necessary to implement radical reform across Government and the economy to make it easier for businesses to establish, thrive and create jobs.With reference to County Kerry, IDA Ireland markets the linked hub locations of Killarney in South Kerry and Tralee in North Kerry for new foreign direct investment (FDI). In addition, IDA Ireland actively promotes other locations as part of its marketing efforts in response to specific client queries on an opportunistic basis.At the end of 2011 there were 12 IDA Ireland supported companies in Kerry employing 1,294 permanent staff. Based on the strengths of the region, IDA is particularly targeting the ICT, International Financial Services and Globally Traded Business sectors.  In addition, IDA Ireland is working closely with educational institutions and FÁS to develop the skill sets necessary to attract high value added employment to the county.One of the targets outlined in IDA's Strategy document "Horizon 2020" is that 50% of investments will be located outside of Dublin and Cork. It is acknowledged, however, that there is intense and continual international competition to win this FDI, which is mainly dominated by Metro City Regions with populations in excess of 1 million.  Ireland has one Metro Region, the Greater Dublin area, so in order to achieve balanced regional development IDA Ireland focuses on promoting Gateway locations within each Region as the areas of critical mass and highlights the opportunities provided by Hub locations which are within commuting distances of these Gateways.  In the final analysis, however, it is the investor who decides where to locate.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21584	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	997	In the matter referred to, officials from my Department have been in touch with representatives of the Administrator of the company on several occasions since the announcement of the closure of the stores and I have been apprised of developments.While any dispute of this nature is regrettable, the role of the State in such circumstances is to provide supports that allow the parties to resolve disputes themselves, rather than to seek to impose a solution.  The Conciliation Service of the Labour Relations Commission can assist the parties in seeking a resolution, to any issues of dispute, where requested by both parties.  I understand that neither party to this dispute has sought the assistance of the Labour Relations Commission to assist them in resolving the issues in dispute.As the company is insolvent, the Administrator has stated that there are no funds available to pay statutory redundancy, pay in lieu of notice, holiday pay etc. to former employees.  Employees have instead been referred to the Department of Social Protection, to which they can make a claim from the Insolvency Fund administered by that Department.  I have been informed that the administrators are assisting the workers in this process.With regard to other rights and entitlements, complaints regarding alleged breaches of employment rights, if any, may be brought to a rights commissioner or the Employment Appeals Tribunal, as appropriate.

An appeal against the Decision to refuse a Permit in this case was received on 8th March 2012. Appeals in respect of refusals of Work permit applications are processed in date of receipt order by permit type and this application will be processed in sequence.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	14378	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1000	The Programme for Government contains a commitment to establish a network of Technology Research Centres designed to accelerate the exploitation of new technologies and bridge the gap between research and technology commercialisation.Technology centres are public-private research centres of excellence that connect industry to the higher education sector to increase the generation and availability of new, industrially relevant knowledge. The research agenda is driven and led by companies involved in the relevant sectors and leverages the strength of other previous academic research funding provided by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland are undertaking preparatory actions, as set out in the Action Plan for Jobs, through engagement with groups of companies relevant to the three research centres referred to.  These company groups are in the process of defining their research needs and are being facilitated in documenting these needs.  On the basis of a demonstrated industry requirement and demand the research needs identified will be formally submitted for external assessment by the end of June and, subject to the results of this assessment, will form the basis for a call for research provision later in 2012.

However, I have referred the Question to the Agencies for direct reply to the Deputy.In relation to the appropriate use of State resources, it is the case that the State Agencies are subject to the 2009 Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies and must therefore comply with all EU and national procurement rules.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1003	Under the provisions of section 19 of the Civil Registration Act, 2004, all live births fall to be registered.Where a child is stillborn, and weighs not less than 500 grams, or has a gestational age of not less than 24 weeks and shows no sign of life, the parents may, within 12 months of the stillbirth, arrange to have the required particulars entered in the register of stillbirths.I understand that the designation of a stillbirth, as outlined above, is the generally accepted medical definition.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1004	I assume that the Deputy is referring to the results of the CSO's Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC) for 2010 for which the full results were recently published and to the fact that the consistent poverty rate for the 0-17 age-group was 8.1 per cent in 2010 (roughly equivalent to 100,000 persons).The consistent poverty measure includes those households that experience basic deprivation (enforced lack of 2 out of 11 items) and whose income falls below 60% of median equivalised household income.  The list of deprivation measure includes two food-related items (eating a meal with meat, chicken, fish (or vegetarian equivalent) every second day; having a roast joint or its equivalent once a week) but it does not directly seek to measure malnutrition in the population.The Government is acutely aware of the need to address child poverty as a priority. Plans to tackle child poverty are outlined in the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion 2007-2016 (NAPSincl) and in the Programme for Government. The Government is committed to achieving the targets in the NAPSincl to reduce the number of people experiencing poverty. These targets are currently being reviewed to ensure that they continue to be appropriate and achievable.A multi-dimensional approach to tackling child poverty is needed to take into account income supports, services and parental access to employment. The overriding objective for the Government is to increase employment, promote activation, skills training and education and thus build real and sustainable economic growth and to protect those who are most vulnerable in our society. The Programme for Government sets out the framework to achieve these aims. New initiatives such as Pathways to Work will help to facilitate those who have been long-term unemployed to re-enter the labour market.  The highest rates of poverty are in jobless households and households that have limited engagement with the labour market. These groups include lone parent families, unemployed people with disabilities and unemployed families. Children in jobless households are three times more likely to experience consistent poverty than children generally.The Government has endeavoured insofar as it could to limit changes in social welfare to avoid any general reduction in primary weekly welfare payments. Additional supports to families on low incomes such as child-related increases to social welfare payments and the family income supplement have remained unchanged, even as other changes, such as the standardisation of Child Benefit, are an important step in introducing a more appropriate system of child income supports.The poverty reduction effect after social transfers also demonstrates that the social protection system is protecting children at risk. In 2010, social transfers (excluding pensions) reduced the at-risk-of-poverty rate by 60 per cent. From 2004 to 2009 (most recent data for children), the poverty reduction effect of social transfers for children's at-risk-of-poverty rate increased from 43 per cent to 60 per cent. This reflects concerted State intervention and investment in the social protection system during this period.This Department also works closely with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs (DCYA) in relation to these issues.  In this context, it is worth noting that my colleague, Frances Fitzgerald T.D., Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, plans to enhance the role of early intervention and support programmes for the most vulnerable children and their families in the context of the new Child and Family Support Agency.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1005	I propose to take Questions Nos. 477 and 557 together.
Carer's Allowance is a means-tested payment for people who provide full-time care and attention to someone who requires it and in the course of processing applications for this scheme, a Social Welfare Inspector usually speaks to the person concerned in order to establish that the various statutory conditions of the scheme are satisfied.To ensure the best possible standards in dealing with members of the public, the Department operates a code of practice which commits to treating all customers equally, fairly and with respect.  When interviewing clients, Social Welfare Inspectors are instructed to take account of any special circumstances and to conduct the interview with tact, sympathy and empathy.  The work of an inspector is always conducted on a confidential basis and where necessary another person can be present at the interview to provide support.A range of training courses are in place specifically designed to equip Social welfare Inspectors with the skills necessary to deal with all customers in a professional manner. These courses include the provision of interviewing and reporting skills as well training on Disability Awareness, Diversity Awareness, and Customer Service. In the event that a person is unhappy with the manner in which an interview was conducted he/she can avail of the Department's Customer Complaints procedures. Details of this procedure are available on the Department's website www.welfare.ie.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1006	Activation programmes for people with disabilities have been consolidated under the new national identity 'Employ Ability Service’. The EmployAbility service offers a range of supports: wage subsidy scheme, employment services including job search activities and on-the-job coaching; employer supports which comprise disability awareness training support, employee retention grants and workplace adaptation grants.  The service is key in supporting people with disabilities overcome the challenges not only of adapting to employment and being accepted in the workplace but in demonstrating their productive capability and ability to do the job.In addition the Department caters for people with disabilities in its community employment programme.The range of options available to people with disabilities has been augmented further by the introduction of the partial capacity benefit scheme which I launched in February this year.  The partial capacity benefit scheme is open to people who are in receipt of invalidity pension or who have been in receipt of illness benefit for a minimum of six months.  Participation in the scheme is voluntary and the scheme is designed in particular to respond to the needs of people who currently seek to avail of ‘exemptions' in order to take up employment opportunities.In addition I recently announced the expansion of the Disability Activation Project. This project is co-funded by the European Union under the European Social Fund and the Irish Government.  The strategic aim of the Disability Activation Project is to increase the capacity and potential of people on the Department's disability /illness welfare payments to participate in the labour market, based on a case management approach.  The Project is being expanded through the issue of a Call for Proposals which opened in February and invited organisations in the Border, Midlands and Western region that have experience of working with people with disability to submit projects for funding.  The closing date for receipt of application was 13 April.Services available to people with disability are not differentiated on the basis of the nature or type of disability of the client.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1008	Section 61 of the Civil Registration Act, 2004 governs access to civil registration records, including birth certificates.  It provides that following an application in writing by a person and on payment of the prescribed fee a Superintendent Registrar, a registrar, an authorised officer or the Registrar General shall give the person a certified copy of the entry in the register.  Certificates may be ordered in person, by post, by fax, or online.In all cases, the applicant must provide their name and address, as well as the details of the person to whom the record relates. Payment must be by cash, cheque, debit card or credit card. The vast majority of payments are by credit/debit card and credit/debit card payments are only accepted where the name on the credit/debit card and the name of the applicant are the same. In addition, the vast majority of applications are by post, by fax or online, and the applicant in all cases must provide a delivery address.The computerisation of the registration system has enabled extensive electronic exchange of civil registration data with other public bodies. This has greatly reduced the need for members of the public to obtain physical copies of certificates.I would also point out that while birth certificates are frequently used for access to public and other services, a birth certificate is not an identity document. If a birth certificate is presented to a public body, it is the responsibility of that body to satisfy itself as to the identity of the person who presents the document. If the body in question has concerns that there is anything untoward, that body should report the matter to an Garda Síochána. To alter a certificate or use an altered certificate is a serious offence.The paper on which certificates are issued has a significant number of advanced security features, and it is extremely difficult to forge a certificate.In light of the above, there are no plans to insist that evidence of identity be produced when applying for a birth certificate. As there is no statutory system of identity documentation in the State, the requirement to produce evidence of identity could result in persons who have no identity documents being denied access even to their own certificates.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1010	The Department is committed to delivering the best possible service to its customers.  In the interests of fairness and equity applications are processed, as far as possible, in order of the date on which they were received in the Department.A major service delivery modernisation project is underway to address the large increase in the claim-load and to improve the efficiency of administration of the carer's allowance scheme. This involves the development of information technology functions and associated business process re-organisation. It is anticipated that the new system will introduce significant processing efficiencies and a quicker and more responsive service to the customer. Accordingly, the project is being given high priority and involves a significant level of time and commitment from the relevant staff in the Department.  This has had a short-term negative impact on claim processing times.  This essential focus of certain staff resources will continue until the completion of the modernisation project in June of this year when all existing carer's allowance claims will be transferred onto the new processing system.Accurate processing time figures are not available at present as applications are still being processed on both the old and the new computer systems. The average time to award an application at present is estimated at around 28 weeks. There are currently approximately 7,800 new applications registered and awaiting a decision and approximately 330 new applications are received each week.  I acknowledge that this is unsatisfactory but I am satisfied that the Department is taking all steps available to it to resolve the issue.In addition to the deployment of new systems which should address service levels in the medium term, the Department is allocating additional resources in the form of overtime working to help reduce backlogs that have built up.  In addition, approval has recently been  given for the assignment of temporary staff to expedite the reduction of the backlogs. However, it is expected to be a significant number of months before the backlog is reduced to an acceptable level.In the meantime, if a person's means are insufficient to meet their needs while awaiting a decision on an application, they may apply for a means-tested supplementary welfare allowance payment from their local community welfare officer.

This review of CE Schemes has proved to be a valuable exercise for both the schemes themselves and for my Department.Given the volume and breath of the data being returned, the financial review of CE schemes will take longer than originally envisaged to complete.  This will allow more time for schemes to engage with local officials in the finalisation of their respective budgets and for my Department to bring forward improvements to the overall operation of Community Employment which will improve the budgetary situation for schemes. No final allocations of materials and training grants have been made pending completion of the review.The existing commitment in relation to the financial support of schemes will continue to apply.

However due to the current economic circumstances, this Department has had to find significant savings in the Budget for 2012. The reduction only applies to the grant for materials and training and represents a reduction of 7.5% of the overall expenditure on Community Employment in 2011. The allowance grants for Supervisors are unchanged, as are the working hours for staff employed under Community Employment. There will be no decrease in the number of Community Employment places allocated to this sector in 2012.Department officials have met with representatives of these projects on a number of occasions and are very mindful of the challenges facing these centres and are very supportive within the parameters set down for Community Employment.

The medical evidence provided by the claimant in support of her claim was examined by a medical assessor who expressed the opinion that the person concerned was not eligible for invalidity pension as she does not satisfy the medical criteria.  The application for invalidity pension was, accordingly, disallowed by a deciding officer.  The person in question was notified of this decision and the reason for it.Further medical evidence was subsequently submitted by the claimant.  This additional evidence, along with the original information, was evaluated by a different medical assessor who expressed the opinion that the person concerned does not satisfy the medical criteria.  The deciding officer found that there were no grounds to overturn the original decision to disallow invalidity pension and the person concerned was notified of the outcome of this review on 9 February 2012.

However, I am aware of the variations and high costs associated with obtaining insurance for CE schemes. As a result officials from my Department had commenced a review of insurance and other costs with the objective of achieving value for money and cost reductions.As a result of this review there are indications from the providers of such insurance that cover can be provided at a rate that reflects the costs at the lower end of the current scale of charges. This will result in a significant cost reduction for the Department in 2012.

The current free travel scheme provides free travel on the main public and private transport services for those eligible under the scheme. These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus Átha Cliath, Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann, as well as Luas and services provided by over 90 private transport operators.  In 2011 there were almost 730,000 people in receipt of free travel at a cost of €76 million.I appreciate the important role that free travel plays in promoting social inclusion and preventing the isolation of elderly people. However, all of the schemes operated by my Department, including free travel, were examined in the context of the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure and continue to be kept under review given the on-going need for savings. The Review continues to inform my decisions in relation to future spending.Funding for the free travel scheme was frozen by the previous Government at 2010 levels of expenditure as outlined in the National Recovery Plan 2011-2014 and the 2011 Budget. This cap was confirmed in the 2012 Budget.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1035	A bereavement grant is a payment designed to assist families in dealing with death and funeral expenses.    It is a once-off payment, based on PRSI contributions, made from the Social Insurance Fund.To qualify for a bereavement grant, the person on whose insurance record the claim is based must have 156 PRSI contributions paid.  Alternatively, if an insured person has between 26 and 155 PRSI contributions paid, they must also have 39 PRSI contributions paid or credited in the relevant tax year OR a yearly average of 39 PRSI contributions paid or credited over the 3 or 5 tax years before the relevant tax year.  The relevant tax year is the last complete tax year prior to the year in which the bereavement occurs.  Full details of the grant and how to qualify are available on the Department's website.The person on whose insurance record the claim may be based can be the deceased, or their spouse, civil partner or cohabitant.All adults are treated equally under the bereavement grant scheme and must satisfy the same PRSI conditions.Likewise, where the deceased was a qualified child, entitlement to a bereavement grant may be decided based on the insurance record of a parent/guardian.  A qualified child is where the deceased was under 18 years of age or over 18 and under 22 and in receipt of disability allowance.Means tested exceptional needs payments may be available under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to those who require financial assistance with funeral expenses. Payment is dependent on individual circumstances and is not based on contributions paid. This scheme is administered by the community welfare service.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1036	The Department is committed to delivering the best possible service to its customers.  In the interests of fairness applications are processed, as far as possible, in order of the date on which they were received.There were c 53,000 people in receipt of carer's payments as at the end of February 2012 this represents an increase of c 60% over the past five years. In addition there are, at present, circa 7,800 applications registered and awaiting a decision. I acknowledge that this is unsatisfactory but I am satisfied that the department is taking all steps available to it to resolve the issue.A major service delivery modernisation project is underway to address the large increase in the claim-load and to improve the efficiency of administration of the carer's allowance scheme. This involves the development of information technology functions and associated business process re-organisation. It is anticipated that the new system will introduce significant processing efficiencies and a quicker and more responsive service to the customer. Accordingly, the project is being given high priority and involves a significant level of time and commitment from the relevant staff in the Department.  This has had a short-term negative impact on claim processing times.  This essential focus of certain staff resources will continue until the completion of the modernisation project in June of this year when all existing carer's allowance claims will be transferred onto the new processing system.Accurate processing time figures are not yet available as applications are still being processed on both the old and the new computer systems. The average time to award an application on both systems at present is estimated at around 28 weeks.In addition to the deployment of new systems which should address service levels in the medium term the Department allocates additional resources in the form of overtime working to help reduce backlogs that have built up.  In addition, approval is being given to the assignment of temporary staff to expedite the reduction of the backlog. However, it is expect to be a significant number of months before the backlog is reduced to an acceptable level.In the meantime, if a person's means are insufficient to meet their needs while awaiting a decision on an application, they may apply for a means-tested supplementary welfare allowance payment from their local community welfare officer.I am advised by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that there are currently 1,421 carers allowance cases awaiting a decision on appeal.The current average times taken to process carers allowance appeals decided by summary decision is 31.5 weeks and 42.8 weeks for those requiring an oral hearing.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1037	I propose to take Questions Nos. 512 and 522 together.The Department is committed to providing a quality customer service to all its customers.  This includes ensuring that applications are processed and that decisions on entitlement are issued as quickly as possible having regard to the eligibility conditions which apply.  These conditions include, in the case of jobseeker's allowance, establishing the person's identity or their place of habitual residence and assessing means where appropriate.  In some cases, delays arise where the person fails to supply all pertinent information in support of their application.Since May 2008, some 952 staff have been redeployed to the Department to fill critical vacancies in local offices, Central Support Units and the Department's Inspectorate to deal with the increased volume of claims due to the downturn in the economy.  Taking into account the number of staff who have left the Department and the vacancies that exist currently, a net total of 486 additional staff have been assigned to the Department.  In addition, the Department has recruited new medical assessors and appointed additional staff to the social welfare appeals office.  The Department also makes judicious use of overtime and employs temporary staff as appropriate to address particular service issues as they arise.At the end of March, there were 20,630 jobseekers allowance claims awaiting a decision.   It is not possible to give a definite timeline as to how long it will take to process all current pending claims.   However, the average processing time for jobseeker's allowance claims decided in March was 5 weeks.I am advised by the social welfare appeals office that there are currently 2,143 jobseeker's allowance cases relating to means awaiting an appeal decision and a further 1,728 jobseeker's allowance cases awaiting an appeal decision on other issues.  This comprises 3,871 cases in total.  The current average time taken to process jobseeker's allowance appeals decided by summary decision is 18.8 weeks and 32.2 weeks for those requiring an oral hearing. The current average time taken to process jobseeker's allowance means-related appeals decided by summary decision is 14.5 weeks and 40.5 weeks for those requiring an oral hearing.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1038	At the end of March 2012 there were 7,040 Invalidity Pension (IP) claims registered and pending decision. Average time to award is currently 32 weeks, this includes the time taken to decide EU and bilateral cases which have a significantly longer processing time. It is not possible to segregate domestic claim processing times from EU/bi-lateral cases.In an effort to ensure continuity of payment priority is given to applications received from illness benefit (IB) recipients whose payment is due to expire therefore applicants who are in receipt of a continuous IB payment which will not expire provided they continue to satisfy the medical criteria will take longer to process. Since the introduction of the two year expiration of illness benefit there has been a significant increase in the number of IP claims received in this department. A high percentage of these applicants are not suitable for the invalidity pension scheme as they are not considered to be permanently incapable of work.The processing time for individual Invalidity pension claims may vary in accordance with their relative complexity in terms of the qualifying criteria. In addition, factors outside the department's control can have an impact, for example, insufficient information received from claimants at time of application and delays in claimants furnishing the information requested.This Department is continually reviewing its processes in an effort to improve processing times and customer service. Many improvements have already been introduced in IP section. Since June 2011 all IP claims are processed on a new IT platform under the department's service delivery model project. This has led to further efficiencies in processing which resulted in an increase in the number of claims processed. Most claims are now desk assessed by medical assessors to determine medical suitability. Two temporary staff have been assigned to the IP area to help to reduce the backlog and waiting time. Overtime has been made available and is utilised on a judicious basis. Despite these improvements it is expected to be a significant number of months before the backlog is reduced to an acceptable level.I am advised by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that there are currently 2,431 invalidity pension cases awaiting a decision on appeal.The current average times taken to process IP appeals decided by summary decision is 36.9 weeks and, excluding 4 very protracted cases, 36.5 weeks for those requiring an oral hearing.Customers waiting on a decision on their IP claim, who have urgent income support needs, can apply for the means tested supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) from their local Community Welfare Officer.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1039	In the period from 1 January 2012 to 31 March 2012 some 78,500 claims for illness benefit were processed. At the end of March 2012 there were 5,282 illness benefit claims awaiting decision. The average time to process a claim for illness benefit is one week.I am advised by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that there are currently 2,277 illness benefit cases awaiting a decision on appeal. The current average time taken to process illness benefit appeals decided by summary decision is 39.8 weeks and it is 51.9 weeks for those requiring an oral hearing.In relation to additional resources in the Social Welfare Appeals Office, the Department appointed 12 additional Appeals Officers during 2010 and 2011. In addition, a further 10 Appeals Officers, formerly employed by the Community Welfare Services (CWS) of the Health Services Executive joined the Office as part of the integration of the CWS appeals services into the Social Welfare Appeals Office.  This brings the total number of Appeals Officers to 39.I am assured by the Chief Appeals Officer that she is keeping the methods of operation by which the Social Welfare Appeals Office conducts its business under constant review, and that the processes are continuously being enhanced to reduce the backlogs in the Office and, overall, to reduce the processing times for dealing with appeals.

This has significantly impacted on the processing time for appeals which require oral hearings and, in order to be fair to all appellants, they are dealt with in strict chronological order.While every effort is being made to deal with the large numbers awaiting oral hearing as quickly as possible, it is not possible to give a date when the person's oral hearing will be heard, but s/he will be informed when arrangements have been made.The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions on social welfare entitlements.

Currently over 6,100 internships have commenced to date with 4,391 internships in place as at 5th April and over 1,960 opportunities are currently advertised on www.jobbridge.ie. Of the 6,149 internships which have commenced since the 1 July 2011, 2% of the internships are occupations associated with catering sector and hotels. In addition to catering assistants; accommodation assistants; chefs and event co-ordinators roles; these figures also relate to support and administrative functions within the catering sector and hotel sector, including for example clerical, marketing, quality control and human resource roles. Our records indicate that a significant proportion of individuals who have participated in JobBridge have progressed into employment on completion of their internship placements. This represents very significant progress in a short period of time.  Further information on outcomes will be ascertained as a result of the forthcoming formal evaluation of JobBridge, which is due to commence shortly.This evaluation will assess the design, delivery and impact of the JobBridge Scheme, It will provide details of the nature of the work experience of the participants; a measurement of the relevance of that experience to the labour market and progression into employment. It will also offer an assessment of the potential displacement effect of the Scheme and the satisfaction of participants and of host organisations with their experience. It will also present recommendations on how the Scheme might be improved.It should also assist the Department in making further policy decisions on the benefit of work placement programmes in the overall context of the Government's activation policy, which is to engage with every unemployed individual to provide them with a pathway to employment and to prevent and reduce long term unemployment.An intern may contact the JobBridge Team at any stage of their internship whether for advice or as part of the "whistle blowing" feature.  Consequently any individual who suspects that an internship may be in breach of the scheme's criteria, including cases of suspected displacement or poor quality, may contact the JobBridge Team.  All such claims are fully investigated.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1045	I understand that the person in question has been in touch with my Department on a number of occasions and that a reply has  issued to her on the queries raised by her which are similar to those raised here in this question.I want to take this opportunity to again re-iterate the reasons for the upcoming changes to rate bands for State pension contributory. A core principle of sustainable social protection systems in advanced economies is that citizens receive benefits in proportion to their contributions.Recognising that the State pension contributory is a very valuable benefit, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives thereby ensuring equity in the social welfare system. This has always been part of our pensions system and changes to State pension contributory provision which were announced in Budget 2012  put an increased emphasis on this.  Recipients of the State pension contributory who have contributed more will receive a more generous pension.   For example, currently a person with an average of between 20 and 47 PRSI contributions per year over their working life receives a weekly State pension contributory of only €4.50 less than a person with a yearly average of 48 or more PRSI contributions. This is neither fair nor equitable.To address this anomaly, a change to the rate bands is essential, which is one of the reform measures announced in Budget 2012. The rate of State pension contributory paid to new applicants will be proportionate to the rate band appropriate to the average number of contributions paid.  Those who have fewer contributions will receive a lower rate of pension.Furthermore, the principle that the amount of pension paid should reflect the PRSI contributions paid over a working life needs to be adhered to if we are to be able to fund pensions into the future.  By aligning the rate of pension paid with the number of contributions paid ensures that those who contribute more during a working life benefit more in retirement than those with lesser contributions. This is fair and equitable and puts us on a more financially sustainable track.With effect from September 2012, the rate band of between 20 and 47 (24 and 47 for State pension transition) yearly average contributions will be replaced with new rate bands of between:—(i) 40 and 47 yearly average contributions(ii)  30 and 39 yearly average contribution and(iii)   20 and 29 yearly average contributions.Therefore, the rate of State pension transition or State pension contributory paid to new applicants will be appropriate to the average number of contributions paid over a working life.  Those who have fewer contributions will receive a lower rate of pension.  The maximum rate is unchanged as is the rate for those with yearly average contributions of between 40 and 47.  While existing pension recipients are unaffected, the changes proposed will apply to new claimants from September 2012.The measures outlined support the social contract between the State and the individual whereby those who pay most in a working life benefit most in retirement.For those who take time out of the workforce for child rearing or caring, the Homemakers Scheme may be available to them. For those who are eligible for the Homemakers Scheme, a higher rate of pension will be payable. Furthermore, the Increase for Qualified Adult (IQA) or the  means-tested State pension non-contributory may be available to people who have an income need.For rate bands changes, see chart.New State pension transition RatesYearly Average ContributionsPersonal Rate Per Week €48 or over230.3040-47225.8030-39207.0024-29196.00Yearly Average ContributionsPersonal Rate Per Week €48 or over230.3040-47225.8030-39207.0020-29196.0015-19150.0010-1492.00

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1048	I propose to take Questions Nos. 524 and 525 together.The purpose of rent supplement is to provide short-term income support to eligible tenants living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source. The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer.The current maximum rent limits were set after an analysis of the most up to date market data available but did not include consultation with landlords. The emphasis of the rent limit review was to ensure that maximum value for money for tenants and the taxpayer was achieved whilst at the same time ensuring that people on rent supplement are not priced out of the market for good quality private rented accommodation.As the Department currently funds approximately 40% of the private rented sector it is essential that State support for rents are kept under review, reflect current market conditions and do not distort the market in way that could increase rent prices for others such as low paid workers and students.The next national review of maximum rent limits is due to be completed before June 2013. The Department will continue to monitor rent levels throughout the country but at this point I have no plans to revise any of the existing rent limits.Rent supplement is calculated to ensure that the person, after payment of rent, has an income equal to the basic supplementary welfare allowance rate, less a specified weekly minimum contribution which recipients are required to pay from their own resources. The type of shortfall payments to which the Deputy refers are known as "top up" payments and fall into two specific categories.Where a person has an additional income above the rate of supplementary welfare allowance they are, in certain circumstances, allowed to top up their rent as they will still have sufficient income to meet their basic needs after paying their rent.  The second type of top up payment can occur where the application to the Department declares a rent lower than that actually being charged by the landlord. Any instance of false declarations should be reported to the relevant Departmental representative who has specific legislative powers to deal with such matters.

The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer. There are approximately 95,000 rent supplement recipients with a forecast outturn of €437 million provided for 2012. Approximately 54,000 of these are now in receipt of rent supplement for more than eighteen months.The Department currently funds approximately 40% of the private rented sector so it is essential that State support for rents are kept under review, reflect current market conditions and do not distort the market in a way that could increase rent prices for others, such as low paid workers and students.The new maximum rent limits came into force on 1 January 2012. These new limits are in line with the most up to date market data available. The emphasis of the rent limit review was to ensure that maximum value for money for tenants and the taxpayer was achieved whilst at the same time ensuring that people on rent supplement are not priced out of the market for private rented accommodation.All new Rent Supplement applications are subject to these limits. As existing claims come up for review, most claims are reviewed every six months, or when an existing lease expires, individuals will be reassessed using the new limits.In all cases under review whereby the rent is above the new maximum limit the individual concerned is being asked to contact the landlord to renegotiate the rent.  Where a landlord does not agree to reduce the rent to the new rates, Departmental officials will discuss the options open to the tenant up to and including seeking alternative accommodation having regard to any existing lease arrangements. There will be no case of homelessness from this measure and Department officials are dealing with each case based on the individual circumstances of the rent supplement tenancy.

An overpayment is any social welfare assistance or benefit payment which the person who received the amount was not entitled to receive.  In accordance with the legislation, where an overpayment has been assessed against a person, that person is:—informed of the factors which gave rise to the overpayment;informed of the amount of overpayment;informed of the proposed method of recovery; andbefore any decision is made regarding the recovery of the overpayment, s/he is afforded an opportunity to bring to the notice of the Department  any view s/he may wish  to offer on the assessment of the overpayment or the proposed method of recovery and any facts or circumstances which s/he may consider relevant to the recovery of the overpayment.In 2010, total overpayments amounted to €83.4m.  Each decision, resulting in an overpayment, is classified as suspected fraud or error. Overpayments arising from activity suspected as fraudulent amounted to €25.9m in 2010.  Every claimant is given a period following a decision to lodge an appeal on any aspect of the decision, including the classification of the overpayment as suspected fraudulent.Customers typically incur suspected fraudulent overpayments in situations such as:claiming unemployment or disability payments when they are in fact working;failing to disclose their full means or increases in their means;failing to disclose the true employment or residential status of their spouse, partner or dependants; and/orbeing themselves absent from the State or their dependants being absent.There is no further breakdown of the €25.9m between fraud and suspected fraud.

In exceptional circumstances, a percentage of participants may be retained for an additional subsequent year, subject to budget limits and personal training needs. Persons in receipt of a qualifying payment for 3 years or more (on entry to CE) may be eligible for up to 3 years on CE (en bloc), subject to annual renewal, based on job-readiness assessment and personal training requirements.

This initiative is being delivered through the network of local development companies and Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Of the 5,000 placements initially planned for Tús, Clare Local Development Company Limited was allocated a total of 100 placements and 5 supervisor positions in the initial round of allocations.  In early March 2012 the Department reallocated 440 participant placements and 22 supervisory positions to those companies that had reached full implementation and where there was a demand from community and voluntary sector organisations for work to be undertaken.  Clare Local Development Company Limited was successful in this round and was allocated an extra 20 participant placements and 1 supervisory position.The purpose of Tús is the provision of quality work for those who are unemployed in order to break the cycle of unemployment and to improve a person's opportunities in returning to the labour market.  I consider the existing 12-month period on Tús to be adequate to meet the objectives of the initiative whilst also ensuring that as many unemployed people as possible are able to benefit.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1067	A core principle of sustainable social protection systems in advanced economies is that citizens receive benefits in proportion to their contributions.Recognising that the State pension contributory is a very valuable benefit, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives thereby ensuring equity in the social welfare system. This has always been part of our pensions system and changes to State pension provision which were announced in Budget 2012  put an increased emphasis on this and protects the future sustainability of our pension system. Recipients of the State pension contributory who have contributed more will receive a more generous pension.   For example, currently a person with an average of between 20 and 47 PRSI contributions per year over their working life receives a weekly State pension of only €4.50 less than a person with a yearly average of 48 or more PRSI contributions. This is neither fair nor equitable. To address this, a change to the rate bands is one of the reform measures announced in Budget 2012. The rate of State pension contributory paid to new applicants will be proportionate to the rate band appropriate to the average number of contributions paid.  Those who have fewer contributions will receive a lower rate of pension.With effect from September 2012, the rate band of between 20 and 47 (24 and 47 for State pension transition) yearly average contributions will be replaced with  new rate bands of between:—(i) 40 and 47 yearly average contributions(ii)  30 and 39 yearly average contribution and(iii)   20 and 29 yearly average contributions.Therefore, the rate of State pension transition or State pension contributory paid to new applicants will be appropriate to the average number of contributions paid over a working life.  Those who have fewer contributions will receive a lower rate of pension.  The maximum rate is unchanged as is the rate for those with yearly average contributions of between 40 and 47.  While existing pension recipients are unaffected, the changes proposed will apply to new claimants from September 2012.The measures outlined support the social contract between the State and the individual whereby those who pay most in a working life benefit most in retirement.For those who take time out of the workforce for child rearing or caring, the Homemakers Scheme may be available to them. For those who are eligible for the Homemakers Scheme, a higher rate of pension will be payable. Furthermore, the Increase for Qualified Adult or the  means-tested State pension non-contributory may be available to people who have an income need. In relation to the person concerned, I understand  no communication has been received in my Department in relation to her pension provision. Should the person concerned wish to check her contribution record , a copy of this record can be obtained from  the Central Records Section of my Department or a copy can be requested via my Department's website, www.welfare.ie   under the topic PRSI.For rate bands changes, see chart.New State pension transition ratesYearly Average ContributionsPersonal Rate Per Week €48 or over230.3040-47225.8030-39207.0024-29196.00Yearly Average ContributionsPersonal Rate Per Week €48 or over230.3040-47225.8030-39207.0020-29196.0015-19150.0010-1492.00

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1071	I propose to take Questions Nos. 550 and 551 together.The purpose of the Insolvency Payments Scheme is to protect pay-related entitlements of employees whose employer has become legally insolvent as defined under the Insolvency Payments Acts, 1984 to 2004.  Under the scheme, employees may claim, normally through a liquidator or receiver, arrears of pay, holiday pay, pay in lieu of notice and various other entitlements that may be owed to them by their employer.  All payments are made from the Social Insurance Fund.There are two processing streams for insolvency claims.  A new online system was introduced in October 2011.  The Department is currently processing online claims submitted correctly through this system, received in January 2012.  Manual claims, submitted since October 2011, are also processed as part of this stream but take longer to process due to the need to enter the manual claims onto the new system.  The Department is currently processing claims in this category which were received in July 2011.The most common type of claim received under the Insolvency Scheme is for arrears of wages and/or arrears of holiday pay and /or minimum notice.  Currently, there are 4,654 claims of this nature on hand.In addition, there are approximately 11,000 pension related claims awaiting processing. Pension claims for employees that are nearing pension age are processed, so that their entitlements on retirement are fully met.  However, in processing terms, priority is given to non-pension claims, as these claims provide an immediate relief for employees.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1072	The purpose of rent supplement is to provide short term income support to assist with reasonable accommodation costs of eligible people living in private rented accommodation who are unable to provide for their accommodation costs from their own resources and who do not have accommodation available to them from another source.  Rent supplement is not payable in respect of the family home.Under the rules governing entitlement to rent supplement, the Department must establish that the applicant is a bona fide tenant. In determining whether the applicant is a bona fide tenant the Department will generally require documentary evidence including:details of the lease agreement,proof of ownership of the property,documentation that the tenancy has been registered with the PRTB, where necessary.In addition, there a number of other qualifying conditions for the scheme including at the time of the application, the claimant must:have been residing in private rented accommodation (where at the commencement of the tenancy the person could have reasonably afforded the rent and has experienced a substantial change in his or her circumstances where they are now unable to pay the rent) or accommodation for homeless persons or in an institution (or any combination of these) for a period of 183 days within the preceding 12 months of the date of claim for rent supplement,orhave had an assessment of housing need carried out within the 12 months preceding the date of claim and have been deemed by the relevant local authority to be eligible for and in need of social housing support.Overall, I am satisfied that the conditions of the scheme are sufficient to ensure that only those who are in need of rent supplement can access the scheme.

This care and attention must be given by another person, effectively full-time, so that the child can deal with the activities of daily living.  The child must be likely to require this level of care and attention for at least 12 months.An application for DCA was received on 18th May 2011.  This application was referred to one of the Department's Medical Assessors who found that the child was not medically eligible for the payment.  A letter issued on 16th July 2011 refusing the allowance.  The person concerned subsequently lodged an appeal against this decision and this appeal is currently with the Social Welfare Appeals Office for their consideration.The provision of the relevant tests and therapies is a matter for the HSE.

The father has been granted guardianship by the Court.  However, the Court does not indicate that the State must provide additional accommodation when the children are already being housed. The person concerned has no entitlement to a higher limit as his children are already accommodated in the family home with their mother. The client has been informed of his right to appeal this decision.

In the interests of fairness and equity applications are processed, as far as possible, in order of the date on which they were received in the Department.A major service delivery modernisation project is underway to address the large increase in the claim-load and to improve the efficiency of administration of the carer's allowance scheme. This involves the development of information technology functions and associated business process re-organisation. It is anticipated that the new system will introduce significant processing efficiencies and a quicker and more responsive service to the customer. Accordingly, the project is being given high priority and involves a significant level of time and commitment from the relevant staff in the Department.  This has had a short-term negative impact on claim processing times.  This essential focus of certain staff resources will continue until the completion of the modernisation project in June of this year when all existing carer's allowance claims will be transferred onto the new processing system.Accurate processing time figures are not available at present as applications are still being processed on both the old and the new computer systems. The average time to award an application at present is estimated at around 28 weeks. There are currently approximately 7,800 new applications registered and awaiting a decision and approximately 330 new applications are received each week.  I acknowledge that this is unsatisfactory but I am satisfied that the Department is taking all steps available to it to resolve the issue.In addition to the deployment of new systems which should address service levels in the medium term, the Department is allocating additional resources in the form of overtime working to help reduce backlogs that have built up.  In addition, approval has recently been  given for the assignment of temporary staff to expedite the reduction of the backlogs. However, it is expected to be a significant number of months before the backlog is reduced to an acceptable level.In the meantime, if a person's means are insufficient to meet their needs while awaiting a decision on an application, they may apply for a means-tested supplementary welfare allowance payment from their local community welfare officer.

Apart from the excluded categories, anyone in the State who satisfies a habitual residence condition and a means test, has registered for employment, unless they have a physical or mental disability, and can prove unemployment, or anyone who is awaiting the outcome of a claim or an appeal for a primary social welfare or HSE payment, may qualify for SWA.   A number of client categories are specifically excluded in legislation from receiving assistance under the SWA scheme.  These include people in full-time work and people in full-time education. However, under Section (190), subsection (3) of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act, 2005, an individual in full-time education may, in exceptional circumstances,  receive SWA.  Any person enquiring about their entitlement to a payment under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme should contact the Department in order that their entitlements can be investigated.

These ENP payments are a vital component of the SWA scheme and link the income support function of the scheme with the wider welfare role of the Department's community welfare service.There is no automatic entitlement to a payment, ENP's are payable at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case.A review of the guidelines on ENPs has recently been carried out by the Department by a working group made up of former community welfare service staff.  One of the recommendations from the Group was to address the different approaches taken, in different areas, in relation to the payment of exceptional needs payments in respect of religious ceremonies and to ensure that the SWA scheme is responding to a specific financial need and not to the occasion.At present, where the Department is satisfied that an exceptional need exists, it is now recommended that a maximum payment of €110 can be made in respect of the religious ceremony. This will be the first step towards limiting these payments to cases of significant hardship only, in 2013.

While significant progress has been made to date in establishing the new service, because of the scale of transformation required, full implementation will involve a multi-annual programme of change. The development of the new service is being brought about with minimal disruption to the on-going work of the Department. It will not be a stand-alone service but will be an integrated, albeit innovative, element of the Department's service provision for those of working age.  The new one-stop shop service will be trialled in four offices; Parnell Street/Kings Inn and Tallaght offices in Dublin and also in offices in Arklow and  Sligo from June of this year.  The first step in establishing the National Employment and Entitlements Service was the transfer of staff and services from FÁS and the Community Welfare Service to this Department.   This was completed on schedule on the 1st of January this year.Because the new service is an integrated service within the Department, there is no separate staff allocation envisaged for the service. The new service will be provided by the staff currently working within the Department, which is now approximately 6,500 including c1,700 staff who recently transferred.  There is however, a need to build capacity in delivering the case manager role and training will be required for staff in developing these competencies. Already  about 400 of the staff who transferred  are involved in activation/case management, most of whom have received professional training in employment guidance.  Many of the 1,000 staff in the Community Welfare Service also have some experience of working as case managers. In addition there are c 300 staff employed by the Local Employment Services Network funded by this Department.In releasing more staff to work in the new service the Department expects to realise efficiency gains from the continued upgrading and development of IT support systems and the automation of routine resource intensive operations. This will release staff currently involved in manual routine work to populate the case management service. The NEES project plan also allows for the outsourcing of some of the case management and activation services to complement the Department's own resources in referral and job placement.

There is no Minister of State attached to my Department.TitleNameAnnual SalaryPress AdvisorKathleen  Barrington€86,806Special AdvisorEdward Brophy€127,796Kathleen Barrington commenced duty on 18 July 2011, and was initially on a salary of   €80,051 i.e. the first point of the Principal Officer pay scale. However, on the basis of her experience and qualifications, I sought sanction from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform on 19 October 2011 to place her on a salary on par with her previous remuneration and received sanction to place her on the 3rd   point of the scale i.e. €86,604 per annum effective from the 18 July 2011.The applicable pay scale grade for Special Advisers is the Principal Officer (standard) scale: €80,051 to €92,672.  As Edward Brophy was previously employed in the private sector on a salary package that was more than twice the highest point of the Principal Officer (standard) scale, I sought sanction from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform for remuneration in excess of the applicable pay scale grade. A single point salary of €127,796 was sanctioned by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform effective from 29 July 2011.  This represents a reduction of over one third in my Special Adviser's previous salary in the private sector.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1112	In relation to the sentiments outlined in the correspondence from Mr. Myles O'Brien I would like to acknowledge that Community Employment (CE) schemes provide a very important and valued contribution to social employment, training and progression for unemployed people. Furthermore, many Community Employment schemes provide vital community services right across the country.CE schemes play an important role in our communities, in particular by providing services which have an intrinsic social value like helping the disabled to live independently or delivering meals on wheels to our older citizens.  This point sometimes gets lost in a purely economic analysis of CE schemes, which views them as not delivering sufficient progression into the labour market.The Department will ensure that the contribution of such schemes is recognised in any future decisions on the future operation, funding and role of community employment.A financial review of Community Employment (CE) Schemes is underway. This review of CE Schemes has proved to be a valuable exercise for both the schemes themselves and for my Department.Given the volume and breath of the data being returned, the financial review of CE schemes will take longer than originally envisaged to complete.  This will allow more time for schemes to engage with local officials in the finalisation of their respective budgets and for my Department to bring forward improvements to the overall operation of Community Employment which will improve the budgetary situation for schemes. No final allocations of materials and training grants have been made pending completion of the review.However due to the current economic circumstances, this Department has had to find significant savings in the Budget for 2012. The reduction only applies to the grant for materials and training and represents a reduction of 7.5% of the overall expenditure on Community Employment in 2011. The allowance grants for Supervisors are unchanged, as are the working hours for staff employed under Community Employment. There will be no decrease in the number of Community Employment places allocated in 2012.The existing commitment in relation to the financial support of schemes will continue to apply.The outcome of these reviews will inform the overall approach to be taken by the Department of Social Protection in relation to how to secure the best outcomes for the schemes and for their participants taking account both of the large amount of money we spend on CE schemes and the valuable contribution that many of them make to their communities.The Government has been clear that in the event that the changes in the training and material grant announced in the Budget create financial difficulties for schemes, the Department of Social Protection will continue to provide funding for those schemes and funding has been made available in this context.Where a scheme demonstrates a clear need, up to €1,000 may be available to that scheme in respect of the training and materials grant for this year.There are currently 1,143 CE schemes in operation nationally with 23,300 participants. The overall estimated budget stands at €315,194 million for 2012.The review will also seek to establish if income is generated by scheme activity and the potential for utilisation of these funds to cover project costs.Community Employment participants can continue to avail of education and training programmes that are available to them free of charge from existing State funded providers. This facility will also form part of the arrangements that will be developed as part of the establishment of SOLAS.

This application was referred to one of the Department's Medical Assessors who found that the child was not medically eligible for the allowance.  A letter issued on 7  February 2012 advising the person concerned of the decision.  She subsequently lodged an appeal against this decision and supplied additional information on her child's condition.  As part of the appeal process her application, along with the extra information she provided, was reviewed by a second Medical Assessor and the child has been deemed to be medically eligible for the allowance.  The person concerned was notified of the decision on 26 March 2012.It can currently take up to 8 weeks to process an application for domiciliary care allowance.  The current average times to process domiciliary care allowance appeals decided by summary decision is 27.6 weeks and 38.2 weeks for those requiring an oral appeal hearing.

Apart from the excluded categories, anyone in the State who satisfies a habitual residence condition and a means test, has registered for employment, unless they have a physical or mental disability, and can prove unemployment, or anyone who is awaiting the outcome of a claim or an appeal for a primary social welfare or HSE payment, may qualify for SWA.In calculating a person's entitlement for a payment under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, all income in cash is generally assessable including any income by way of child or working tax credits.Full details relating to how means are assessed for SWA payments and items that are disregarded are available on the Department's website.

The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer.In the case of private rented accommodation, tenancy arrangements involve a contract between the landlord and tenant and tenant behaviour is a matter for the landlord in the first instance. There are a number of avenues open to landlords in such cases, including: the dispute resolution services for landlords and tenants operated by the Private Residential Tenancies Board; recourse to the Garda Síochána; or the Courts in relation to the enforcement in dealing with anti-social or criminal behaviour. If necessary, the landlord may seek termination of the tenancy which, if effected, would result in the termination of rent supplement.Social welfare legislation already provides the Department with the authority to refuse, suspend or terminate payment of a rent supplement in the case of a person who has been required to deliver up possession of a dwelling provided by a housing authority or an approved body. This can be due to anti-social behaviour of the tenant or the interests of good estate management.The Department does not disclose personal information in  relation to an individual's entitlement or identity.

It provides internship opportunities of either 6 or 9 months for unemployed individuals on the Live Register, at all skills levels. The aim of JobBridge is to assist individuals in breaking the cycle where they are unable to get a job without experience.  It provides them with an opportunity to gain valuable experience, relevant knowledge and skills within a working environment.  The Scheme is open to organisations in the private, public and community or voluntary sectors.The Scheme is open to those on the Live Register and in receipt of JobSeeker payments or signing for credits for 78 days in the past 6 months.  The current Scheme allocation provides for up to 5,000 internship places at any point in time.  There are currently some 4,400 jobseekers undertaking internship placements.  This provides a balance of approximately six hundred internship places presently available.   This figure continues to change on a weekly basis as JobSeekers commence and complete internship placements.With respect to Tús — the community work placement initiative, this is designed to provide 5,000 placements at any one time with community, voluntary and not-for-profit organisations where quality work placements can be provided.  Participation is by random selection by the Department of Social Protection and there is no option for self-selection by way of application.  The Deputy will appreciate that Tús is unsuitable in the circumstances outlined.In relation to the more specific query regarding the participation of Local Voluntary/Sporting Organisations, it is important to note that the GAA have advertised over 150 internship positions to-date across a wide range of geographic areas including a number of coaching and games development roles. The FAI have also advertised a number of internship positions.  In addition to this, there has been strong engagement from other local voluntary/sporting organisations with JobBridge, the National Internship Scheme.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1124	I propose to take Questions Nos. 608, 681 and 683, inclusive together.The core issue relating to this question is the position of the self-employed.Self-employed persons are liable for PRSI at the Class S rate of 4% which entitles them to access long-term benefits such as State pension (contributory) and widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner's pension (contributory).   Ordinary employees who have access to the full range of social insurance benefits pay Class A PRSI at the rate of 4%.  In addition, their employers make a PRSI contribution of 10.75% in respect of their employees, resulting in the payment of a combined 14.75% rate per employee under full-rate PRSI Class A.  (For employees earning less than €356 per week, the rate of employer's PRSI is 4.25%).Any changes to the PRSI system to extend the full range of social insurance benefits, including jobseeker's benefit or social insurance illness benefits, would have significant financial implications and would have to be considered in the context of a much more significant rise in the rate of contribution payable.   I established the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare last year to meet the commitment made in the Programme for Government.   The Advisory Group will, inter alia, examine and report on issues involved in providing social insurance cover for self-employed persons in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable.   In addition, the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund, which is due to be completed in mid-2012, will examine this matter.Self-employed workers may establish eligibility to assistance-based payments such as jobseeker's allowance and disability allowance.  In the case of jobseeker's allowance they can apply for the means-tested jobseeker's allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  In general, their means will take account of the level of earnings in the last twelve months in determining their expected income for the following year and, in the current climate, account is taken of the downward trend in the economy.  As in the case of a non-self-employed claimant for jobseeker's allowance or disability allowance, the means of husband/wife, civil partner or co-habitant will be taken into account in deciding on entitlement to a payment.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1142	The State pension (transition) was introduced in 1970 when it was known as the retirement pension. It was designed to bridge the gap between the standard social welfare pension age, which at that time was 70 years of age, and retirement age of 65.  Over time, the social welfare pension age was reduced over a period of years until it reached 66 years of age, which means that State pension (transition) is now only payable for one year. This will change in 2014 when State pension age will be standardised to age 66 for all.There is currently no entitlement to the transition pension for the self — employed and I have no plans to change the qualifying conditions for State pension (transition) in the forthcoming Bill. Class S contributions which are paid by the self-employed,  will continue to provide cover for long-term benefits such as State pension (contributory) and widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner's pension (contributory) only.In terms of value for contributions paid, the 2005 Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund found that the Fund favours the self-employed over the employed when both employer and employee contributions are included in respect of the employed person.  The analysis demonstrates that, despite the fact that they are eligible for a narrower range of benefits, self-employed persons can still gain substantially more from the Fund than employees

Its aim is to assist in breaking the cycle where jobseekers are unable to get a job without experience and provide the opportunity to gain valuable experience, relevant knowledge and skills in a working environment.  The Scheme has made significant progress to-date.  Currently, over 6,200 internship placements have commenced to-date. In addition, there are 2,000 posts currently advertised on the JobBridge website.  Our records indicate that a significant proportion of individuals have progressed into employment on completion of their internship placements.  The JobBridge scheme is open to all individuals irrespective of their skill levels. Low skilled individuals have a right to access an activation measure that is specifically designed to improve their skills, enhance their experience and improve their chances of securing employment in the future.  There are internship opportunities currently available for individuals who may be low skilled. However, these are only approved if they can show that the intern will receive a broad and practical work experience that will involve significant learning outcomes for the intern.A variety of measures have been introduced to protect the intern and to ensure the integrity of the JobBridge Scheme.  In order for an application from a Host Organisation to be approved the host organisation must meet a number of criteria. These criteria are to ensure that the internship does not displace an existing position; that it provides appropriate training and development experience; and that appropriate mentoring and support is provided to the Intern.  Additionally in order for an internship to commence a Standard Agreement must be signed and agreed to by both the Intern and the Host Organisation.  This Agreement clearly states the terms of the internship; including the expected working hours, which can range from 30-40 hours (maximum) per week and the specific learning outcomes the intern will gain over the course of their internship.To ensure that both the host organisation and intern are abiding by the spirit and the rules of the scheme, the Department of Social Protection is involved in the continuous monitoring of internships.  This involves the regular review of monthly compliance reports and the conducting of random monitoring site visits to facilitate discussions with both parties to the Internship.It is worth noting that participation in the Scheme is voluntary and an intern may contact the JobBridge Team at any stage of their Internship for advice and support.  Consequently any individual, who suspects that an internship may be in breach of the scheme's criteria, including cases of suspected displacement and quality, may contact the JobBridge team.  All such matters are fully investigated.My Department continues to monitor and review the operation of the JobBridge scheme on an ongoing basis.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1148	I propose to take Questions Nos. 636 and 640 together.The Deputy has clarified that this PQ is regarding two specific issues relating to the timelag between making a claim and receiving a decision.  In particular, (1) delays when a person is claiming invalidity pension (IP) having previously been in receipt of illness benefit (IB) and (2) delays in processing family income supplement (FIS) payments where a person or their spouse is awaiting a decision on another social welfare application.Since January 2009 payment of IB is limited to a maximum of 104 weeks (624 pay days) in most cases. There are a number of possible social welfare payments for which a customer may qualify thereafter, depending on their circumstances. Letters are sent to IB customers 13 weeks before their claim is due to expire. The customer is advised about other possible schemes for which they may qualify, including invalidity pension, disability allowance, jobseeker's benefit, jobseeker's allowance and supplementary welfare allowance. Customers are also advised that if they are considering applying for any of the schemes they should do so as soon as possible.Invalidity Pension is a payment for people who are permanently incapable of work because of illness or incapacity and who satisfy the PRSI conditions. In an effort to ensure continuity of payment priority is given to applications received from IB recipients whose payment is due to expire. Since the introduction of the two year expiration of IB there has been a significant increase in the number of IP claims received in this department. A high percentage of these applicants are not suitable for IP as they are not medically assessed as being permanently incapable of work.The processing time for individual Invalidity pension claims may vary in accordance with their relative complexity in terms of the qualifying criteria.Payment of FIS is based, inter alia, on a fixed proportion of the gap between the assessable income (net of income taxes, PRSI, Pension contribution and USC) of the household and prescribed FIS income thresholds.In assessing weekly family income for the purposes of FIS most weekly social welfare payments are also taken into account when means are assessed. Accordingly in order for a FIS means assessment to be completed the value of other assessable social welfare payments being made to a household must be available.Consequently there can be a delay in completing the FIS means assessment in a small number of cases where a final outcome is awaited on the value of another social welfare payment due to a household.There are approximately 69 FIS claims currently awaiting finalisation of a means test pending a decision on another social welfare application by a household. These cases are being kept under review to ensure that the final FIS means assessment is completed as quickly as possible.This Department is continually reviewing its processes in an effort to improve processing times and subsequently customer service. Customers waiting on a decision on a social welfare claim, who have urgent income support needs, can apply for the means tested supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) from their local Community Welfare Officer.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1149	The National Internship Scheme is currently limited to individuals who are currently on the Live Register and have been in receipt of Jobseekers Allowance/Benefit or are signing on for credits for at least 3 of the last 6 months.Given the scale of the unemployment crisis, it is important that as employment opportunities become available they are taken up by those on the Live Register. The key objective of labour market policy is to keep those on the Live Register close to the Labour Market and prevent the drift into long-term unemployment. This will ensure that Live Register members availing of activation measures such as the National Internship Scheme will, while retaining social welfare unemployment payments and a top up allowance of €50, get an opportunity to engage in the workplace, get work experience and so be in a position to avail of employment opportunities as the economy improves.For these reasons, it has been proposed as a matter of public policy that eligibility for the scheme be confined to those on the Live Register and in receipt of unemployment payments or signing for credits for 3 of the last 6 months.  As such, the policy objective is to prioritise scarce resources on those on the Live Register so as to increase their chances of leaving it thereby ensuring a reduction in Exchequer costs over time.Individuals who are in receipt of a disability allowance however can access the Work Placement Programme, which provides participants with a work experience placement of between two and nine months. During this time participants may be able to retain their social welfare entitlements.In addition, people in receipt of a disability allowance can access a range of other specific programmes, such as the Supported Employment Programme and the Wage Subsidy Scheme. Both of these programmes aim to assist people with a disability to secure and maintain a job in the labour market.My Department continues to monitor and review the operation of the JobBridge scheme including its eligibility criteria on an ongoing basis.  The extension of JobBridge to those in receipt of Disability Allowances forms part of this broader review process.

This includes ensuring that applications are processed and that decisions on entitlement are made as quickly as possible.The number of families waiting in excess of one month, three months, six months and twelve months for FIS applications to be processed at the end of February is given in the following table:Time pendingRenewalsNewTotal< 1 Month2,3561,5743,930> 1 Month2,4472,1304,577> 3 Months2142,5712,785> 6 Months14261275> 12 Months78087Total5,0386,61611,654The volume of FIS claims on hands and the delays in processing are a consequence of continued strong claim intake.The Department has introduced a number of measures to address the efficiency of claim processing for FIS in light of the current waiting times:Existing processes and procedures are reviewed on an ongoing basis with the explicit objective of reducing delays in claim processing;Priority is being given to claims where a claim is being renewed to ensure continuity of payment;The ongoing staffing requirement is being kept under review in light of the increased volumes of claims;Additional temporary staff have been recruited to help reduce the backlog;Overtime working is being judiciously applied;These measures will, over time, lead to more efficient processing and reduce the number of claims on hand.  The position is being closely monitored and kept under review by the Department.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1151	I propose to take Questions Nos. 639 and 641 together.Family Income Supplement (FIS) is designed to provide support for people with families who are on low earnings.  This preserves the incentive for them to remain in employment in circumstances where they might only be marginally better off than if they were claiming other social welfare payments.  The payment amount is based on a fixed proportion of the gap between the assessable income (net of income taxes, PRSI, Pension contribution and USC) of the household and prescribed FIS income thresholds.   Currently this fixed proportion is 60 per cent of the difference between the weekly income and the income threshold for the family size.In assessing weekly family income for the purposes of FIS, most weekly social welfare payments are assessable as income.   Accordingly, in order for a FIS means assessment to be completed, the value of other assessable weekly social welfare payments being made to a household must be available.Consequently there can be a delay in completing the FIS means assessment in a small number of cases where a final outcome is awaited on the value of another social welfare payment due to a household.There are approximately 69 FIS claims currently awaiting a decision which are awaiting finalisation of a decision on another relevant social welfare application.  These cases are kept under review to ensure to ensure that the final FIS means assessment is completed as quickly as possible.

In this case, the appeal of the person concerned in regard to the requirement for, and the provision of, full-time care and attention, for the purpose of entitlement to carer's allowance in respect of her mother, was allowed with effect from the date of the oral appeal hearing in this case, i.e. 27th October 2011.  In arriving at this decision, the Appeals Officer has taken regard of all the available medical and other evidence, including that arising from the visit of a Social Welfare Inspector to the home of the care recipient on 9th May 2011.  During this visit it was confirmed that the care recipient remained capable of driving her own car at that time.An Appeals Officers decision may be revised in light of new evidence or new facts in a particular case.  Having reviewed all further correspondence and contentions received in this case, the Appeals Officer concludes, however, that a revision of his original decision to allow the appeal with effect from the date of the oral hearing is not warranted.The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions on social welfare entitlements.

Humanitarian Aid payments were made, both in the immediate aftermath of the flooding and subsequently to enable eligible households to resume living at their home. Flood relief works were also undertaken in some of the affected areas and other works are at an advanced state of preparation. Discussions also took place with representatives of the insurance industry regarding giving households access to appropriate house insurance at a reasonable cost.Subject to certain conditions the Government also decided to offer support to a small number of families who are continuing to experience significant housing problems as a result of the November 2009 flooding and are considering relocating rather than permanently returning to their original home.   A letter inviting the household to formally apply for assistance toward relocation issued in November 2011.A number of the families, who received these letters, requested a meeting with Departmental officials to discuss their particular case. These meetings took place in March and April this year.The information necessary to make a decision on the amount payable in all cases is being finalised at present and this amount will be communicated to the affected households in the coming weeks. Additionally, Department officials are currently in consultation with the Chief State Solicitors Office to finalise legal agreements which will need to be signed by all parties to the agreement. Payment will issue to families in accordance with these legal agreements.The basis of the financial assistance to be provided is as follows:(a)  The gross cost of relocation will not exceed an estimate (provided by the local authority) of the cost of providing a reasonable home in the area in question.  This has been estimated by the local authorities at €130,000 in respect of a three bed house and €145,000 in respect of a four bed house.(b)  In addition a maximum amount of €55,000 is to be allowed in situations where affected householders do not have access to a site for the rebuilding of a house.(c) An additional maximum amount of either €25,000 or €30,000 (depending on whether three or four bed house is involved) is to be allowed for costs associated with the demolition of the unsustainable house and in connection with other costs such as design costs, legal costs, engineering and planning costs and site costs.

This review of CE Schemes has proved to be a valuable exercise for both the schemes themselves and for my Department.Given the volume and breath of the data being returned, the financial review of CE schemes will take longer than originally envisaged to complete.  This will allow more time for schemes to engage with local officials in the finalisation of their respective budgets and for my Department to bring forward improvements to the overall operation of Community Employment which will improve the budgetary situation for schemes. No final allocations of materials and training grants have been made pending completion of the review.However due to the current economic circumstances, this Department has had to find significant savings in the Budget for 2012. The reduction only applies to the grant for materials and training and represents a reduction of 7.5% of the overall expenditure on Community Employment in 2011. The allowance grants for Supervisors are unchanged, as are the working hours for staff employed under Community Employment. There will be no decrease in the number of Community Employment places allocated in 2012.The existing commitment in relation to the financial support of schemes will continue to apply.

It is anticipated that CE projects will see a reduction in the level of grant aid allocated in respect of materials and training in 2012 as funding will be allocated according to the needs of the participants and the project circumstances. The purpose of the review is to establish the level of need and this review should be completed in the near future.In addition, the Department of Social Protection is undertaking a separate review of the effectiveness of a range of employment supports including Community Employment Schemes.  This review process includes the Community Employment Schemes that support critical addiction prevention.  The outcome of these reviews will inform the overall approach to be taken by the Department and ultimately determine future policy.This review will provide a clear picture of the core funding required for each scheme.  This will assist the Department in ensuring a fair distribution of the funding available for these schemes.Assurances have been given to community and voluntary organisations that no Community Employment Scheme will close pending the completion of this review. The review outcomes are being compiled at present and all projects will be contacted regarding same in the near future.

This disability must be expected to last for at least one year and the allowance is subject to a medical examination, a means test and a habitual residence test.The weekly rate of disability allowance payment depends on the amount of weekly means assessed.  The legislative provisions regarding disability allowance state that means will be assessed from all income which the claimant or claimant's spouse/partner may reasonably expect to receive during the year following the date of their claim with certain exceptions.  Income derived from overtime is not included in these exceptions, and is accordingly assessable in full as means for disability allowance.When assessing weekly means for disability allowance purposes, income derived over a period of time is ‘averaged out' over that period. When making a decision, the deciding officer will average the earnings over the period most appropriate having regard to the circumstances of each case. This could be, for example, the previous tax year or a shorter and most recent period, if more appropriate.If a person's means are derived from their spouse/ partner's insurable employment the means assessment is based on the gross earnings less PRSI, superannuation and trade union dues and also a disregard of €20.00 a day is applied to the earnings for each day worked subject to a maximum of 3 days a week (maximum €60.00 a week) and the balance is assessed at 60%. Where the circumstances of a disability allowance recipient, including the income or earnings of a spouse/partner, have changed, that person should request a review of their entitlement. In order to   carry out a review, the respective person should send in up to date documentary evidence that outlines their financial situation.

This review of CE Schemes has proved to be a valuable exercise for both the schemes themselves and for my Department.Given the volume and breath of the data being returned, the financial review of CE schemes will take longer than originally envisaged to complete.  This will allow more time for schemes to engage with local officials in the finalisation of their respective budgets and for my Department to bring forward improvements to the overall operation of Community Employment which will improve the budgetary situation for schemes. No final allocations of materials and training grants have been made pending completion of the review.The existing commitment in relation to the financial support of schemes will continue to apply.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1177	I propose to answer Questions Nos. 669 to 671, inclusive, together.The pension rights of scheme members are protected through trust law and by provisions in the Pensions Act 1990 as amended. As supplementary pension schemes are usually established under irrevocable trust, the assets of the scheme are legally separate from the assets of the employer and are not available to any other creditors where the employer becomes insolvent.   Under trust law, trustees of occupational pension schemes have the principal responsibility for ensuring that the entitlements of the members are adequately protected and that they receive the pensions due.In addition to the safeguards provided by trust law, the Pensions Act 1990 provides for the regulation of pensions schemes in Ireland.  Under the Pensions Act, defined benefit (DB) pension schemes must meet a minimum Funding Standard which requires that schemes maintain sufficient assets to enable them discharge accrued liabilities in the event of the scheme winding up. The Funding Standard is a regulatory mechanism to assist in ensuring that DB schemes can meet the pension promised to scheme members. Responsibility rests with the employer and the trustees for ensuring that a scheme is properly funded and managed.Where schemes do not satisfy the Funding Standard, the sponsors/trustees must submit a funding proposal to the Pensions Board to restore full funding within three years. The Pensions Board can allow a scheme up to ten years to meet the standard in certain circumstances.Should a scheme be wound up by its trustees, the Pensions Act 1990 (as amended) specifies how scheme assets are prioritised.  In short, schemes first prioritise benefits that have accrued to members by way of additional voluntary contribution or transfer of rights from another scheme.  Benefits being paid to retired members come next in the priority list, followed by benefits to current and deferred members of the scheme.The issue of guarantees and the security of pension funds was raised in the Green Paper on Pensions which was published in October 2007. A public consultation process followed the publication of the Green Paper and was completed in May 2008. In March 2010 the National Pensions Framework was launched.  This framework set out plans for the reform of the Irish pensions system.The issue of a pension protection type mechanism was considered as part of this process to provide protection for DB pension scheme members in the event that their scheme is wound up with a shortfall. While both the UK and the US have such a mechanism, and these were examined, there are a number of reasons why a pension protection fund did not form part of the measures in the National Pensions Framework and why it is not intended to introduce such a measure. The relatively small size of the pensions industry in Ireland means that the risk-sharing and costs involved would be high, particularly at a time when pension schemes are already dealing with significant challenges.It imposes a retrospective penalty on employers who have set up a pension scheme on a voluntary basis and may confer a competitive advantage on those who have made no provision for their employees.It can lead to unintended consequences: e.g. under funding of pensions in advance of liquidation; riskier investment strategies; increasing pension benefits rather than wages in companies at risk; early retirement of directors taking substantial benefits.Stronger companies could end up cross-subsidising the weakest.It is prone to economic cycles: in a downturn, it is exposed to significant demands which it may not be able to meet.It imposes a high regulatory burden and is administratively complex and costly.Article 8 of the Directive 80/98/EEC was implemented by section 7 of the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency Act 1984. The European Commission carried out a review of the implementation of Article 8 in 1995 and again in 2010 and on both occasions expressed general satisfaction with Ireland's implementation of the Directive. This is currently under scrutiny as part of a legal challenge in the Courts: accordingly, I cannot comment further.The Government already makes a very significant contribution to support the private occupational pension system by forgoing approximately €2.5 billion in taxes each year. This is in addition to the €6 billion expenditure on State pensions. It has also made a number of legislative changes in recent years to assist pension schemes address the funding challenge facing many schemes at present.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1187	The person in question was in receipt of jobseeker's allowance with effect from September 2007. On that claim, payment was included for himself, his partner and his child as qualified dependants.  He submitted a claim for carer's allowance on 29 July 2010. His claim was disallowed on the grounds that the care recipient was not so disabled or invalided as to require full-time care and attention as laid down in legislation. He was notified of this decision and of his right of appeal. Following an oral hearing on 25 October 2011, the appeal was allowed. On 27 October 2011, the person concerned was notified accordingly.As there is no provision to pay for partners as dependants on carer's allowance, his jobseeker's allowance rate was payable at a higher rate of payment than the current rate payable to him on his carer's allowance entitlement.  During a phone call on 27 January 2012, he was advised accordingly.Consequently, if his carer's allowance claim was backdated, his carer's allowance arrears would not cover the amount paid to him on his Jobseeker's allowance entitlement. As it is more beneficial to him to opt for carer's allowance and his partner to make a claim in her own right, his entitlement was put into payment from 15 December 2011.  In addition, he is also entitled to €1,700 in respect of the respite care grant due on 2 June 2011. This amount issued to him on 22 November 2011.  Subsequently, his partner submitted an application for disability allowance in her own right. However, her application is currently under appeal and in the meantime she has secured a means tested supplementary welfare payment in her own right. While the household weekly entitlement is reduced by €2 per week at present, the household is financially better off when you take entitlement to the free schemes and entitlement to the annual respite care grant into account.

On 24 August 2011, he was notified of this decision and the reason for it.He appealed the decision, however the appeal was disallowed and the person in question was notified accordingly on 5 January 2012.  An appeals officer's decision is final and may only be reviewed in the light of new evidence being made available that was not to hand at the time of the appeal.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1189	The Labour Court recommended in July 2008 that an agreed pension scheme should be introduced for community employment (CE) scheme supervisors and assistant supervisors, and that such a scheme should be adequately funded by FÁS.  Notwithstanding the positions of the Department in rejecting that liability for these costs falls to be met from public funds, this matter has been the subject of discussions between the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, my Department, and the unions representing CE supervisors.  In the event that funding was required from FÁS, the implementation of the claim is not considered sustainable in light of the current and ongoing fiscal environment and the requirement to contain and reduce public expenditure.  The costs of the introduction of any scheme are likely to be of the order of €3m per annum with retrospective costs of the order of at least €30m.The Deputy should also note that FÁS is not the employer of CE supervisors and such employees are not public servants.  Neither was FÁS a party to the Labour Court dispute on this matter.  The responsibilities of the sponsoring organisations and the individuals concerned must also be recognised when considering pension provision arrangements.

The capping was introduced to facilitate the movement of participants though the programme, allowing new participants who may not otherwise have such an opportunity, to avail of the programme.The person referred to has completed his maximum period of participation of 6 years on the programme and, unfortunately, cannot avail of further participation time on a CE project.However, he should be advised to contact his local Employment Services Office, Main Street, Newbridge where staff will be pleased to discuss other possible training and employment options available to him.

On 4 October 2011, he was notified of this decision. He subsequently appealed the decision and submitted further medical evidence in support of his appeal. This information has been forwarded to the medical assessor for further consideration and, upon receipt of the opinion of the medical assessor, a deciding officer will review the original decision to refuse carer's allowance. The outcome of this review is due shortly.

When received, the appeal in question will be referred in due course to an Appeals Officer for consideration.The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions on social welfare entitlements.

#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1200	As the Deputy may be aware, the scope to provide grants for the protection of our built heritage is constrained by the significant reduction in the public finances.  However, my Department will continue to provide funding for the protection, conservation and development of our built heritage, insofar as resources allow.In 2012, my Department is providing €500,000 through a "Structures at Risk Fund" to assist with works to safeguard structures, both in private and civic ownership, protected under the Planning and Development Acts 2000-2011.  This funding is focused primarily on those protected structures most at risk.  The fund will be administered by local authorities and my Department has recently notified each City and County authority of the details of the scheme for 2012.The buildings to which the Deputy refers are not yet included on the Record of Protected Structures for County Kerry although I understand that the planning authority intends adding them to the Record.  In light of same, these buildings are not currently eligible for consideration under the Fund.The Heritage Council, which is funded by my Department, also administers a number of conservation grants schemes which provide assistance for conservation of the built heritage.  I understand that the buildings in question received some funding from Council in 2007 for works to the roof.  However, as I understand matters, the closing dates for applications under these schemes for 2012 have now passed.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1201	I propose to take Questions Nos. 699 and 700 together.As the Deputy will be aware, the Government, as part of its Public Service Reform Plan, recently announced a radical streamlining of State bodies, including in respect of certain bodies funded from my Department's Vote Group.  This includes decisions to combine or merge a number of such bodies. In addition, decisions have been taken to critically review, by June 2012, the streamlining and shared services agenda in respect of a number of other bodies funded from my Department's Vote Group, including in relation to the merging of the functions of Culture Ireland into my Department.  More details in this regard can be accessed on the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform website at www.per.gov.ie.The Deputy will be aware that it is recognised, most recently at the Global Irish Economic Forum last October, that arts and culture are Ireland's global calling card and one of our world-class, distinctive strengths as a nation.  The international promotion of Irish arts through Culture Ireland has made a significant impact — especially in the US last year with the Imagine Ireland programme — in restoring our global reputation at a critical time and expanding international markets and audiences for Irish artists.  Equally, in the coming years, the promotion of Irish cultural and creative excellence in Europe and in key growth markets, such as China, offers vital opportunities for the country, working in tandem with the promotion of trade, investment, tourism, food and science.  In particular, our EU Presidency in 2013 will present a platform to strengthen our cultural links with key European partners, such as Germany and France.I am committed to ensuring that we will be able to continue to deliver the functions of Culture Ireland effectively in the future. The critical review requested by the Government is already under way in my Department and I expect to be in a position shortly to take definitive decisions on the matter.  Decisions in relation to the future management structure will be finalised at that stage. In relation to the position of the Chief Executive of Culture Ireland, this issue is currently being examined by my Department.

Galway.  This includes the detailed design and costing for the project. It is envisaged that this stage will be completed shortly.The Deputy will appreciate that it would be premature to address the issue of air services until the processes relating to the terminal buildings have been brought to a conclusion.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1203	Since its formation in 1999, Waterways Ireland has continued to upgrade the facilities on the canals through the capital allocations under the National Development Plans.  The canals system has benefited extremely well during that time, particularly with the number of additional mooring and landing spaces that have been made available.  The provision of further mooring space will be dependent on available finance and priorities over the coming years.My Department's 2012 capital allocation for Waterways Ireland is €4.5m.  This will facilitate continued investment in the development and restoration of the inland waterways.  The main thrust of the refurbishment of the waterways over the next few years will be focused on the re-opening of the Ulster Canal from Upper Lough Erne to Clones.  However, Waterways Ireland is also undertaking feasibility studies on the Kilbeggan Branch of the Grand Canal and on the Longford Branch of the Royal Canal.  These are due to be completed by the end of 2013.I am informed by Waterways Ireland that there are 20 lock keepers employed at present on the Grand Canal and Barrow Navigation.  A number of staff have retired recently and decisions on their replacement will be taken having regard to the business needs of the organisation.  I understand that Waterways Ireland is not planning to recruit lock keepers at this time.  Any posts filled will be either by internal transfer or external recruitment, depending on the particular circumstances.I am informed that boat traffic numbers on the Grand Canal and Barrow Navigation have remained fairly constant over 2009 and 2010. In 2011 the numbers increased by 30% following the re-opening of the Royal Canal and the fact that access was available to the Tall Ships event in Waterford.

The developer's application to my Department for consent to proposals for work under the National Monuments Acts in regard to the provision of the commemorative centre is being examined.  As part of the process, the developer was required to provide an assessment of the wider battlefield context of the national monument site.  My Department is currently in consultation with the National Museum of Ireland in relation to the consent application and I hope to be able to make a decision on it shortly.Any wider plans for the development of the Moore Street area would be a matter for the relevant landowners and the development authority, Dublin City Council.

The Media Programme is the EU support programme for the European audiovisual industry and details, including the operation of the programme, are available at www.mediadeskireland.ie; and2. The Culture Programme is the EU support programme for organisations working in the field of culture and details, including the operation of the programme, are available at www.ccp.ie.It is not possible to estimate how much any country will receive from the two programmes. Periodically, there are calls for proposals from the European Commission seeking applications for support under the programmes.  The applications are then assessed by an independent body, the Executive Agency for Education, Audiovisual and Culture (EACEA).  The decisions on what support is provided are based on the merits of the applications: there is no quota for each country or no amount allocated to each country.Discussions are currently underway between the Member States and the European Commission on a new framework programme for the cultural and creative sectors.  This will run from 2014 to 2020 and be called the Creative Europe Programme.  It includes a proposal to amalgamate the current Culture and MEDIA programmes under a common framework and create an entirely new facility to improve access to finance.  A budget of some €1,800 million is mooted for the new programme but it is not finalised yet.  Once the new programme is finalised, details of how to seek funding from the programme will be made available through appropriate information outlets.

Under that Act, the Council is independent in its funding decisions and I, as Minister, am precluded from any involvement, either in decisions regarding which organisations it funds, or the amount of any such funding.Details of the Arts Council's funding decisions are, however, available on its website at www.artscouncil.ie, as are the criteria for applications and the names of the decision-making panels.  Details of successful applications in respect of the years 2009 and 2010 are available in the Council’s Annual Reports for those years, which are also available online.While the Council's 2012 allocation of €63.241 million represented some reduction on its 2011 allocation, I am confident that this funding will allow it to maximise its continuing support for the arts.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1222	I propose to take Questions Nos. 726, 740 and 741 together.The EU Renewable Energy Directive places a legal obligation on all Member states that by 2020 10% of energy in the transport sector must come from renewable energy sources.  Ireland intends to meet the requirement through a combination of the biofuel obligation scheme and an ambition that 10% of all vehicles will be powered by electricity by 2020.  Though very challenging, I believe that this target can be achieved although it will be critically dependent on the success of car manufacturers in bringing to market a range of competitively priced electrical vehicles as well as delivery of the necessary underpinning infrastructure.  It is estimated that replacement of 10% of cars, vans and buses in Ireland with currently available models of hybrid and battery electric vehicles could reduce national CO2 emissions by 0.35 million tonnes annually.The objective of the EV Grant Scheme is to incentivise and support, through grants of up to €5,000, the early deployment of electric and other low emission vehicles in Ireland in order to provide an early critical mass of such vehicles and to encourage the growth of a stable and robust market for these vehicles.In 2011, 42 grants were paid by Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) under the scheme.  An allocation of 1.5 million euro has been provided for 2012 and SEAI expects that the number of applications will increase as car manufacturers increase the range of electric vehicles available to the market.  Any decision in relation to the continuation of the scheme into 2013 will be a matter for consideration in the context of Budget 2013.Under the scheme, vehicles which meet the following criteria are eligible for support:Vehicle Type: Passenger vehicle must meet the M1 classification as defined under the European Whole Type Approval ProcessSafety:  Vehicle must meet European New Car Assessment Programme (Euro NCAP) rating of at least 3 starsSpeed:  Must achieve 100kph on a level surfaceTailpipe CO2 Emissions:  < 75g/kmVehicle Warranty (including battery):  3 years or 100,000kmThere are no plans to alter these criteria.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1226	I propose to take Questions Nos. 730 and 731 together.The Broadcasting Act 2009 provides for the development of digital radio in Ireland.This Act provides RTÉ with the role of establishing and operating a multiplex for the purposes of providing a digital sound broadcasting service.  It gives the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) responsibility for licensing spectrum in respect of digital sound broadcasting services and the primary responsibility for ensuring the development of commercial and community digital radio services rests with the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI).In relation to RTÉ, I can confirm that the public service broadcaster has already put in place the necessary infrastructure for the provision of digital sound broadcasting services and has been operating a DAB radio multiplex since 2010.  RTÉ currently provides a range of digital radio services by means of this network, comprising RTÉ 1, 2fm, Lyric FM, Raidió na Gaeltachta, RTÉ Gold, RTÉ 2XM, RTÉ Choice, RTÉ Junior (which becomes RTÉ Chill at night time), RTÉ Pulse, and RTÉ Radio 1 Extra (which carries the Longwave content).In terms of the broader development of digital radio in Ireland, the BAI Strategy Statement for 2011-2013 offers an outline of what will be achieved by the BAI, taking into account its specific objectives, together with a range of other duties set out in the Broadcasting Act and in its broader work schedule.In this regard, I can confirm that the BAI has included an objective to examine the desirability or, and potential for, digital sound broadcasting and it is anticipated that a programme of work in this regard will be considered in 2013.In regard to the concerns of the community radio sector, the Deputy should be aware that section 26(3) of the Act imposes a direct obligation on the BAI to consider the needs of community broadcasters in respect of digital broadcasting and I am confident that the Authority will meet its obligations in this regard when undertaking the programme of work identified in its Strategy.

The obligation currently requires that the amount of biofuel brought to the market is not less than 4.166% of the relevant disposal of petroleum road transport fuels.In 2011, the total amount of petroleum motor fuel placed on the market was 4,276 million litres of which 145 million litres or 3.39% were biofuel.  Taking into account the double certificates issued for biofuel produced from wastes a total of 194 million biofuel certificates were issued in 2011 which equates to 4.54% of relevant disposals during the year.My Department will be undertaking consultations shortly on the options for increasing the Biofuels Obligation from 2013 taking into account of all relevant factors, including developments in the Irish market and in the UK and other EU markets as well as sustainability considerations.  The Obligation is designed to promote the sustainable growth of the Irish biofuels market thus supporting the growth of sustainable indigenous production of biofuels.

The Warmer Homes scheme is delivered through a range of Community Based Organisations (CBOs), augmented by a panel of private contractors in order to ensure national coverage.The SEAI advises that 762 homes in County Kerry were supported in 2010 and 587 in 2011.  The waiting list comprises 10,729 homes nationally as of 31 March 2012.2012 marks a shift in emphasis on the Better Energy: Warmer Homes scheme to take account of the Government's Affordable Energy Strategy.  Heretofore, applicants were considered eligible for retrofit measures if they met defined criteria, such as eligibility for the National Fuel Scheme.  All successful applicants were placed on a waiting list and addressed in rotation.  The focus in 2012 is shifting to addressing those households identified as being in extreme energy poverty as a priority.  Such households typically spend over 20% of their disposable income on energy services.  This approach will ensure that those most in need receive the benefit of energy efficiency measures first.

In the REFIT 3 scheme for biomass technologies, higher reference prices are offered for those new renewable electricity generating plants in the Anaerobic Digestion category that are less than half a megawatt and for those new biomass CHP (combined heat and power) units that are less than one and a half megawatts.The hydro category in REFIT 1 (scheme now closed to new applicants) and REFIT 2 is limited to new renewable generating units of less than 5MW while the small wind category is limited to those new windfarms of less than 5MW and a higher rate is payable than for those in the large wind category.  There are several small hydro units of less than 1MW in the REFIT 1 scheme, as well as a number of landfill gas units that are also less than 1MW.Electric Ireland, on a commercial basis, offers a feed in tariff for domestic micro-generators under certain conditions and it recently extended its micro-generation payment of (9 cent / kWh) by a further year to 31st December 2012.  The terms and conditions of the Electric Ireland scheme are available on the Electric Ireland website.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) initiated a pilot micro-generation scheme in 2009 and has been monitoring the 42 installations in that scheme in order to provide information and advice in this area.The Programme for Government states that a feed-in tariff will be provided for micro-generators wishing to produce electricity for their own homes, farms and businesses and that they will be facilitated to sell surplus electricity to the grid while the tariff should not be significantly above single energy market price for electricity.  My Department and the SEAI are finalising analysis on the most cost effective options which could be considered for supporting the micro-generation sector, having regard to the costs and benefits for all energy consumers.

The objective of each Eel Management Plan is to reduce anthropogenic mortalities so as to permit with high probability the escapement to the sea of at least 40% of the silver eel biomass relative to the best estimate of escapement that would have existed if no anthropogenic influences had impacted the stock.  The Irish Eel Management Plan has four main management actions aimed at reducing eel mortality and increasing silver eel escapement to the sea.  They were as follows:a cessation of the commercial eel fishery and closure of the market,mitigation of the impact of hydropower, including a comprehensive trap and transport plan to be funded by the ESB,to ensure upstream migration of juvenile eel at barriers,to improve water quality.Recently the status of the European Eel in Ireland was defined as critically endangered in Ireland Amphibians, Reptiles and Freshwater Fish Red Data List, published in 2011.  Scientific analysis estimated that 2007 Eel escapement (adults going to sea) was at 23% of pristine stock and declining.  Due to the very long cycle and slow growth in Irish waters it is probable that any recovery of the Irish eel stocks will be over a very long time frame.Hydropower on major catchments causes mortality of eel passing through turbines.  Ireland's eel management plan sets out mitigation of hydropower as one of the management actions aimed at reducing eel mortality and increasing silver eel escapement to the sea.  The ESB and the National University of Ireland Galway (NUIG) are currently researching the level of turbine mortality on the Shannon and Erne but it is estimated that turbine mortality is above 20%.  A number of studies carried out across Europe suggest an average mortality rate of 28.5% across all length classes per hydropower installation according to the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) in 2003.To reduce this mortality on eels passing down the headrace of the hydropower stations and through turbines, migrating silver eels are captured upstream and transported down below the hydropower stations and released.A license was issued under Section 14 of the 1959 Fisheries Act to the then ESB for Trap and Transport operations in 2009, 2010 and 2011and there were no other applicants.  A similar authorisation has not yet been issued in respect of 2012.  Authorisation facilitates the ESB to contract fishermen to catch silver eel for transport and release below the hydropower stations.While ESB supervises the activity directly, both the catching and release of eels is monitored by Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI) and where appropriate the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure, Northern Ireland (DCAL).A similar effort is made by ESB in trapping juvenile eel at the base of the lowermost hydroelectric stations and transporting these juvenile eel upstream where they are released into the existing habitat.The protocols and sanctions are all listed within the documentation supplied by the Department in a section 14 authorisation.  I am organising for the same to be forwarded to the Deputy.  They are based on current best practices and are reviewed annually.  There is a high level of monitoring by both IFI (and DCAL where appropriate) built in to safeguard the welfare of migrating eels.The cost of the operation was met each year by the ESB and as such is a matter for that organisation.There were no eel dealer licences held by the ESB Fisheries during the years 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011.ESB are involved in the trap and transport operation as part a multi-agency co-operative approach in the implementation of Ireland's Eel Management Plan and were not party to decisions to cease the commercial fishery as part of that plan. The European eel is a single, panmictic, stock distributed from Northern Africa and the Mediterranean in the south to Northern Norway and Iceland in the north, including the Baltic Sea.  Recent genetic evidence has confirmed the shared nature of the stock, with slight temporal variation between cohorts but no geographical differentiation (Palm et al. 2009).  Therefore, it is not possible to genetically distinguish eels from different European countries.

There is a ban on commercial fishing for eels from inland waters in the State including the River Shannon Estuary.  I am advised by Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI) that there is no evidence of the illegal removal of large quantities of glass eels from the River Shannon Estuary or the sale of these to third parties.In 1993 and 1994 ESB carried out a glass eel programme, which investigated sampling techniques, biological observations and discussed results in an international context.This was an intensive survey into glass eels and elvers in the River Shannon estuary.  Subsequently between 2002 and 2008 small quantities of glass eels were caught at some rivers near Limerick and transported upstream to Lough Derg.Glass eel recruitment in the Shannon dropped after 1983 and with the exception of the mid 1990s has remained low since.  There was no improvement in the recruitment of glass eels to the River Shannon between 2009 and 2011.Information derived from glass eel research on the Shannon has been provided in Ireland's Report to the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) in 2011 and in the Draft Report of the IFI's Standing Scientific Committee for Eel (2012).I attach for the Deputy's information a table summarising the glass eel catches in the River Shannon catchment from 1985 to 2011.  The research in question has been carried out for almost three decades and has been part of the research spend by IFI and its predecessors for that extended period.  The costs of eel research are not disaggregated from overall research costs and are not available.YearShannon ArdnacrushaR FealeR MaigueInagh RShannon Estuary Glass Eels19851,093503198694819871,610198814519892719904671991901992321993241994287701419953980194199633203414019972,1204074671886161998275818114841999181350041620003917401204320012758218120021781165372003378367211114720045800241200541010412006421043200745003912200870082.5220098422010502031,312320117558

The programme continues to underpin significant economic activity, supporting at least 4,500 jobs and realising significant energy savings for households.To date the scheme has paid over €130m in grants for over 300,000 measures in over 120,000 homes.The monthly payment levels for the past two years are summarised in the table below:MonthNumber of ApplicationsAverage Grant Paid Per Month *Apr-104,949€773May-105,132€753Jun-104,171€794Jul-104,127€883Aug-104,721€915Sep-105,645€997Oct-106,786€1,001Nov-109,374€1,043Dec-105,317€1,031Jan-115,595€1,038Feb-115,163€996Mar-114,929€1,001Apr-113,729€1,051May-113,924€1,176Jun-114,068€1,212Jul-114,022€1,264Aug-114,987€1,277Sep-115,784€1,331Oct-115,754€1,260Nov-116,492€1,144Dec-113,882€1,170Jan-122,429€1,142Feb-122,453€1,152Mar-122,052€1,096*As Homeowners have six months in which to complete works and submit documentation from the date of grant approval, there is not a direct correlation between the numbers of applications and the average grant drawn down.Grant levels for half the measures under Better Energy: Homes have been adjusted for 2012 in light of market developments and to ensure a better link between grant support and dwelling type.  For instance, the reduction in the external wall insulation grant reflects increased price competitiveness in the market and the relative cost of undertaking this work on the various house types.Since the start of 2012, there has been a decrease in applications across all measures in Better Energy: Homes.  I have requested my Department and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland to provide me with analysis on the factors underlying the decrease, which I expect to receive shortly.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1244	Ireland's fiscal terms are tax based and do not include royalty payments.  In 1987, Ireland followed the lead of other countries such as the UK and Norway in moving away from a royalty based payments system to a tax based system.  Under a tax based system the return to the State is linked directly to the profitability of the individual oil or gas field, as compared to a royalty based system where payments are linked to the actual volume of production and do not take account of differences in development cost or actual profitability.As a tax based system offers greater predictability in terms of the potential return on investment, it is a more appropriate approach for a country such as Ireland that is seeking to attract a higher share of mobile international exploration investment. A comprehensive review of Ireland's licensing terms was carried out in 2007 by independent economic consultants, following which both the fiscal and non-fiscal licensing terms were revised.  The revised terms, which were put into effect through the 2008 Finance Act, apply to all exploration licences issued since 1st January 2007 and provide for a new profit resource rent tax of up to 15% in addition to the 25% corporate tax rate previously applying.  The revised terms ensure that the return to the State would be up to 40% in the case of very profitable fields.

The Better Energy Homes solar grant amounts to €800 for every eligible home where the installation meets the performance requirements set out in the Better Energy Homes Code of Practice and the homeowner's Solar Buyers Guide.The specification requires that the solar water heating installation must contribute a portion of renewable energy for domestic hot water heating relative to the floor area of the property.  All registered solar contractors have been fully apprised of the specific requirements.The property of the applicant has a floor area of 178 square meters and so the solar installation must provide at least 1,700 kilo Watt hours (kWh) per annum.  The information supplied to the SEAI at the time of grant claim and subsequent appeals indicates that the installation only provides 1,196 kWh per year, significantly below the prescribed requirements for this particular property.  Payment of this grant was therefore declined for failure to meet the technical requirements of the grant scheme.  Queries in relation to individual applications are an operational matter for the SEAI and a dedicated hot line can be reached at 1800 250 204.  In addition, the SEAI has recently established a specific email address for queries from Oireachtas members, which can be sent to oireachtas@seai.ie  and will be dealt with promptly.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1246	Ireland's telecommunications market has been liberalised since 1999 and since then has developed into a well-regulated market, supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators, providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms.  Details of broadband services available on a county-by-county basis can be found on the Commission for Communications Regulation's (ComReg) website at www.callcosts.ie.The State is not a provider of services, except in instances of clear market failure such as in the cases of both the National and Rural Broadband Schemes.  Such interventions are always subject to EU State Aid clearance to ensure no unacceptable level of market distortion takes place.In keeping with State aid clearance for the Scheme, the broadband service contracted under the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) is an affordable, scaleable product which currently offers minimum speeds of 1.6Mbps download and 1.2Mbps upload subject to a maximum contention ratio.  As regards service quality, my Department has well-established monitoring arrangements in place to ensure that the NBS delivers the minimum specified service or better to all users.  The NBS contract guarantees service levels and imposes a service credit regime on 3, the NBS service provider, with significant financial consequences in the event that minimum specification service levels are not met.Should any NBS customer experience problems with the NBS service, they are advised to contact 3's customer care centre, 24 hours a day 7 days a week, by phone at 1913 (free of charge), via email to nbssupport@three.ie or by post to 3 Customer Services, Hutchison 3G Ireland Limited, PO Box 333, Dublin 2. I should add that my Department also has a role where customers have fully utilised the established complaints process and consider that their complaint has not been resolved.  My officials operate a dedicated NBS mailbox, which NBS customers can contact by email at nationalbroadbandscheme@dcenr.gov.ie, with any comments or complaints they may have about their NBS service.  Where a customer has unresolved problems with their NBS service, they can contact my Department who will then liaise with 3 personnel at its Head Office in Dublin to remedy their service performance issues.While my Department has previously dealt with a small number of individual complaints from NBS customers in County Longford, there is no evidence to suggest that there is widespread poor quality service delivery in NBS areas.  Such a scenario would be of concern to my Department.The Rural Broadband Scheme (RBS) was launched last year in recognition of the fact that despite the widespread availability of broadband throughout Ireland, there still remained individual premises that were unable to receive affordable broadband provision, due to technical difficulties such as line of sight issues.  In total, there were 221 applications from persons living in County Longford.The response to date by industry suggests that virtually all eligible applicants are capable of obtaining a broadband service from a supplier using one of the available technology platforms, i.e. DSL, fixed or mobile wireless, cable or satellite.  Obviously, where a commercial service is shown to be available, the State cannot intervene with a subvention for alternative services as to do so would be a breach of State Aid rules.  I expect that over the coming months, those remaining eligible applicants under the RBS, of which there are 81 from County Longford, will be receiving offers from the commercial providers who are participating in the scheme and I am hopeful that all of them will be offered a commercial service.The combination of private investment and State interventions means that Ireland will meet the EU Commission's "Digital Agenda for Europe" target of having a basic broadband service available to all areas by 2013.The Government accepts that the widespread availability of high speed broadband is a key requirement in delivering future economic and social development.  With basic broadband services now widely available across Ireland, the challenge is to accelerate the roll out of high speed services.  The Next Generation Broadband Taskforce (NGBT), which I convened last summer, is currently finalising its deliberations which are expected to identify how best to deliver wider customer access to high speed broadband generally.The next steps, following completion of the NGBT report, will be to bring the report to Government before consulting with the wider public for their views.  Building on the work of the Taskforce, it is my intention to publish a National Broadband Plan for Ireland later this year which will set out a range of policy commitments and actions aimed at accelerating the rollout of high speed broadband across Ireland.

Information on the Bellacorick wind farm is available on the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland's (SEAI) website and it indicates that the project was grant-aided by the EU Valoren programme, which assisted the development of indigenous energy potential in less development regions of the community in the 1980s and 1990s.No records can be located in my Department or in SEAI in relation to the administration of projects under the Valoren Programme as it applied to Ireland.

The scheme is managed by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) and delivered through a range of Community Based Organisations (CBOs), augmented by a panel of private contractors in order to ensure national coverage.The SEAI has recently renewed the contracts with 26 of the network of CBOs and hopes to conclude negotiations with the remainder at the earliest possible opportunity.  Energy efficiency upgrades continue to be provided and households on the waiting list on 31 March 2012 are being retrofitted according to their position on the waiting list.  All applicants since the end of 2011 have been informed that there will be a change in eligibility criteria.An Invitation to Tender was recently published by the SEAI to establish a new panel of private contractors to augment this network.  The public procurement process through the Official Journal of the European Union will take a number of weeks to conclude and a panel should be in place next month.2012 will mark a shift in emphasis on the Better Energy: Warmer Homes scheme to take account of the Government's Affordable Energy Strategy, which I launched last November.  The Inter-Departmental Group on Affordable Energy met in February 2012 and has established subgroups to work on particular dimensions, including finalisation of revised eligibility criteria for the scheme.  Heretofore, applicants were considered eligible for retrofit measures if they met defined criteria, such as eligibility for the National Fuel Scheme.  All successful applicants were placed on a waiting list and addressed in rotation.The focus in 2012 is shifting to addressing those households identified as being in extreme energy poverty as a priority; such households typically spend over 20% of their disposable income on energy services.  This will ensure that those most in need receive the benefit of energy efficiency measures first.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1250	The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) administers the Better Energy Programme.  The Better Energy Programme is in line with the key criteria governing the Government's investment priorities and is consistent with the Programme for Government's objectives, and in particular its Action Plan for Jobs.  The Government has committed significant Exchequer funding of €76 million to the Better Energy Programme in 2012 and expenditure on the programme to date this year is €17.716 million.  The Programme will continue to support the sustainable employment of at least 4,500 jobs in 2012.Better Energy: Homes encourages homeowners to improve the energy performance of their homes through incentives with over 120,000 homes completed since the scheme launched in May 2009.  Better Energy: Warmer Homes aims to address households identified as being in extreme energy poverty as a priority, those households identified as spending over 20% of their disposable income on energy services.  To date, energy efficiency improvements in over 80,000 homes have been made under Better Energy: Warmer Homes.The National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP) commits to achieving 20% energy savings across the economy by 2020.  As part of this energy efficiency drive, the Government has also committed to achieving a 33% energy saving across our public sector institutions by 2020.   The Better Energy: Workplaces Programme disbursed €11 million in 2011 to co-finance 85 projects in the public, commercial, industrial and community sectors.  This leveraged additional investment of €34 million, securing estimated savings of 270GWh and abatement of 63,000 tonnes of CO2 .  Estimated annual monetary savings are €11 million.A new phase of Better Energy: Workplaces was launched in March 2012, providing a capital fund of €7.5 million to support sustainable energy upgrades to existing buildings, services, facilities and processes, in the public, commercial, industrial and community sectors.  The programme is aimed at achieving ongoing and lasting energy savings.  Projects entailing upgrades to thermal, electrical or transport energy performance are all considered eligible.  Public sector projects are particularly encouraged in order to assist in meeting the public sector energy efficiency improvement target in 2020.The SEAI's Public Sector Programme was established in 2009 to provide a range of integrated supports to help public sector organisations realise valuable energy savings and work towards the 33% target.  The SEAI is continuing to develop best practice guidance materials and has facilitated specialist workshops on matters such as public street lighting, water services, and ICT.  To monitor progress to this target SEAI is also developing a database for monitoring and reporting progress across the public sector.

AHBs are also responsible for the operation of letting policies, the fixing of rents and compliance with all relevant statutory requirements.Under the terms of the Capital Assistance Scheme, AHBs are to fix rents at levels which are reasonable having regard to tenants' incomes and the outlay by the approved housing body on the accommodation including the ongoing costs of management and maintenance.Under the terms of the Capital Loan and Subsidy Scheme, rents payable are calculated with reference to household and subsidiary income in the previous tax year. Household income is defined to this end as the total income of the tenant and his / her spouse or of joint tenants as the case may be. Where this would result in hardship arising from a fall in income due to loss of employment, disability etc, the rent may be adjusted accordingly.

In negotiating with landlords to bring properties into RAS, local authorities obtain reductions on existing rents where possible. Guidance which has issued by my Department advises that a discount of at least 8% below market rent is recommended.As part of their negotiation process, local authorities may agree, at their discretion, periodic rent reviews with landlords in line with the prevailing market conditions at the time. My Department has issued guidance to authorities advising them to ensure that rent reviews are undertaken where provided for and also advising authorities of the need to obtain value for money and have regard to local market conditions when entering into new agreements.The achievement of value for money is the primary focus of authorities when negotiating costs and other associated terms and conditions provided for in agreements under the Scheme. Information in relation to the value of savings made resulting from negotiated contracts entered into by individual local authorities is not available in my Department.A Value for Money and Policy Review has been carried out on the RAS which provides general information on discounts achieved based on a sample of local authorities; the sample does not include Louth authorities.

This Report, entitled Health Effects of Electromagnetic Fields, is available for download on my Department’s website (www.environ.ie).  The Expert Group reported that the majority scientific opinion was that no adverse short or long term effects have been demonstrated from exposure to electromagnetic fields at levels below the limits recommended by the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection (ICNIRP). However, extensive international research on the issue continues to be coordinated through bodies such as the World Health Organisation. The Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg), the licensing authority for the telecommunications industry, commissions audit reports to verify that its licensed operators are in compliance with their licence conditions relating to emission limits for non-ionising radiation. The detailed measurement results from over 900 transmitter sites surveyed to date have so far shown total compliance. Recorded levels of radiofrequency signals are typically measured as being within the range of 0.002% to 2% of the safe exposure levels set by the ICNIRP guidelines. The location of licensed telecommunications antennae and the results of individual site survey reports can be found on ComReg’s website:http://www.askcomreg.ie/mobile/siteviewer.273.LE.asp.My Department's current advice to those living in close proximity to mobile masts or base stations, based on the conclusions of the Expert Group, is that there is no scientific basis for, or evidence of, adverse health effects in children or adults as a result of exposure to electromagnetic fields below ICNIRP levels. This applies irrespective of the location of the mobile phone mast.The Department will continue to monitor this and other scientific evidence as it is made available, and will consider any policy implications in this context.

I am sure the Deputy will understand that I cannot pre-empt the outcome of those discussions which are ongoing.   I should point out that a fuel rebate system, as sought by the IRHA, could not under EU law be restricted to Irish licensed hauliers but would have to be extended to all vehicles intended exclusively for the carriage of goods by road with a maximum permissible gross laden weight of not less than 7.5 tonnes. In addition, the rebate would have to include the carriage of passengers by a motor vehicle of category M2 or category M3 as defined in Council Directive 70/156/EEC.

The data to end of September 2011 indicate that 6,202 of all local authority mortgages (i.e. those drawn down for the purposes of purchasing under the various paths to home ownership including affordable housing, shared ownership and tenant purchase) are in arrears of more than 90 days. This represents 27.5% of the total number of loans.

The registration fee for a tenancy is currently set at €90 and an additional fee of €90 is payable for tenancies registered more than a month after the creation of the tenancy.  There is a combined fee of €375 for the registration of several tenancies within the same property and within one month of the commencement of the tenancies.  The maximum duration of a tenancy under the Act is four years after which a new tenancy must be registered with the Board. In the case of a dwelling subject to several different tenancies in a 12 month period no more than two tenancy registration fees are payable.The Act allows for the PRTB, having regard to changes in the value of money, to vary these fees.  I have no function in this matter.

An online system www.householdcharge.ie   is in place in the Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) to enable homeowners to pay the household charge by credit/debit card.   In addition, homeowners can make payment by cheque, postal order, credit/debit card by completing the relevant payment details on the declaration form and posting it to Household Charge, PO Box 12168, Dublin 1.  Instalment payments were available by direct debit only and persons opting to pay in this way had to register their details with the LGMA before 1 March, 2012.  This deadline was necessary in order to meet banking requirements for direct debit arrangements.A bureau is in place in the LGMA to administer the charge on a shared service/agency basis for all local authorities.  In addition, all county/city councils have arrangements in place for persons to attend their principal offices to pay the household charge.I am satisfied that there are comprehensive suites of payment options available to persons to pay the household charge and I have no proposals along the lines suggested.

The outcome of this analysis is that Irish Water should be established as an independent state owned company within the Bord Gáis Group.Bord Gáis Éireann (BGE) has key capabilities that can be brought to bear in the establishment of Irish Water, including experience in operating as a utility in a regulated environment and a track record in raising finance, and has specific skills from its own experience of transformation, customer relations, network management, metering and utility operation that can be quickly deployed to assist in the successful establishment and operation of Irish Water.The skills within the Bord Gáis Group will be paired with the experience and commitment to service in local authorities and the specific water and wastewater capabilities and expertise that exist in local government to build the new organisation.  The proposed public utility model represents a major change with significant implications for local government, the water industry in Ireland and its many stakeholders.  A high level plan set out in the independent assessment provides for a phased transition of functions from local authorities to Irish Water.  From an operational perspective, it is envisaged that local authorities will be engaged as agents of Irish Water for a considerable period of time with the majority of staff remaining in the direct employment of local authorities.  This will ensure a smooth transition to the new model and guard against the loss of local expertise. These arrangements would end in 2017 at the earliest based on the independent assessment.These are a range of key issues to be addressed in developing the implementation plan for the establishment of Irish Water. The development and rollout of the plan will involve co-operation with local authorities and staff to ensure that the change is managed well.  The County and City Managers Association is involved in the steering group for the project and the Department has also written to Managers on a number of occasions to update them on aspects of the reform programme.The Department has had initial engagement with ICTU at the start of the independent assessment and as part of the consultation process undertaken earlier this year.   There will be further engagement during the course of the development of the implementation plan and I have written to Congress in this regard.The implementation plan will be refined and developed over the coming weeks in collaboration with other relevant Government Departments, local authorities, BGE and NewERA.

The objective of the water metering programme is to install water meters in households connected to the public mains and move to a charging system based on usage above a free allowance.  The metering programme will commence prior to the end of 2012.I expect that the Regulator will address affordability issues, including in respect of persons with medical conditions, in consultation with my Department and the Department of Social Protection in the context of developing a water pricing framework.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1269	Local authorities are multi-purpose bodies responsible for an extensive range of services, which include among other services, public parks; libraries; open spaces and leisure amenities; planning and development; fire and emergency services; roads; maintenance and cleaning of streets and street lighting.Income from local sources such as commercial rates, housing rents, environmental and other waste charges, and charges for non-domestic water services provide over half of the current funding needs of local authorities. The balance of the funding is provided through specific State grants from a range of Government Departments and agencies.It is a matter for each local authority to determine its own spending in the context of the annual budgetary process having regard to both locally identified needs and available resources. Local authorities are required to prepare their annual budget and annual financial statement in the prescribed format in accordance with the Local Authority Accounting in Ireland Code of Practice and Accounting Regulations, issued by my Department in December 2009 under section 107 of the Local Government Act 2001. This publication is available on my Department’s website www.environ.ie.The provision of detailed information on projects and services is a matter for each individual local authority. I understand that local authorities do make a number of annual reports and other information regarding the cost of their services available to the public, including on their websites.

The charge is set at €200 and is being levied and collected by local authorities. The Act places the onus on an owner of a residential property which is situated in the State to assess his or her liability for the charge in the first instance.Under the Act, it is a function of a local authority to collect non-principal private residence charges and late payment fees due to it.  In this regard, it is a matter for individual local authorities to take measures in respect of properties that may have a liability to the NPPR charge under the provisions of the 2009 Act.

The Programme includes contracts under construction and to commence to the value of some €38 million in the county during the period of the Programme.   However, the Doolin Sewerage Scheme was not amongst the priority contracts and schemes selected for inclusion in the current Programme.The Programme aims to prioritise projects that target environmental compliance issues and support economic and employment growth.  A key input to the development of the Programme was the assessment of needs prepared by local authorities, including Clare County Council, in response to my Department's request to the authorities in 2009 to review and prioritise their proposals for new capital works in their areas.  These were subsequently appraised in the Department in the context of the funds available and key criteria that complemented those used by the authorities. Inevitably, through this process, certain projects that had been proposed had to give way to others that were more strategically important at that time.   Progress under the Water Services Investment Programme 2010-2012 was reviewed in mid 2011 and through this process, consideration was given to any newly emerging priority contracts and schemes submitted by local authorities for addition to the Programme.  No proposal for the Doolin Sewerage Scheme was received from Clare County Council in response to the review.It is a matter for Clare County Council to submit to my Department any proposals relating to the pumping of sewage from Doolin to a treatment plant in Lisdoonvarna for approval.

Decisions have already been taken to merge the authorities in Limerick and in Tipperary and implementation work is proceeding in both cases. I very recently received the report of the Waterford Local Government Committee which was established to consider whether Waterford City and County Councils should be unified and that report is under examination.Building on these actions, I will be bringing wider policy proposals to Government for an action programme on local government, with particular focus on strengthening structures generally at regional, county and sub-county levels and expanding the role of local government. The programme will also reflect other work under way in relation to local government efficiency implementation and financing and will broadly map out further aspects of the local government system on which reform proposals will be considered. In that context, I intend to consider further the concept of a directly elected mayor and its relationship with the local government system.

These include the incremental purchase scheme, the availability of loan finance from local authorities for house purchase, including open market purchase, and the tenant purchase scheme. I have no immediate plans to introduce a general rent-to-buy scheme across all local authorities.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1275	Local authorities are under a statutory obligation to levy rates on any property used for commercial purposes in accordance with the details entered in the valuation lists prepared by the independent Commissioner of Valuation under the Valuation Act 2001.  The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority. The annual rate on valuation (ARV), which is applied to the valuation of each property, determined by the Valuation Office, to obtain the amount payable in rates, is decided by the elected members of each local authority in the annual budget and its determination is a reserved function.The Commissioner of Valuation, who has sole responsibility for all valuation matters, is conducting a programme of revaluation of all commercial and industrial properties throughout the State on a county by county basis.  The purpose of the revaluation process is to provide for more consistent and up-to-date valuations for rating purposes and to assist in providing a more equitable distribution of valuations across those liable to pay rates.The Commissioner, in consultation with my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, has been reviewing various options for streamlining the valuation process and speeding up the national revaluation programme. In this regard, the Government recently approved the drafting of a Valuation Bill to amend the Valuation Act.I have requested that local authorities exercise restraint in setting their 2012 ARVs. Across the 88 rating local authorities, the average change of ARV from 2011 to 2012 shows a decrease of 0.31%.With regard to the application of rates on childcare premises and crèches, local authorities levy rates on commercial establishments. Where childcare provision is within a community facility, operating in a non-profit capacity, commercial rates do not generally apply.I recognise that these are difficult economic times for many businesses and I will continue to keep all matters relating to rates under regular consideration in my Department.

However, it is expected that the proposed treatment process will deliver a moderately hard water and it is anticipated that this level of hardness would not warrant further intervention.  The water treatment plant is to be commissioned later this year and its performance can be assessed by Kildare County Council.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1278	Under the Fire Services Act 1981 and 2003, fire safety and fire prevention measures in public buildings, including hotels, are the responsibility of the person having control of the premises.  Section 18(2) of the Act places a duty on persons, having control of a building to which the Act applies, to take all reasonable measures to guard against the outbreak of fire, to provide reasonable fire safety measures for such premises and to ensure, as far as is reasonably practicable, the safety of those using the premises in the event of fire.  To assist the person in control in discharging their statutory duty, my Department published Fire Safety in Guest Accommodation (2001) which is available on my Department’s website at www.environ.ie.  This guide sets out the fire safety measures and procedures which should be considered, including recommendations for fire alarm systems.Fire alarm systems in public buildings, including the provision of visual alarm systems, are also dealt with in the recommendations of Irish Standard I.S. 3218: 2009.  This standard, published by the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI), makes detailed recommendations for planning, design, installation, commissioning, and servicing of fire detection and alarm systems in buildings. Paragraph 5.6.7.1 of the Standard states that in areas where a normal type of sounder may be ineffective, e.g. where the occupants are hearing impaired or may be sleeping, visual alarms and tactile alarm devices should be used.Fire safety in the design and construction of new buildings, including hotels, is governed by Part B of the 1997-2008 Building Regulations, made under the Building Control Act 1990.  Primary responsibility for compliance with the Building Regulations rests with the builders and owners of buildings.  Guidance on how to comply with Part B is set out in Technical Guidance Document B (TGD-B) published by my Department.  Paragraph 1.4.14 of TGD-B deals with requirements in relation to fire detection and alarm systems, including reference to the relevant I.S. as mentioned above.My Department is currently engaged in a review of TGD-B, in which the issue of fire alarm systems will be further considered.

The consultation document set out the proposed content of the Regulations to be made under Section 70L of the Water Services (Amendment) Act 2012.The consultation period closed on 30 March and more than 160 submissions were received. The submissions are being reviewed by my Department and when this process is complete, the regulations which will give legal effect to the standards will be finalised. At that stage, the relevant Statutory Instrument will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas, in accordance with Section 18 of the Water Services Act 2007.

The Programme includes contracts under construction and to commence to the value of some €130 million in the county during the period of the Programme.Galway County Council's Contract Documents for the Networks for the Milltown and Claregalway Sewerage Scheme, with an estimated cost of €2.9 million, were approved in May 2011. I understand that Galway County Council is currently assessing the tender recommendations for the contract.The revised Design Build Operate Contract Documents for the wastewater treatment plant for the Milltown and Claregalway Sewerage Scheme, which were received in my Department in November 2011, are currently being examined.  Once approved by my Department, the Council can then proceed to invite tenders for this contract.In relation to the provision of funding for the connection of additional septic tanks to the scheme, it is a matter for Galway County Council to submit proposals in this regard to my Department.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1281	The assessment of a tenderer's financial and economic standing is a key part of any procurement process. Establishing the appropriate suitability criteria that are relevant and appropriate to a particular contract is, of course, a matter for the contracting authority concerned. This is because the contracting authority is in the best position to gauge the appropriate levels of financial capacity that are appropriate to the needs of that specific contract.In this regard, tenderers must declare that they have the necessary capacity to carry out a contract and must be in a position to produce the necessary documentation when requested.  That documentary evidence (e.g. bank statements, audited accounts, proof of professional indemnity, etc.) need only be produced when a tenderer has been short-listed or is coming under consideration for the award of a contract. Contracting authorities are advised to check these issues throughout a procurement process up to the point of awarding a contract to ensure that such circumstances have not changed.  If the financial situation of the tenderer has changed they can be excluded from any further participation in the competition.Any tenders received from companies in receivership are considered on their own merits, taking account of the circumstances of the case and the provisions of the relevant tender competition.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1283	I propose to take Questions Nos. 806 to 811, inclusive, 839 and 922 together.I refer to the reply to question No. 162 of 1 March 2012 which sets out the position in relation to the inspection undertaken by the Housing Inspectorate of my Department following an application by the developer of the Priory Hall complex for Floor Area compliance Certificates (FACCs) as introduced by section 72 of the 2004 Finance Act.The Building Control Acts 1990 to 2007 set out a clear statutory framework for construction activity based on:clear legal standards as set out in the Building Regulations;detailed Technical Guidance Documents to outline how these standards can be achieved in practice;the burden and responsibility for compliance resting first and foremost with developers/builders;a statutory responsibility for professionals who are engaged by developers to ensure that construction at least meets the legal minimum standards; andthe responsibility for enforcing compliance with the building regulations resting with the 37 local building control authorities.Where a contract exists between the owner of a building (including a local authority in the case of certain publicly owned buildings) and the relevant builder/developer enforcement may also be a civil matter.The Health and Safety Authority is the national statutory body with responsibility for enforcing occupational health and safety law in places of work (including construction sites).  I have no function in relation to this agency.Local authorities already have extensive powers under the Building Control Acts which they can use to enforce compliance with the Building Regulations.  These include the powers to scrutinise proposals and inspect works in progress; to serve enforcement notices for non-compliance; to institute proceedings for breaches of regulatory requirements; and to seek High Court injunctions if non-compliance poses considerable and serious danger to the public.While a robust system of building control does exist, there are steps that can and must be taken to strengthen the system.  I have very recently released, for public consultation, proposed Building Control (Amendment) Regulations which will provide for(a) the introduction of mandatory certificates of compliance by builders and designers of buildings confirming that the statutory requirements of the Building Regulations have been met; and(b) the lodgement of drawings, at both commencement and completion of construction, demonstrating how the building has been designed and built to comply with all parts of the Building Regulations.Mandatory certification and lodgement of drawings are key reforms which will have the capacity to improve the quality of buildings and will lead to further strengthening of the regulatory regime in 2012.The legal proceedings in relation to Priory Hall are continuing and it would be inappropriate to anticipate their conclusion. The appeal by Dublin City Council against the court order to pay the costs associated with providing alternative accommodation for the residents is expected to be heard by the Supreme Court on 24 April 2012.The overriding priority is to ensure the optimum outcome for the households concerned and to facilitate as early as possible a return to their homes.  In this respect it will be necessary to ensure that these homes are made fit for purpose and that the costs of so doing fall where they should.  I have asked Dublin City Council to do all within its powers to achieve this objective and have asked my Department to continue to liaise closely with Dublin City Council in this regard.

Of this, €6.15 million was used to support the administrative overhead of the regeneration company, Ballymun Regeneration Ltd.  €16.75 million was recouped to meet the ongoing costs of the regeneration programme including construction, demolition, site-reinstatements, public infrastructure including parks, and to support a range of social regeneration investments.  The remaining €4.45 million related to house purchases to facilitate the urgent relocation of households from those blocks and towers that had not been refurbished.  Despite the constraints on capital expenditure across the public sector, my Department continues to prioritise the National Regeneration Programme within the overall housing capital provision for 2012.  To that end, I have made €25 million available for the regeneration programme in Ballymun this year.

Interpretation of the legislation is a matter for legal advice in individual cases and ultimately a matter for the Courts.Under the legislation, an owner of a residential property on the liability date of 1 January 2012 is liable to pay the household charge by 31 March 2012, unless otherwise exempted or entitled to claim a waiver.The Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011 provides for a number of exemptions and waivers from payment of the household charge.The exemptions from payment of the household charge are—Residential properties that are part of the trading stock of a business and have not been sold or been the source of any income since construction,Residential property owned by a Minister of the Government, a housing authority or the Health Service Executive,Voluntary and co-operative housing,Residential property subject to commercial rates and wholly used as a dwelling,Residential property owned by certain charities or discretionary trusts, andResidential property which an owner has vacated due to long-term mental or physical infirmity (e.g. elderly person that has moved into a nursing home).The waivers which apply concern—Owners of residential property entitled to mortgage interest supplement, andOwners of houses in certain unfinished housing estates.The charge applies to residential property situated in the State.  There are no specific exemptions or waivers in the legislation in respect of residential property situated on off-shore islands.I have established an Inter-Departmental Group on Property Tax to consider the structures and modalities for an equitable valuation based property tax.  The Group will complete its work and make recommendations to me shortly. Following consideration of the Group's recommendations, I will bring proposals to Government on the full property tax as soon as possible. It will then be a matter for the Government to decide on the structure and modalities of the full property tax.

The household charge is on a self-assessment basis and it is a matter for an owner of a residential property on the liability date to determine if he/she has a liability and, if so, to declare that liability and pay the household charge.I understand, from data provided by the Local Government Management Agency (LGMA), which is administering the household charge system on a shared service/agency basis for all county and city councils, that as of 26 March 2012, a total of 372,023 properties had been registered for payment of the household charge and 8,545 were registered for a waiver from payment of the household charge.  Some 42,000 properties were registered for the instalment payment option.I understand, from data provided by the LGMA, that as of 16 April, 2012, a total of 660,597 properties had been registered for payment of the household charge.  Some 42,000 properties are availing of the instalment payment option.In addition, 14,655 properties have been registered for a waiver from payment of the household charge.  It is also estimated that there are some 228,500 registrations on hand to be processed, bringing the total number of registrations to over 903,000.

The statement clearly recognises the economic consequences of an over reliance on the property sector.  It signalled a shift to a tenure neutral high level objective, and a clear commitment to restoring balance to the housing sector generally through a lesser reliance on home ownership. The statement also announced the standing down of all affordable housing schemes on the basis that these had been symptoms of, rather than solutions to, an overheated property market. I anticipate that a contract for the full review of Part V will be awarded shortly.In the planning area, the Government will be bringing forward new guidance to planning authorities shortly to update the way in which development contributions schemes are used to capture planning gain. We are also keenly aware of the strong synergy between a balanced, evidence based approach to forward planning and overcoming our economic challenges to prepare for recovery. In this regard, the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act, 2010 has strengthened regional co-ordination and the alignment of planning policies from national to local level,  with the integration of core strategies; local authorities are engaging with the legislation and recognise the need for a plan-led approach for all proposed development. The requirement to include evidence-based core strategies in development plans is essential in rationalising the excessive zoning in some parts of the country, and moving to a position where all zoning is based on a quantifiable need that is community based rather than developer-led.I am committed to a physical planning system that is better supported by:evidence-based requirements linked to key Government strategic policies, e.g. through the National Spatial Strategy and capital allocations;a coherent basis to ensure planning and investment in infrastructure and services are focused on the most suitable locations;tackling the legacy of over-zoning and moving towards a more joined up approach to the delivery of critical services such as schools, public transport, water services and social housing;refocusing on revitalising city and town centres, and discouraging urban sprawl;engaging more directly with elected members at a strategic level by requiring them to bring together, in a concise manner, the key priorities of their development plan; andproviding the necessary certainty about where development will take place.The report of the Mahon Tribunal contains a number of recommendations regarding planning, and these are subject to full consideration by Government, with a view to any further reforms necessary to ensure a fair, open and transparent planning system.

The charge is set at €200 and is being collected by local authorities. The Act places the onus on an owner of residential property to assess his or her liability to the charge on the liability date and, if liable, to declare that liability and to pay the charge in respect of that property by the due date.The Act provides for the application of late payment fees of €20 in respect of each month or part of a month for which the charge remains unpaid after the due date.  In addition, both the €200 charge and any accumulated late payment fees remain as a charge against the property concerned.Section 9 of the Act places collection of the charge under the care and management of local authorities.  It is therefore a matter for each individual local authority to utilise the provisions of the legislation in the context of any undeclared properties that may be identified.   It is understood that local authorities are pursuing those who may have a liability, including those who having paid a charge in a previous year have not done so in subsequent years, and initiating court proceedings, where it is considered appropriate.From information supplied by the Local Government Management Agency on 16 April, 2012, a total of €67.7m has been raised from the charge on non-principal private residences in respect of 2011.

Accordingly, the details sought in the questions are not available in my Department.

Interpretation of the legislation is a matter for legal advice in individual cases and ultimately a matter for the Courts.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1294	Local authority rents are set in accordance with a rent scheme adopted by each housing authority having regard to the broad principles laid down by my Department in Circular letter HRT 3/2002 under Section 58 of Housing Act 1966 (as amended).  The percentage of income varies within and between rent schemes depending on the terms of the scheme and the particular circumstances of the household concerned.  My Department does not have information on the percentage of income collected on rents across the different housing authorities and household types.Section 31 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, when commenced, will replace existing enactments in relation to differential rent schemes.  Regulations and guidelines for housing authorities to give effect to section 31 are currently in preparation in my Department.  When these are made, section 31 will be commenced and authorities will have one year in which to put in place a differential rent scheme under the new provisions.  While it is not the intention to introduce a national standardised differential rent scheme, the regulations to be made will more clearly set out the matters that may be included in a local rents scheme, including — the level, type and sources of household income that may be assessed for rent purposes; how dependents will be accounted for in calculating rent; the manner in which the size, standard, etc., of any class or classes of dwellings are to be taken into account in determining rent, having regard to the market rent in respect of dwellings of similar size, standard, etc., in the administrative area concerned; and procedures for rent reviews.

#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1296	Under the Planning and Development Acts 2000 — 2011, all development, unless specifically exempted under the Acts or associated Regulations, requires planning permission.  Any development that is carried out without planning permission, or that does not comply with the terms of a planning permission, is unauthorised development, and may be subject to enforcement action by a planning authority.  Planning authorities have substantial enforcement powers and duties under the Planning Acts.  A planning authority must issue a warning letter in relation to written complaints regarding unauthorised development, or other unauthorised development it becomes aware of (except in the case of trivial or minor development).  There is also a statutory obligation to carry out an investigation and expeditiously decide whether an enforcement notice should be issued or a court order should be sought, under section 160 of the 2000 Act.  Where a planning authority establishes, following an investigation, that unauthorised development (other than development that is of a trivial or minor nature) has been or is being carried out, and the person who has carried out the development has not proceeded to remedy the position, then the planning authority must issue an enforcement notice or seek a court order, unless there are compelling reasons for not doing so.An application for retention permission is required to be assessed by a planning authority in the same way as any other application, that is, the planning authority is required to consider the proper planning and sustainable development of the area, having regard to the provisions of the development plan, any submissions or observations received, and relevant Ministerial or Government policies, including any guidelines issued by my Department.The facility to apply for retention permission was curtailed in the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2010 which provided that a planning authority may not accept an application for retention permission in respect of a development which would have required that one or more of the following was carried out: an environmental impact assessment; a determination as to whether an environmental impact assessment was required; or an appropriate assessment.The above provision was commenced on 23 March 2011.  Section 57 of the 2010 Act makes provision to allow developments which would have required an environmental impact assessment or an appropriate assessment to be the subject of applications for substitute consent, but only in very limited circumstances e.g. the development had a permission which was found defective by a court or An Bord Pleanála consider that there are exceptional circumstances which warrant the granting of leave to apply for substitute consent.

Unfinished housing developments were divided into four categories as follows: Category one, where the development is still being actively completed by the developer, or where no serious public safety issues exist; Category two, where a receiver has been appointed; Category three, where a receiver has not been appointed and the developer is still in place but effectively inactive; and Category four, where the development has been effectively abandoned and is posing serious problems for residents.Other relevant factors for the purposes of the categorisation process include, inter alia: the state of completion of roads, footpaths, public lighting, piped water and sewerage facilities and open spaces or similar amenities within the development; the extent to which the development complies with the terms of applicable planning permission; the extent to which it complies with the provisions of the Building Control Acts 1990 and 2007; the provisions of the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act 1964 as they pertain to dangerous places and dangerous structures within the meaning of the Act; the extent to which facilities within the development have been taken in charge by the local authority concerned; and  where there is an agreement regarding the maintenance of such facilities, the extent to which this agreement has been complied with.This categorisation formed the basis for the list of those unfinished developments eligible for a waiver on the annual household charge.  Only households in developments in categories three and four are eligible for the waiver from payment of the household charge.  The list of developments in which households are eligible for the waiver in 2012 is set out under the Local Government (Household Charge) Regulations 2012.  The prescribed list of estates to which the waiver applies is the final and complete list for 2012.A revised list of estates will be prescribed for 2013 after which time the waiver for unfinished housing developments will end.  Throughout this period it is anticipated that the numbers of categories 3 and 4 developments will decrease significantly as my Department continues to work with local authorities and other stakeholders to resolve outstanding issues, including through the Public Safety Initiative.In some cases a local authority may have found that conditions in respect of a certain phase of a development were relatively good and that, for example, no serious public safety issues could be identified.  This phase of the development may have been categorised under category 1 or 2.  Conversely, safety issues may have been identified in another phase of the same overall development, or development in that second phase may have been abandoned altogether, implying a category 3 or 4 identification for that phase.

I intend to publish the regulatory impact analysis concerning the regulation of household waste collection subsequent to Government's consideration of the issues.I expect to be in a position to submit final proposals to Government in relation to household waste collection in the coming weeks.  All policy proposals will be carefully considered by Government and will take account of the full range of issues and perspectives, including the impact on rural communities and households.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1314	The Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011 and the Local Government (Household Charge) Regulations 2012 provide the legislative basis for the household charge.Section 2 of the Act sets out the meaning of "residential property" for the purposes of the Act. In particular, section 2(2)(d) of the Act provides that a building that is wholly used as a dwelling (other than a dwelling that forms part of a mixed hereditament within the meaning of the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act 1978), and in respect of which local authority rates are payable, is not a residential property for the purposes of the household charge.While I cannot provide a legal interpretation of the legislation, where there is a commercial premises on the ground floor and a residential property above it, and rates payable on the structure relate to the ground floor with the upper residential section benefitting from a rates allowance, that upper residential section is liable for the household charge under the 2011 Act.The Act places the household charge under the care and management of the local authorities and application in particular circumstances is a matter for the relevant local authority.  The household charge is on a self assessment basis, and interpretation of the legislation is a matter for legal advice in individual cases and ultimately a matter for the Courts.

Given that the nature of the current application is for site investigation purposes only and the drilling of an exploratory well, the fact that it has already been the subject of a public and prescribed bodies consultation process, and that the submissions received under this process and the responses of the applicant to these have been published on my Department's website, I do not consider that a public inquiry is warranted. 
I will consider the recommendation of the Marine Licence Vetting Committee and my Department in due course in making a determination on the licence application.  The determination and supporting documentation will also be published on my Department's website.Without prejudging my eventual determination of the current application, it is important to recognise that should the project progress to commercial exploitation it would be the subject of further formal applications for consents from the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, in the first instance, and then An Bord Pleanála under the Planning Acts, and a full lease or licence under the Foreshore Acts, all of which willrequire an Environmental Impact Assessment, including full public consultation and where appropriate, oral hearing.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1316	Under section 30 of the Planning and Development Acts 2000-2011, I am, as Minister, specifically precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to any particular case, including an enforcement matter, with which a planning authority or An Bord Pleanála is or may be concerned.It is the responsibility of planning authorities to administer the development management process within their area, to provide for proper enforcement of planning control and to take all appropriate steps to ensure that development takes place in compliance with national and EU law.  Enforcement of planning control for unauthorised development is a matter for the planning authority, which can take action where a development requiring planning permission has not obtained this permission, or where permission has not been complied with.  The implementation of the law in individual cases is a matter for the planning authority and ultimately for the courts in any case coming before them.Planning authorities have substantial enforcement powers and obligations under the legislation.  A planning authority may issue an enforcement notice, non-compliance with which is an offence, in connection with unauthorised development (which includes failure to comply with planning conditions) requiring such steps as the authority considers necessary to be taken within a specified period.  If an enforcement notice is not complied with the planning authority may itself take the specified steps and recover the expense incurred in doing so.  A planning authority may seek a court order requiring any particular action to be done or not to be done.  A planning authority may also refuse permission to any developer who has substantially failed to comply with a previous planning permission.The Planning Acts also place clear statutory obligations on planning authorities in relation to unauthorised development.  A planning authority must issue a warning letter in relation to written complaints regarding unauthorised development or other unauthorised development it becomes aware of (except in the case of trivial or minor development).  The planning authority must then carry out an investigation and where it establishes, following such an investigation, that unauthorised development (other than development that is of a trivial or minor nature) has been or is being carried out, and the person who has carried out or is carrying out the development has not proceeded to remedy the position, the planning authority must issue an enforcement notice or make an application for a court order unless there are compelling reasons for not doing so.

In many areas, a number of private sector waste collectors offer competing services to householders, subject to the applicable environmental and other relevant legislation.  Waste collection in Ireland is subject primarily to compliance with the 1996 Act, and the conditions attached to each waste collector's collection permit issued by the relevant local authority under the Waste Management (Collection Permit) Regulations 2007.  Waste collection in individual local authority areas may also be subject to local bye-laws.  As such, local authorities are responsible for local regulation and oversight, including the inspection and enforcement regimes, notwithstanding that many local authorities no longer collect household waste.  Such functions are shared between the elected members and the executive.  For example, the making of bye-laws is a reserved function. The Programme for Government commits to the development of a coherent national waste policy, adhering to the waste hierarchy, which will aim to minimise waste disposal in landfill and maximise recovery.  I expect to be in a position to submit final proposals in this regard to Government in the coming weeks.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1318	The Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) is administering the household charge system on a shared service/agency basis for all county and city councils.  I understand, from data provided by the LGMA, that as of 16 April, 2012, a total of 675,252 property declarations have been processed by the household charge bureau.  660,597 registered for payment of the charge and 14,655 residential property owners have registered for a waiver from payment of the charge.  In addition, 188,500 postal applications have been received in the household charge bureau and a further 40,000 declarations have been received by local authorities which have yet to be processed. This gives a total number of over 903,000 declarations made.The household charge is on a self-assessment basis and it is a matter for an owner of a residential property on the liability date of 1 January, 2012 to determine if he/she has a liability and, if so, that person is required to declare that liability and to pay the household charge.The Act further provides for offences where a person contravenes the statutory requirements.  In addition, late payment penalties apply where payment is not made by the due date and household charges and any associated late payment penalties are a charge against the property which will have to be discharged in the event of the sale or transfer of the property concerned.Section 12 of the Act provides that it is a function of each local authority to collect household charges, late payment fees and late payment interest due to it and to deal with matters associated with such collection.  I will be keeping the income being generated from the household charge under constant review and I and local authorities will take any necessary measures, as appropriate, in regard to compliance with the legislation.The following table sets out the numbers registered for the household charge on a county/city basis.  This breakdown shows the number of households that have been registered to date against an estimate of the number of households liable to the household charge.  The 228,500 declarations yet to be processed are not included in this table as a county/city breakdown is not as yet available in respect of these.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1320	My Department does not have a role in regulating fuel standards from a consumer perspective in terms of quality assurance or the operational performance of the fuel.  My Department's responsibility for fuel quality standards arise from the perspective of ensuring that petrol and diesel sold in the State meet prescribed environmental specifications to reduce the polluting effect that certain substances have on the environment, when emitted to air as part of the fuel combustion process.Directive 98/70/EC relating to the quality of petrol and diesel fuels is transposed in Ireland through the European Communities Act, 1972 (Environmental Specifications for Petrol, Diesel Fuels and Gas Oils for use by non-road mobile machinery, including inland waterway vessels, agricultural and forestry tractors, and recreational craft) Regulations 2011.  As required by the Directive, Ireland reports annually to the European Commission the results of a sampling programme for both petrol and diesel, including any breaches of the environmental specifications of the fuel.  Ireland’s latest results, which were submitted to the Commission on 30 June 2011, indicated that fuel sold in the State during 2010 was predominantly compliant with the environmental specifications set out in Irish legislation.  The Commission collates the data received from Member States and publishes annual reports, which are available to download from the Commission’s website: http://ec.europa.eu/environment/air/transport/fuel-quality-monitoring.htm
Sampling of the fuel is carried out by officers of the Revenue Commissioners and the samples are analysed by the State Laboratory. In addition, the Irish Petroleum Industry Association (IPIA) contracts an independent laboratory to sample and analyse fuel and the results of that process are included in Ireland's report to the Commission.

Interpretation of the legislation is a matter for legal advice in individual cases and ultimately a matter for the Courts.Both Acts contain common provisions dealing with the situation where a person who is the sole owner of a residential property dies.  The legislation provides that the personal representative of the deceased person is not, in respect of that residential property, liable to pay the household charge or the charge on non-principal private residences relating to a year in which the liability falls after the date of death of the deceased person and before the date of issue of a grant of representation to the estate of the deceased person.The specific provisions are contained in section 4(3) of the Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011 and, in relation to the charge on non-principal private residences, in section 4(7) of the Local Government (Charges) Act 2009, as amended.In addition, both Acts provide that where a person who is the sole owner of a residential property dies and, at the date of his or her death, a household charge or a charge on non-principal private residence (and any related late payment penalties) remains unpaid in relation to that property, no  further late payment penalties are payable in relation to that property until a grant of representation to the estate of the deceased person issues to the personal representative of such deceased person.The personal representative of such deceased person is, as soon as a grant of representation to the estate of the deceased person issues to him or her, liable to pay to the relevant local authority the full amount due and owing by the deceased, at the date of his or her death, in respect of the household charge or the charge on non-principal private residences and any related late payment penalties.Where the full amount owing is paid by the personal representative within 3 months of the date of issue of the grant of representation to the estate of the deceased, he or she has no further liability.Where the full amount owing is not paid by the personal representative within 3 months of the date of issue of the grant of representation to the estate of the deceased, he or she is liable to pay late payment penalties, in addition to the full amount, from the date of issue of the grant of representation to the estate of the deceased.These provisions are contained in section 7(3)-7(6) of the Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011 and section 6(3)-6(6) of the Local Government (Charges) Act 2009, as amended.

At the request of Sligo County Council, I met with a delegation from the Council on 31 January 2012 to discuss its financial position, including its adopted 2012 budget.  My Department continues to be in on-going consultation with the Council in relation to these matters.I can confirm that a request for sanction to increase Sligo County Council's current overdraft facility from €11 million to €14 million was received by my Department on 26 March 2012.  Following discussions between my Department and the Council, it was agreed that an increase in the current overdraft limit was not required immediately. I have conveyed my sanction for the continuation of the current overdraft limit of €11 million and this is to be kept under regular review.In addition, I understand that Sligo County Council is to engage an independent financial consultant to prepare a report on the authority's financial position and present options for consideration and decision by the elected members.  This report will inform and advise the Council members and management on possible ways forward in dealing with the challenging financial circumstances of the Council.My Department has been consulted on the terms of reference for the review and I have asked to be provided with a copy of the report when it is complete.

This Report, entitled Health Effects of Electromagnetic Fields, which considered issues such as digital signals, microwaves and mobile phone masts, is available for download on my Department’s website (www.environ.ie).  The Expert Group reported that the majority scientific opinion was that no adverse short or long term effects have been demonstrated from exposure to electromagnetic fields at levels below the limits recommended by the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection (ICNIRP).  However, extensive international research on the issue continues to be coordinated through bodies such as the World Health Organisation.The Department will continue to monitor this and other scientific evidence as it is made available, and will consider any policy implications in this context.

This condition applies for a period after sale prescribed by the Minister, which, in the case of the 1995 tenant purchase scheme, is 20 years.  Under section 90(12) of the 1966 Act, a housing authority may refuse to consent to the resale of a tenant purchase dwelling during this period where, in the authority's opinion — (i) the intended purchaser is not a person in need of housing, or (ii) the intended purchaser is or has been engaged in antisocial behaviour or that the intended sale of the dwelling would not be in the interest of good estate management, or (iii) the intended sale would, if completed, leave the seller or any person who might reasonably be expected to reside with him or her without adequate housing.These measures are necessary to ensure that the interests of the local community and the housing authority are taken into account in the resale of a local authority dwelling within a reasonable period after tenant purchase and I have no proposals to change the law in this area.

Such decisions are made in the context of the local development strategy of the individual groups and in line with Departmental operating rules and EU regulations.There are a number of systems in place at both Departmental and LAG level to ensure that funding approved and delivered through the Rural Development Programme is managed in an efficient and effective way and is also verifiably correct.  My Department has been in contact with Mayo North East LEADER Partnership (MNELP), the LAG for the area, with regard to the project referred to in the question.Funding for the project was approved by MNELP and the LAG is now in the process of ensuring that all the documentation in respect of the claim for payment in respect of the completed project is in order.  Once the documentation is finalised, and the LAG is satisfied that all is in order, the LAG will request a drawdown of RDP funds from my Department.  Any claim for payment once received by my Department will be subject to my Department's own verification processes.

Interpretation of the legislation is a matter for legal advice in individual cases and ultimately a matter for the Courts.Section 3(4) of the Act provides that where a residential property is owned by two or more persons, those persons shall be jointly and severally liable to pay the household charge in respect of that property.  Payment of the household charge by one co-owner will discharge the liability of each co-owner to pay the household charge.Regulation 5 of the Local Government (Household Charge) Regulations 2012 provides for the making of the household charge declaration.  In particular, Article (2)(d) provides that the personal public service number of the person who, in the case of an individual, is the owner of the property, shall be included in the declaration.I have established an Inter-Departmental Group on Property Tax to consider the structures and modalities for an equitable valuation based property tax.  The Group will complete its work and make recommendations to me shortly.  Following consideration of the Group's recommendations, I will bring proposals to Government on the full property tax as soon as possible.

I will disburse monies back to local authorities in general-purpose grants, making it possible for me to equalise distribution, and ensuring that those local authorities with lower populations than others do not suffer unduly as a result.General Purpose Grants contribute to meeting the difference between the cost to local authorities of providing a reasonable level of services and the income available to them from local sources and from specific grants.  The two principle sources of revenue for the Local Government Fund are the proceeds of motor tax and the income from the Household Charge.General purpose grants from the Local Government Fund are structured to bring about equalisation, over time, so that each authority will have sufficient resources, either from central grants or from its local income base, to provide a reasonable level of day to day services to its customers.  For the purposes of allocations, a range of factors is taken into account, including each local authority's expenditure on, and income from, its services, and the overall amount of funding available for distribution.

The Act sets out the law relating to the rights and obligations of tenants and landlords in the sector covering, inter alia,   security of tenure and the termination of tenancies.  Under the Act a tenancy includes any periodic or fixed term tenancy whether oral, written or implied and a tenancy agreement includes an oral tenancy agreement.The maximum duration of a tenancy under the Act is four years, after which a new tenancy must be registered with the Board.  Where a tenant has been in occupation of a dwelling for a continuous period of 6 months, and no notice of termination has been served in respect of the tenancy before the expiry of the period of 6 months, the tenancy continues in being for the remainder of the four year period and this is referred to in the Act as a Part 4 tenancy.  A landlord may not serve a notice of termination on such a tenant except in very clearly defined circumstances such as a failure by the tenant to comply with his or her obligations in relation to the tenancy, where the landlord intends to sell the property within 3 months after the termination of the tenancy or where the landlord requires the dwelling for his or her own occupation or for that of a family member.The employment status of a tenant has no impact on the tenant's legal rights to remain in the tenancy for the remainder of the Part 4 tenancy and any changes in that status cannot be used by a landlord as grounds for termination of a Part 4 tenancy.

Unfinished housing developments were divided into four categories as follows:Category one, where the development is still being actively completed by the developer, or where no serious public safety issues exist;Category two, where a receiver has been appointed;Category three, where a receiver has not been appointed and the developer is still in place but effectively inactive; andCategory four, where the development has been effectively abandoned and is posing serious problems for residents.Other relevant factors for the purposes of the categorisation process include, inter alia:the state of completion of roads, footpaths, public lighting, piped water and sewerage facilities and open spaces or similar amenities within the development;the extent to which the development complies with the terms of applicable planning permission;the extent to which it complies with the provisions of the Building Control Acts 1990 and 2007;the provisions of the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act 1964 as they pertain to dangerous places and dangerous structures within the meaning of the Act;the extent to which facilities within the development have been taken in charge by the local authority concerned; andwhere there is an agreement regarding the maintenance of such facilities, the extent to which this agreement has been complied with.This categorisation formed the basis for the list of those unfinished developments eligible for a waiver on the annual household charge.  Only households in developments in categories three and four are eligible for the waiver from payment of the household charge.  The waiver was not intended to apply to developments where a developer is in place who carries the responsibility for completing the works, or where a receiver has been appointed in this regard. The list of developments in which households are eligible for the waiver in 2012 is set out under the Local Government (Household Charge) Regulations 2012.  The prescribed list of estates to which the waiver applies is the final and complete list for 2012.A revised list of estates will be prescribed for 2013 after which time the waiver for unfinished housing developments will end.  Throughout this period it is anticipated that the numbers of categories 3 and 4 developments will decrease significantly as my Department continues to work with local authorities and other stakeholders to resolve outstanding issues, including through the Public Safety Initiative.In some cases a local authority may have found that conditions in respect of a certain phase of a development were relatively good and that, for example, no serious public safety issues could be identified.  This phase of the development may have been categorised under category 1 or 2. Conversely, safety issues may have been identified in another phase of the same overall development, or development in that second phase may have been abandoned altogether, implying a category 3 or 4 identification for that phase.

The Preliminary Report will make recommendations on the works to be completed and will outline the costs involved.Until the Preliminary Report is completed it will not be possible to say what elements of the sewer network in Malahide will be upgraded or what contribution my Department might make to the cost of the work.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1338	The Building Regulations 1997 to 2011 provide for the safety and wellbeing of persons in and around buildings (including dwellings).  The legal requirements are set out in twelve parts (classified as A to M) in the Second Schedule to the Regulations.  Technical Guidance Documents are published to accompany each part in order to outline how the legal requirements can be achieved in practice.In line with the Building Control Act 1990 the responsibility for compliance with the Building Regulations rests first and foremost with the owner and builder of the building.  Enforcement of the Regulations is the responsibility of the local building control authority in whose functional area the building is situated which in this case is the Building Control Authority in Longford County Council.  There is a five year limit from the date of completion of the dwelling within which the Building Control Authority can bring enforcement proceedings for failure to comply with the requirements of the Building Regulations.Where building defects occur, their remediation is a matter for the parties concerned, namely the building owner, the relevant builder and the builder's insurers, in line with any contractual arrangements agreed between the parties.The National House Builders' Guarantee Scheme (NHBGS) which operates the Homebond Warranty Scheme is a private limited company providing structural guarantees for new houses registered by the builder/developer and, since November 2008, the HomeBond Insurance Scheme is underwritten by Allianz Insurance.  As in the case of any private company, the operations of HomeBond are a matter for its management and Board of Directors and I have no function in relation to how it deals with its inspections or claims.

However, I understand that Longford County Council intend to submit a proposal under my Department's Improvement Works Programme in respect of McKeon Park, Longford. Having regard to the existing high level of commitments under the programme, it is not possible to approve the proposal submitted by Longford Town Council in respect of the Springlawn Estate at this time.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1341	Fire services are provided by the 37 statutorily designated fire authorities.  The provision of a fire service in its functional area, including the establishment and maintenance of a fire brigade, the assessment of fire cover needs, the provision of a premises and the making of such other provisions as it considers necessary or desirable, is a statutory function of individual fire authorities under Section 10 of the Fire Services Act 1981.The national blueprint for the future development of the fire services, including improvements in efficiency and effectiveness, is set out in the Irish Fire Services National Development Framework 2010-2015.  The Framework sets out policies and key actions in the areas of Fire Services Role in Society; National Processes and Guidance on Standards; Staff Learning and Development; Quality Assurance Systems and Reporting Performance; and Service Infrastructure and legislative support.  The Framework was developed and approved under the aegis of the Management Board of the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management, which is also managing the implementation of its actions.In 2011 the Management Board of the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management decided two priority projects should be progressed  and these are now the subject of consultation with a range of stakeholders.  The first draft document concerns an integrated approach to efficient fire safety in Ireland titled: “Keeping Communities Safe”.  The primary objective of the draft policy is maintaining and improving public safety, through achieving an appropriate balance between prevention of fires, having appropriate fire protection facilities in place in buildings and through fire brigade response measures.  The second draft document is a review of the Computer Aided Mobilisation Project (CAMP).  CAMP provides a computer aided call taking and mobilisation service for members of the public seeking the assistance of the emergency services.  Following this stakeholder consultation, it is intended that the finalised policy documents will be completed by the end of summer 2012, and “Keeping Communities Safe” will then be circulated to all fire authorities for implementation.  I expect that each fire authority will review its approach to fire safety in light of the guidance and recommendations in the document, and plan for any adjustments in current arrangements.As regards the CAMP project, following consideration of comments received, a revised document in the form of a final report will be prepared for the National Directorate's Management Board.Both the CAMP and "Keeping Communities Safe" draft documents are available on my Department's website at www.environ.ie via the “Public Consultations” link which can be found on the home page under the heading “Popular Topics and Quicklinks”.Fire Services will continue to be developed by the local authorities having regard to both of the service priorities referred to above, including the need to maximise effectiveness and efficiency, and taking account of the resources available.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1342	I am chairing the National Co-ordination Committee on Unfinished Housing Developments to oversee implementation of the Report of the Advisory Group on Unfinished Housing Developments, together with the Government's response to the recommendations.  The Committee includes representatives from the Irish Banking Federation, local authorities, the Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency, NAMA and the construction sector.  The Committee is meeting on a regular basis with the aim of publishing a report on progress achieved within the next 12 months.  In the meantime, work is ongoing on implementation of the Report of the Advisory Group and real progress is already being made with regard to the public safety works required to improve the living conditions of existing residents on some unfinished estates.While planning authorities are making progress in securing the co-operation of developers, financial institutions and/or bond holders, thereby obviating the need to use Exchequer resources to fund such work the ongoing work of the Committee includes an assessment of the framework for the operation of bonds.  This is taking account of existing legislative provisions, statutory guidance and practical experience in the operation of bonds in order to determine what further policy advice and action are necessary in this regard.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1343	The Water Services Investment Programme 2010-2013 provides for the development of a comprehensive range of new water services infrastructure in County Longford. The Longford Sewerage Scheme is included in the Programme as a scheme to advance through planning.  I understand that Longford County Council is in the process of procuring Consulting Engineers to prepare a Preliminary Report for the scheme. As part of the preparation of the Preliminary Report, the Consulting Engineer will examine the feasibility of providing a sewerage collection in the South Eastern Environs of Longford Town which includes Feraghfad.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1344	Development contributions have been an important addition to the capital funding resources of local authorities but they are only one element and local authorities generate capital income from a variety of sources including grants.  In addition, limited debt finance is available to local authorities as necessary to finance their capital investment.The adoption of development contribution schemes is a reserved function of the elected members of local authorities.  My Department provides a policy guidance framework for development contributions which is designed to draw the attention of local authorities to their obligations under the legislation, while also recognising that the adoption of development contribution schemes remains a reserved function.  Further draft guidance which will reflect current economic conditions is currently being prepared for public consultation.  My Department will continue to work closely with local authorities, including Westmeath and Longford County Councils, on this and other matters.

The Programme is administered directly by the European Commission and funding is allocated to projects on merit in accordance with established criteria and following rigorous assessment by the Commission.  As funding is provided directly by the Commission, the question of county by county allocations does not arise.To date, five Irish projects have qualified for funding totalling almost €5.5 million under the EU LIFE+ Programme.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1347	A concessionary rate of motor tax for motor caravans was introduced in 1998.  I understand that the rationale behind the introduction of the concessionary rate was that, while motor caravans are generally less in use than many other categories of vehicle, rates of motor tax were relatively high.  The average engine capacity of a motor caravan was estimated at 2.5 litres and the motor tax for an engine of that capacity was significantly higher than the tax being paid by owners of motor caravans in the United Kingdom.I understand it was also considered that a concessionary annual rate of tax for motor caravans would encourage tourism and tourist related activities, not least by facilitating more out-of-season use of motor caravans, where previously owners may have taxed and used the vehicle for only three months of the year due to cost.  Concessionary rates of tax (€99 or less) are available on an annual basis only and not quarterly or half-yearly.

#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1348	Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is the process by which the anticipated effects on the environment of a proposed development or project are examined.  The document produced to facilitate this process is known as an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS).EIA requirements derive from Directive 85/337/EEC (EIA Directive) on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment, as amended, which has been transposed into Irish law primarily by means of the European Communities (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 1989 to 1999 and also, more generally, through various legislation providing for relevant consents in respect of projects.In each such consent system, which is governed by separate legislation, a competent authority is identified as the body responsible for examining the EIS, including its compliance with the EIA Directive, as amended.  The competent authority then makes its decision to refuse or grant permission for the development or project, having regard to the information contained in the EIS, among other factors.  For example, the competent authority in respect of land use consent is the local planning authority and/or An Bord Pleanála; in the case of petroleum and gas extraction, it is the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.In effect, no single body is responsible for examining EISs to ensure, inter alia, their compliance with the EIA Directive, as amended; rather, this responsibility is appropriately assigned to a defined competent authority in the context of each relevant statutory consent system.

In excess of €62 million has been made available for the various housing programmes in the Dublin City Council area.  Of this, €660,000 has been allocated for necessary adaptations and extensions to meet the needs of tenants of local authority houses.  The administration of this funding and the selection of properties for upgrading is entirely a matter for Dublin City Council.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1353	My Department manages the Seniors Alert Scheme which encourages and assists the community's support for older people by means of a community-based grant scheme to improve the security of people over 65 years of age.The Scheme is administered by local community and voluntary groups with the support of my Department.In 2011, grant support was available towards the purchase and installation of personal monitored alert systems (pendant alarms) and other items to improve the safety and security of the home (including monitored smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, internal emergency lighting and external security lighting).Due to unprecedented demand for grant assistance under the Seniors Alert Scheme in 2011, the budget allocation of €2.35m was expended by the end of November 2011; there were a significant number of grant applications received in December 2011 that the Seniors Alert Unit was unable to grant-aid until the receipt of the budget allocation for 2012.A significant portion of the 2012 budget allocation (€2.35m) was spent early in 2012 as a result of this unprecedented demand.  The Seniors Alert Unit is also continually registering Community and Voluntary groups who wish to administer the Scheme and this will further increase the demand for funding in 2012.As a result, my Department examined the operation of the scheme with the aim of ensuring its sustainability and an equitable distribution of funding country-wide. The following temporary changes were notified to groups on 26 March 2012, and took effect from 30 March 2012:Funding will only be available for the purchase and installation of socially monitored alarms at a maximum of €250 per alarm (Maximum funding of €50 is also available for additional pendants and reinstallations).Grants to Community and Voluntary groups will be capped at €30,000 per annum.The aim of the Seniors Alert Scheme is to support independent living for those over 65 who live alone or who live with a person who is also over 65 years of age and of limited financial means.  A key element of the Scheme is the provision of funding for a socially monitored alarm which supports this independence.  Having regard to available funding in the current economic climate, the changes above will ensure that my Department can continue to maintain the Scheme in a viable way and provide the maximum number of socially monitored alarms to as many older persons as possible in 2012.The temporary changes made under the Scheme will be monitored on an on-going basis and may be revised later in the year in light of the overall demand for funding relative to the budget allocation for 2012.

The costs arising are a matter for the LGMA and the county and city councils.I have established an Inter-Departmental Group on Property Tax to consider the structures and modalities for an equitable valuation based property tax.  The Group will complete its work and make recommendations to me shortly.  Following consideration of the Group's recommendations, I will bring proposals to Government on the full property tax as soon as possible. It will then be a matter for the Government to decide on the structure and modalities of the full property tax.

Within that framework, local returning officers are responsible for all matters in connection with the actual conduct of elections and referendums, including the selection, appointment and training of polling station and count staff in accordance with the relevant provisions of electoral law.To assist returning officers, my Department issues guidance to them in advance of each election and referendum.  The guidance emphasises that the smooth conduct of polls is dependent on maintaining a cadre of sufficiently skilled and experienced people.  Having regard to that overall objective, returning officers are advised to employ competent and efficient persons as polling staff and asked to give consideration, where possible, to employing suitable persons who are unemployed.

My Department is currently in consultation with the voluntary housing sector, through the Irish Council for Social Housing, with regard to the development of an enabling regulatory framework that will support the expanded role for the sector foreseen in the Government's housing policy statement of June 2011.  In developing this framework, my Department will, inter alia, examine a range of issues around making best use of the significant equity inherent in the voluntary housing stock, including how some of this equity might be released to leverage additional new supply, including through the sale of voluntary houses to tenants. 
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1361	The Local Government (Charges) Act 2009, as amended, which sets out the detail of the charge, is premised on a universal liability for residential property in respect of the charge.  It exempts certain buildings and owners from this liability, the most important exemption being where a property is occupied by the owner as his or her sole or main residence on the liability date.Interpretation of the legislation is a matter for legal advice in individual cases and ultimately a matter for the Courts.Section 4(6) of the Act includes an exemption for property in which a relative of the owner is living rent-free, as long as that residence is on the same property or within two kilometres of the owner's main residence.  This provision was intended principally to cater for situations in which accommodation might be provided for an elderly parent by a son or daughter, and follows precedent from Revenue legislation dealing with the home carer tax credit.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1363	New emissions based Vehicle Registration Tax and motor tax systems were introduced in 2008 in order to influence the future purchasing decisions of car buyers.  The owners of vehicles registered prior to 1 July 2008 continue to pay motor tax on the basis of engine capacity.  Both systems of charging are based on a graduated scale, with vehicles with lower emissions or smaller engine capacity attracting lower rates of taxation than those with higher emissions or larger engine capacity.The question of applying the new CO2 based motor tax system to all cars was subject to detailed discussion during the debate on the Motor Vehicle (Duties and Licences) Act 2008.  Any retrospection would not be possible, as the CO2 data for the pre-2008 car fleet have not been authenticated for business purposes.  The cost of any retrospection could be substantial were it possible, depending on how it applied, and could have direct implications for the revenue base of local government.Continuing improvements in vehicle manufacturing technology are contributing to an increasing number of vehicles with lower carbon emissions.  The average CO2 emissions of a new passenger car in the EU were 140.3 gCO2/km in 2010, 5.4 gCO2/km (3.7%) less than in 2009 when average emissions were 145.7 gCO2/km.  More than 60% of all new cars sold in the EU in 2010 have emissions of 140 g/km or less, compared to only 23% in 2003.  This is reflected in Irish buying trends — 81% of new vehicles purchased in 2010 fell into the two lowest CO2 bands A and B, with emissions less than 140g CO2/km.  In 2011, 91% of new vehicles fell into those two bands and indications to date in 2012 are that a similar percentage will apply.

The LGMSB and the LGCSB were subsequently placed on a primary legislative footing under the Local Government Services (Corporate Bodies) (Confirmation of Orders) Act 2008.Under the terms of the Local Government Management Services Board (Establishment) Order 1996 (S.I. No. 410 of 1996), the Board is made up of not less than four and not more than ten qualified persons appointed by the Council, and such officers of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government as the Minister shall appoint from time to time.  A qualified person is a manager or assistant manager of a county borough or the personnel officer of the Right Honourable Lord Mayor, Aldermen and Burgesses of Dublin, or a manager or assistant manager for the purposes of the County Management Acts 1940 to 1994.  The Council is made up of the persons who are for the time being qualified persons.Under the terms of the Local Government Computer Services Board (Establishment) Order 1975 (S.I. No. 212 of 1975), the Board is made up of not more than eight and not less than six qualified persons appointed by the Council, not more than two serving officers of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government appointed by the Minister, and one serving officer of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform appointed by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  A qualified person means a manager or assistant manager of a county borough, or a manager or assistant manager for the purposes of the County Management Acts 1940 to 1994.  The Council is made up of the persons who are for the time being qualified persons.The Local Government Management Services Board and the Local Government Computer Services Board are merging as the Local Government Management Agency. A single Chief Executive and joint management arrangements are currently in place.Both boards comprise the same membership with the addition of one Ministerial nominee, on the LGMSB, and a representative from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the LGCSB.  Board meetings and Audit Committee meetings are held jointly and recorded in accordance with governance requirements.  There is no duplication of any sub-committee and all committees report to the joint Board meeting.The dissolution of the LGMSB and the LGCSB, as well as the statutory establishment of the Local Government Management Agency will be facilitated by the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2012, which is due to be published in the current Dáil session.

The main objectives of the RDP are to improve the quality of life in rural areas and facilitate the diversification of the rural economy.  The RDP is designed to address directly many of the challenges facing rural communities including the need to increase economic activity and stimulate job creation; improve access to basic services for rural dwellers and encourage rural tourism based on sustainable development of natural resources.  The programme is inclusive in its approach to arriving at solutions to such challenges using a "bottom up method" where local communities provide local solutions.In general, the rates of grant aid available under the measures of the RDP are 50% for private promoters and 75% for Community promoters with some higher rates available for specific activities such as Training (100%) and Analysis and Development (90%).  In the current economic climate, it has been difficult for private individuals and community groups to obtain the matched funding required to avail of this support level, particularly for larger projects.As part of a suite of measures to address these and other issues relating to the delivery of the RDP my Department is proposing to increase the rates of aid available to both private promoters and community groups.  Such changes require the approval of the European Commission and the programme change request has already been submitted to the RDP Monitoring Committee for onward submission to the Commission for consideration.  The result of this process will be communicated to all Local Development Companies as soon as possible.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1371	My Department is actively working to ensure that services in Gaeltacht areas previously provided by MFG can be maintained.With regard to the Local and Community Development Programme (LCDP), which is administered on behalf of my Department by Pobal, interim arrangements have recently been put in place whereby funding for LCDP activities in Gaeltacht areas will be administered through contiguous Local Development Companies (LDCs) for an initial six month period, subject to a review of progress after 3 months.  The LDCs have been advised that the LCDP services must continue to be delivered to communities in an effective and coherent manner, through the medium of Irish, in the short/medium term, pending a longer term solution for Gaeltacht service delivery.  The LDCs have been asked to prioritise the planning for this work by liaising with both Pobal and Údarás na Gaeltachta on how the work of the LCDP delivery to the Gaeltacht areas can be achieved.My Department's objective is to have LCDP actions delivered to these areas within the next four weeks. In the majority of cases agreement has now been reached between Pobal and the LDCs on the inclusion and implementation of LCDP actions for their particular Gaeltacht areas. These actions are now included in the LDCs Annual Work Plan for 2012.In the context of the delivery of the Rural Development Programme (RDP) significant progress has been made and project promoters with fully completed contracts were contacted during the week ending 2 March 2012 with a view to verifying project information in order to facilitate payment of outstanding amounts. Once this verification process is fully complete the LDCs contiguous to the MFG Gaeltacht areas will form part of an interim system of payment in the short term.  My Department expects to facilitate payment of verified projects in the coming weeks.In the context of the delivery of Axes 3 and 4 (LEADER) of the Rural Development Programme in Gaeltacht areas in the longer term my Department is currently examining the submissions received as part of an overall process commenced in March 2012 which requested expressions of interest from established LDCs to deliver the LEADER elements of the RDP in MFG areas for the remainder of the Programming period.

I am satisfied that these provisions, supplemented by the specific and detailed guidance to planning authorities on wind energy development set out in the Department's Wind Energy Development Guidelines, published on 29 June 2006, provide a sufficiently comprehensive framework for public consultation in respect of large-scale wind farm developments.  I will continue to keep these and the suite of planning guidelines under review to ensure that they meet best practice and current policy advice.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1373	I propose to take Questions Nos. 923 and 924 together.The Building Regulations set out the legal requirements for the design and construction of buildings, including dwellings.  Compliance with the Regulations is the responsibility of the owner or builder of a building.  Enforcement of the Regulations is the responsibility of the 37 local building control authorities who are empowered to carry out inspections and initiate enforcement proceedings, where considered necessary.Part H of the Second Schedule to the Building Regulations 1997 to 2011 sets out the requirements for the disposal of foul and surface water. The related Technical Guidance Document (TGD H 2011) provides guidance on how these requirements can be achieved in practice.In relation to the use of septic tanks in particular, TGD H states that "Septic Tanks must conform to I.S. EN 12566 Part 1 or 4 including their national annexes and comply with the EPA Code of Practice — Section 7."The national annexes were recently completed and published by NSAI, in consultation with my Department and others. They set out clearly the performance required by septic tanks when used in Ireland, and tested in accordance with I.S. EN 12566 Part 1 or 4.Under the EU Construction Products Directive, any product tested to a harmonised standard can be put on the market in a Member State, including Ireland.   While it is not possible to indicate the number of septic tank units so tested by approved testing bodies throughout the EU, my Department is currently aware of four septic tank units which have been tested for, and declared to be in compliance with, current Irish performance standards.

The Programme includes contracts under construction and to commence to the value of some €29 million in Limerick during the period of the Programme.  However, the Bruff Sewerage Scheme was not amongst the priority contracts and schemes selected for inclusion in the current Programme.The Programme aims to prioritise projects that target environmental compliance issues and support economic and employment growth.  A key input to the development of the Programme was the assessment of needs prepared by local authorities, including Limerick County Council, in response to my Department's request to the authorities in 2009 to review and prioritise their proposals for new capital works in their areas.  These were subsequently appraised in the Department in the context of the funds available and key criteria that complemented those used by the authorities. Inevitably, through this process, certain projects that had been proposed had to give way to others that were more strategically important at that time.Progress under the Water Services Investment Programme was reviewed in mid-2011 and through this process, consideration was given to any newly emerging priority contracts and schemes submitted by local authorities for addition to the Programme.  No proposal for the Bruff Sewerage Scheme was received from Limerick County Council in response to the review process.

The services of the Money Advice and Budgeting Service are also available to such borrowers and support is available through the Supplementary Welfare Allowance Scheme.Section 34 of Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 provides local authorities with powers to deal flexibly with distressed borrowers. My Department issued comprehensive guidance to local authorities on the treatment of mortgage arrears, including local authority mortgages for shared ownership transactions, in March 2010. That guidance was closely based on the Central Bank's first statutory Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears   to ensure that cases of local authority mortgage arrears are handled in a manner that is sympathetic to the needs of the particular household, while also protecting the position of the local authority concerned.To reflect the content of the Central Bank's revised Code of Conduct and provide a further suite of options for the sympathetic treatment of mortgage arrears by local authorities my Department is currently preparing updated guidance to local authorities in consultation with the City and County Managers Association. I anticipate that this guidance will be made available to local authorities before the summer recess.

General purpose grants are my Department's contribution towards meeting the cost to local authorities of providing a reasonable level of services to their customers.Some €651m in general purpose grants has been allocated to local authorities for 2012.  In addition, local authorities will retain some €77 million in pension related deductions in 2012.  I am satisfied that the general purpose allocations provided for 2012, together with the income available from other sources, will enable local authorities to provide a reasonable level of services to their customers.Local authorities cost and income bases vary significantly from one another and calculating an appropriate distribution of these grants is complex.  General purpose grants from the Local Government Fund are structured to bring about equalisation over time; that is a position of balance where the financial needs of local authorities are met by their resources and they are able to provide an appropriate level of service to their customers.In determining these grants a number of factors are taken into account including the overall funding available for this purpose, the estimated cost to each authority of providing a reasonable level of services to their customers, the income each authority should generate from local sources and the necessity to provide each authority with a baseline allocation that will support its financial stability.The information requested is set out in the tables:General Purpose Grant

The charge is set at €200 and liability for it falls, in the main, on owners of rental, holiday and vacant properties.Under the Act, it is a function of a local authority to collect non-principal private residence charges and late payment fees due to it and all charges and late payment fees imposed and payable to a local authority are under the care and management of the local authority concerned.  In this regard, application of the legislation in particular circumstances is a matter for the relevant local authority.  Interpretation of the legislation is a matter for legal advice in individual cases and ultimately a matter for the Courts.I have recently issued guidelines to local authorities in relation to the operation of the "care and management" provisions of the legislation in the context of individual situations where genuine hardship in having to discharge a liability in a single payment can be demonstrated.  In such cases, the guidelines set out the modalities for local authorities in entering into payment arrangements for the discharge of outstanding liabilities in instalments over a specified period.

In the current economic climate, it has been difficult for private individuals and community groups to obtain the matched funding required to avail of support under the programme, particularly for larger projects.As part of a suite of measures to address these and other issues relating to the delivery of the RDP my Department has recently submitted a number of proposals to the European Commission regarding possible RDP Programme amendments, one of which will allow Local Authorities to act as project promoters eligible to apply for the community rate of aid. It will be a requirement that any applications for funding from a Local Authority will be in partnership with a community group. This amendment, coupled with a proposed rate of aid change, will reduce the matching and bridging funding required from community groups, thereby increasing the likely uptake under the Programme. It is also envisaged that the assistance provided by the Local Authority will result in communities moving forward with projects they would not otherwise have considered due to the workload involved and the detailed plans required for some projects of a very complex nature.All programme changes require the approval of the European Commission and  its decision is awaited.  All Local Development Companies will be notified of the outcome as soon as possible.

The statement is below for the Deputy's information.
Minister Shatter announces extension of Irish Short-stay Visa Waiver Programme

The Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence, Mr. Alan Shatter, T.D., today announced that he has secured Government agreement for the extension of the Irish Short-stay Visa Waiver Programme for a further period of four years. This initiative, introduced for the first time last year, was welcomed as a very positive step in encouraging visitors to Ireland.

The programme had originally been due to last until the end of October this year but on consideration of a review of the Programme, the Government agreed to extend its duration.

The Minister also announced the following changes to the Programme:

Bosnia and Herzegovina will be added to the existing list of 16 countries already covered by the Programme.

As a further measure to encourage tourism, the fee for visas will be waived for long-term residents from the countries covered by the Programme who live in the Schengen area. This will be reviewed after six months.

The Minister stated that he was delighted that the Government had agreed to the extension of the Programme. “There has been unanimous welcome for this initiative from the tourism promotion bodies and the tourism industry. The initial indications of the impact of the Programme are very positive. It was originally intended that the review of the Programme would follow the London Olympics period but on strong representations from the tourism industry I brought forward the review which was completed in recent weeks. Today’s announcement will facilitate preparations for the 2013 tourist season during which I am confident the industry will maximise the potential of the Visa Waiver Programme”, the Minister said.

This scheme is an integral part of the Government’s Jobs Initiative and is intended to promote tourism, particularly from emerging markets such as China, India and the Gulf Region. Under the Programme, tourists or business people who have lawfully entered the UK, including Northern Ireland, on a valid UK visa are able to travel on to Ireland without the requirement to obtain an Irish visa.

Minister Shatter pointed out that the full year cost of the existing measures and the new proposals, in terms of lost visa fee revenue, amounts to over €1m approximately. However, the Minister also said, “Lost visa fee revenue will be more than made up for by the increased number of visitors to our shores from significant new markets.” Minister Shatter added “This Programme, together with other initiatives such as the forthcoming Investor and Entrepreneur Scheme for migrants, demonstrates the Government’s commitment to innovative and imaginative approaches to promoting economic growth and recovery.”

No. 644 of 2005).County Registrars (except in Dublin and Cork) are automatically Sheriffs.  It should be noted that County Registrars are not paid an annual retainer nor do they receive any additional income from their sheriff duties.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1384	It is the Government's intention to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities as quickly as possible, taking into account the need to ensure that all necessary legislative and administrative requirements under the Convention are being met. As the Deputy may be aware, Ireland does not become party to treaties until it is first in a position to comply with the obligations imposed by the treaty in question, including by amending domestic law as necessary.The ongoing implementation of our National Disability Strategy in many respects comprehends many of the provisions of the Convention.  In addition, the Inter-Departmental Committee on the UNCRPD monitors the remaining legislative and administrative actions required to enable ratification.  At the Committee's request, the National Disability Authority, the lead statutory agency for the sector, has independently assessed the remaining requirements for ratification so as to ensure conclusively that all such issues will be addressed.One of the key requirements in this regard is the enactment of mental capacity legislation. The Government's Legislation Programme as announced on 11 January 2012, indicates that the Mental Capacity Bill is expected to be published in the current Dáil session. The Bill will replace the Wards of Court system with a modern statutory framework governing decision-making on behalf of adults who lack capacity. The passage of this Bill will add substantially to the overall progress on implementation of the requirements towards ratification of the Convention.

In that context the Commissioner determines the appropriate measures to be put in place, including the specific firearms to be deployed, without reference to either myself or my Department.The Garda authorities have informed me that at present the armed capability of Garda members is provided by District Detective Units supported by National Units.  In addition, they have made arrangements to co-ordinate armed response measures throughout the country.  In view of the operational nature of the functions involved, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on how the relevant resources might be deployed.The Garda authorities have also informed me that the armed capability of Garda members is kept under on-going review.

I should point out that while the Irish authorities are in a position to confirm the residence status and the right to re-enter of the person concerned, any decision in relation to the entry of the person to the EU country of his destination is a matter for the authorities of that Member State. Airlines and other carriers may also have their own requirements in terms of travel documents acceptable to avail of their services.I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) that the person concerned is now in possession of an Irish Travel Document issued on 21 February 2012.  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.  This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process. The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from the INIS is, in the Deputy's view, inadequate or too long awaited.

In this regard, I am informed that it has become necessary for the Tribunal to introduce an upper limit of €250,000 to the amount that may be paid under an individual award during 2012.  I am satisfied that this amount represents a substantial payment in circumstances where the balance of the award will be paid in subsequent years and, indeed, where the State itself is not responsible for the injuries suffered by the unfortunate victim.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1389	I propose to take Questions Nos. 941 and 977 together.As I indicated in my reply to Question number 491 of 21 March 2012 the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority to be established under the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011 will be independent of the legal professions and of the Government in the performance of its functions. This will include new and independent procedures relating to allegations of professional misconduct by either solicitors or barristers. Such complaints will be dealt with under the auspices of the Authority's Complaints Committee and supported, where appropriate, by the work of the new and independent Legal Practitioners' Disciplinary Tribunal. Under the Bill, members of the public will no longer go to the Law Society or to the Bar Council and their respective disciplinary tribunals to deal with complaints, as happens at the moment, but will instead do so through the Legal Services Regulatory Authority.The Law Society has recently recognised that it would be "in the best interests of the public and the profession" if complaints about solicitors were no longer to be dealt with by the Society but by the new Regulatory Authority to be established under the Bill . The independence of the new Regulatory Authority and of its attendant complaints and Disciplinary Tribunal procedures is fundamental to their success and to the avoidance of any perception that complaints about lawyers are being dealt with by lawyers themselves or their representative bodies.Under the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011, therefore, the complaints systems currently operated by the legal professional bodies are to be replaced by new procedures the independence of which will have to be reflected in the relevant recruitment and appointment processes. In closing the Second Stage debate on the Bill I confirmed that I am considering possible Committee Stage amendments to create  appropriately independent procedures for the appointment of members of the Legal Services Regulatory Authority, its Complaints Committee and of the Legal Practitioners' Disciplinary Tribunal. Similarly, I expressed the view that staff appointments to the new Authority would be better made by the Authority itself under a public competition carried out by the Public Appointments Service. While the transition to a new and independent complaints procedure under the Bill will have an impact on staff currently involved in that area it will be open to such staff  — who would obviously possess the relevant skills and experience — to offer to apply for positions advertised by the new and independent Legal Services Regulatory Authority.

The Deputy will be aware from a previous reply that the Garda investigation was a lengthy process due to the complex nature of the investigation which required examination and analysis of a significant volume of information technology data and communications. In particular I am informed that progress in the investigation was hampered because of the unavailability of a person the Gardaí wished to interview.  I am further informed that an investigation file was submitted to the Law Officers on 27 January, 2011.  Following a number of further enquiries by that office, directions were issued on 2 November, 2011 not to prosecute.

The Deputy will be aware that the Commissioner, in consultation with his senior management team, is responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, throughout the organisation. This  allocation of resources is constantly monitored in the context of crime trends, policing needs and other operational strategies in place on a District, Divisional and Regional level to ensure optimum use is made of Garda resources and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1394	I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that the Communications Room at Store Street Garda Station is being expanded into a Communications Centre for the D.M.R. North Central Garda Division consolidating the four Communications Rooms currently in existence within the Garda Division.Gardaí who currently perform this duty at Communications Rooms within the Garda Division will be assigned to the newly expanded Communications Centre. The centralisation of the Communications Centre will result in a reduction in the number of Garda personnel required to perform this duty, which will facilitate the re-deployment of additional Garda personnel for operational policing duties. In addition, the establishment of a Divisional Communications Centre will also facilitate a more robust and pro-active supervision of resources in the Division.

I am also informed that a tendering process in respect of Garda vans has recently been completed. This is being undertaken by the National Procurement Service with a view to putting in place a contract which will allow for the provision of new vehicles.  Any requirement for vans on the part of An Garda Síochána will be addressed in that overall context.

I am further informed that the amounts quoted are inclusive of property forfeited to the State which was sold.  In addition, I have been advised that it would not be practicable to extract the figures specifically relating to seized property:YearAmount of Money Raised from Auctions2008€28,9682009€128,7302010€84,8022011€82,6072012 (04/04/2012)€650Money received from the sale of unclaimed/seized property is accounted for as an Appropriation-in-Aid within the Garda Vote. The sale of the property is dealt with by public auction and in order to maximise the receipts from such sales the appointed auctioneers advertise the auctions in national newspapers.I understand that information in relation to the class of each asset sold and the number of auctions held in each of the three years is not readily available. In this context I have been advised that extraction of the relevant material would require a significant and disproportionate use of Garda resources which are required for other purposes.

In that context the Commissioner determines the circumstances in which such charges arise and I do not have a role in relation to the matter.I have been informed by the Garda authorities that, at operational level, it is the Divisional Officer who decides whether policing services provided in connection with a specific event will be charged for.  In that regard I also understand that Divisional Officers take into account the type of event involved and that, for example, they may not seek to recover costs arising from local public events.

The Deputy will appreciate that the Courts Service, in common with all other public sector organisations, is obliged to ensure that resources are deployed to best effect in the current challenging economic climate and reductions in staff numbers. In that context the Courts Service has to prioritise the delivery of front line court services, in particular supporting court sittings, while at the same time providing the best possible services to court users.In order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that the existing vacancy, coupled with other staff absences, has had an effect on delivery of probate services in Kilkenny and Carlow.   The Service has indicated that measures are now being put in place to seek to address the arrears in probate cases over the coming weeks.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1402	The Sex Offenders Act 2001 introduced a wide range of measures aimed at reducing the risk to the public from convicted sex offenders. Those measures include the notification system, also known as the sex offenders' register. The Act also provides for post-release supervision orders for sex offenders.Section 28 of the Act obliges the court, at sentencing stage, to consider whether to impose a sentence involving post-release supervision. It sets out the criteria, including the need to protect the public from serious harm, the need to prevent the commission by the offender of further sexual offences and the need to rehabilitate the offender, to be considered by the court in this context.  The question of whether a post-release supervision order is imposed is a matter for the court to decide taking into account the individual circumstances of the case and I have no plans to amend this aspect of the procedure. However I am considering measures to enhance the application of such orders and may bring forward legislative proposals in that regard.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1403	The Reception and Integration Agency (RIA), a functional unit of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department, is responsible for the accommodation of persons while their applications for international protection are being processed.RIA itself has no function in determining whether someone should stay or not in its accommodation, except in the context of rare instances of serious and repeated misbehaviour.  Its function is to provide accommodation and related services to those who have sought international protection and who otherwise have no other means of supporting themselves. The process of determining protection claims is carried out by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC), Refugee Appeals Tribunal (RAT) and the Repatriation Unit of my Department.  Further, if the end of the process results in a removal order, the carrying out of that order is the responsibility of the Garda National Immigration Bureau.In essence, RIA accommodates all those who make a claim for protection and seek accommodation until such time as they:(i) leave voluntarily;(ii) are removed — either by way of deportation or Dublin II transfer;(iii) are granted refugee status or subsidiary protection; or(iv) are granted leave to remain, either through the process set out in the Immigration Act, 1999 or by way of a special scheme such as the 2005 IBC scheme.In relation to the statistics provided below, a number of points need to be considered.Firstly, it is not possible to specify exactly how long each person has resided in RIA accommodation.  Protection applicants are not required to live in RIA accommodation and in many cases, may move in and out of the direct provision system as their circumstances change. The statistics below set out the numbers of persons currently residing in RIA accommodation and the length of time that has elapsed since they first submitted their applications for international protection. This does not necessarily mean that those persons have lived in RIA accommodation for all of that period. These persons may have left RIA accommodation and then returned or, indeed, these persons may never have been in RIA accommodation until recently.Secondly, the statistics do not include children whose parents have not yet presented them to be registered as asylum seekers, nor does it include any Irish citizen children in the centres. So, in total, there are approximately 5,215 persons overall currently residing in RIA accommodation.In relation to the specific statistics sought, there are 539 persons residing in the direct provision system who made their applications for international protection less than one year ago;  630 between one and two years; 770 between two and three years; 945 between three and four years; 812 between four and five years; 670 between five and six years; 397 between six and seven years; and 272 more than seven years ago.The length of time spent in the direct provision system is affected by a number of factors and depends on the individual circumstances of each case.  For example, RIA accommodates those who have initiated Judicial Review proceedings  — in respect of decisions made at the ORAC and RAT stage of the process as well as in respect of deportation orders —  the effect of which is to delay a final decision as to whether they are removed or allowed to stay in the State.  Further delays are caused by applications for asylum for children being made only after their parents' own claims have concluded with the issuance of deportation orders. The deportation process itself can itself be prolonged by difficulties in getting travel documents from the countries to where the person is being sent and by a lack of cooperation on the part of the intended deportee in having travel documents issued by the embassy or consulate involved.

This allocation of resources is constantly monitored and reviewed where necessary, in the context of crime trends, policing needs and other operational strategies in place on a District, Divisional and Regional level to ensure optimum use is made of Garda resources and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public.I have been informed by the Garda Authorities that on the 29 February, 2012 the latest date for which figures are readily available, the strength of Celbridge Garda station was 17.  Celbridge forms part of the Leixlip District in the Kildare Division, which on the same date had a complement of 75 and 316 Garda respectively.I have also been informed by the Garda Authorities that the opening hours of Celbridge Garda Station are Monday to Saturday 10 a.m. - 6 p.m and 7 p.m - 9 p.m and Sunday 12 noon - 2p.m. Outside these hours, patrols are carried out by members attached to the District H.Q. in Leixlip.

In that context I have been informed by the Garda authorities that financial operating cost statements are maintained at District Headquarters level rather than at Garda station level. In the circumstances the Deputy will appreciate that the specific financial information he has sought is not readily available and I understand that the provision of such information would require a disproportionate amount of Garda time and resources which are required for other purposes.With regard to the closure of Rush Garda station I would stress that the key objective involved is to promote the more efficient and effective deployment of resources rather than to secure cash savings. In this context, the Commissioner has concluded that Garda resources could be better deployed and more effectively used on the front line if the station no longer had to be staffed and maintained.I am advised by the Garda authorities that refurbishment work to facilitate the allocation of additional members to Lusk Garda station has been carried out by the Office of Public Works.

The Deputy will of course appreciate that, in its foreign relations, Ireland adopts a "one China" policy and that the matter would need to be considered within that overall context.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1408	I propose to take Questions Nos. 961, 962, 967, 968, 970 and 971 together.I assume that the information sought in respect of humanitarian leave to remain refers to applications made under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999.  These applications arise in circumstances where a non-national who has no permission to be in the State is served with a notice of intent to deport under section 3(3)(a) of the Immigration Act, 1999. A person served with such a notice is afforded three options, viz. to leave the State voluntarily; to consent to the making of a Deportation Order; or to make representations in writing within 15 working days setting out reasons as to why a Deportation Order should not be made and why temporary leave to remain in the State be granted instead. In the years in question, that is, 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011, temporary leave to remain was granted to 1,052, 512, 232 and 1,101 persons respectively. Over the same period, in each year the total number of section 3 application cases on hands was approximately 12,000.In addition, prior to a determination being reached on an application made under section 3 as outlined above, where a subsidiary protection application is submitted it must be considered first to assess whether the applicant has an identifiable need for international protection under the criteria defined by the applicable EU Directive. The vast majority of subsidiary applications are from persons who have already been refused refugee status following consideration of their asylum claim by an independent process comprising the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC) and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal (RAT). In 2008, 479 decisions were made on applications for subsidiary protection of which seven were granted, 680 decisions made in 2009 of which 27 were granted, 521 made in 2010 of which four were granted and 884 made in 2011 of which 13 were granted.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1410	I propose to take Questions Nos. 964 and 965 together.Any foreign national who is granted residency in Ireland under the Immigrant Investor Programme will be subject to the immigration laws and regulations of the United Kingdom and the Member States of the Schengen area if they wish to travel to those jurisdictions for business or recreational purposes.  Such persons will of course be free to apply to those states for an appropriate permission for legal entry for whatever purpose and obviously it is important that we do not equate a requirement to have a visa to enter the UK or the Schengen zone with denial of access.It is of course a matter for Schengen Member States and the UK to decide on the operation of their visa regimes. However, it would not be uncommon for friendly countries to regard their respective decisions on visa applications as persuasive when considering applications to enter their territory. In relation to the wider point about Ireland's position in relation to the Schengen Agreement it is not possible for us to simultaneously participate in that Agreement and remain part of the Common Travel Area (CTA) with the UK. Leaving the CTA would mean, for example, the implementation of full border controls between Ireland and the UK at all ports of entry and at the land border with Northern Ireland.I can inform the Deputy that the longer term public policy objective in this regard is to develop a Common Travel Area visa with the UK which both countries committed to pursuing in an agreement signed in December 2011.  A Common Travel Area visa would allow tourists and business visitors to travel to the Common Travel Area and to travel freely between Ireland and the UK. It is anticipated that such a visa will prove an attractive option for tourists and business visitors and it is intended to conduct a trial scheme which will be used to gauge likely demand and to resolve the substantial practical issues around its introduction.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1411	The Irish Short-stay Visa Waiver Programme, which commenced on 1 July, 2011 allows tourists or business people who have lawfully entered the UK, including Northern Ireland, on a valid UK visa to travel on to Ireland without the requirement to obtain an Irish visa.Nationals of seventeen countries are currently included in the programme including India, China, Russia, various priority Middle East countries and others.  As part of the initiative, nationals of these countries, who are long-term legal residents in the UK, will have the cost of an Irish visa waived should they wish to visit Ireland. It is estimated that there are up to 1 million people in this category in the UK.The Government agreed on 28 February to the extension of the Programme for a further period of four years i.e. to end October 2016, to add Bosnia and Herzegovina to the Programme and, as a further measure to encourage tourism, to waive the fee for visas for long-term residents from the countries covered by the Programme who live in the Schengen area. This last measure will be reviewed after six months.The Programme as it operates at present does not for technical reasons allow for reciprocity between the UK and Ireland. This is primarily due to the UK requirement that all visa applicants supply fingerprint (biometrics) data electronically as an essential element of applying for a UK visa. Quite obviously Ireland does not have the capacity to capture such data for all visa applications worldwide; currently for UK visas this is done in over 150 countries.However, there is very close cooperation between the immigration service of my Department and the UK immigration authorities and I regularly discuss with both the UK's Home Secretary and Minister for Immigration matters relating to the operation and oversight of the Common Travel Area (CTA) arrangement. In December 2011, together with the UK's Immigration Minister, I signed an agreement which, among other things, commits both countries to developing a Common Travel Area visa. Such a visa would allow tourists and business visitors to travel to the CTA and to travel freely between Ireland and the UK. It is anticipated that such a visa will prove an attractive option for tourists and business visitors and it is intended to conduct a trial scheme which will be used to gauge likely demand and to resolve the substantial practical issues around its introduction.  The availability of a visa for the Common Travel Area would, of course, supersede the existing Waiver Programme.

As of the 29 February 2012, the latest date for which figures are readily available, there were 210 Gardaí, stationed in Mill Street. While the number of dedicated Community Gardaí in Mill Street station is 12, under the current model of Community Policing all Gardaí have responsibility, inter alia, to deal with Community Policing issues as and when they arise. These figures are further augmented by 30 Reserve Gardaí and 15 Civilians assigned to that station.The Deputy will be aware that the Commissioner, in consultation with his senior management team, is responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, throughout the organisation.

The service enables up-to-date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek this information through the more administratively expensive Parliamentary Questions process.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1414	I am advised by the Garda authorities that the Garda National Policing Plan of 2002 outlined that each Garda Division was to set up a full time dedicated Divisional Drugs Unit. Following the establishment of the new Garda Division for Roscommon/Longford in 2009, a dedicated Divisional Drug Unit was established in Roscommon Garda Station, which was deemed geographically most central and strategically suitable.Local Garda management is of the view that the establishment of the Unit, based in Roscommon, ensures a more cohesive and coordinated approach to the enforcement of drugs legislation within the Division.The Garda authorities are satisfied that the Unit is deployed on a regular basis in Longford and other locations within the Division, as the need and crime trends indicate, with liaison being maintained with local district officers regarding intelligence-gathering and the monitoring of local suspected offenders, in respect of the sale and supply of illegal drugs within the overall Division.The situation is closely monitored by local Garda management in consultation with the Regional Assistant Commissioner who is satisfied that the establishment of the Divisional Drugs Unit, based in Roscommon, has not resulted in any diminished role by An Garda Síochána in addressing drug problems in Longford.With regard to drug offence statistics for the area, I am advised by the Garda authorities that Garda records indicate that in the Granard and Longford Garda districts, there were 87 incidents of possession of drugs for personal use contrary to section 3 of the Misuse of Drugs Acts 1977 and 1984 detected in 2011, compared with 66 such incidents recorded in 2010.   Furthermore, in the same districts there were 28 incidents of possession of drugs for the purpose of sale or supply, contrary to section 15 of the Misuse of Drugs Acts 1977 and 1984 detected in 2011, compared with 19 in 2010.   In addition there were 6 incidents of cultivation of drugs, contrary to section 17 of the Misuse of Drugs Acts 1977 and 1984 detected in 2011, compared with 2 such incidents recorded in 2010.These figures reflect increased levels of enforcement since the establishment of a dedicated Drug Unit in the Roscommon/Longford Garda division and also the trend nationwide in the increased detections of so-called ‘grow-house' operations.

At Divisional level, the deployment of Garda vehicles is a matter for the Divisional Officer who allocates vehicles on the basis of identified operational requirements.I am advised by the Garda authorities that the station referred to by the Deputy is within the Cahirciveen Garda District in the Kerry Division.  In addition, I understand that the area concerned is subject to regular mobile patrols carried out by District and Divisional units.  In that context the Garda authorities have indicated that the current policing arrangements for the area make the best use of available resources and that a comprehensive policing service is being delivered there.  They have also confirmed that the policing needs of the local community will be kept under on-going review.

In that context I have also been advised by the Garda authorities that the information provided to the individual concerned corresponded to the request received from him.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1422	I am advised that correspondence was received by the immigration service of my Department from the person concerned on 21 December, 2011 in relation to his position in the State and, more specifically, as to how the recent ECJ Judgment in the Zambrano case might apply to him. As the person in question has current permission to remain in the state on a stamp 2, a letter was issued to him on the 21 December 2011, advising him to attend at his local Garda Registration Office to have his case considered. This letter also advised the person concerned that should the Garda Registration Office not be satisfied that he meets the Zambrano criteria, he should refer his case back to the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service for further examination. To date there is no record of the person in question having requested the immigration service to re-examine his case.  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.  This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process. The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from INIS is, in the Deputy's view, inadequate or too long awaited.

In that context I can confirm that my Department has received submissions from the Irish League of Credit Unions, the Credit Union Development Association and the Credit Union Managers Association as well as from a small number of individual credit unions.  In addition, representatives from my Department and the Department of Finance met with credit union representatives last month to brief them on the proposed legislation.The submissions and other comments on the General Scheme of the Personal Insolvency Bill received from credit union representatives are being taken into consideration in the overall context of the further development of the legislative proposals.

The Act provides that the Service is independent in the performance of its functions, including the maintenance and provision of courthouse facilities.In order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that preliminary work was carried out in relation to work on the Mullingar Courthouse project. However, due to the reduced funding available, it has not been possible to proceed to tender for the Mullingar project or indeed for any other major courthouse construction project in the last three years. The Courts Service has indicated to me that, at this time, it is not possible to say when the Mullingar project will proceed as it is dependent on both the availability of funding and other project priorities.

The group in question were encamped on private property and there had been ongoing liaison between An Garda Síochána, the group in question, the Central Bank and other interested parties.  Policing of the protest and the deployment of appropriate Garda resources was, of course, at all times an operational matter for An Garda Síochána.  For obvious reasons, it is not the practice to disclose operational details relating to the deployment of An Garda Síochána.I am further informed that An Garda Síochána requested the protesters to leave the encampment, particularly in the light of health and safety and public safety issues arising at the site.  A positive response was not received to this request.  Against this background, the Gardaí removed the encampment, in accordance with the provisions of Section 19 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994 as amended by the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2002.

The Policing Plan for 2013 has not yet been prepared and therefore it is not possible to say at this stage what it may contain although I expect that it will contain measures to address the ongoing issue of rationalisation of the Garda station network.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1428	In accordance with the provisions of the Garda Síochána Act, the Minister for Justice and Equality may determine the policing priorities for the Garda Síochána for the coming year in consultation with the Garda Commissioner.  The Garda Commissioner, in turn, must take account of the policing priorities identified and submit to me by the end of October, a draft policing plan for the following year. That plan must contain, among other items, any proposals the Commissioner has for the closure of Garda stations or for amending District or Divisional boundaries. As Minister, I must approve the policing plan as submitted by the Commissioner or with amendments determined in consultation with the Commissioner.  The Deputy will appreciate therefore that I cannot comment on the contents of a policing plan for the year 2013 as it is not yet drafted. Consultations relating to the drafting of the 2013 plan will start in the third quarter of this year.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1429	The Garda stations identified for closure under the 2012 Garda Síochána Annual Policing Plan form part of the portfolio of State properties owned and maintained by the Office of Public Works.  Accordingly, it is for that Office to decide on the future of these properties and I do not have a role in relation to the matter.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1430	I am informed by the Garda authorities that the incident referred to by the Deputy is under investigation and every effort is being made to establish the identity of those involved.I am further informed that local Garda management is satisfied that a full and comprehensive policing plan, including the preparation of a risk assessment and an assessment of all information and intelligence available, was in place for this event.  Local Garda management is also satisfied that sufficient members of An Garda Síochána were deployed for duty at this event, commensurate with the risk level assigned.As the matter is under investigation it would be inappropriate for me to comment further at this time.  I can, however, confirm that in planning for the policing of an event such as this, the Garda authorities consult with all relevant organisations concerning public order and safety issues, including liaison with local transport services.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1431	Section 30 of the Garda Síochána Act 2005 provides a statutory basis for the Garda Commissioner to charge for police services on a non-public duty basis for commercial events such as sports fixtures and concerts.I am advised by the Garda authorities that Garda records in relation to sporting fixtures are not maintained in a format which provides a breakdown of the costs incurred in policing these events.  I am further informed that the extraction of such data would require a significant and disproportionate use of Garda resources.I am further informed that the cost to the event holder is determined by the number of Gardaí deployed at a particular event. The operational policing plan for a particular event is formulated by local operational management and An Garda Síochána does not recover the full cost of policing such events.

On examination of the application submitted, it was determined that the application be returned in its entirety to the person concerned for further attention on 23 November, 2010 and 4 March, 2011. In order to be fair to all applicants, only valid applications can be considered.   To date no new application has been received.I shouldremind the Deputy that queries in relation to the status of individual Immigration cases may be made direct to INIS by Email using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.  The service enables up-to-date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek this information through the more administratively expensive Parliamentary Questions process.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1433	During the period in question, I replied to approximately 1,200 Written and Oral questions submitted by my colleagues in Dail Eireann. The Deputy will appreciate that, given the remit of my Department, the nature of these questions can often involve matters of a complex legal, statistical or personal nature.On occasion, it is not possible to provide the information requested immediately as detailed reports must first be obtained to ensure the replies I give to the Deputy, and the House, are accurate. When these reports are to hand, I write directly to the Deputy concerned and convey the information to them. I regret that I cannot detail the number of Parliamentary Questions where the details supplied in the questions related to personal matters. Extracting this information would require a manual examination of all 1,200 Questions asked. I am sure the Deputy will agree that this would involve a disproportionate expenditure of staff time and resources.

As an exceptional measure, and as part of ongoing efforts to assist this particular individual and alleviate his personal fears in relation to visits, arrangements were made for this prisoner to receive visits when there are no other visits taking place. These arrangements have been in place for a number of weeks at this stage.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1438	The Deputy may wish to note that Garda vetting is only provided in the case of those seeking employment in Ireland with registered organisations where the employment involves substantial unsupervised access to children or vulnerable adults.  The Garda Central Vetting Unit (GCVU) based in Thurles carries out this vetting service. The present turnaround time is three weeks which I consider is well within acceptable limits.The Deputy's question appears to relate to a different type of Police Certificate of Character. Such a Certificate may be issued by An Garda Siochána in respect of a given individual, but only for the purposes of foreign consular and immigration requirements and for foreign business establishment.  Applications should be made at a person's local Garda Station.An individual may also apply to the Garda Síochána for a disclosure under Section 4 of the Data Protection Act 1988 (as amended) for a copy of the personal data which is maintained by An Garda Síochána. Such a disclosure is made to the individual to whom the data relates.If the Deputy is referring to a specific case and will provide the required information, I will arrange to have the necessary inquiries made.

In this context, I can assure the Deputy that my attention has been drawn to the newspaper report to which he refers and I can further assure him that the assessment to which I have referred will have regard to the views of all relevant stakeholders.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1440	I am, of course, concerned at the increase in number of burglaries in 2011, while noting that for most crime groups, including robbery, the most recent statistics indicate a decline in recorded crime.All crime trends are monitored closely by Garda management, with intelligence-led initiatives put in place to target burglary and other criminality.  An Garda Síochána is currently developing a new Burglary Prevention and Reduction Strategy which will provide a strategic framework for preventing and reducing burglaries in Ireland.  The Deputy will be aware that the Garda Commissioner has recently announced the introduction of a wide range of measures as part of a new operation aimed at tackling gangs involved in burglaries.In terms of prevention, the National Crime Prevention Unit (NCPU) and Crime Prevention Officers at divisional level provide advice, information and support to organisations, businesses and individuals aimed at reducing burglary crime and the opportunity to commit burglary. These specially trained officers are skilled at identifying environmental design risks and advise on ways to reduce opportunities to commit burglary and other property crime. The NCPU has designed a number of crime prevention advice leaflets including advice on home security and burglary prevention through a step by step checklist. These leaflets and the checklist are available on the Garda website www.garda.ie.During 2012, the national ‘Garda Supporting Safer Communities Campaign' will continue to highlight key issues, in particular burglary prevention.  The primary objective of this Garda Community Safety Campaign is to engage with, and raise awareness within communities of initiatives aimed at preventing crime, reducing the fear of crime and promoting community safety.  The first campaign will take place in early May and the second will take place in September.The Crime Call TV programme, broadcast once a month, to an average audience of 400,000 viewers, is often utilised to specifically target the issue of burglary prevention.  Practical crime prevention advice will continue to be given to highlight the most effective security measures householders can take to deter burglars.The National Model of Community Policing is directed and supported each year by the Garda Síochána Annual Policing Plan which ascribes current key actions which govern policing priorities at a national level.  Each Garda District and Divisional Officer also configures their policing response to local conditions to ensure that an appropriate policing service is continuously delivered to rural areas.Community policing utilises a number of crime prevention programmes to encourage active participation with the public.  An Garda Síochána, along with programme partners Muintir na Tíre, has established 1,345 Community Alert groups in rural Ireland.  Funding totalling €160,000 was provided by my Department to Community Alert in 2011.  The work of Community Alert continues to be highly valued and decisions on the precise level of funding which may be provided by my Department in 2012 will be made in the context of the available resources.In so far as the closure of Garda stations is concerned, when preparing the Policing Plan for 2011 the Garda Commissioner reviewed all aspects of An Garda Síochána's policing model, including the deployment of personnel, the utilisation of modern technologies and the operation of Garda stations, both in terms of opening hours and possible closures.  In addition, all Divisional Officers were asked to assess the level of activity in each Garda station in their area.  It must be stressed that the key objective of the station closures is to promote the more efficient and effective deployment of resources rather than secure modest cash savings.  In this context the Commissioner has concluded that Garda resources could be better deployed and more effectively used on the frontline if a particular station no longer had to be staffed and maintained.For the Government's part, we will do everything we can to support the gardaí in their work, to provide resources as public finances permit, and to respond to any legislative needs that are identified.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1441	I have been informed by the Irish Prison Service that it is not possible to provide specific information on the number of prisoners convicted of homicide offences who have absconded from open centres and who have returned voluntarily or were returned.However, I can advise the Deputy that there are currently 3 prisoners who were serving sentences for homicide offences who are unlawfully at large having absconded from an open centre.  Two prisoners were serving sentences for dangerous driving causing death and have been unlawfully at large since 24 November 2004 and 14 June 2010 respectively.  The third prisoner, who was serving a sentence for manslaughter, endangerment and dangerous driving causing death, absconded on 15 March 2012.  He was arrested by the PSNI and is currently serving a sentence in Northern Ireland.  He will be subject to a European Arrest Warrant in due course.Prisoners being considered for a transfer to an Open Centre are identified by a number of different means but primarily on the recommendation of the Prison Governor or the therapeutic services in the prisons.  The prisoner, their family or their legal representative can also apply for consideration of such a concession.  Recommendations are also made to the Minister in relation to long term sentence prisoners by the Parole Board.  It is very important to note that it does not necessarily follow that a prisoner will receive a transfer to an Open Centre even if the recommendation is to that effect.The criteria considered for the transfer of prisoners from closed prisons to open centres includes:the safety of the public (specifically flight risk),compassionate and humane considerations (including facilitating family visits),nature and gravity of the offence,length of sentence served to date,length of sentence left to serve,prior record on temporary release,behaviour in prison,previous criminal history,family support,addiction issues/history,prisoner's home address.Prisoners serving short sentences, i.e., under 12 months, can be moved to an open centre shortly after committal.  Other longer term prisoners being prepared for transition back into the community can be considered for moves with about 2 years left in their sentence.  Exceptional prisoners who are engaging strongly with the therapeutic services can sometimes be considered for a transfer with up to 4 years left to serve in their sentence.  Those convicted of offences resulting in the loss of life are not precluded for consideration and have frequently been transferred to Open Centres in the past.  In some cases, these prisoners were serving life sentences.The Deputy may wish to note that new procedures have been put in place to ensure that where consideration is being given to the transfer of a prisoner serving a sentence for a homicide offence to an Open Centre, that decision must be made by the Director General of the Irish Prison Service.

This allocation of resources is constantly monitored and reviewed where necessary, in the context of crime trends, policing needs and other operational strategies in place on a District, Divisional and Regional level to ensure optimum use is made of Garda resources and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public.
As of 29 April 2012 Abbeyleix Garda District and Portlaoise Garda District will be amalgamated and form the new Portlaoise Garda District as set out is the 2012 Policing Plan.  I have  been informed by the Garda Commissioner that the personnel strength of Abbeyleix Garda Station on 29 February 2012, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 24.  The personnel strength of Abbeyleix Garda District on the same date was 37.  In addition to this there is also 5 Garda Reserve members and 4 civilian personnel attached to Abbeyleix Garda Station.All Divisional resources are further augmented by a number of Garda National Units such as the Garda National Drugs Unit, the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) and other specialised units, all of which have had increased resources.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1443	There has been an enormous increase in the volume of applications for a certificate of naturalisation in recent years.  In 2000 the number of applications made that year was just over 1,000 whereas last year the number was 25,671 — an increase of almost 2,500%.  Quite clearly, this dramatic increase in volume has impacted on the capacity of the administrative system to process them and has given rise to a large volume of cases on hand.  This gave rise to a situation where most cases were taking well over two years to complete.When I came into Office just over a year ago there were about 22,000 cases on hands.  I undertook to address this issue and committed to get to the stage that by the second quarter of this year the average processing time for standard cases would take six months.  In this regard, a major effort has and continues to be made in reducing the time taken to process the generality of applications.  In 2011 over 16,000 applications were dealt with.  I expect to have made a decision on 12,000 applications by the end of May this year and a further 12,000 by year end. By contrast, in 2010, a decision was reached in just over 5,600 cases.The primary aim over the past year has been to reduce the large volume of cases on hand as swiftly as possible and this has been achieved in the majority of cases.By way of general comment, it is a statutory requirement that, inter alia, applicants for naturalisation be of good character.  In some instances that can be established relatively quickly and in other cases completing the necessary checks can take a considerable period of time.  Quite clearly in those circumstances it is not possible to provide a specific date for the determination of an individual application.  I can, however, inform the Deputy that steps are being taken to process all outstanding applications including those referred to by the Deputy and to have made significant inroads into them by the end of this year.

Arising from the refusal of his asylum application, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was notified, by letter dated 18th August, 2011, that the then Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against him. In addition, he was notified of his entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in accordance with the provisions of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006.

The person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection. When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.

In the event that the application for Subsidiary Protection is refused, the position in the State of the person concerned will then be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.

He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against him. In addition, he was notified of his entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in accordance with the provisions of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006.The person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection. When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.In the event that the application for Subsidiary Protection is refused, the position in the State of the person concerned will then be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1448	I refer the Deputy to my reply below to Parliamentary Question No. 212 of 19 January, 2012. The position is unchanged since then.
I am informed by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) that the person referred to by the Deputy has no application pending for residency. The person concerned is the subject of a  Deportation Order, signed on 23 November 2011, following a comprehensive and thorough examination of his asylum claim and his application for subsidiary protection, and a detailed examination of the representations he submitted for consideration under Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended).

The effect of the Deportation Order is that the person concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter out of the State. The enforcement of the Deportation Order is an operational matter for the Garda National Immigration Bureau.

In developing these legislative proposals the welfare and best interests of children will be key considerations.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1451	The Deputy will appreciate that I am not in a position to comment on a particular case in response to a Parliamentary Question.  However, I can indicate the following by way of general information.The principal objectives of the Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011, which entered into force on 1 April 2011, are to ensure the timely transfer of the common areas of multi-unit developments to owners' management companies (OMCs) and to facilitate the fair, efficient and effective management of such companies.  Section 18 requires OMCs to establish and maintain a scheme of annual service charges from which they may discharge expenditure incurred on common or shared services, including insurance, refuse collection and security services.  In order to ensure transparency and accountability, the annual service charge, and the services to be funded by it, must be approved by a general meeting of the apartment owners.I should add that section 18 also provides that each apartment owner is under an obligation to pay the annual service charge.  As regards unpaid service charges, the position is that section 22 provides that unpaid charges may be recovered by the OMC as a simple contract debt in a court of competent jurisdiction, i.e normally the District Court.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1452	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1016 to 1019, inclusive, together.The Private Security Authority, established under the Private Security Services Act 2004, is the regulatory body with responsibility for regulating and licensing the private security industry in the State.  The Authority is an independent body under the aegis of the Department of Justice and Equality and the administration of the Authority is vested in a Board whose membership includes industry representatives.  The key responsibilities of the Authority are to licence and regulate those providing security services and to improve and maintain standards in the provision of these services.Contractors such as those in the intruder alarm installer sector are required to pay a licence fee to the Authority.  As the Authority is an independent body, my Department has no role in the determination of licence fees.  This is a matter for which the Private Security Authority has sole statutory responsibility and it would be inappropriate for me to interfere in the exercise of these statutory functions.  However, I am informed by the Authority that the current fee, which is for a two year licence, was set by the Authority in 2005 and has not been increased since that time.The provision of a regulatory environment understandably has cost implications for the industry.  The Authority has made every effort to ensure that costs are kept to a minimum and has also introduced an instalment payment option to assist contractors with paying for their licence.The table sets out the licence fees paid to the Authority in the years 2009, 2010 and 2011:YearContractor Licence FeesIndividual Licence FeesTotal Licence Fees2009€716,294€1,146,939€1,863,2332010€1,454,300€1,373,163€2,827,4632011€800,950€1,480,177€2,281,127I understand that Inspectors from the Authority conduct inspections on a wide range of licence holders, including security guards, door supervisors, installers of intruder alarms and Cash-In-Transit services.  Where required, the Authority's Inspectors undertake joint inspections with other state agencies and regulators including An Garda Síochána and the Revenue Commissioners.The Authority conducts announced quality control inspections of contractors operating in licensable sectors of the security industry as well as unannounced visits to contractors and locations where security services are being provided.  In the past two years, I am informed that 39 inspections where undertaken in County Mayo.I am advised that the Authority has a modern phone system which is manned by its staff and the Authority acknowledges that during certain peak times it can be difficult to contact the Contractor Division of the Authority.  For this reason alternative communication channels, including email and text, are available.  In addition, the direct dial numbers for the Division are contained in all correspondence and detailed on the Authority's website.  The Authority deals with all enquiries made to them.  However, in circumstances where the enquiry is of a technical nature or where the identity of the caller cannot be verified, the Authority may opt to respond to the enquiry in writing.

There are currently 43 cars attached to the Division and, based on current usage, it is estimated that 6 cars may be decommissioned by the end of the year.I am further advised that provision has been made in the 2012 Garda Vote for the purchase of new vehicles.  I am also informed that a procurement process is currently being conducted by the National Procurement Service with a view to putting in place a contract which will allow for the provision of new vehicles.  An Garda Síochána's vehicle requirements, including those of the West Cork Division, will be addressed in that overall context.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1455	A valid application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to by the Deputy was received in the Citizenship Division of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) in January, 2010.The application is at an advanced stage of processing and the person concerned will be informed of my decision on their application in due course.The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.I shouldremind the Deputy that queries in relation to the status of individual Immigration cases may be made direct to INIS by Email using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1456	Marriage to an Irish national does not grant any automatic right to enter or reside in the State solely on that basis.A person who is visa-required wishing to come to Ireland to reside in the State with his/her spouse must apply for a "Join Spouse" visa.   Where all the required documentation/evidence has been furnished and the Visa Officer is satisfied with the bona fides of the application a long stay visa is approved which will allow the applicant to register with the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) in the vast majority of cases without further reference to the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS).  In exceptional cases, where a Visa Officer has concerns over the relationship history for example, a short stay visa may be approved.  The rationale for this is that the applicant is being afforded the opportunity come to the State and to demonstrate the existence of the relationship by submitting an application to INIS for consideration.Non-EEA nationals who are already in the State and who are seeking to remain on the basis of marriage to an Irish national are required to make an application for residence to the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service of my Department.The Deputy will appreciate that it would be neither possible nor sensible to devise rules which would comprehend every possible circumstance where non-nationals seek to enter the State.  As a general rule applicants should disclose in full the reasons they are seeking to enter the State and supply readily verifiable documentation to vouchsafe those reasons.  In circumstances such as those referred to by the deputy where it might not be possible for example for an entry condition such as the parties having met at least three times to be observed, a pragmatic approach is taken.As is the case for all applications for visas, each application is considered on its individual merits.  Our system operates on the basis that the onus is on the applicant to satisfy the authorities as to why s/he should be allowed to enter/remain in the State; it is not the other way around.Finally, the Deputy may wish to note that more than 90% of all visa applications to enter the State are approved.It is not clear if the Deputy has a particular case in mind.  If so, queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

The strength of each district on the 29 February 2012, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was as set out in the table herewith:DistrictStationStrengthCahirArdfinnan2Ballyporeen1Cahir47Cashel14Clogheen1New Inn1DungarvanAglish1An Rinn1Ardmore2Ballyduff1Ballymacarberry1Cappoquin1Dungarvan47Lismore4Tallow3Total127I have been advised that incidents of criminality occurring inside the County Tipperary boundary, including the mountain area on the Newcastle to Cappoquin Road, within Tipperary Garda Division, are investigated by Garda personnel from Cahir Garda District, the local Garda Station being Ardfinnan Garda Station, under the direction of the local District Officer. Incidents of criminality occurring inside the County Waterford boundary within Waterford Garda Division are investigated by Garda personnel from Dungarvan Garda District, the local Garda Stations being Ballymacarberry and Cappoquin Garda Stations, under the direction of the local District Officer.Where an incident of criminality is reported to Cahir Garda Station, an appropriate member of An Garda Síochána from Cahir Garda District attends at the scene of the incident and investigates the matter.  Where such incident refers to another Garda District, within or outside Tipperary Garda Division, a report of the circumstances is taken by the Garda who attended the scene, which is then forwarded to the District Officer of the relevant District where the criminal incident is alleged to have occurred for full and proper investigation of that incident.

I am informed by the Court Service that all such summonses being sent to An Garda Siochána to be served from that date onwards will be amended as above.  I understand that the amended summonses will refer to cases due before the courts from September 2012.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1460	I am informed that a senior Garda officer has investigated the matter referred to by the Deputy based on the details provided. However, her enquiries (which included the viewing of CCTV footage where available and enquiries with relevant Garda personnel on duty at Dublin Airport at the time in question) did not identify the alleged incident referred to by the Deputy. However, if details regarding the flight on which the person concerned travelled to Dublin airport can be provided, it would greatly assist in identifying the immigration control point at Dublin airport at which the person presented in order to seek permission to enter the State. This would, of course, assist with any further enquiries.The Deputy will be aware that it is open to a member of the public directly affected by the conduct of a member of An Garda Síochána that he or she believes is misbehaviour to contact the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission as the body responsible for receiving and dealing with all complaints made by members of the public concerning the conduct of members of An Garda Síochána.  A witness to such behaviour may also make a complaint.

A supplementary file was submitted in May 2011 and a further investigation file was forwarded in October 2011.  The files remain under consideration by the Director of Public Prosecutions, and directions are awaited.  Following further developments additional information was submitted to the Law Officers, with a further supplementary investigation file submitted in April 2012 to allow matters to be considered further.On taking office, this Government gave priority to satisfying itself that the necessary resources, both personnel and legal, were available to the investigation.  Within eight weeks of taking up office, I moved urgently to introduce new legislation which was enacted on 2 August 2011 as the Criminal Justice Act 2011.I am being briefed on an ongoing basis on the progress of the investigations and am assured that this investigation remains an absolute priority for An Garda Síochána.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1466	Chinese citizens travelling to Ireland as tourists currently have their visa applications processed within 5 to 10 working days. The processing of visas for Chinese citizens coming here for business purposes ordinarily takes two to five working days. I am advised that these timeframes are well within international norms. It should also be noted that the approval rate for Irish visa applications lodged in China is 94%.At present persons granted an Irish visa are not permitted to use that visa to travel to the UK. This is primarily due to the UK requirement that all visa applicants supply fingerprint (biometrics) data electronically as an essential element of applying for a UK visa. Quite obviously Ireland does not have the capacity to capture such data for all visa applications worldwide; currently for UK visas this is done in over 150 countries.However, I can inform the Deputy that in December 2011, together with the UK's Immigration Minister, I signed an agreement which, among other things, commits both countries to developing a Common Travel Area visa. Such a visa would allow tourists and business visitors to travel to the Common Travel Area and to travel freely between Ireland and the UK. It is anticipated that such a visa will prove an attractive option for tourists and business visitors and it is intended to conduct a trial scheme which will be used to gauge likely demand and to resolve the substantial practical issues around its introduction.

However, no offers of employment have been made to applicants since the introduction of the public service moratorium on recruitment in 2009.The moratorium on recruitment remains in place in furtherance of the objective, set in the context of the agreement with the EU and the IMF, to reduce the numbers of public servants.  While successful applicants on this panel currently remain eligible to be offered positions as trainee Gardaí, the lifetime of the panel, and the position of applicants on it, will be kept under review in the light of when Garda recruitment might recommence.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1469	Ireland as a matter of policy does not deport unaccompanied minors. A significant percentage of unaccompanied minors who present at the frontiers of the State subsequently join up with family members already present in the State and are therefore no longer considered to be unaccompanied minors.In relation to former separated children/ aged out unaccompanied minors (i.e. those who have reached the age of 18), if they have no permission to remain in the State, they can be issued with a 'proposal to deport' letter under Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999.Just under 40 such persons have been deported from the State since 2006. In addition, almost 280 additional Deportation Orders for such persons remain outstanding at present. It is believed that many of these persons will have already left the State.In the period in question, over 30 such persons have been granted refugee status and just under 200 persons have been granted permission to remain in the State.

This eligibility criteria was the same for all candidates who applied for the competition.As for the future, the current minimum educational qualifications are set out publicly for all job-seekers who wish to upskill to a sufficient level in preparation for any such competitions.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1471	The moratorium on Public Service Recruitment continues to apply to An Garda Síochána and no date has been fixed for future intakes into the Garda College. A decision on when recruitment will re-commence will take into account the rate of retirements in the Garda Síochána and Government targets, set in the context of the agreement with the EU and the IMF, to reduce the numbers of public servants.In addition to this, what will ultimately determine the sustainable level of Garda numbers, and therefore establish when recruitment will recommence, is the level of budgetary provision that can be made for the Force, and the Deputy will be conscious that difficult decisions will continue to have to be made, right across the public sector, in order to bring our public finances back into balance.

I am advised by the Military Authorities that a new recruitment competition was launched on Monday 2 April 2012. Details of this competition are available on www.military.ie.  The closing date for receipt of applications is 22 April 2012.In addition, there will also be a Cadetship Competition in 2012.  The planning for this entry level competition for officers is currently being finalised.

Having regard to the wider dimensions of the issue, including for those who were actually tried by Court Martial for desertion during the Emergency and thereafter, I referred the matter to the Attorney General's Office for advice.  I recently received the advice of the Attorney General in this regard and am considering that advice with a view to determining a way forward on this issue.

I believe that this is the optimum level required to fulfil all roles assigned by Government.   It is my intention that targeted recruitment will continue in 2012, within the resource envelope allocated to Defence, so as to maintain the Government approved strength of the Defence Forces. While there will be a Cadetship Competition in 2012 details of the number of cadets to be inducted from this competition are being considered in the context of the reduction in overall numbers and the re-organisation of the Defence Forces from three to two Brigades.It is too early to confirm if there will be a cadet class in 2013.

The EOD team subsequently made safe a suspected viable Improvised Explosive Device (IED). From a security and operational perspective, it would not be appropriate to reveal technical information on the specific components and capability of the device in question.Intelligence gathering in relation to this event is a matter for An Garda Síochána, as is monitoring of the ongoing threat level.With regard to the number of potentially viable IEDs discovered in the State in 2011, of the 237 EOD team callouts, 46 involved viable IEDs and of these 15 had functioned before the EOD team had an opportunity to intervene.

Research has shown that it is one of the most effective medications for protection against the type of malaria prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa.  While certain risks associated with the use of the drug were highlighted in Drug Safety Newsletters in 1996 and 2003, the Irish Medicines Board remained of the view that the benefit/risk profile for the product remained acceptable. The IMB continues to review the safety of this and all medicines on an ongoing basis and updates the product information as appropriate. Lariam remains the medication of choice for the Defence Forces for missions to sub-Saharan Africa and continues to be certified by the Irish Medicines Board.In relation to the person referred to in the question, patient medical records are confidential and remain so even after death.  It is not possible to disclose confidential patient information to third parties.  I therefore can make no comment on any medical issues relating to the person referred to and can only address the generality of the questions raised by the Deputy.There is no requirement to report whether a person who died had or had not taken Lariam or any other drug unless there was an issue directly linked to the taking of the medication which gave rise for concern.  I understand that the death was reported to the coroner as is the requirement for all sudden death incidents.  The Defence Forces' Medical Corps do not perform post mortems when a member of the Defence Forces dies in service.  It is a matter for the Coroner's Office to determine whether a post mortem should be carried out, which would then be carried out by an appointed pathologist.  It is a matter for that pathologist to determine what procedures and tests are used in post mortems.The Medical Corps provides all medical advice to the Defence Forces.  Where required the Medical Corps will accesses relevant external military or civilian medical expertise including in the area of tropical medicine.The Medical Corps is charged with looking after the health of serving Defence Forces' personnel.  It achieves this in conjunction with the civilian health services and other medical professionals as the need for additional or specialist services arises.  There is no provision for the Medical Corps to provide a medical service to retired personnel.  However, on request, copies of the service medical records of retired members can be provided to their nominated medical practitioner.

A decision on the level of afforestation that may be permitted in this SPA for the 2012/13 planting season will be decided following consultation with the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  Future afforestation levels must take into account the results of Hen Harrier breeding and distribution surveys, the availability of suitable habitat and the effects of other cumulative developments on hen harrier populations e.g. wind farms.  This analysis is currently underway and it is anticipated that a decision on future levels will be agreed in the advance of the 2012/2013 planting season.

Annex VIII of Regulation (EC) No. 142/2011 lays down detailed hygiene, temperature and traceability requirements. In particular, the regulation specifies that vehicles or containers must be maintained in a clean condition and must be covered when transporting animal by-products or derived products and should show no evidence of leakage or damage.Registered ABP hauliers in Ireland are required to maintain a register of receptacles used to transport ABP. Each receptacle has to be uniquely identified and there is an obligation to clearly display this identification on each receptacle.  Breach of the regulations can lead to revocation of a registration. If the Deputy has specific information in this regard I would ask him to supply it and I will have the matter investigated by my Department.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1489	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1064 and 1118 together.Responsibility for management of the national deer herd, including for sending carcases to laboratories rests with the National Parks and Wildlife Service. However, my Department monitors the outcome of routine veterinary examination of wild deer carcasses intended for human consumption.  My Department also specifically carries out on-going research into the incidence of TB in wild deer.  To date, both the routine veterinary examination results and our research has shown a very low incidence of TB in the wild deer population (Sika and Dama dama ), even when the deer concerned were deliberately selected from areas of the country with a high incidence of TB in the cattle population. Based on the evidence to date, I am satisfied that the risk of the spread of TB from deer to cattle is low and that a deer cull is unnecessary in the context of the bovine TB eradication scheme.  I should explain that, while a deer cull is not justified from a TB perspective, deer are not a protected species and can be culled under licence issued by the NPWS to local gun clubs and/or farmers for the purpose of reducing deer numbers in a locality where they may be causing problems.

My Department has had responsibility for the management and development of the harbour from that date.  The harbour was previously in the ownership and management of the Dingle Harbour Commissioners.A total of €307,000 in funding was provided for works at the harbour under my Departments Fishery Harbour and Coastal Infrastructure Development programme in 2007.  In addition to these costs there would have been costs incurred to pay staff and to cover current costs from the period May to December 2007.  These costs would have been met from the Fishery Harbour Centres Fund and total €239,122.

However, rather that simply apply an across the board cut to the rates payable or reduce the maximum payable area, I decided that real efforts should be made to focus the Scheme on those farmers who are most actively contributing to achieving the aims of the Scheme, namely, ensuring continued agricultural land use, thereby contributing to the maintenance of viable rural communities, maintaining the countryside and maintaining and promoting sustainable farming systems, which take account of environmental protection measures.While horses will no longer be eligible for the stocking density calculation, equine breeding enterprises will continue to be eligible on the basis of the contribution they make to the local economy. Equine breeding enterprises are defined as follows: an applicant must, in the first instance, be an equine (horse/donkey) breeder and have bred a foal, from a mare registered as on the applicant's holding in 2011, in either 2009, 2010 or 2011, which was registered in a Stud Book approved by my Department, with pedigree recorded (sire and dam).

No. 8 of 2012, Diseases of Animals Act 1966 (Registration of Horse Premises) Order 2012.Where these criteria are met, the following equines will then be eligible for inclusion in the stocking density calculation for the 2012 Scheme:All equines aged one year to five years, (aged using 1 January), registered in the name of the applicant and maintained on his/her holding;Breeding mares, registered as having been on the applicant's holding in 2011, that have bred an appropriately registered foal in either 2009, 2010 or 2011.

The operation of the cable car to Dursey Island is the responsibility of Cork County Council.  Cork County Council engaged consulting engineers to carry out studies on the cable car servicing Dursey Island following which the transportation of all animals was ceased from 30th January 2012 for a number of reasons, inter alia, health and safety, absence of codes covering transportation of animals and persons in the same cable car and increase of the risk to public health.I understand that a Group representative of Electoral Area Members of Cork County Council, the farming community, residents and relevant public bodies has prepared a brief for the commissioning of a report on the future of the Dursey Island Cable Car.  The onus is on the person transporting animals to conduct the operation in a safe manner.

This work represents a significant financial, administrative and scientific investment by the State in resolving this issue.  The Appropriate Assessment of aquaculture applications is being dealt with on a bay-by-bay basis.In relation to a timeframe, the completion of the process of identifying Conservation Objectives and conducting Appropriate Assessments varies depending on location and key operational factors including weather conditions, the quality of data received from field operations and the need to carry out additional survey work in certain specific instances.  The area in question remains part of the package of prioritised areas under assessment. This package is reviewed on a regular basis with a view to expediting the appropriate assessment process.  Addressing the issue of aquaculture licensing in Natura 2000 areas is a key priority for my Department and you can be assured that every effort is being made to expedite the determination of these cases having regard to all the complexities involved.

However, rather that simply apply an across the board cut to the rates payable or reduce the maximum payable area, I decided that real efforts should be made to focus the Scheme on those farmers who are most actively contributing to achieving the aims of the Scheme, namely, ensuring continued agricultural land use, thereby contributing to the maintenance of viable rural communities, maintaining the countryside and maintaining and promoting sustainable farming systems, which take account of environmental protection measures.Horses and donkeys will no longer be automatically eligible for the stocking density calculation, with the following requirements now applicable:
Horses:
Equine breeding enterprises will continue to be eligible on the basis of the contribution they make to the local economy.  Equine breeding enterprises are defined as follows: an applicant must, in the first instance, be an equine breeder and have bred a foal, from a mare registered as on the applicant's holding in 2011, in either 2009, 2010 or 2011, which was registered in a Stud Book approved by my Department, with pedigree recorded (sire and dam).  Furthermore, the premises of all who meet this criteria must be registered with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, in accordance with S.I. No. 8 of 2012, Diseases of Animals Act 1966 (Registration of Horse Premises) Order 2012.Where these criteria are met, the following equines will then be eligible for inclusion in the stocking density calculation for the 2012 Scheme:All equines aged one year to five years, (aged using 1 January), registered in the name of the applicant and maintained on his/her holding;Breeding mares, registered as having been on the applicant's holding in 2011, that have bred an appropriately registered foal in either 2009, 2010 or 2011.
Donkeys:
Donkeys will continue to be eligible for inclusion in the stocking density calculation where the animals in question are appropriately registered and in respect of which the relevant identification documentation has been issued, showing the animal(s) concerned as being in the ownership of the given applicant.

My Department has however recently conducted a review of the 2003 Order and I can confirm that a draft Rates and Charges Order has been published on foot of that review.  That draft Order is currently the subject of a public consultation process.  On completion of the public consultation process I will consider any submissions made and, if necessary, make appropriate amendments to the Rates and Charges Order.

I hope to have this information by the end of this week or early next week.  However, with more than 80% of the information gathered, early indications are that deliveries in March were significantly ahead of those in March 2011 and this will place Ireland in a super levy situation for the first time since 2007/2008.  As soon as I have the estimated position I will make the information known to the Deputy.

A total of 187 Licences have been issued this year to date in respect of rodents from outside the EU (USA), and rodents and rabbits originating within the EU. All animals entering the EU must be cleared for entry at an approved Border Inspection Post (BIP).  Irish BIPs are not approved for the landing of certain categories of animals such as rodents and therefore such animals originating in the USA and destined for Ireland were cleared through Frankfurt Airport BIP.

There are currently 45 outstanding payments to farmers in Co Kerry in respect of forestry schemes, 91 files continuing to be processed and they will be brought to payment stage as soon as possible under the Rural Environment Protection Scheme 4 (REPS 4) and with the Organic Farmers Scheme 36 participants from Kerry are awaiting payment.  Under the EU Regulations governing the Agri-Environment Options Scheme (AEOS) and other area-based payment schemes, a comprehensive administrative check, including cross-checks with the Land Parcel Identification System, must be completed before any payment can issue.  At this time there are 208 applicants awaiting payment for 2011.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1513	Botulism is a disease caused by a bacterium of the Clostridia family, the organisms are widely distributed in nature but only occasionally give rise to clinical disease in animals or humans.  Outbreaks of botulism occur when cattle consume feed material that has become contaminated with decomposing carcase material and it can also be associated with the storage and spreading of poultry litter where the poultry litter contains remnants of dead poultry.Botulism is not a notifiable disease in Ireland, but suspected botulism cases should be reported to my Department.  The Central and/or Regional Veterinary Laboratories of my Department will carry out field investigations and epidemiological investigations where they are notified of outbreaks of suspected cases. In this regard I can confirm that the Cork Regional Veterinary Laboratory has recently carried out post mortem examinations in relation to two bovine animals that are suspected of having died of botulism.  It is important in situations where botulism is suspected for keepers to consult both their private veterinary surgeon and the local regional veterinary laboratory in an effort to rule out other diseases which can present in a similar manner to botulism.In addition to providing a diagnostic service and information in relation to the disease and prevention, my Department also carries out follow-up investigations in situations where poultry litter is suspected of being the source of a botulism outbreak to ensure that adequate measures are being taken to prevent outbreaks.  These investigations involve both the farm where the poultry litter is being spread and the poultry units that supplied the poultry litter.  My Department also carries out routine inspections of poultry units to ensure that carcasses of dead poultry are being dealt with appropriately. Random inspections on poultry producers' premises are also carried out to ensure that the necessary procedures are being followed in relation to the disposal of manure and where there is evidence that proper procedures are not being followed, my Department can require that all poultry litter from those premises be sent for rendering.My Department has been proactive in disseminating information about botulism and has written to dairy processors advising them about the condition and asking them to distribute to their producers an information/advisory note.  An "Information Note on Botulism for Veterinary Practitioners" and "Instructions for Practitioners when dealing with suspected cases of Botulism on Farm" has also been circulated to Private Veterinary Practitioners.  Guidance notes have also been drawn up by my Department; one for the poultry industry providing advice in relation to the removal of dead birds from poultry litter and one for farmers providing advice on how to minimise the risk when storing and spreading poultry litter. Both sets of guidance notes are available on my Department's website or from local District Veterinary Offices in conjunction with other information relating to botulism.  In recent times, my Department has had discussions with industry and farmer representatives with a view to ensuring that the guidelines are being adhered to in order to minimise the risk of botulism outbreaks.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1514	The People's Millennium Forests Project was a flagship Millennium project sponsored by the National Millennium Committee and AIB and managed by Coillte in association with Woodlands of Ireland.  This was the largest ever project directed at the expansion and enhancement of our native woodlands.  There were 16 sites involved in this project, 14 of which are in the Republic of Ireland and two in Northern Ireland.  The mission of the People's Millennium Forests Project was to ensure that all future generations can enjoy the benefits of Ireland's native forests.One element of the Project was the "Household Tree Scheme" whereby each household in Ireland had a native tree planted at one of the 13 sites of the 14 sites in the Republic of Ireland.  The 14th site was exclusively for the protection of a unique native yew wood in Killarney. While a certificate was issued to each household in relation to the "Household Tree Scheme", it did not confer legal ownership of the tree to that household.  The context in which the trees were planted is that they would be part of a woodland community that would remain in place in perpetuity.  People were invited to participate in the People's Millennium Forests Project by visiting the forests and to enjoy the ever-changing natural environment of native woodland with its associated flora and wildlife.I am aware that 12 of the 16 sites involved in the Peoples Millennium Forest Project form part of the Coillte forest estate.  As announced by the Government in February, consideration will be given to the possible sale of some assets of Coillte excluding the sale of land.  A valuation of Coillte assets is currently being undertaken by the NTMA (NewERA unit) in conjunction with my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. No decision on the possible sale of Coillte assets will be taken until the valuation process is completed.  The protection of the People's Millennium Forests is one of the issues to be considered in the decision-making process in relation to the possible sale of Coillte assets.

The main commercial invertebrate species is nephrops, which is targeted on the continental shelf west of Scotland. Fisheries dredging for scallops and some smaller bivalves exist west of Scotland, as well as pot fisheries exploiting lobster and brown crab.  Ireland's has a small quota for nephrops.The shelf edge is a spawning area for mackerel and blue whiting while the main resident pelagic species is herring. Historically, there were important commercial fisheries for cod, haddock and whiting and a number of flatfish species. Hake and angler fish are also fished across the area.  Stocks that can be caught in area VIa for which Ireland have quotas include: Cod, Haddock, Whiting, Megrim, Anglerfish, Nephrops, Plaice, Sole, Saithe, Herring, Mackerel, Horse Mackerel, Boarfish and Albacore Tuna.At the 2008 December Fisheries Council, restrictions on whitefish fishing in the west of Area VI (waters west of Donegal and off Scotland) were introduced for the first time under Council Regulation No. 43/2009.  These restrictions included establishing minimum mesh sizes to be used by vessels fishing in the west of area VIa and requiring that these vessels' fishing gear incorporate square mesh panels in certain circumstances.  It also includes a ban on the use of certain fishing gears, including gill nets.  These measures continue to apply under current EU Regulations with some limited amendments introduced.  The Regulations apply until the end of December 2012.In addition, EU Fisheries Councils in November 2008 adopted a new Cod Recovery Plan, as set out in Council Regulation (EC) No. 1342/2008.  Under these Regulations, Ireland and other Member States were required to introduce and implement a licensing regime to manage limits on the number of days their vessels can fish in areas VIa (north west of Ireland) and VIIa (the Irish Sea) using specified gear types.  This regime only applies to vessels greater than 10 metres in length.

He also joined the Organic Farming Scheme (OFS) in 2010.  Payment under the OFS and AEOS for land submitted under the Traditional Hay Meadow or Species Rich Grassland is primarily based on the same principle which is income foregone due to the reduction of fertilizer inputs or restricted access for production.  From an EU perspective, payment under both Schemes on the same parcel is regarded as a "double payment" and is not permissible.Accordingly, to regularise this situation and to avoid "double payment", my Department wrote to the person named and indicated that he should either (i) withdraw from OFS or AEOS, or (ii) continue in AEOS and remain eligible for full payment in respect of land declared under this scheme while continuing to farm organically and receive OFS payment on all other lands farmed organically. No recoupment will be sought in respect of monies already paid. The person named has appealed this decision to the Agriculture Appeals Office which is currently reviewing the case.

During these checks a query was identified regarding the traditional hay meadow parcel.  My Department has been in contact with the persons named regarding this issue and once successfully resolved the application will be processed with a view to making payment in respect of 2010 at the earliest opportunity.Payment in respect of the 2011 Scheme year is subject to a similar administrative checking process which includes verification of capital investment through checks on receipts.  During these checks queries were identified in relation to the capital expenditure claim of the persons named. My Department has made contact with the persons named regarding these matters and the application will be further processed upon receipt of a response to these queries.

Following a European Court of Justice Judgement in 2010 only data relating to beneficiaries who are legal persons are being published.  Details of natural persons cannot be published as a consequence of this Judgement.  As forestry grant payments are fully State funded there is no obligation on the Department to publish details of recipients, whether they are natural or legal persons. It is not the practice of my Department to give financial details of individual grant recipients.

Detailed instructions and guidelines for ante-mortem inspection include taking note of the numbers of birds which are dead on arrival and evidence of dirty birds as well as other factors which may suggest a welfare problem at the farm. Where there is evidence to suggest that there may be an on-farm welfare issue, procedures are in place to communicate this evidence, not just to the farmer, but also to the District Veterinary Office (DVO) for the county in which the farm of origin is situated, which can then investigate at farm level.Evidence of broken bones is usually detected at post-mortem inspection and is usually a sign of improper handling during the catching of the birds. Again this is communicated to the relevant DVO and investigated as appropriate.  Each slaughter establishment keeps mortality figures for consignments delivered and is required to make these available to the official veterinarian.  The information available to the Department indicates that in 2011 the number of broilers which were dead on arrival at slaughterhouses represented approximately 0.18% of the total slaughtered. In the same year, ante-mortem injuries accounted for 0.02% of the number slaughtered.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1522	The Hygiene Package of regulation, which came into force in all European Union Member States on 1 January 2006, provides as follows in relation to cleanliness of livestock being presented for slaughter.  Food business operators (FBOs) rearing animals or producing primary products of animal origin are to take adequate measures, as appropriate and as far as possible, to ensure the cleanliness of animals going to slaughter and, where necessary, production animals.  FBOs operating slaughterhouses must have intake procedures to guarantee that each animal or, where appropriate, each lot of animals accepted onto the slaughterhouse premises is clean. In the event of failure to comply with any of the requirements the FBO must notify the official veterinarian and take appropriate measures.The official veterinarian is to verify compliance with the FBO's duty under Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 to ensure that animals that have such hide conditions that there is an unacceptable risk of contamination of the meat during slaughter are not slaughtered for human consumption unless they are cleaned beforehand.  Post-mortem examination is carried out on all species of slaughtered animals. On detection of faecal contamination by the Department appointed inspector, measures are taken to remove the risk of entry of any faecally contaminated meat to the human food chain.My Department does not maintain a central database for the collation of data relating to faecal contamination for all species. The Department does however require FBOs at bovine slaughtering establishments to categorise the animals as follows:A— Cattle that can be slaughtered, without an unacceptable risk of contaminating the meat during the slaughter process by using the standard hygienic dressing procedures routinely employed by the plant;B— Cattle that can only be slaughtered without an unacceptable risk of contamination of the meat during the slaughter process, by putting in place extra defined hygienic dressing controls;C— Cattle unfit for slaughter because of hide condition. These cattle must not be presented for ante mortem and it is the responsibility of the FBO to take the required remedial action with regard to these cattle.I can advise the Deputy that the percentages of bovines in each category in 2010 were as follows:A — 75%;B — 24%;C — less than 1%.The corresponding figures for 2011 were:A — 78%;B — 21%;C — less than 1%.Comparable statistics are not available for 2009.My Department has also actively publicised the requirements for primary producers to ensure that animals being sent for slaughter are clean, as well as guidance in that regard. This approach has included publication of articles in the farming press, information leaflets and mailshots to producers who have supplied animals that were categorised as less than fully compliant with the required level of cleanliness.

These plants are supervised by 53 veterinary inspectors (VIs) employed by the Department, assisted in their duties by 180 agricultural officers (AOs) and by temporary veterinary inspectors (TVIs) who are drawn from a pool of approximately 700 in total and contracted from private practice on a rota basis. Smaller local abattoirs are supervised by local authorities, operating under service contract to the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.The numbers of the different species processed on a per hour basis in establishments which operate under the supervision of my Department vary depending on factors such as the size of the plant, the level of automation and overall throughput. Hourly throughput rates vary from approximately 5,000 to 12, 000 for broilers; 150 to 370 for pigs; and 150 to 200 for sheep. Cattle slaughter plants typically process about 50 animals per hour.

There are a number of regulations impacting on labelling including those for Marketing Standards, Consumer Information and specific production methods (e.g. Organic farming). Objective standards are set, inter alia, for organic production and for free range production in the poultry and egg sectors.In addition to the general labelling rules which are set out in Directive 2000/12/EC, the general principles of food law set out in Regulation 178/2002 also state that "Without prejudice to more specific provisions of food law, the labelling, advertising and presentation of food or feed, including their shape, appearance or packaging, the packaging materials used, the manner in which they are arranged and the setting in which they are displayed, and the information which is made available through whatever medium, shall not mislead consumers."Against this background, my powers to introduce national legislation in this area are constrained by the available legal bases in EU law.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1528	Under EU Regulations governing the Direct Payment Schemes my Department is required to recover any monies resulting from the application of reductions and/or penalties.  My Department is obliged to recover the amount from either the payment due for the calendar year of application or from payments due in future calendar years if not already repaid in full by the applicant.   Where an administrative fine has been applied the monies owing can be recouped over the course of the three years following the year in which the determination was made, with any outstanding balance at the end of this three year period being cancelled.In the vast majority of cases the penalty represents a reasonably low percentage of the payment due and it would be inappropriate to delay payment pending the outcome of any review.  If the timing of the penalty is such that any review is carried out before payment falls due then the payment is made in full where the penalty decision is overturned on review/appeal. Where a reduced or no payment has issued and the outcome of the review/appeal process results in a change to the reduction/penalty originally applied any monies owing are calculated and processed as a matter of urgency.There is no specific provision in EU regulations governing the right of farmers to seek a review of decisions relating to penalties or to appeal the outcome of any review to the independent appeals office.  The review and appeals machinery was introduced by my Department with a view to ensuring that every decision to impose penalties could be challenged by individual farmers.The value of these schemes to Irish farmers is €1.8bn annually. Therefore it is incumbent on my Department to ensure that the EU regulatory requirements in this regard are implemented in full so as to avoid EU disallowances.

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1530	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1108 to 1110, inclusive, together.Poultry egg production is a small but important component of the Irish agri-food sector. Output is valued at approximately €30 million. Unlike most sectors, the egg sector is largely domestically focused with competition from imports an ongoing issue. Approximately 85% of eggs consumed in Ireland are produced domestically. Food Harvest 2020   targets a 10% increase in the value of overall poultry output including meat, by 2020. The Report makes a number of recommendations, including taking all necessary measures to underpin consumer confidence in Irish product, particularly with regard to disease prevention, continued investment in innovation and value-added output and the adaption of new technologies aimed at improving efficiency and increasing the return on investment.The value of egg exports is small with the vast majority of exported product going to Northern Ireland and the UK. In 2009, exports were worth almost €8.65 million, with values declining to €5.6 million in 2010 and recovering to almost €7.8 million in 2011.There are four distinct egg production methods, namely Organic, Free-Range, Barn and Caged. In terms of the number of production sites in Ireland, Free-Range is the largest, followed by Caged and Organic with Barn being the smallest. Caged production, by virtue of the scale of the bigger operators, accounts for over 57% of the bird numbers with Free-Range accounting for almost 40%.You will be aware of the introduction of the enriched cage production system in January of this year. This animal welfare measure prohibited the sale of eggs produced in older unenriched cages and led to a number of smaller scale and older producers exiting the industry. Some €16 million was allocated under the Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Scheme (TAMS), under the aegis of Ireland's Rural Development Programme, to assist existing producers convert their production systems. While the number of producers declined the size of the national flock remained stable. This was due to those producers remaining in operation expanding the size of their flocks and new large scale entrants.Ireland was compliant with the new enriched cage system by the January deadline and an audit visit by the Food and Veterinary Office in early March confirmed this. A number of EU Member States have not yet complied with the provisions of the Directive and this has led to a decline in production and an increase in the price of eggs in the EU market. The European Commission have expressed the view that,   as more producers become compliant in other Member States, the market will stabilise over the next few months.In addition, Bord Bia continues to promote the Egg Quality Assurance Scheme which is a critically important tool for Irish producers who must compete with imported product.

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1532	As part of the reform of the EU Sugar Regime in 2006, a temporary restructuring scheme was introduced with the aim of reducing EU sugar production to comply with WTO and other international obligations. The Scheme was negotiated and agreed by the EU Council of Agriculture Ministers in the latter part of 2005 and resulted in the formal adoption by Ministers of the EU Council Regulation (EC) No 320/2006, which governs the operation of this voluntary EU restructuring scheme. Restructuring, in this context refers to the abandonment of sugar quota production and the allocation of restructuring aid to the affected processors, growers and machinery contractors.Greencore, the sole holder of the entire Irish sugar quota at that time, decided to avail of this voluntary sugar restructuring scheme, and accordingly the company renounced the quota and dismantled the last remaining sugar factory in Mallow in compliance with the conditions of the scheme.  This was a commercial decision taken by Greencore having regard to the prevailing market situation.The total compensation package negotiated at the Council of Agriculture Ministers' meetings in November 2005, in the context of the reform of the EU sugar regime, and as further modified in 2007, was worth a total of €353 million to Ireland. This sum was made up of €220 million to beet growers, €6 million to machinery contractors and €127 million to Greencore. The beet growers' share was made up of restructuring aid of €53 million, diversification aid of €44 million and €123 million via the Single Farm Payment. All elements of the Restructuring Scheme have now been implemented, not just within Ireland but across the EU.As Minister, I hold a Special Share in Greencore. This share has the same monetary value as any other share in the company but has conditions attached which prevent the company from engaging in a number of activities without the prior written consent of the Minister. However, the Special Share does not empower me to get involved in operational matters or normal business decisions made by the company.In relation to the issue of quota ownership, the EU Commission confirmed at the time that the sugar quota is not an asset owned by the Member State or any other party but is simply a mechanism for regulating the sugar market.
Current Situation
The present EU sugar regime runs from 1 September 2006 to the 30 September 2015, in accordance with the prevailing EU Regulations. There is no mechanism under the current Regulations which would allow for the re-instatement of the sugar quota for the growing of sugar beet in Ireland for the production of sugar. Of course, sugar beet has always been grown here to be used as animal fodder.I know the Deputy is aware that I have strongly supported the full abolition of sugar quotas from September 2015 as part of the CAP reform discussions which are currently underway in the Council of Ministers, and which, if agreed, would replace the existing quota regime. This would enable interested parties to re-engage in the production of sugar. I also raised the issue with the Agriculture Commissioner Ciolos during his recent visit to Ireland. In this regard, I have met in 2011 with two separate groups who have conducted feasibility studies, into the possibility of establishing a sugar/bioethanol facility here. At both meetings, I stated that any venture to develop a combined sugar/bioethanol production facility would have to be a commercial proposition, financed in total by investors and interested parties and make sound economic sense in order to be viable.

I understand that the National Association of Regional Game Councils maintain records of all pest species.

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1536	My Department has introduced a number of changes recently into the bovine TB eradication scheme with a view to confining TB to the area/herd where it is first disclosed and to protect herdowners with clear herds from buying in infected animals.  These measures were explained to and discussed with the farming organisations prior to their introduction.It has long been recognised and research confirms that outbreaks of TB cluster within an area.  With regard the new controls on the movement of animals out of herds which are contiguous to or neighbouring a herd experiencing an active high risk TB breakdown: in 2011, within the 8,014 herds tested under the contiguous test programme, the risk of disclosing TB was almost 3 times greater than the risk in the case of herds tested on a round test. In view of the fact that 2,256 test reactors were disclosed amongst the almost 800,000 animals tested in the contiguous herds, the risk of TB spreading from such herds is very significant.In light of this evidence, my Department has decided that herds which (i) are contiguous to an active TB breakdown (high risk designation) (ii) are identified as epidemiologically relevant to the breakdown and (iii) which have not had a full herd test within the previous 4 months will be trade restricted pending a full herd test. Such herds are permitted to move cattle direct to slaughter and to buy-in cattle under permit. They will also be immediately de-restricted once they pass a TB herd test.Prior to this change, herdowners which were contiguous to a high risk breakdown were permitted to move animals from their holdings pending the TB test. Many herdowners took advantage of this arrangement to sell on cattle which subsequently tested positive in the buyer's herd, thereby causing that herd to be restricted for a minimum period of 4-months.I should also emphasise that the policy of my Department in relation to the identification of relevant contiguous herds has not changed and that each contiguous herd is assessed on its merits from an epidemiological perspective before determining its relevance for testing. The only difference in approach now is that any such herds which have not had a clear test within the previous 4 months must be tested before animals can be sold onto the open market.  The choice of four months as the benchmark period against which to evaluate the necessity for a contiguous test is not a new criterion — this has been the parameter used heretofore. The four month period is not arbitrary but is related to the time interval from when an animal may be exposed to infection and the expectation that a test will give a positive result, if the animal is infected.I am satisfied that the recent changes, which aim to confine disease to the area/herd where it is first disclosed and protect clear herds, will result in fewer herd restrictions and lead to a more effective TB eradication programme.

In order to help prevent the spread of animal disease, before moving to any other Member State, all circuses with animals and all animal acts must be registered with the relevant authority (in Ireland the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine) and must comply with certain conditions.  These conditions require that the animals are clinically healthy, that the place of departure is not subject to any animal health restrictions and that all testing and vaccination requirements are met. The species covered by this legislation are all mammals (including bats), birds, bees, salmon and trout. Registered circuses/circus acts require a Register of Animals, Animal Passports and a Venue Register, All movements must be notified by the exporting country on a movement system (TRACES). Accordingly no import licences are required.

National Parks and Wildlife Service, Inland Fisheries Ireland and Meath County Council made no comments or observations.The Forest Service Archaeologist consulted the National Monuments Service of the Department of the Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  On this basis, the archaeologist approved the licence subject to certain conditions as follows:—1. Coillte must submit a detailed plan for the removal of trees from the monument and/or its immediate environs for the prior consideration and agreement of the Forest Service Archaeologist and the agreement of the National Monuments Service.  This must be submitted at least 3 weeks in advance of the felling commencement date.2. Pre-felling archaeological works must be carried out by a suitably qualified archaeologist.3. The regional Harvesting Manager, the local Forest or Environmental Managers, the Coillte Archaeologist, or other consultant archaeologist should contact the Forest Service Archaeologist in advance of inspecting the monument.The licence was issued, with the Forest Service Archaeologist's conditions attached, on the 11th April 2011.Coillte employed a consultant archaeologist, who compiled an Archaeological Impact Assessment and plan.  A copy of this plan was submitted to both the Forest Service and the National Monuments Service in early November 2011.  It was then considered jointly by the National Monuments Service and the Forest Service Archaeologist.The National Monuments Service requested that the sensitivity of the site be emphasised with Coillte's consultant archaeologist.  It also emphasised the necessity of ensuring, as per the plan, that an archaeologist would be present to continuously monitor the works in and around the souterrain.  This was conveyed to Coillte by the Forest Service Archaeologist.In response to complaint by a member of the public when the felling commenced, the relevant Coillte regional Environment Manager was contacted.  He informed the Forest Service that no trees have been felled within 50 metres of the monument and that the consultant archaeologist was scheduled to be on site from the morning of 4th April 2012, i.e. before Coillte commenced works in that area.The Coillte regional Environment Manager had also undertaken a wider appraisal of the site from an environmental perspective prior to any works commencing and identified an additional ‘cultural feature', namely a stone lined well, which was also marked off and protected.  The Forest Service Archaeologist inspected the site in person on the morning of 4th April 2012, examined the condition of the souterrain before any works had commenced near it, and spoke to the harvesting crew and Coillte's consultant archaeologist.  The Forest Service Archaeologist re-inspected the site again on the morning of 6th April 2012 and examined the souterrain and its environs after felling in that area had been completed. No evident damage of any nature has occurred to the monument.  The stone-lined well is similarly intact and undisturbed.  A report on the archaeological monitoring undertaken by Coillte's consultant archaeologist has since been received by the Forest Service Archaeologist and copied to the National Monuments Service.  On the basis of this extensive preparation and its own inspections, the Forest Service of my Department is satisfied that a sufficient archaeological survey has been carried out and that Coillte took sufficient and appropriate action to protect all archaeology at the site.There are no known protected bird species at this site and, therefore, no special conditions must be attached to a felling licence in relation to felling within the nesting season.  Coillte is aware of its obligations under current legislation and must harvest its trees in accordance with current legislation and good forestry practice.

The vessel has not been licensed by the Sea Fishing Boat Licensing Authority since September 2010.  In relation to mackerel, the Minister introduced new management arrangements in late 2010 following a long and detailed consultation process with the fishing industry.  Mackerel allocations were made available to vessel owners based on track record from the two best years 2007, 2008, 2009. Vessels were allocated an individual allocation of mackerel based on having caught more than 35% of the mackerel allocated to them in an average of 2 of the reference years.  In order to qualify for Tier 1 allocations, a vessel had to have landed more than an average of 275 tonnes of mackerel per year.  To qualify for a Tier 2 allocation, a vessel had to have landed more than 25 tonnes of mackerel per year.  The vessel referred to by the Deputy did not have the necessary track record.  Prior to the introduction of the new management arrangements, the vessel would have qualified as an "Under 65ft" vessel for participation in the mackerel fishery.  The Sea Fisheries Protection Authority has provided details of mackerel landings by the vessel in question since 2000.  The records show that the vessel landed over the 11 year period 2000 to 2010 in total 29 tonnes of mackerel and landed less than 1 tonne of mackerel in total in the reference years 2007, 2008 and 2009.The vessel in question qualifies for participation in the herring fisheries in the Celtic Sea or in the North West under the management arrangements that have been in place over recent years.  The Sea Fisheries Protection Authority has provided details of herring landings by the vessel in question since 2000.  The records show that the vessel landed over the 11 year period 2000 to 2010 in total 17 tonnes of herring and landed less than 1 tonne of herring in total  since 2006 (2007-2010).  In relation to herring fisheries, I am currently concluding a full review of the management arrangements for herring which has involved a detailed consultation with industry.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1557	The Food Harvest report published in 2010, offers a vision for the long-term development of the agri food sector and in the case of the beef sector, targets an increase of 20% in the value of beef output in the period to 2020.  Having regard to the dramatic price and other developments since then, the Beef Activation Group, which was established to identify the specific actions needed to achieve these targets, suggested in 2011 that a more ambitious target of 40% growth in output could be set.That report suggests that there is market demand to support growth in the suckler and dairy herds. Maximising beef output potential from the national herd is contingent on a number of factors, not least on the price of beef on EU and international markets.  In light of current and future market developments, it is essential that a co-ordinated approach is taken by stakeholders to improve efficiency at farm and processing level, to breed better animals, maintain high standards of quality and food safety and maximise the market potential of Ireland's unique natural advantages.My Department and its agencies are playing their part.  Despite the significant budgetary pressures in 2012, I have provided €26 million to maintain the Suckler Cow Scheme, which underpins improvements in welfare and breeding that are critically important for the future development of the sector.  To date, my Department has paid out more than €127 million under this scheme, and the animal welfare measures have contributed directly to improved prices for weanlings and enhanced the reputation of Irish livestock and beef.The Beef Activation Group Report highlighted the need to equip beef farmers to improve efficiency, reduce costs and adopt best practice at farm level. With that in mind I have, following extensive consultation with stakeholders, introduced a €5 million Beef Technology Adoption Programme.  To date my Department has received more than 7,000 applications for the scheme.  Livestock farmers in the BTAP will be equipped to adopt a more businesslike approach to running their farm enterprises which will reduce costs and improve profitability.I am also providing substantial strategic support for the beef sector through the activities of State Agencies.  Bord Bia's beef marketing strategy is one of product differentiation and premiumisation to assist the industry in targeting the best customers across Europe.  Since 2007, we have seen a doubling of the volume of Irish beef going to premium retail and food service and a rise of 15% in the volumes destined for standard retail lines.  This equates to over 50,000 tonnes going to better paying outlets. Bord Bia is also developing a strong sustainability message around its Beef Quality Assurance Scheme, and in that context has secured accreditation for its beef carbon footprint model.  Bord Bia's Beef and Lamb Quality Assurance Scheme is the first such scheme world wide to include environmental criteria.On the production side, Teagasc is working with the processing industry on research projects investigating dairy beef production and on optimal young bull production, and my Department is continuing to make a substantial financial contribution to the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation to support its efforts to improve breed quality.Insofar as international trade is concerned, I have been extremely active in developing relationships in new and expanding markets in order to build the kind of confidence in Irish production and control systems that provide a platform for long-term trading relationships in the future.  As part of that effort, I am at present leading a trade delegation in China, to help to develop trade opportunities for Irish food business operators.  In addition, my Department has engaged with a range of third countries, including Australia, the Philippines, South Korea, Turkey, Egypt, Algeria and others, with a view to opening new markets and expanding the presence of Irish food products in existing markets.I should also mention the critical importance of a strong and effective Common Agricultural Policy in supporting farm incomes in the period to 2020, and I am committed to negotiating the best possible deal for Irish farmers in the context of CAP post 2013.The Deputy will be aware that there have been dramatic price developments in global markets in recent times, based on demand and supply dynamics, and Irish beef prices have risen by 21% over the past year.  I am confident that if the correct approach is taken by all stakeholders, there will be tremendous opportunities for the Irish beef sector in the coming years. I can assure the Deputy that my Department and its agencies will continue to play their part in creating an environment which will enable the beef industry to grow and develop to its full potential in the years ahead.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1558	I very much welcome the fact that the declining trend in numbers in our national flock is showing signs of reversal and our sheep numbers are now increasing. This reflects a growing sense of confidence amongst sheep farmers in terms of rebuilding breeding stock numbers which will ultimately lead to an increase in through-put. Whilst it is still too early to provide an accurate estimate for the 2012 lamb crop, it is estimated that it will be up in the order of 1-2%.  The market performance of the sheep sector, in common with other agricultural sectors, is a function of supply and demand.  The long-term future of the sector will depend on its ability to satisfy the market and in order to do this well it must focus on competitiveness, innovation and the demands of the consumer.The Food Harvest 2020 Strategy includes specific recommendations for the sheep sector. It envisages that over the coming years, demand for sheepmeat on the European market will outstrip production levels, which could provide opportunities for exporting countries such as Ireland.  This should provide the potential for better returns, provided the industry can continue the market and product diversification which has been evident in recent years.  At producer level there is likely to be improved price prospects, provided an increased focus on production, efficiency and product quality is evident.  Based on a renewed commercial focus by the sheep sector, building consumption on the domestic market and through the implementation of the recommendations of Food Harvest 2020, the industry has targeted a growth in output value of 20% by 2020.The recommendations of the report focus on farm competitiveness and the processing sector.  On the farm side, they emphasise the importance of the continuance of the application of on-farm labour efficiencies and new technologies, breed improvement and the production of a quality product.  On the processing side, the focus is on efficiencies, innovation and improved product range.There has been significant public investment in the sheep sector in recent years. Key supports for this sector include €7 million from the 2009 Single Farm Payment National Reserve under the Uplands Sheep Payment Scheme and €54 million for the three-year Grassland Sheep Scheme which commenced in 2010.  The grassland Sheep Scheme is proving to be a valuable support mechanism in terms of improving income and confidence in the sector.  The sheep fencing/mobile handling equipment scheme, one of five Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Schemes (TAMS), which was re-opened to applications last December, will enable many farmers in the sheep sector to complete the necessary investment works in order to maintain competitiveness and introduce increased efficiencies on their farm and so secure the future of their enterprises.  All of the supports I have outlined have provided a significant incentive to farmers to maintain their production levels, which is vital for the future of a viable sheep industry in Ireland.  Teagasc has also allocated almost €1.5 million for sheep research for 2012.In addition, Bord Bia will also spend over €1.1 million this year on a promotional strategy for the Irish sheep sector which addresses the issue of safeguarding the future of the sector in the following ways:By encouraging Irish consumers to buy more Quality Assured lamb.By collaborating with its French and English counterparts in a campaign to reverse the decline in consumption of lamb on the French market, which accounts for over 50% of our exports.By working with individual exporters to increase the amount of exports to higher value markets such as Germany and Scandinavia and thereby reduce Ireland's dependency on the French market.On another positive note, sheep meat exports to International markets almost doubled to 600 tonnes during the course of 2011.  This generates a great confidence boost for Irish exporters.  While almost 99% of our lamb exports are to the EU, it is always beneficial to have a wide range of outlets available and to this end my Department, together with Bord Bia and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade continues to work to secure access to more third country outlets for Irish lamb.  There is strong demand for all meats globally at present and my Department and I remain committed in our efforts to ensure that the Irish sheep sector is able to take full advantage of all of the opportunities that will arise as a result of this demand.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1559	The Food Harvest 2020 report sets out the strategic vision for the agri-food and fishing sector.  From a dairying perspective, the ending of milk quotas in 2015 represents an exceptional opportunity to increase milk output, and Food Harvest has targeted a 50% increase in milk production in the period to 2020.  This target is ambitious but I also believe it is realistic, because the dairy sector has the capability to expand at producer and at processor level. In that context, the Dairy Expansion Activation Group established to identify specific actions needed to deliver on the Food Harvest targets, has produced a Road Map setting out 55 actions required to achieve the 50% increase in milk production.  All of the stakeholders are being encouraged to discharge the responsibilities assigned to them, and the response will be monitored and reported on.  Key areas for action include the identification of markets, the improvement of efficiency at processing level and improving production efficiency at farm level.  While many of these actions will be taken at commercial level, my Department and its agencies are working with industry to provide a framework to support the necessary development, and I am personally chairing the High Level Implementation Committee in order to monitor progress and take appropriate action to support the successful implementation of Food Harvest 2020.Exports of dairy products in 2011 were valued at €2.66 billion, an increase of 17% on the previous year.  Ireland already has access to markets worldwide and exports dairy products to over eighty countries.  Nonetheless I am working with industry to raise the profile of the Irish dairy sector, and the Irish agri-food sector generally, in emerging markets in the Far East, North Africa and elsewhere.  I have been very active in developing relationships in new and expanding markets in order to build the kind of confidence in Irish production and control systems that provide a platform for long-term trading relationships in the future.  As part of that effort, I am at present leading a trade mission to China to further develop this important relationship, and to meet my ministerial counterparts in the Agriculture and Quarantine Ministries to help raise the profile of the Irish agri-food industry, including the dairy sector, in China.At farm level, my Department provides €6 million per annum through the Dairy Efficiency Scheme to encourage the adoption of technology and best practice at farm level. This scheme will help to equip farmers with the knowledge and skills necessary to maximise their output, reduce their costs of production and increase margins.  In addition, a Dairy Equipment Scheme to encourage capital investment at farm level is available under the TAMS (Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Scheme) to ensure farmers are equipped to gear up for expansion.  The scheme provides grant aid for milking machines, cooling equipment and other ancillary items.In addition, a number of incentives were introduced in this year's budget to encourage new farmers including a stock relief incentive for milk production partnerships, a stamp duty reduction on agricultural land and restructuring of retirement relief.In addition Teagasc, which is funded by my Department, provides research, education and advice at both farm and processing level and is working closely with industry in the critically important product development area, while Bord Bia is working with operators in the sector on the development of an accredited sustainability model.It should not be forgotten, that in recent years the dairy sector has experienced severe volatility in product prices, primarily caused by an imbalance of supply and demand in international markets.  However, while there will always be short term fluctuations in dairy prices, the medium term prospects for global dairy markets are good.  Growth in global population and wealth is forecast to stimulate strong levels of demand for dairy products.  Against that background, I believe that prospects and opportunities for the dairy sector will expand significantly over the coming years and I can assure the Deputy that my Department and its agencies will continue to play their part in providing an appropriate framework to support the development of this critically important industry.

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1561	Phosphorus is an essential nutrient for agriculture, necessary for both production of herbage, such as crops and grassland but also as an important mineral for animal production. It is also an expensive nutrient for Irish agriculture and if present in excess quantities can result in diminished water qualities. It is indeed correct to state that it is a mineral of finite supply.A number of estimates have been made as to the longevity of this resource, but these estimates vary significantly. One such estimate indicates that the viable reserves of phosphate rock could last from as low as 48 years to as high as 235 years depending on usage patterns.The European Communities (Good Agricultural Practice for the protection of Waters) Regulations 2010, commonly described as the Nitrates Regulations, which is administered by both the Department of Environment and Local Government and my own Department sets out the appropriate limits for application of phosphorus on crops and grassland. This, while aimed principally at preventing negative impacts on water quality arising from excess application of phosphorus to land, also ensures that this scare resource is applied at appropriate levels on Irish farms.In addition, both my own Department and Teagasc provides guidance on the most efficient use of organic manures such as slurry (including from the Pig and Poultry sector) which are a very good source of phosphorus ensuring that effective recycling of this nutrient takes place on farms. The overall usage of fertiliser phosphorus in Agriculture in Ireland has decreased from 62,000 tons in 1995 to 29,000 tons in 2010.In relation to the recovery of phosphate from waste water treatment systems, I am advised that it is both difficult and expensive to separate out phosphorus on its own from waste water systems. However as it tends to be bound up in sewage sludge, the recycling of treated sewage sludge (biosolids) to agriculture in accordance with the Waste Management (Use of Sewage Sludge in Agriculture) Regulations, is, in effect, the recycling of phosphorus (as well as organic material) from wastewater treatment to agriculture.

#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1572	Under the Child Care Act, 1991, the Health Service Executive has a duty to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care or protection. The policy of the HSE is to place children in care settings, preferably in foster care, as close as possible to their home and community. The vast majority  of children in care are in foster care and residential care.  Some children have highly specialised needs arising from severe behaviour difficulties, in some cases as a result of injury,  accident or disability  or in others due to their childhood experiences. The care needs of these children are generally met by directly provided services or services commissioned by the HSE within Ireland. From time to time the HSE places children in single residential placements with specialised therapeutic inputs from child psychiatry and psychology to meet the needs of the children.  There are three designated special care units in the country; Ballydowd in Dublin, Glenn Álainn in Cork and Coovagh House in Limerick where children are detained on order of the high court for their own safety.  In addition, there are two designated national High Support Units at Crannog Nua, Portrane in north County Dublin and Rath na nÓg in Castleblayney, Co Monaghan.  These units provide, through on site education, higher staff ratios and therapeutic inputs an individualised programme of support for children and young people with exceptional needs through the provision of a time-limited, therapeutic intervention in a secure or non-secure environment as appropriate. The HSE has developed a business plan for the delivery of a national Special Care Services with a particular focus on improving governance and development and innovation. The business plan highlights the importance of improving the model of service delivery to develop a service that can cater for the needs of these most vulnerable and challenging children.For a small number of children, the HSE is, on occasion, required to make arrangements for the placement of children in care and treatment facilities outside of the State, primarily in the UK, to allow for access to an individually tailored mix of psychiatric treatment, care and therapeutic services not available in this country. This is done on as infrequent a basis as possible and only where such placement is considered to be in the best interest of the child.  I should emphasise that the referral of persons abroad for specialised therapeutic interventions is an established feature within our health and social care system and decisions in each case are made in the best interests of the individual.  The level of requirement for these services is closely monitored by the National Director and my officials.I am advised by the HSE that there are 7 young people detained in secure accommodation abroad on foot of high court orders as of 16 April 2012.  The HSE ensure that these placements are suitable and the child's social worker visits regularly, and makes arrangements for family or carers of the child to also visit. The units in which the children are placed are inspected and  regulated by their national authorities and the HSE is attentive to the standards of care delivered in these specialised units.  I have asked the HSE to provide information regarding the cost to the Exchequer and I will forward this to the Deputy as soon as it is available.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1573	It is a matter of concern to me that historically in Ireland we have seen only a very limited number of published reports into the deaths of children in care. It is for this reason that I am supportive of the work of the Independent Review Group on Child Deaths which was tasked with reviewing files held by the HSE relating to the deaths of children and young people over a ten year period who were in care or known to the HSE. The Review Group was asked to review the deaths of children and young people in the following three categories:in care within the meaning of the Child Care Act 1991 at the time of their death;in receipt of aftercare within the meaning of Section 45 of the Child Care Act 1991 at the time of their death;known to the child protection services within the meaning of the HIQA guidance to the HSE of 20 January, 2010 at the time of their death.The Review Group was also asked to make recommendations on how child protection responses can be strengthened, based on the learning identified from the documentation under review. This is a very significant body of work and I very much hope that the resulting report will help to guide our approach to strengthening our child protection system, where particular deficits have been identified.  The findings of a number of previous reports relating to the welfare and protection of children, notably the Roscommon report, have already helped to guide policy makers and practitioners working in this field.  The Government has set out a very challenging programme of work designed to reform and strengthen the delivery of child protection services and improved safeguarding of children. Key initiatives include:The publication of revised Children First  Guidance, which was launched last year.The preparation of legislation as a priority to put the Children First   Guidance on a statutory basis.The establishment of an inter-Department Committee to oversee the consistent implementation of Children First   across all sectors.The holding of a Constitutional referendum on children's rights, which is planned for later this year.The introduction of external inspection of child protection services by the Health Information and Quality Authority to ensure that services are being delivered to the highest standard.The establishment of a dedicated Child and Family Support Agency, which will be led by the HSE's National Director for Children and Family Services, Gordon Jeyes, as part of a wide ranging reform programme under way across children and family services.The change programme is addressing the quality and consistency of child welfare and protection services.  This change process will continue into the new Child and Family Support Agency where Gordon Jeyes will be the first Chief Executive.  An open recruitment process is under way for a number of key senior positions for the Agency.  I hope that this process delivers a very strong team to work with Gordon in leading the improvement of children's services.Enhanced accountability is also an important feature of the reforms.  This greater transparency is already evident in the provision for the first time of a dedicated budget of €550 million for Children and Family Services in 2012.  This will bring greater transparency and control to budgetary management and pave the way for the establishment of the new Agency in 2013.  I am determined that the measures I have described above will create a new and revitalised service delivery framework for our children.

Under the provisions of the legislation, such adoptions may take place up to the end of October 2012, with the possibility of the Adoption Authority granting approval for an extension of up to one year.The Hague Convention is a co-operative agreement drawn up to allow countries to mutually support one another in protecting the best interests of children in the intercountry adoption process. It is a minimum set of standards in intercountry adoption in areas such as subsidiarity, consent and financial considerations. It is designed in such a way as to allow for mirrored mechanisms and structures to mutually assure countries of the safety and standard of intercountry adoptions in those countries.  The Adoption Authority of Ireland (AAI) performs the function of a Central Authority under the Adoption Act 2010, in accordance with the Convention. In choosing to deal primarily with Hague countries, the AAI has the mechanism to work collaboratively with equivalent structures in that country. Each Central Authority has the responsibility to oversee standards in respect of those parts of the process taking place within their respective jurisdictions. This mutual arrangement is designed to give the AAI, the Government and, most importantly, those involved in the adoption process assurance as to the standards being set and the oversight of the system.  Russia has not ratified the Hague Convention and there appears to be no immediate prospect that this will happen.  In the circumstances, adoptions from Russia, beyond those provided for under the transitional arrangements, may only be possible under a bi-lateral agreement developed to the standards of the Hague Convention.An official delegation from Ireland recently visited Russia and held preliminary discussions regarding the potential for a bilateral agreement. I have received an initial assessment from the Adoption Authority which will inform the next steps to be taken in relation to this matter. My Department is in discussions with the Adoption Authority on this assessment and other issues which will influence any policy decisions to be taken in this regard. I am aware of the need to bring clarity to the situation in respect of Russia and I hope to be in a position to do so shortly.The immediate priority of the Adoption Authority is the development of administrative arrangements with other countries which have ratified the Hague Convention.  Any future bilateral arrangements which might be entered into would also be required by law to meet the minimum standards set out in the Convention.

In addition, pursuant to Section 63 of the Adoption Act 2010, the AAI has, since 1st November, 2010 issued 556 revised Declarations to persons who were already in possession of a valid Declaration of Eligibility and Suitability issued prior to 1st November 2010 by the former Adoption Board.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1576	A total of €1.7m (approximately) in funding has been available from 2010 to date for the specific support of the provision of youth cafés. The bulk of this funding was allocated to the dedicated competitive funding scheme announced in 2010.  The majority of the funds awarded from this scheme (approximately €1.5m) were distributed to the successful projects in 2011 and the facilities are gradually coming on stream. A further €200,000 was made available by my Department to various youth café projects in late 2011. This brings the total funding (to date) to circa €1.7m. The funding was designed to both provide completely new youth cafés and to support existing youth cafés who needed assistance in providing additional facilities etc.My Department is committed to supporting the development of quality, front-line youth work projects and services which address the changing needs of young people and communities. A key element of this is to support the continued nationwide development of youth café facilities given the considerable benefits they offer for young people to meet in safe drug and alcohol free spaces and most importantly the identification of the need for such spaces by young people themselves.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs now estimates that between 75-100 youth café facilities now operate across the state and are seen as hugely beneficial to local communities in terms of broader engagement with young people. The projects are in many cases run directly by or in partnership with young people and are popular with teenagers and young people generally. We must ensure therefore that we focus any funding supports to support as many as possible of the existing locations as well as providing targeted funding for new locations.  My Department is currently looking at what capital funding will be available in 2012.   I must stress that this is capital funding and one of the criteria for the provision of funding will be that projects would be sustainable into the future as it is not expected that current funding will be available to provide ongoing support to these projects.

The ratification of the Hague Convention by Vietnam, the associated changes in Vietnamese law and the arrangements being put in place to support on the ground implementation represent significant changes in the intercountry adoption regime in that country.I took the opportunity to visit Vietnam in recent months and met with the Vietnamese authorities. My visit coincided with a visit of a delegation from the Adoption Authority of Ireland  to Vietnam to discuss administrative matters in relation to intercountry adoptions on foot of Vietnam's recent ratification of the Hague Convention.Under section 72 of the Adoption Act 2010, the Adoption Authority may enter into administrative arrangements with another contracting State.  In this context, the Authority has prepared and submitted to the Vietnamese authorities a suggested scheme of administrative arrangements to be established between Ireland and Vietnam for the resumption of intercountry adoption between the two States. The Authority is awaiting the response of the Vietnamese authorities to this proposal.The Adoption Authority has also recently announced its registration of one accredited body for the purposes of adoption mediation within Vietnam. Further applications from other bodies remain under consideration by the Authority and a decision is anticipated shortly in this regard. Agencies accredited by the Adoption Authority of Ireland also require the approval of the Vietnamese authorities.

About 66,000 children, that is approximately 95% of children in the year before school, are availing of the free pre-school provision at this time.Children qualify for the free pre-school year where they are aged more than 3 years 2 months and less than 4 years 7 months at 1 September in the relevant year.  Children born between 2 February 2008 and 30 June 2009 will qualify for the free pre-school year in September 2012 and children born between 2 February 2009 and 30 June 2010 will qualify for the programme in September 2013.   There are no exceptions for children who are below the qualifying age.The objective of the ECCE programme is to make early learning in a formal setting available to eligible children in the year before they commence primary school.  To achieve this, services participating in the pre-school year are expected to provide age-appropriate activities and programmes to children within a particular age cohort.  For this reason, it is appropriate to set minimum and maximum limits to the age range within which children will qualify.As the child referred to by the Deputy was born in November 2009, she will be eligible for the free pre-school year in September 2013.

The Authority has responsibility for the direct operational implementation of legislation and Government policy.Adoptions between Ireland and India must comply with the terms and conditions of the 1993 Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption.  The Hague Convention is a co-operative agreement drawn up to allow countries to mutually support one another in protecting the best interests of children in the intercountry adoption process. It is designed in such a way as to allow for mirrored mechanisms and structures to mutually assure countries of the safety and standard of intercountry adoptions in those countries.  The Adoption Authority of Ireland (AAI) performs the function of a Central Authority under the Adoption Act, 2010, in accordance with the Convention. In choosing to deal primarily with Hague countries, the AAI has the mechanism to work collaboratively with equivalent structures in that country. Each Central Authority has the responsibility to oversee standards in respect of those parts of the process taking place within their respective jurisdictions. This mutual arrangement is designed to give the AAI, the Government and, most importantly, those involved in the adoption process assurance as to the standards being set and the oversight of the system.I understand from the AAI that the Indian Authorities have recently reviewed and introduced changes to their intercountry adoption system. The AAI has contacted CARA, the Indian Central Authority for intercountry adoptions, to clarify the position in this regard and will continue to provide updates on its website as appropriate. My officials are working with the AAI and liaising with the Department of Foreign Affairs in respect of the matter. Further, the AAI has indicated its intention to visit India as a priority to meet with CARA to discuss matters relating to adoption between the two countries.

The section provides that a declaration of eligibility and suitability expires after 24 months from the date of issuance of the declaration or after a further period of not more than 12 months that the Adoption Authority may specify. The legislation does not make provision for any further extension of declarations. In the event that declarations lapse under the provisions of the legislation the Adoption Authority of Ireland and the HSE will have responsibility for determining the most appropriate approach to the issue of suitability to adopt. I will be guided by their advice in this regard and I have raised the matter with them for clarification.The Adoption Authority launched an online notification and application system on its website on 13 April 2012. This will allow prospective adoptive parents to apply to the Authority for an extension to their Declaration of Eligibility and Suitability in sufficient time before the expiry date of 31 October 2012. Prospective adoptive parents who may not have access to the internet can avail of alternative arrangements, which are outlined on the website.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1581	I recently announced that my Department has begun work on Ireland's first Early Years Strategy. I have received Government approval for the approach I am taking in developing this Strategy as an innovative and dynamic blueprint for the future development of Ireland's Early Years sector aimed at providing a coherent approach to seeking to improve the lives of children from birth to age six.One of the issues of policy which I have identified for consideration in the preparation of the new Strategy is the development of the child-minding sector as a fully-integrated component of early childhood care and education, in particular for the under-one age group.At present pre-school services are regulated under the Child Care (Pre-School Services) (No. 2) Regulations 2006, as provided for under Part VII of the Child Care Act 1991.Services providing care for children who have not yet commenced primary school are required to notify their service to the Pre-School Inspectorate of the Health Service Executive (HSE) and are subject to inspection and report by the Inspectorate on a regular basis.  Services covered by the Regulations include full-time, part-time and sessional services as well as childminders taking care of more than three pre-school children from different families in the childminder's home.Childminders taking care of not more than three pre-school children from different families are not covered by the Regulations, recognising parental choice to place children with friends and neighbours, and the challenges of the over-regulation of the more informal arrangements chosen by parents.The National Guidelines for Childminders, compiled by the National Childcare Co-ordinating Committee which oversees the development of an integrated child-care infrastructure throughout the country, provide guidance to childminders on good practice, and assist them to decide whether they are subject to the Regulations, as well as providing other useful information on the role of the childminder in the provision of child-care services.As is the case with all regulatory requirements, the Child Care Regulations set the minimum standards which services are legally required to comply with.  However, my Department is proactive in monitoring, promoting and developing the highest standards of care and education throughout the sector, including the regulatory environment, given the important role which these services play in this crucial phase of children's lives.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1582	Under the Child Care Act, 1991, the Health Service Executive has a duty to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care or protection. The policy of the HSE is to place children in care settings, preferably in foster care, as close as possible to their home and community. The vast majority of children in care are in foster care and residential care.Some children have highly specialised needs arising from severe behaviour difficulties, in some cases as a result of injury, accident or disability or in others due to their childhood experiences. The care needs of these children are generally met by directly provided services or services commissioned by the HSE within Ireland. From time to time the HSE places children in single residential placements with specialised therapeutic inputs from child psychiatry and psychology to meet the needs of the children.  There are  three  designated special care units in the country; Ballydowd in Dublin, Glenn Álainn in Cork and Coovagh House in Limerick where children are detained on order of the high court for their own safety.   In addition, there are two designated national High Support Units at Crannóg Nua, Portrane in north County Dublin and Rath na nÓg in Castleblayney, Co Monaghan.  These units provide, through on site education, higher staff ratios and therapeutic inputs an individualised programme of support for children and young people with exceptional needs through the provision of a time-limited, therapeutic intervention in a secure or non-secure environment as appropriate. The HSE has developed a business plan for the delivery of a national Special Care Services with a particular focus on improving governance and development and innovation. The business plan highlights the importance of improving the model of service delivery to develop a service that can cater for the needs of these most vulnerable and challenging children.For a small number of children, the HSE is on occasion required to make arrangements for the placement of children in care and treatment facilities outside of the State, primarily in the UK, to allow for access to an individually tailored mix of psychiatric treatment, care and therapeutic services not available in this country. This is done on as infrequent a basis as possible and only where such placement is considered to be in the best interest of the child.  I should emphasise that the referral of persons abroad for specialised therapeutic interventions is an established feature within our health and social care system and decisions in each case are made in the best interests of the individual. The level of requirement for these services is closely monitored by the National Director and my officials.I am advised by the HSE that there are 7 young people detained in secure accommodation abroad on foot of high court orders as of 16 April 2012. However, it would be inappropriate to provide further details regarding the names and locations of these placements. The HSE ensure that these placements are suitable and the child's social worker visits regularly, and makes arrangements for family or carers of the child to also visit. The units in which the children are placed are inspected and regulated by their national authorities and the HSE is attentive to the standards of care delivered in these specialised units.

These instructions set specific conditions to be met in respect of such appointments including sanction of the Minister for Finance and An Taoiseach for appointments made from outside the civil service. In addition, there is a statutory requirement under the Public Service Management Act 1997 to obtain the approval of the Government for the appointment of a Special Adviser.The terms of the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995 and the Standards in Public Office Act 2001 apply to all Ministerial staff appointments, including Special Advisers, and in accordance with these Acts a copy of the appointees' contracts of employment together with details of qualifications are laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. In addition, the Acts provide for each individual appointee, with the exception of the grade of Civilian Driver, to make written statements of registerable interests which could materially influence the appointee in, or in relation to, the performance of official functions.The Civil Service Code of Standards and Behaviour also apply to Ministerial appointees but the Deputy may wish to note that the restrictions on civil servants engaging in political activity under the Code do not apply to Ministerial staff holding temporary unestablished positions in the civil service and whose tenure is coterminous with that of the relevant Minister.I am satisfied that all of the persons appointed by me are appropriately qualified to carry out their official functions.

On 21 February 2012, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence, Deputy Alan Shatter, T.D.  published a Guidance Document on citizenship, parentage, guardianship and travel document issues in relation to children born as a result of surrogacy arrangements entered into outside the State. The Guidance Document provides information to people who intend to enter surrogacy arrangements outside the State on the practical and legal considerations arising under Irish law where the commissioning parents intend to bring the child to live with them in the State.The adoption of children generally is governed by provisions of the Adoption Act 2010. The applicability of adoption law to any individual case is a matter for the Adoption Authority of Ireland.  The policy imperative on which adoption, including intercountry adoption, is based, is to provide alternative families for children who need a permanent alternative care arrangement. Surrogacy is not specifically contemplated in the adoption legislation. As the surrogacy guidance advises, family law provides the principal framework as the key first step. The Guidance advises all those contemplating surrogacy to seek independent legal advice as the issue is complex.

The Authority has responsibility for the direct operational implementation of legislation and Government policy.In November 2011 the AAI commenced a review of the adoption law(s) of Panama, which has ratified the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption. The general review process followed by the AAI in such instances is detailed on the Authority's website. Owing to the variable nature of the process in respect of each individual country, and the need to engage with legal experts in the country being assessed, there is no definitive or set timescale for the completion of such reviews. The AAI will provide all relevant information relating to reviews on its website at the appropriate time.The Hague Convention is a formal state-to-state agreement between countries developed on a multi-lateral basis. If a country has ratified the Hague Convention then the Adoption Authority of Ireland may establish administrative arrangements, as provided for in Section 72 of the Adoption Act 2010. Administrative agreements are designed to underpin the Hague process and are related to the sequence and process arrangements in place to support the safeguards already agreed between states. The Adoption Authority of Ireland works with central authority counterparts in the establishment of administrative agreements.

Dignity 4 Patients received lottery funding of €69,000 from my Department's 2011 allocation of National Lottery Funding towards the once-off cost of providing an office, a website, a helpline and office administration. An application for 2012 Lottery funding has recently been received by my Department from Dignity 4 Patients and is currently being considered.  It must be stressed that lottery funding is once-off discretionary funding and is not intended to provide a source of ongoing revenue funding.On-going funding for any service is a matter for the HSE and accordingly I previously asked the HSE to liaise with Dignity 4 Patients to consider if any additional funding might be approved to support activities which were complementary to services offered by the HSE.  I understand the HSE is currently in contact with Dignity 4 Patients in order to sign off on a Grant Aid Agreement to cover the running costs for the Organisation's County Louth office.The HSE will not be issuing funding to Dignity 4 Patients for counselling services.

#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1609	I presume the Deputy is referring to the assisted living/personal assistant services provided by the Health Service Executive (HSE) to people with a physical and/or sensory disability.The HSE's National Service Plan for 2012 provides for a reduction of 3.7% in funding to specialist disability services.  However, the Plan states that at least 2% of this reduction should not impact on services and needs to be generated from other savings and increased efficiencies.As part of the ongoing work of the HSE's National Consultative Forum on disability services, the HSE in conjunction with representative organisations, service providers and service users, has begun a process to identify and agree a framework for identifying and implementing cost efficiencies. The goal is to minimise the impact on services.The HSE provides a range of assisted living services, including Personal Assistant services, to support individuals to maximise their capacity to live full and independent lives.  In 2011, a total of 1.68 million personal assistant/home support hours were provided to 11,571 persons with a physical and/or a sensory disability. Although the funding allocated to disability services has decreased by 3.7%, the HSE aims to minimise the impact this will have on services users and their families as much as possible.  The HSE is in the process of negotiating with agencies providing personal assistant services around the unit cost of providing this service.

#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1612	Individuals in receipt of financial support under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme contribute 80% of their income and 5% of the value of any assets (including their principal residence) per annum towards the cost of their nursing home care. The principal residence is only included in the financial assessment for the scheme for the first three years that a person is in nursing home care. This is known as the three year cap.The percentages referred to above are prescribed in the primary legislation underpinning the scheme, the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009. In order to decrease the percentage of income and increase the percentage of the principal residence that is taken into account, the Act would need to be amended by further primary legislation.  The Nursing Homes Support Scheme will be three years in operation in October 2012 and will be reviewed shortly. The reason for allowing this period to elapse is to ensure that trends and statistics will be available in order to inform the work.   The review will look at, amongst other issues:the ongoing sustainability of the scheme,the relative cost of public versus private provision,the effectiveness of current methods of negotiating price in private and setting price in public nursing homes, andthe balance of funding between residential and community care.The views of relevant stake-holders will be considered as part of the review.

Following Government approval, I intend to have the necessary legislation drafted as a priority so that the Bill can be published as soon as possible.  In tandem with the proposed new legal structures, new administrative structures will be put in place within the HSE which will reflect the need for a greater operational management focus on the delivery of key services, and greater transparency about funding, service delivery and accountability.

As part of this reform programme the Government is committed to introducing Universal GP Care within the term of office of this Government.  I have established the Universal Primary Care Project Team, which has been tasked with working through the issues relating to the introduction of this commitment.  The Project Team is meeting on a regular basis.Initially it is intended to extend GP cover without fees to persons with defined long-term illnesses.  Primary legislation is required to give effect to this commitment.  Once primary legislation has been approved by the Oireachtas, the details of the new arrangements will be announced.  €15m has been made available to meet the costs involved in 2012.As other aspects of the Deputy's questions relate to the management and delivery of health and personal social services, which are the responsibility of the HSE, my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to address these matters and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.

It will set out a common framework for the development of operational plans by a number of Government Departments which will clearly set out each Department's objectives relating to older people. Mechanisms designed to monitor the implementation of measures contained in operational plans will also be included in the Strategy.  However, I do not envisage that the Strategy will propose new service developments. Rather it will set the strategic direction for future policies, programmes and services for older people in Ireland.A considerable amount of preparatory work has already been completed.  The drafting of the Strategy will proceed within the Department within the constraints of available staff and other priorities.  At this stage I envisage the Strategy will be completed and published as soon as possible within these constraints.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1619	The integration of care in all settings is key to efficient and high quality health care delivery, in which the right care is delivered in the right place.  As set out in the Programme for Government, the integration of care will be the responsibility of an Integrated Care Agency under the aegis of the Minister for Health.  The Integrated Care Agency will manage the integration of funding across the spectrum of services by overseeing the flow of centrally-funded resources between the different arms of the system so that there are incentives for care to occur in the best setting.The reform programme is a complex and major undertaking that requires careful planning and sequencing.  Detailed consideration must be given to the optimal structures for delivery of different services and to the critical inter-relationships between services as well as best practice in health care reform.  I recently announced significant changes in the governance of the Health Service Executive under which the current Board/Chief Executive structure will be replaced with a Directorate as a transitional governance structure pending the abolition of the HSE as the health reform programme advances.    In tandem with the proposed new governance structures, new administrative structures will be put in place within the HSE which will reflect the need for a greater operational management focus on the delivery of key services, and greater transparency about funding, service delivery and accountability.These new governance and administrative arrangements represent important first steps in the process of delivering the reform agenda contained in the Programme for Government.  The next steps, which will include measures to facilitate clearer and better integrated delivery and funding arrangements, are under consideration at present.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1621	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1215 to 1218, inclusive, together.The HSE operates a Treatment Abroad Scheme (TAS), for persons entitled to treatment in another EU/EEA member state or Switzerland under EU Regulation 1408/71, as per the procedures set out in EU Regulation 574/72, and in accordance with Department of Health Guidelines. Within these governing EU Regulations and the Department of Health and Children's Guidelines, the TAS provides for the cost of approved treatments in another EU/EEA member state or Switzerland through the issue of form E112 (IE).The TAS allows for an Irish based consultant to refer a patient that is normally resident in Ireland for treatment in another EU member state or Switzerland, where the treatment in question meets the following criteria:
(a) The application to refer a patient abroad has been assessed and a determination given before that patient goes abroad.

(b) Following clinical assessment, the referring consultant certifies the following:

They recommend the patient be treated in another EU/EEA country or Switzerland;

The treatment is medically necessary and will meet the patient’s needs;

The treatment is a proven form of medical treatment and is not experimental or test treatment;

The treatment is in a recognised hospital or other institution and is under the control of a registered medical practitioner;

The hospital outside the state will accept EU/EEA form E112 (IE).
With specific reference to your question as to the numbers of children who have secured referrals by their treating consultant for the procedure I hope the following will explain the rationale that must be considered by any consultant making a referral for this irreversible treatment. In recent past months the Treatment Abroad Scheme (TAS) of the HSE has had a number of applications for the Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy procedure for which there is an emerging evidence base.  The NHS, which provides the treatment for patients that have received approval under the TAS, has published guidance for the provision of same.  This guidance states: "Current evidence on selective dorsal rhizotomy for spasticity in cerebral palsy shows that there is a risk of serious but well-recognised complications.  The evidence on efficacy is adequate.....During the consent process parents or carers should be informed that selective dorsal rhizotomy....is irreversible...”    All applications to the TAS are independently assessed by the HSE Health Intelligence Unit.  In consideration of the NHS guidelines for referral for this procedure, the HSE is working with leading paediatric consultants to establish an assessment procedure in Ireland for patients seeking referral for the procedure, prior to the patients’ applications being submitted to the TAS.  The aim of this assessment procedure would be to ensure the patient is a suitable candidate for the procedure and to ensure the parent(s) or carer fully understands the procedure and the implications of same.It is important to ensure that aftercare is provided for patients that undergo this procedure and our aim is to provide this aftercare in Ireland for patients that have been approved and have received the treatment.  The HSE's Treatment Abroad Scheme and Health Intelligence Unit are scheduling meetings with relevant consultants early in May to review the matter of referrals for selective dorsal rhizotomy.

In this regard I have established the Special Delivery Unit (SDU), which will work to unblock access to acute services by dramatically improving the flow of patients through the system, and by streamlining waiting lists, including referrals from GPs. The SDU is working closely with its partner agencies — mainly the HSE and the NTPF.As a priority, public hospitals were instructed to ensure that, by the end of 2011, they had no patients waiting more than 12 months for treatment.  I can confirm that the vast majority of hospitals achieved this objective.  During 2012 the SDU will support hospitals in the delivery of a 9 month maximum wait time for inpatient or daycase surgery.As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.

These Directives allowed for the automatic recognition of pharmacist qualifications which met agreed minimum training requirements for pharmacists, consisting of training of at least 5 years duration (comprising a minimum of 4 years academic study at university or equivalent and a minimum of 6 months practical in-service training). The 1985 Directives contained a derogation, which was availed of by the United Kingdom (UK), to provide for the recognition of pharmacist qualifications which were of 4 years total duration (i.e. 3 years academic study and 1 year practical in-service training).The 1985 Directives were replaced by Directive 2005/36/EC which now provides a system for the mutual recognition of professional qualifications between EU Member States.   The derogation which allowed for the recognition of 4 year pharmacist qualifications was not carried forward into the 2005 Directive.The difficulty that arises in relation to the recognition of UK 4 year pharmacist qualifications is not unique to Ireland, but applies to the recognition of those qualifications in all other Member States under the framework of the 2005 Directive.My Department and The Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, which is the competent authority in Ireland for the recognition of pharmacist professional qualifications, have engaged with the EU Commission on this issue.  They are working closely to endeavour to find a legal means by which affected individuals can be registered as pharmacists in Ireland.

This project is one of the main priorities for the Government and is a commitment under the Programme for Government.I recently announced the establishment of a Review Group to consider the decision of An Bord Pleanála to refuse planning permission for the National Paediatric Hospital.  The Government agreed the Terms of Reference for the Review Group which are as follows:—"To inform itself about the planning considerations and processes affecting this project.To consider the different options which now exist for progressing the construction of a national children's hospital having regard to—Government policy on the delivery of health services, including accessibility and paediatric services in particular and best clinical practice considerations,the cost and value for money considerations of the different options,the likely timelines associated with the different options,the implementation risks associated with the different options.To advise him, in the light of these considerations, on the appropriate next steps to take with a view to ensuring that a national paediatric hospital can be constructed with minimal delay.To report to the Minister within 56 days of the first meeting of the group."The aim of this Review is to consider all the possible options for the earliest possible delivery of a new children's hospital.  The Review Group will present their findings on each of the possible options for my consideration.  The Group will not be undertaking a site selection process.I have appointed Dr. Frank Dolphin to Chair the Review Group.  There is a wealth of expertise on the group.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1638	The total number of cases treated via the National Treatment Purchase Fund initiative up to end February 2011 is 151,156.  This is inclusive of inpatients, daycases and radiology.  In addition 50,714 out-patients were treated up to end December 2010.  Since 1 March 2011 there have been 12,490 people treated (inpatients, daycases and radiology).  In addition 2,951 outpatients received appointments in the full year of 2011.In July 2011 I announced changes to the remit of the NTPF — namely that it would move from working to largely outsource treatments for those waiting longest to working with hospitals in a performance improvement capacity to improve access to scheduled care.  The NTPF has been aligned with the Special Delivery Unit and is now targeting waiting lists strategically and incentivising hospitals to manage their waiting times proactively.  The NTPF capability is a core part of the SDU's performance improvement role in holding public hospitals to account.In 2011 I instructed all hospitals to ensure that they had no patients waiting more than 12 months for inpatient or daycase treatment by the end of 2011.  All except 2 hospitals achieved this target for their patients. In order to achieve this the NTPF supported the treatment of 1159 cases in the later half of the year.  Over 60% of these cases were supported within public hospitals.This year I have set a target that, by year end, no adult will be waiting longer than 9 months and no child longer than 20 weeks for in-patient or daycase treatment.  Also no person should be waiting longer than 13 weeks for a routine GI endoscopy.  Currently the NTPF/SDU is intensely engaged with public hospitals supporting their planning processes that will underpin the delivery of these targets.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1639	The cost of non-emergency patient transport, in particular for outpatient (OPD) appointments, has been escalating in recent years and non-essential provision has been identified as an area suitable for budgetary control.  Accordingly, criteria have been restricted considerably in recent times and, in addition, a uniform approach is being rolled out across the health regions.In general, patients are expected to make their own way to and from hospital and OPD appointments, using private or scheduled public transport.  The exceptions are for dialysis, cancer (radiotherapy and chemotherapy) and post-operative transplant patients. In these cases, the patient's appointment or treatment should be directly related to the condition. Transport may also be provided where, in the clinician's view, the patient would be unable to make the journey without clinical assistance or where the patient must be transported on a stretcher.  Where transport has been withdrawn, having previously been provided, this may be a result of the Local Health Office (LHO)    beginning to implement the national criteria. If a patient feels there is a genuine case for provision, that is within one of the categories outlined, then they should approach the LHO. If they feel there is a genuine clinical reason for transport to be provided, they should get the clinician to make the case for it.   If having approached the LHO they are not satisfied with resolution, they can contact Director of Advocacy, Quality and Patient Safety Directorate, Oak House, Millennium Park, Naas, Co. Kildare. Telephone 1890 424 555.

#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1642	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1240, 1241 and 1244 together.The staffing structure provides for 32 Social Workers (Senior Case Workers) and 4 Dedicated Elder Abuse Officers. Among the responsibilities of the Senior Case Worker, in conjunction with the appropriate health service providers, is the assessment/investigation and provision of supports, where necessary, in relation to suspected cases of elder abuse. The duties of Dedicated Elder Abuse Officers include overseeing, reviewing and development of policies at local and national level.Each year since 2009, the HSE has published a detailed report on developments in the HSE elder abuse service. It outlines current structures, work undertaken in the previous year and provides a detailed analysis of statistics in relation to elder abuse referrals during the previous year. The reports also identify the various training and awareness programmes undertaken by the HSE. The reports are available on the HSE website at http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/Find_a_Service/ Older_People_Services/Elder_Abuse/Resources1/.  In addition, statistical information relating to elder abuse referrals has been included in the HSE’s National Service Plan and in the Performance Monitoring Reports (reported on a quarterly basis) since 2010. These reports are also available on the HSE website.As the Deputy's question also relates to service matters, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.

In this regard I have established the Special Delivery Unit (SDU), which will work to unblock access to acute services by dramatically improving the flow of patients through the system, and by streamlining waiting lists, including referrals from GPs. The SDU is working closely with its partner agencies — mainly the HSE and the NTPF.  As a priority, public hospitals were instructed to ensure that, by the end of 2011, they had no patients waiting more than 12 months for treatment.  I can confirm that the vast majority of hospitals achieved this objective.

#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1650	The New Directions Report was initiated by the HSE Primary Community and Continuing Care Directorate in 2007. The review was to consider the reconfiguration and modernisation of HSE-funded day services for people with intellectual disability, mental health and physical and sensory disability ensuring the principles of person-centeredness, access, accountability and quality, while also ensuring better outcomes for the service users; provide value for money and be in line with relevant legislation, national standards and best practice. The Report was published by the HSE on 29 February 2012.The focus of the Report is on the requirement to accommodate a wide diversity of need among some 25,000 service users. This spectrum of need ranges from those with severe and profound disabilities, challenging behaviours and high support needs who are likely to need long-term, specialist service provision, to people with lower support needs and greater potential for community participation and inclusion.  The central approach within the report focuses on the core values of person-centeredness, community inclusion, active citizenship and high quality service provision. It will be underpinned by good governance, monitoring and guidance to providers.  The ambitious change envisaged in New Directions will depend on and benefit from an acceleration of the policy of mainstreaming that is central to the National Disability Strategy (NDS). This will require joint planning between the HSE and key government departments to maximise the approach outlined in the NDS.With regard to my strategy for health-funded disability services, a Value for Money and Policy Review of Disability Services is currently being undertaken in the context of the Government's Value for Money and Policy Review Initiative 2009-2011. The Review is well advanced and it is anticipated that it will be published in the first half of 2012 if accepted by Government.  The review is made up of two strands:1. A examination of the effectiveness and efficiency of the current disability services programme; and2. A review of current policy in relation to HSE-funded disability services.The Expert Reference Group on Disability Policy was established to look specifically at existing disability policy and whether it needs to be changed to better meet the expectations and objectives of people with disabilities.  The Group's policy review was recently published by the Department of Health and has also been the subject of consultation within the Department of Health, with other Government Departments, and with the general public.The Steering Group for the VFM Review is currently drafting its final report, taking into consideration the recommendations made in the report of the Policy Review Group, the results of the consultative process and the examination of the efficiency and effectiveness of the current disability services programme.  On completion, it is my intention to look at both reports together and, in conjunction with Minister Reilly, to ensure that proposals for the future of our disability services are brought to Government for its consideration and publication in due course.

#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1661	A Vision for Change identified mental health services for children and young people as a priority area for development.  The HSE has therefore placed a particular emphasis on developing child and adolescent mental health teams, improving in-patient access, addressing waiting times for assessment and progress has been made in recent years.  In 2009 the HSE established the multidisciplinary Specialist Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services Advisory Group.  The Group has now developed a minimum dataset for Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) and a suite of key performance indicators linked to the dataset that takes into account resource allocation and other factors.  Targeted efforts have been made to reduce the waiting list and I note that the waiting list for children waiting over 12 months reduced by almost 29% between December 2010 and December 2011.During 2012 the capacity of the CAMHS will be expanded, as part of the special funding of €35m provided for mental health in Budget 2012 will be used to strengthen CAMHS teams by ensuring, at a minimum, that at least one of each mental health professional discipline is represented on every team.  This will enable the CAMHS to continue to reduce the overall waiting list and it is hoped that by the end of 2012, no child will be waiting longer than 12 months for an appointment.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1663	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1268 and 1373 together.The Chief Medical Officer (CMO) of my Department has met with and is engaging with the treating clinics which provided breast implant surgery with a view to ensuring that best practice and patient support is paramount in the service provided to concerned recipients of PIP implants.The PIP Action Group also met with the CMO and officials of the Irish Medicines Board (IMB) on Friday 23rd March last and discussed their very reasonable concerns.  The meeting was very constructive and identified a number of follow on activities which the Department will take to help these women in their unsatisfactory dealings with one of the treating clinics.  The CMO has agreed to meet the Group again and will continue to engage with the treating clinics with a view to reaching an acceptable arrangement for resolving this serious issue for all concerned.  The IMB have advised that, to date, 138 women who received PIP breast implants have reported ruptures.  Reports received indicate that ruptures have occurred at/between one month — eight years after implant.  The Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR) in "The Safety of PIP Silicone Breast Implants” published on 1st February, 2012 said that all silicone breast implants can fail, regardless of manufacturer, and the probability of failure increases with time since implantation.  The Committee also states that “estimates of breast implant rupture prevalence range widely, in part because the methods of estimating rupture prevalence rates differ among studies”.  On average it is estimated that there is a 10% -15% rupture risk within 10 years of implantation.However, officials of my Department are currently working on the Licensing of Health Facilities Bill which will provide for a mandatory system of licensing for public and private health service providers. The legislative proposals are being prepared broadly in line with recommendations made by the Madden Commission in 2008 and are designed to improve patient safety by ensuring that healthcare providers do not operate below core standards which are applied in a consistent and systematic way.  The intention is to have a proportionate system which has the confidence of the public.  Standards and other requirements will be enforceable through inspection and imposition of sanctions as necessary.  Licensing will be targeted at areas which are not currently subject to regulation. It is expected that outline proposals for the new system of licensing should be finalised by year end.  In the meantime I am making arrangements to put better information in place for people who in good faith use services of non-State providers, especially for cosmetic surgery.

The Executive is required to prioritise the capital infrastructure projects within its overall capital funding allocation taking into account the existing capital commitments and costs to completion over the period.  A draft capital plan for the period 2012-2016 has been submitted to my Department.  My Department is reviewing the proposals and following up with the HSE where further details may be required.  The proposed plan requires my approval with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  Details of the plan will be published by the Executive following its approval.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1665	A special allocation of €35m for mental health was provided in Budget 2012 in line with commitments in the Programme for Government.  This funding will be used to enhance Community Mental Health Teams, improve access to psychological therapies in primary care and implement suicide prevention strategies.  It is planned that 414 staff will be recruited to the mental health service to deliver on these objectives.  The staffing requirement relating to each region has been identified and the information necessary to commence recruitment is in the process of being collated by the four Regional Directors of Operations.  It is proposed that the new professionals will be drawn from existing National Recruitment Service panels where available and new competitions will be established for the remaining posts.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1666	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1271, 1288 and 1291 together.In late 2009, the Data Protection Commissioner (DPC) received a complaint from a member of the public in relation to the retention of Newborn Screening Cards (NSCs).  The basis of the complaint (which was upheld by the Data Protection Commissioner) was that the NSCs should not be retained indefinitely without consent as this constituted a breach of the Data Protection Acts 1998 and 2003. During 2010, a number of meetings were convened with the Deputy Data Protection Commissioner and representatives of the Department of Health, the Health Service Executive, and Temple Street, and Cork University Hospitals.A policy was agreed in conjunction with the DPC to address both the legislative and ethical requirements of the National Newborn Screening Programme.  In accordance with the policy, from July 1st 2011, the blood portion of the Newborn Screening Card (NSC) will be retained for 10 years and disposed of during the child's 11th year (for the purpose of confirming an initial diagnosis should this be deemed necessary). Parents/guardians are provided with specific information on the retention of the NSC's with regard to their use and written consent is sought in this regard.  The changes to the National Newborn Screening Programme since 1st July 2011 bring about compliance with both national and EU data protection legislation, uphold ethical principles and meet ethical obligations with regard to consent, privacy and confidentiality.The agreed policy also provided for the disposal of archived NSCs older than ten years. Following receipt of representations concerning the proposed destruction of archived Newborn Screening Cards, I requested the HSE to conduct a review of this decision. The report and recommendations of the review group were submitted to my office in January 2012. Having carefully considered the issue, I have accepted the recommendation of the review group, that in order to meet our legal and ethical responsibilities, newborn screening cards older than ten years will be destroyed. The international consensus clearly favours seeking explicit consent (rather than opt out) from an individual and/or their parent/guardian for use of their previously collected biological material (including NCS's) for any other purpose than for which it was collected.Retention of newborn screening cards for a period of ten years means they are available for second opinion, medico-legal reasons, long-term clinical follow-up and re-examination of samples with the most recently developed techniques to further define the initial diagnosis. This is standard practice in many countries and extends a potential benefit to the child and is ethically and legally justifiable as it directly relates to the initial purpose for which the sample was originally collected.I am aware that recent advances in biomedical and genetic technologies have significantly increased the scientific value of archived human biological material, such as the Newborn Screening Card, in this country and beyond. Nonetheless, the potential benefits from such research have to be balanced against the rights of the donors of that material.  In the case of the Newborn Screening Archive, parents did not give consent for the retention of the material/data and almost certainly did not consider the potential secondary purposes of the material, including research.The HSE is developing an information campaign offering members of the public the opportunity to have their NSC returned to them, prior to any destruction of the cards taking place.  This will ensure that anyone who wishes to donate their own or their child's NSC to research will be afforded the opportunity to do so.  I have requested the HSE to provide an outline of the procedures to be followed for the retrieval by members of the public of their NSCs.  The proposed course of action seeks to ensure public trust and a continued willingness to participate in the National Newborn Screening Programme, a vital public health measure for children and their families.

#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1676	The Health (Fluoridation of Water Supplies) Act 1960 provides for the fluoridation of public piped water supplies.  This is achieved through the addition of hydrofluorosilicic acid (HFSA) to the water.  The complete and rapid reaction between HFSA and water produces hydrogen ions (which are removed through a process called buffering), silica (sand) and fluoride ions.  Consumers do not come into contact with HFSA as water from the tap contains fluoride, not HFSA or fluorosilicates.  The balance of scientific evidence worldwide confirms that water fluoridation, at the optimal level, does not cause any ill effects and continues to be safe and effective in protecting the oral health of all age groups.  There are no plans to discontinue the policy of fluoridation of public water supplies, which continues to make an effective contribution to oral health in Ireland.

It applies to the donation, testing, characterisation, procurement, preservation, transport and transplantation of organs.  Under the Directive, Member States must also ensure that donations of organs from deceased and living donors are voluntary and unpaid.  My Department is working in cooperation with the HSE to ensure that the necessary systems, processes and procedures are in place so that the health service is in a position to comply with the requirements of the Directive by the transposition date.The Deputy will also be aware that the Programme for Government envisages the future introduction of an opt-out system of organ donation, with a view  to improving the availability of organs for patients in need of transplantation.  This will of course require detailed consideration and my Department will be consulting further on this matter.

This proposed measure sought to bring consistency to the top up bonus paid to people attending the HSE rehabilitative training scheme with similar payments paid in other State training schemes.  Any reduction in payments to individuals requires adequate advance notice to enable the recipients and indeed, service providers, to take the reduction into account in planning their support needs and other arrangements.It should also be noted that people with a disability attending Rehabilitative Training are usually in receipt of a State payment such as the Disability Allowance.  The HSE, at my request agreed to review its decision, and it has submitted a Report on the matter which is under consideration in my Department.

This project is one of the main priorities for the Government and is a commitment under the Programme for Government.I recently announced the establishment of a Review Group to consider the decision of An Bord Pleanála to refuse planning permission for the National Paediatric Hospital.  The Government agreed the Terms of Reference for the Review Group are as follows:—"To inform itself about the planning considerations and processes affecting this project.To consider the different options which now exist for progressing the construction of a national children's hospital having regard to—Government policy on the delivery of health services, including accessibility and paediatric services in particular and best clinical practice considerations,the cost and value for money considerations of the different options,the likely timelines associated with the different options,the implementation risks associated with the different options.To advise him, in the light of these considerations, on the appropriate next steps to take with a view to ensuring that a national paediatric hospital can be constructed with minimal delay.To report to the Minister within 56 days of the first meeting of the group."The aim of this Review is to consider all the possible options for the earliest possible delivery of a new children's hospital.  The Review Group will present their findings on each of the possible options for my consideration.  The Group will not be undertaking a site selection process.  I have appointed Dr Frank Dolphin to Chair the Review Group.  There is a wealth of expertise on the group.  The membership is composed of senior planners, an architect, the CEO of a major UK Paediatric hospital and senior clinicians in the field of paediatrics.  I will await the completion of the work of the Review Group and do not wish to make any further comment on the matter at this time.

Charges are not payable in respect of items supplied under the Long Term Illness Scheme.  Prescription charges do not apply to children in the care of the HSE or to methadone supplied to patients participating in the Methadone Treatment Scheme.  Under the Drug Payment Scheme no individual or family pays more than €132 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.  The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.There is no regulation of the prices, dispensing fees or other charges for items supplied privately to patients outside of the GMS and community drugs schemes.  If the Deputy would like to supply additional information regarding the circumstances referred to, including the name of the pharmacy and the nature of the prescription, I would be happy to investigate the matter further.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1687	The use of animals for scientific purposes is strictly controlled in accordance with Council Directive 86/609/EEC and the Cruelty to Animals Act 1876, as amended by the European Communities (Amendment of Cruelty to Animals Act 1876) Regulations 2002 and 2005.  Under this legislation, experiments on animals can only be performed by persons licensed by the Minister for Health and in premises registered for that purpose. Both the licensees and the registered premises must meet specific requirements and standards.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine carries out the necessary inspections of breeders, suppliers and users of animals and their establishments to verify compliance with the regulations.  A Memorandum of Understanding has been signed by both Departments formalising arrangements in this regard.While it is desirable to replace the use of animals in scientific procedures it remains the case that such procedures continue to be necessary to protect human and animal health and the environment. In this regard, a new Directive 2010/63/EU on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes will further strengthen the protection of animals still needed for research and safety testing.  The Directive will also play a significant role in further minimising both the number of animals used and the requirement that alternatives be used where possible, whilst ensuring a level playing field for EU industry and enhancing the quality of research conducted in the EU.  The "Three Rs" principle of replacing, reducing, and refining animal testing is firmly anchored in the new legislation and this is something that I strongly support.  The new Directive will be transposed into Irish law by the end of 2012.

The aim of the programme is to ensure that no patient receiving IV antimicrobials, who could be treated out of hospital, remains an in-patient.  Patients will be reviewed within 24 hours of referral and discharged within 24 hours post review if suitable for OPAT.   In the initial phase patients will be enrolled in the programme through Acute Medical Units and in-patients facilities.  It will be possible to facilitate early discharge of the patient and to deliver IV antibiotics in the nursing home for suitable patients as part of the programme.It is envisaged that the programme will be rolled out to GPs and primary care settings facilitating admission avoidance for selected patient groups.

In this regard I have established the Special Delivery Unit (SDU), which will work to unblock access to acute services by dramatically improving the flow of patients through the system, and by streamlining waiting lists, including referrals from GPs.  The SDU is working closely with its partner agencies — mainly the HSE and the NTPF.  As a priority, public hospitals were instructed to ensure that, by the end of 2011, they had no patients waiting more than 12 months for treatment.  I can confirm that the vast majority of hospitals achieved this objective.  During 2012 the SDU will support hospitals in the delivery of a 9 month maximum wait time for inpatient or daycase surgery.As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.

This was dependent on the powers that had been proposed under the 30th Amendment of the Constitution.  As it was not possible to proceed as proposed, I am giving consideration as to how best to deal with the issues involved.  My Department is currently exploring the options in this regard and I would be open to a meeting at a later date when my Department's deliberations are at a more advanced stage.

On this basis, the organisation of hospital services nationally, regionally and locally will be informed by the Clinical Programmes.  These Programmes have been developed and implemented by a joint HSE/Departmental group who are currently developing a framework for the future development of smaller hospitals.  Consultation with all the stakeholders, including patients and public representatives, will be an integral part of the process.  These inter-related programmes aim to improve service quality, effectiveness and patient access and to ensure that patient care is provided in the service setting most appropriate to individuals' needs.  The planned introduction of hospital groups will also provide further opportunities for inter-site cooperation.Louth County Hospital is an integral part of the Dublin North East Group and continues to play an important role in the delivery of clinical services in the Louth area and to other parts of the North East Region.  The current level of activity will be maintained at Louth County Hospital as part of the 2012 Service Plan.  In addition, an increase in day services activity is also planned for 2012.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1698	The Special Delivery Unit was established in my Department last July to tackle patient wait times for hospital services.  Unacceptably high wait times have been tolerated for too long and have become systemic for both unscheduled and scheduled care. The problems have to be tackled step by step so that improvements can be sustained.  The SDU immediately began work with the HSE and the NTPF on the problem of trolley waits and long waits for inpatient care.  Last July I introduced a 12 month limit beyond which no hospital could keep a patient waiting for inpatient or day case treatment.  There is no room for complacency but progress is being made.  Since December the number of patients waiting on trolleys has been consistently lower than the same period last year and 94% of hospitals met the 12 month target for scheduled care.  As a result some patients have had a better quality of service than would otherwise have been the case.  I believe I have also demonstrated through this initiative that, even in the challenging times we face, it is possible to exert control over the system and deliver improvements.  This has been achieved by the SDU, the NTPF and the HSE working together to rigorously manage performance.The latest available data for the mean waiting time shows that at the end of December 2010 it was 2.4 months, at the end of December 2011 it was 2.8 months and up to the end of March this year the figure was 2.9 months.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1699	While the Programme for Government provides for a reduction in consultants' remuneration, my immediate priority is to achieve more effective implementation of the existing contract and to reform how services are delivered to patients.  I am satisfied that considerable efficiencies can be achieved under the terms of the 2008 contract and the Public Service Agreement, if consultants embrace this reform agenda.  I believe that the efficiencies, productivity increases and reform, if achieved, will be worth more to the health system than simply reducing the pay of consultants and the Government has endorsed this approach.The HSE is at present preparing for the commencement of discussions with the consultant representative bodies and I expect these discussions to begin shortly.  This process will need to be focussed on the achievement of worthwhile and measurable change and should also, in my view, be concluded within a reasonable period, in line with the provisions of the Public Service Agreement 2010-2014.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1700	Broadly speaking, Parliamentary Questions received by my Department can be divided into two categories.  These are:questions which relate to the development of the overall health strategy, planning and policy development, drafting of legislation etc. and;questions which relate to operational matters such as services to named individuals, specific health service issues in local areas etc.The vast majority of questions in the first category are answered by my Department without referral to the Health Service Executive or any other agency.  In relation to the second category, the majority of questions are operational matters which are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive.  These questions are referred by my Department to the Executive for direct reply to Deputies.  The Executive is very conscious of the need to reply promptly to Deputies Questions and there is regular liaison between my Department and the Executive in this regard.Parliamentary Questions relating to HSE operational issues of a national/regional scale or importance as well as high profile individual issues are answered by myself or the relevant Minister of State instead of being referred to the HSE.  Whenever possible these questions are answered on the relevant Dáil sitting day.  Where this is not possible because the information is not readily available, a reply is issued as soon as possible thereafter.Taking account of the above, the figures sought by the Deputy for the period concerned are as follows:TableTotal number of questions answered by my Department2,316Total number of questions answered in full without referral to any agency774Total number of questions referred to the HSE or other agencies for direct reply to Deputies1,330Total number of questions concerning national/regional issues212

#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1706	As the Deputy is aware the Irish Human Rights Commission Enquiry Report into the provision of intellectual disability services by the Brothers of Charity Services to adults in the John Paul Centre, Galway was published in March 2010.  From a Department of Health perspective, the Report raises important questions regarding the current arrangements for funding, accountability and standards in our disability services.  It is acknowledged that, despite considerable advances in the standard of service provision in recent years, more needs to be done to improve services.  A number of important current initiatives will further advance the ability of the health services to focus more fully on meeting the needs of people with disabilities.  My Department's ongoing Value for Money and Policy Review of Disability Services (VFM) is considering how well the current substantial allocation of funding for disability services is being used, and is exploring the way forward for reconfiguration of these services, and their management and operation, so as to enable them to respond more effectively to individual needs.  It is expected that the Review will be completed in the first half of 2012.The Report makes 15 specific recommendations to the Department of Health. I have set out below the current position in relation to the implementation of the recommendations below.  Recommendations 1 and 2: (Gaps in existing law/ practice and ratification of UNCRPD).  These recommendations were accepted.  The Department of Justice and Equality has responsibility in relation to ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD).  The Department of Health is engaging with that Department in relation to ongoing work involved in preparing for ratification.Recommendation 3: (Definition of health and personal social services).  The Department of Health has completed a review of the eligibility framework which is contained in the Health Act 1970.  The issue is being considered in the context of policy proposals being developed on Universal Health Insurance.  The Government is now committed to implementing a comprehensive programme of health reform.  It has set clear goals for the health service, namely, a universal, single tier health care system with access based on need and not income, more care delivered locally through strengthened primary care, and greater transparency and incentives regarding performance.  The Government will introduce Universal Health Insurance with equal access to care for all, with no discrimination between patients on the grounds of income or insurance status.Recommendations 4, 5, 6 and 8: ("bottom up" redesign of service agreements (quantum, quality and accountability) working group on national average costs, National Intellectual Disability Database review, individual assessments to inform service level funding — non-retrogressive measures).  These recommendations have been accepted and will be informed by and progressed in the context of the forthcoming Value For Money and Policy Review of Disability Services.Recommendation 7: (Disability Act 2005).  Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005 was commenced for children under the age of 5 on 1 June 2007.  It had been intended that the Disability Act would be commenced on a phased basis for the 5-18 year old cohort and then for adults, with the Disability Act and the Education for Persons with Special Education Needs (EPSEN) Act 2004 to be implemented during 2010 in respect of children between 5 and 18 years of age.  In light of current fiscal constraints, it was necessary to defer further implementation of the two Acts.Recommendations 9, 13 and 15: (Clear guidelines on the required staff-to-client ratios; clear protocols for the prevention of foreseeable risks to vulnerable persons with an intellectual disability living in institutions or residential centres through timely and appropriate intervention strategies; HIQA's inspection and monitoring role to be immediately introduced).  HIQA has prepared and published standards for residential services for the disability sector, which outline what is expected of a provider of services and what a person with a disability, his or her family, and the public, can expect to receive from such services.  The standards clearly set out what a quality safe residential service for people with disabilities should be and support the delivery of person-centred care in this sector.  The Government is committed to ensuring that vulnerable people with disabilities in residential services are safeguarded and protected, and that their quality of life is enhanced. With this in mind, the current Programme for Government commits to mandatory standards for this sector and inspections of services by HIQA.  Discussions have begun between the Department of Health and HIQA to progress this commitment.  Given the complex nature of residential service provision for people with disabilities, ranging from congregated settings to dispersed housing in the community, careful consideration is being given to designing the most appropriate regulatory model and this work is ongoing.  A target date of Quarter 1 2013 has been provisionally set for the commencement of the proposed regulatory scheme.Recommendation 10: (protocols governing HSE Reviews including reporting).  The HSE has informed the Department that it has reviewed its current arrangements for holding and managing enquiries in order to ensure that all future enquiries are conducted efficiently and effectively, and without undue delay.  I understand that a Serious Incident Unit has been set up within HSE for the purpose of developing and implementing policies and procedures to facilitate appropriate and proportionate responses to all serious incidents including the establishment and management of inquiries and investigations.Recommendation 11: (the complaints mechanisms under Part 9 of the Health Act 2004 should be reviewed).  The Department will raise this issue with the HSE to establish how the overall complaints system is working in relation to disability service providers.Recommendation 12: (Mental capacity legislation). This is currently being progressed by the Department of Justice and Equality.Recommendation 14: (Department to review the Government's 2003 Report to the CPT and the recommendations made in the Report — persons with ID in a psychiatric facility).  Substantial progress has been made in relation to (a) transferring persons with an intellectual disability from psychiatric hospitals and other inappropriate placements, (b) the development of national standards, recommendations 9, 13 and 15 above refer.

The intention is to continue with the closure of the old psychiatric hospitals and move from the traditional institutional based model of care to a patient-centred, flexible and community based mental health service, where the need for hospital admission is greatly reduced, while still providing in-patient care when appropriate.The core unit of mental health service delivery is now the Community Mental Health Team of which there are 124 Adult Teams and 61 Child and Adolescent Teams  in place nationally.  These Teams provide care to individuals  living in their own home or in supported accommodation within their own community.  In some areas specialist Rehabilitation and Recovery Teams also provide support to those with severe and enduring mental illness to move towards recovery.  Mental health services are provided in various settings in the community including community residences, day hospitals, day centres and respite houses all of which offer community based services as an alternative  to in-patient admission.  GPs, Primary Care Teams and the voluntary sector, in partnership with local mental health services also play a critical role in the support of individuals with mental health needs.In addition, a special allocation of €35 million for mental health was announced in Budget 2012 in line with our Programme for Government commitments.  Funding from this special allocation will be used primarily to strengthen Community Mental Health Teams in both Adult and Children's mental health services.  It is intended that the additional resources will be rolled out in conjunction with a scheme of appropriate clinical care programmes based on an early intervention and recovery approach.  Some of the funding will also be used to advance activities in the area of suicide prevention and response to self-harm presentations and to initiate the provision of psychological and counselling services in primary care specifically for people with mental health problems.   Some of these funds will also be used to advance the re-location of mental health service users from institutional care to more independent living arrangements in their communities, in line with A Vision for Change.

#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1715	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1327, 1328 and 1332 together.A voluntary patient is not subject to an admission order and is therefore free to leave an approved centre at any time.  However Section 23 of the Mental Health Act 2001 provides that where a voluntary patient indicates that they wish to leave an approved centre, and a consultant psychiatrist, registered medical practitioner or registered nurse on the staff of the centre is of the opinion that the person has a mental disorder, they may detain the person for a maximum period of 24 hours.  Where a person is detained in this manner, the person must be examined by a consultant psychiatrist who must either discharge the person or arrange for an independent examination to be undertaken by another consultant psychiatrist within the 24 hour period.  If the second consultant psychiatrist is satisfied that the person is suffering from a mental disorder, an admission order for reception, detention and treatment is made, whereupon the person becomes an involuntary patient.  The rights, provisions and procedures applying to persons admitted involuntarily are afforded to the patient, and the admission order admitting the patient involuntarily is subject to review by an independent Mental Health Tribunal within 21 days.The Mental Health Act 2001 commenced in full, in November 2006 so statistics relating to the operation of Part 2 of the Act are only available from that date.Form 13: Regrade of Voluntary Patient to InvoluntaryNov and Dec 200610520076232008584200959020105462011586In relation to the reclassification of patients from involuntary to voluntary, the position is that this data is not routinely collected. While Section 28 of the Mental Health Act 2001 obliges a consultant psychiatrist to revoke an admission/renewal order where the person is no longer believed to be suffering from a mental disorder, in some cases the person will leave the centre while others may opt to remain as a voluntary patient.  The consultant psychiatrist must notify the Mental Health Commission of all such revocations, but is not required to specify whether the patient has been discharged from the approved centre or remains as a voluntary patient.Form 14:  RevocationsNov and Dec 200624920071,44420081,29020091,37620101,34720111,397
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1716	The Mental Health Act 2001 provides that where an admission or renewal order has been referred to a Mental Health Tribunal, the Tribunal is required to make a decision to affirm or revoke the order as soon as may be, but not later than 21 days after the making of the order.While I fully accept that a patient should be detained for no longer than is necessary, I believe it is also important to be realistic about the logistical and administrative implications of holding tribunals within a shorter timeframe.  The present 21 day timeframe takes account of the fact that the Mental Health Commission is also required to appoint an independent Consultant Psychiatrist to examine and interview the patient  with a view to forming a judgement as to whether the patient is suffering from a mental disorder and making a report available to the Tribunal within 14 days.As the Deputy will be aware however, the Mental Health Act 2001 is currently under review and the feasibility of reducing this timeframe will be examined in that context.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1717	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1330, 1334 and 1335 together.Regulation 15 of the Mental Health Act 2001 (Approved Centres) Regulations 2006 requires that the registered proprietor in each approved centre must ensure that each resident, whether voluntary or involuntary, has an individual care plan.  In addition, the Mental Health Commission, which has a statutory role to promote, encourage and foster high standards in the delivery of mental health services, has published a Quality Framework for Mental Health Services in Ireland.  This framework provides a mechanism to continuously improve the quality of services and promotes an empowering approach to service delivery, where services facilitate an individual's personal journey towards recovery.  The framework, which incorporates the Mental Health Act 2001 (Approved Centres) Regulations 2006, requires that each service user has an individual care and treatment plan that describes the levels of support and treatment required in line with his/her needs.  The preparation of these individual care and treatment plans is co-ordinated by a designated member of the multi-disciplinary team, and is developed with input from the service user, the multi-disciplinary team and the service user's family/chosen advocate, where appropriate.Issues relating to the detention of, and protections provided for, involuntary patients are dealt with in the Mental Health Act 2001.  A number of protections in the Act also apply to voluntary patients e.g., rules governing the use of seclusion and mechanical means of bodily restraint.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Mental Health Act 2001 is currently under review and in that context, the need to extend the scope of the Act to voluntary patients will be examined.

In order to maintain and improve on these targets, the SDU has advised the HSE of a penalty scheme which will be levied on hospitals which fail to treat inpatients and day cases within the 12 month target.   Work has now begun on access to outpatient services, with the recent launch of the OPD Performance Improvement Programme.

Nevertheless he advises that fluoridated water can be used for preparing infant formula.The question of whether infants receive too much fluoride in their early months through infant formula reconstituted with fluoridated water has been addressed in a risk assessment carried out by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) (2004) and by research carried out at University College Cork (2006).  The FSAI risk assessment concluded that there was no significant evidence that any adverse effect other than dental fluorosis was relevant to the assessment of the risk of fluoride intake at levels within the range estimated for young infants.  It also concluded that the risk of dental fluorosis was very low.  A research project was subsequently conducted in University College Cork to investigate formula feeding practices in infants.  The results of the study confirmed the results of the FSAI risk assessment.  Since these studies were carried out the level of fluoride in public water supplies has been reduced from 0.8-1 mg per litre to 0.6-0.8 mg per litre as provided for in the Fluoridation of Water Supplies Regulations 2007.  Based on these findings and on the scientific evidence available, the Irish Expert Body on Fluorides and Health recommends that infant formula should continue to be reconstituted with boiled tap water in accordance with the manufacturers' instructions or alternatively ready-to-feed infant formula can be used.

#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1750	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1367 to 1369, inclusive, together.There were 2,800 applications for the Nursing Homes Support Scheme in progress at end-March.  Applications continue to be processed on a daily basis.  Since the start of 2012, an average of 900 applications per month have been received by the HSE.  On average, applications take between 4 to 6 weeks to process, from receipt of completed application to date of determination.  Depending on the level of complexity of the individual case, processing of the application may take longer.  For example, in cases where ancillary state support is sought, additional factors may impact on the timeframe, i.e. the HSE must establish Title of a property before a decision can be made.  Establishing Title can be a lengthy process in some cases.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1751	The Health Service Executive published a 'National Review of Autism Services' in February this year.  The National Review of Autism Services outlines the historical background, the current models that exist, the gaps in service provision and the need for a consistent clear pathway for individuals to access services in the least restrictive way.   The report highlights the imperative for a clear focus on the individual and their family in ensuring that the needs of the individual remain at the centre of service provision.It is intended that future provision of services for children and adults with autism will be developed having regard to the Government's commitment to 'mainstreaming' i.e. to enable people with a disability have access to the same services as the general population, and in addition receive the appropriate support and intervention to address individual needs.  There are no plans currently under consideration in the Department of Health for the development of a national autism strategy or for introducing specific legislation on autism.The recommendations of the National Review of Autism Services report will be implemented through the reconfiguration of existing service provision, and having regard to the most efficient and effective use of resources available in the current economic climate.  The Department of Health's forthcoming Value For Money and Policy Review of Disability Services will set the wider context for achieving a person-centered disability service overall.

As part of this reform programme, the Government is committed to introducing Universal GP Care within the first term of office of this Government.Initially it is intended to extend GP cover without fees to persons with a defined illness. Primary legislation is required to give effect to this commitment.  Once primary legislation has been approved by the Oireachtas, the details of the new arrangements will be announced. The Department is currently working on preparing legislation, which is intended to be published as soon as possible.

I understand that the legislative proposal in relation to this is due to be published later this year.Also as I stated in that response the Australian Government is being challenged in the courts by the tobacco industry and I understand that one of these legal challenges is being heard this week in the High Court of Australia.The Deputy may be interested to know that the Department of Health in the UK just this week published a "Consultation on the standardised packaging of tobacco products”   and I understand that the UK Government will await the results of this consultation before taking any decisions in this regard.My Department will continue to monitor developments in Australia and the UK in this regard and will support any international developments in relation to plain or standardised packaging.In relation to the Report of the Tobacco Policy Review Group I hope to be in position to publish this document in the coming months.

In this regard I have established the Special Delivery Unit (SDU), which will work to unblock access to acute services by dramatically improving the flow of patients through the system, and by streamlining waiting lists, including referrals from GPs.  The SDU is working closely with its partner agencies — mainly the HSE and the NTPF.  As a priority, public hospitals were instructed to ensure that, by the end of 2011, they had no patients waiting more than 12 months for treatment.  I can confirm that the vast majority of hospitals achieved this objective.  During 2012 the SDU will support hospitals in the delivery of a 9 month maximum wait time for inpatient or daycase surgery.As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.  Should the patient's general practitioner consider that the patient's condition warrants an earlier appointment, he/she would be in the best position to take the matter up with the consultant and facility involved.

In view of the current financial circumstances, my Department is not in a position to provide funding under the Local Improvements Scheme in 2012.  Given the limited funding available to maintain the road network, I have to concentrate resources on the maintenance of public roads, including those in rural areas and it is not possible to assist with works on non-public roads at present.  However, the scheme has been suspended and not abolished.  If and when the financial position of the State improves, it will be possible to re-open this scheme.  In the interim, it is open to local authorities to continue to operate the scheme or a similar scheme from their own resources and I am sure they will do if they consider it to be a good use of limited resources.

ETV's are expensive to purchase and maintain and so it is important to pursue enhancements in Ireland's marine pollution prevention, preparedness and response capability from within existing and available resources before we consider any further expenditure.  As part of the Programme for Government I am reviewing risks posed by international shipping and by offshore exploration in the Irish Exclusive Economic Zone and will thereafter consider what steps can be taken for the provision of emergency towing

The current site of the Unit and the Cleggan BIM Ice Plant have been deemed unsuitable for development by the Office of Public Works (OPW).  A new site will need to be identified by the OPW should funds become available at a later stage.  However, the OPW has not been asked to consider lands at the Cleggan airstrip as no offer has been received.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1776	As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in relation to the national roads programme.  The planning, design and implementation of individual road projects is a matter for the National Roads Authority (NRA) under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2007 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.  The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads in its area, is a statutory function of each road authority in accordance with the provisions of section 13 of the Roads Act, 1993.In January this year, I announced the 2012 Regional and Local Road Grant Allocations under which a total of €379.5 million was made available towards works on regional and local roads, Over 85% of the monies allocated to local authorities were directed towards the maintenance and rehabilitation of road pavements.  The restoration of road surfaces would also include for the provision of new road markings as appropriate.  Some €225 million has been allocated towards a programme of Restoration Improvement and Maintenance works in County Council areas. A Discretionary Grant of €55 million was made available to county councils and it may be used towards both road repairs and for road markings. Block Grants which total €27.2 million have been allocated towards roads in urban areas.  However it should be noted that works on regional and local roads is a matter for the relevant local authority to be funded from its own resources and that the regional and local road grants provided are only intended as a supplement to this own resources expenditure.

Where excess heavy goods vehicles are deemed to be an issue then the relevant local authority, in this case Kilkenny County Council, may apply speed restrictions, traffic calming, or other measures they deem appropriate.  The designated works may be eligible for funding under the regional and local roads allocations made by my Department each year.  It is open to the Council to apply for a grant allocation under the relevant funding heading (where applicable) or to carry out such works under its Discretionary Grant from the Department under which a variety of road and traffic management works are permitted.

The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for local authorities.  Local authorities have been provided with a number of best practice documents and are required to follow the guidelines in these documents when carrying out grant aided works on regional and local roads.   These best practice documents are available on the Department's website www.dttas.ie.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1779	As the Deputy will be aware, public transport services and fares are a matter for the CIÉ operating companies in conjunction with the National Transport Authority, which regulates fares for public service obligation (PSO) services.  I have referred the Deputy's question to the National Transport Authority for direct reply.  Please inform my private office if you do not receive a reply within ten working days.I am aware that the NTA approved a range of fare increases in respect of the CIÉ companies which took effect in January this year.  Notwithstanding the NTA's statutory responsibilities, the Government recognises the need for the CIÉ companies to respond to the challenge of reduced PSO subvention funding, reduced fares income arising from reductions in passenger numbers and increased costs, such as fuel costs, which are outside their control.  As a general principle, efficiencies in operational costs should, in the first instance, be examined in preference to fare increases and service reductions.  I have stated this in the Letters of Mandate I issued to each of the four CIE Company Chairpersons appointed in 2011.  However, in the current environment there has to be a recognition that, unfortunately, fare increases will be inevitable if costs cannot be reduced sufficiently in order to maintain a reasonable level of service provision.  While a recovery in passenger numbers could increase company revenues, all concerned must focus on identifying key public transport priorities in our cities and across the country and PSO public transport service providers will have to achieve greater efficiency and cost effectiveness in the years ahead.

I have referred the Deputy's question to the NTA for direct reply. Please inform my private office if you do not receive a reply within ten working days.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1781	The primary purpose of providing bus lanes is to facilitate and promote bus based public transport.  The regulations generally limit the use of bus lanes to buses and, in the case of with-flow bus lanes, to cyclists.  Having regard to the role of taxis in providing on-street immediate hire services, an exemption is allowed in respect of taxis when they are being used in the course of business.There have over the years been a number of requests to my Department to consider amending the legislation to allow other categories of vehicle to use bus lanes.  These include hackneys, limousines, multi-occupancy cars, and motorbikes, among others.  I have received a number of such requests since becoming Minister.  The overriding concern in considering these applications is the carrying capacity of bus lanes, and the potential that their primary role to provide bus priority could be undermined if other vehicles were allowed access.  As a result, I have taken the view that the current restrictions on use of bus lanes should be maintained.  These lanes were introduced at some expense to the taxpayer in order to provide priority on our roads for public transport.  This is in line with our aim of making public transport more efficient and attractive, and so reducing congestion and pollution.I do, of course, support the development and promotion of electric cars as an environmentally friendly means of transport, a policy which is within the remit of my colleague the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  However, changes to the bus lane legislation in regard to electric cars, or other modes of transport, are not in my view the appropriate way to promote them.

The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads, in its area, is a statutory function of each road authority in accordance with the provisions of section 13 of the Roads Act, 1993. Works on such roads are a matter for the relevant local authority to be funded from its own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the Council.  My Department received an application from Kildare County Council in November 2008 for 100% funding of the Athy Southern Distributor Road.  A grant of €150,000 was allocated to the Council in 2011 to allow certain design and planning work on this project to be undertaken. No funding allocation has been made for this project in 2012.  All available funding for 2012 has been allocated to local authorities. I am not in a position to give any commitment regarding the provision of further funding for this road in the future.

Dublin City Council has published the Dublinbikes Strategic Planning Framework 2011-2016 to guide the development of the scheme.  The National Transport Authority (NTA) is working with Dublin City Council to expand the Dublinbikes project, initially into areas to the East and West of the existing bike scheme.  The detailed design of phases 2A and 2B (including location of stations, size of bays etc.) is expected to be completed shortly. The arrangements for the implementation of the expansion are being developed by Dublin City Council.  The NTA supported development work on the scheme's expansion in 2011. The NTA has provided an allocation of €500,000 to Dublin City Council for work on the scheme in 2012.

With regard to the tourism sector generally, the Government has introduced a range of measures to enhance competitiveness and our marketing drive overseas.  These included reducing the cost of employing people by halving employers' PRSI for those on modest wages and reducing VAT to 9% on tourism-related services.  We also facilitated an additional autumn/winter marketing blitz, by channelling some of the proceeds from our travel tax back into cooperative tourism marketing. According to Failte Ireland, many tourism enterprises are optimistic regarding their own prospects for 2012.  If these markets perform as expected, employment in the industry should increase this year.  Under the auspices of my Department, the Commission for Aviation Regulation [CAR] licences travel agents and tour operators in accordance with the Transport [Tour Operators and Travel Agents] Act 1982.

In December 2011, a total of over €5 million was allocated to the six regional airports to cover a portion of their operating costs incurred in 2011. This included a subvention of over €2 million to Galway Airport.  In addition, €200,000 was paid to Galway Airport in 2011 under the Regional Airports Capital Expenditure Grant (CAPEX) Scheme.  Recoupment of any monies provided by the Exchequer would have to be in accordance with the relevant schemes. The issue of redundancy payments for staff is a matter for Galway Airport as a privately owned entity.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1796	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1420 and 1439 together.The programme for the funding of capital projects to 2016 is set out in the Medium Term Exchequer Framework 2012-16. Due to the overall reduction in funding for transport infrastructure the priority to 2016 is to protect investment made to date and to maintain safety standards.   The limited funding available over and above this priority will only be provided for projects which are affordable, have strong business cases, meet overall transport objectives and deliver the best return in terms of economic recovery and job creation. Moreover the ability to operate profitably and without the need of any subsidy would also be a key consideration for any new rail projects or extensions.  In the circumstances, Phase 2 of the Western Rail Corridor has been deferred for consideration in 2015 in advance of the next Public Capital Programme. However, the construction of new stations at Crusheen and Oranmore which were approved under Phase 1 have  been included in the Capital Programme to 2016.In accordance with the Programme for Government, I am investing in the National Cycle Policy which calls for a wide programme of action including investment in cycling infrastructure. With regard to the development of a cycle way from Clifden to Galway, an assessment of this route was carried out by the National Roads Authority as part of its plans to upgrade the N59 to Clifden.   I understand that the route alignment for the section from Clifden to Oughterard is currently being finalised.  The identification and design of cycle routes is a matter for local authorities and I understand that Galway City Council and Galway County Council are working together to progress the overall project.  There are no plans for the development of a cycleway along the Western Rail Corridor.

The implementation of individual national road schemes, including Public Private Partnership (PPP) projects, is a matter for the National Roads Authority (NRA) under the Roads Acts 1993-2007.  In addition, the statutory power to levy tolls on national roads, to make toll bye-laws and to enter into toll agreements with private investors in respect of national roads is vested in the NRA under Part V of the Roads Act (as amended).The contracts for the privately-operated toll schemes are commercial agreements between the NRA and the PPP concessionaires concerned. Two PPP contracts, the M3 Clonee-Kells PPP and the Limerick Tunnel PPP, incorporate a traffic guarantee mechanism. With regard to the remaining PPP schemes, all traffic risk remains with the operator while the State stands to benefit from the revenue share arrangement where the average daily traffic ("ADT") exceeds scheme specific pre-defined threshold traffic.  Noting the above position, I have referred the Deputy's question to the NRA for further reply. Please advise my private office if you do not receive a reply within 10 working days.

#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1799	As part of the Taxi Regulation Review an economic analysis of the taxi market was undertaken, which included an analysis of taxi prices.  The International comparison of taxi prices suggests that prices for taxis appear to be somewhat above average in Ireland relative to other countries. However, the conclusion of the analysis  was that fares in Ireland are very similar to what one would expect given the levels of wages, employment and population density.  The Review Group concluded that the guiding principles that have influenced recent price reviews by the National Transport Authority continue to be a valid basis for achieving an appropriate balance between the interests of taxi drivers and consumers.  The National Maximum Taxi Fare is reviewed every two years and is due to be reviewed by the National Transport Authority again later this year. In line with the conclusions of the Review Group on Taxi Regulation, the benchmarking of taxi prices in other jurisdictions will be included in the analysis carried out for the 2012 taxi fare review.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1800	The rural hackney licence is one of a range of actions proposed in the Taxi Regulation Review Report which has been approved by Government and published last January.  The proposal aims to facilitate low cost entry to the market for transport provision in rural areas that, otherwise, would be unlikely to have such services. The rural hackney licence was proposed as a medium-term measure, to be further developed this year for implementation post-2012.  The regulation of the taxi industry is a matter in the first instance for the (NTA) under the Taxi Regulation Act 2003. The NTA is the lead agency with responsibility for implementation of the recommendations of the Taxi Regulation Review Report, including the proposal for a rural hackney licence.  I understand that the NTA is currently working on progressing this recommendation in accordance with the timeframe of the Taxi Regulation Review Report.

The audit is designed to examine and improve, where necessary and appropriate, the application by local authorities of speed limits and speed limit signage throughout the country, in accordance with my Department's "Guidelines for the Application of Special Speed Limits" which issued to all road authorities last year.In this regard, I recently announced that a review of speed limits would be initiated in 2012.  The primary objective of the review is to improve the consistency of application of speed limits nationwide so as to contribute to a reduction in speeding, which is a key cause of road collisions and fatalities.  My Department is in the process of establishing a stakeholder Working Group. The Automobile Association, an Garda Síochána, the Road Safety Authority, the National Roads Authority and the National Transport Authority have been invited to participate on the Working Group.  It is also intended that local authorities will be represented on the Group.  The Group will monitor an audit of the appropriateness and consistency of special speed limits, oversee consultation on possible changes to default speed limits and advise on the extent to which more appropriate signage can assist in reducing road fatalities.  It is planned that the first meeting of the Group will take place in the coming weeks and that substantial progress will have been made by the end of 2012.

Notwithstanding this having regard to my Departments policy as regards the  development of cycle routes I have a concern regarding the unauthorised and illegal encroachment on closed or abandoned rail lines and ancillary lands. In this regard my Department is currently in correspondence with Iarnród Eireann in relation to what measures they might take to prevent these encroachments.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1806	I fully support the central aim of the strategy in reducing the level of alcohol consumption in Ireland. However, I have serious concerns that a legislative ban on sponsorship would have negative consequences for sport and tourism.  There are huge economic, social and health benefits accruing from sport.  From a health perspective alone, there are clearly significant benefits for individuals and for our health system in maintaining and increasing participation levels in sport. One of the goals of my Department is to contribute to a healthier and more active society by promoting sports participation.  However, it is important that funding is available to sports organisations to ensure that sport is maintained at grassroots level so that as many people as possible can participate.Also, it is my view that sport plays an important role in diverting young people away from alcohol.  The financial support provided through sponsorship is integral to the availability of sport at grassroots level and I am concerned that placing constraints on the sporting organisations by eliminating the drinks industry as a source of sponsorship will have a negative impact on the development and availability of sport, particularly in the current economic climate.  My Department will participate in the consultative process which will now take place on foot of the recommendations of the report.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1807	On foot of a recent Government Decision the National Transport Authority (NTA) has been assigned national responsibility for integrated local and rural transport services.  A further development arising from the Government Decision is that I have established a high level committee, the National Integrated Rural Transport Committee (NIRTC), to oversee the future integration of local and rural transport.  Membership of the NIRTC is drawn from organisations representing key stakeholders in local and rural transport including rural transport groups, Bus Éireann, HSE, Pobal and local authorities, as well as policy makers from the relevant Government Departments.  The Committee is chaired by the NTA.  The first meeting of the new Committee took place on 4th April 2012.  At that meeting Committee members were requested to submit proposals to the NTA by 20 April in relation to possible pilot areas for developing local and rural transport integration.  The NTA will review these submissions and will submit recommendations for my approval.  The approved model projects will be overseen by the NIRTC.

Pension entitlements and pensions in payment under this scheme are primarily matters for the Trustee, the members and the companies participating in the scheme and I have no operational responsibilities in that regard but it is important to state that this scheme is closed to new entrants.  I understand that the Trustee of the IASS has advised the participating employers and membership that the results of the March 2011 actuarial valuation of the scheme indicates a significant deficit as measured under the statutory minimum funding standard.  Resolution of the funding difficulties in the scheme is a matter for the Trustee, the companies participating in the scheme and the members.  I understand that the parties are participating in discussions with the assistance of the Labour Relations Commission to identify solutions.  My Department is not a party to these discussions.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-04-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1810	In relation to the tourism sector — which is my area of responsibility — the temporary lower 9% VAT rate applies to a range of services, including hotels and restaurants.  This initiative was aimed at supporting the creation and maintenance of employment within the tourism sector as well as helping tourism businesses to lower their cost base, thereby allowing them to offer a more competitive product offering to tourists.At this stage I believe that it is still too early to accurately assess the impact of the lower VAT rate and it will be later this year before we can form a view on the effect of this and other measures on employment.  I am, however, pleased to report that overseas tourism numbers have increased by 6% in 2011.  I am also encouraged that seasonally adjusted employment in accommodation and food service activities, as measured by the Central Statistics Office, increased by 11,000 over the nine month period to end-December 2011.  In addition, a recent survey of restaurant owners by the Restaurants Association of Ireland showed that 30% had hired new staff because of the VAT reduction.  The Irish tourism industry is cautiously optimistic about its prospects and performance for the year ahead.  Tourism Ireland is targeting growth in overseas visitor numbers of 4.5%. I would hope that this will result in improved job creation over the course of the year.

It is open to any Irish, EU or Chinese airline to operate services between the two countries under the terms of the agreement and I would very much welcome any such initiative.  The Dublin Airport Authority and Tourism Ireland regularly engage with airlines both in Ireland and internationally in relation to the development of new routes to/from Ireland.  Any decision to operate services between Ireland and China would ultimately be a commercial matter for any of the airlines that are interested in operating in this market.
