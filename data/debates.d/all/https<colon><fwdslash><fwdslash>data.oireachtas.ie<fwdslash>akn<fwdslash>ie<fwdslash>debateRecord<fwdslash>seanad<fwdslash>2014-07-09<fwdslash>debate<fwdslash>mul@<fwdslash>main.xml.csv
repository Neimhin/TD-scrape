We are no further down the line on that issue. As the issue of the concerts was discussed at length yesterday, I do not propose to go into it in any great detail. The hit which the city and the country took yesterday, following the cancellation of the concerts, of €50 million to the hospitality sector and the loss of 70,000 visitors to Ireland made international news yesterday at CNN, Fox News and into BBC. It paints a poor picture of our city and country, a country that has successfully hosted major events. I believe the Dublin City Council manager needs to be taken to task-----

He and his senior officials in the planning department of Dublin City Council should strongly consider their positions. This is a disaster for the city. We have got to make sure we get it right from hereon. However, I believe nothing can be done at this stage. One step would be to look at the legislation my colleague, Deputy Timmy Dooley in the other House, published in respect of amending the process in this regard, not specifically relating to these concerts as unfortunately that decision is made. I am disgusted with Dublin City Council manager and his officials who have made such an atrocious decision for Dublin and the entire country. I ask the Leader for a debate early in the next session with the new Minister for Foreign Affairs. I understand the reshuffle will take place later today or tomorrow. I wish Senator Ivana Bacik all the best. It is fair to mention this in dispatches.  In regard to the situation in Israel and Palestine, all of us condemn the murders of the three Israeli teenagers a couple of weeks ago and the subsequent burning to death of a 15 year old Palestinian child. Now the Israeli defence forces are inflicting collective punishment on the people in Gaza for the actions in which Hamas has been involved and for which I condemn Hamas. There is an amassing of troops at the border at Gaza. Some 12 people were killed in air strikes the day before yesterday and the unrest is being allowed escalate. The Middle East is in a volatile state. We have always had a track record in Ireland of being honest brokers in this regard. When the Palestinian people are being punished again for the actions of Hamas terrorists we should tell the Israeli Government we do not agree with that as it is not the way a civilised state should perform. I ask the Leader, when the new Minister for Foreign Affairs is in place, to raise those concerns with him or her. The pyrite resolution board is in place for a number of months. The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, said he would report back to the House and I understand a quarterly report is being issued. I ask the Leader, in September, to invite the Minister, Deputy Phil Hogan, or the new Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to come in to report on the progress with the pyrite remediation scheme and the remediation of houses. I am in regular contact with those concerned. As with any scheme that is set up there are problems but this Chamber can be used to address those issues.

I am aware another promoter went on radio this morning to express his view which was somewhat critical of the way it was done. We need to look at how we ensure change to ensure it does not happen again. As legislators we have allowed a practice to grow up where concert tickets were being sold in thousands, subject to licence. Clearly that process is no longer workable and needs to be changed. Like Senator Darragh O'Brien, I call for a debate on the Middle East. All of us must have a huge concern about the escalation of military action by Israel in the Gaza Strip and the fact that women and children have been killed in attacks by Israel overnight. Of course, we all condemn the brutal murder of the three Israeli teenagers and the subsequent horrific murder of the Palestinian boy. The Israeli Defence ministry, in suggesting in comments this morning that Israel is merely responding to Hamas rocket attacks, does not ring true. Certainly to target civilians and civilian homes is not a legitimate use of force. All of us would have huge concern about what appears to be a further escalation of military action that is pending. I call for a debate as soon as possible with the new Minister for Foreign Affairs to speak about how the EU can seek to resolve matters and ensure this warfare does not escalate further. As we have witnessed horrific warfare in the Gaza Strip previously I hope we do not see it developing in the coming weeks.  I welcome yesterday's announcement by the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, and the Minister for Children, Deputy Charlie Flanagan, of an expansion for access to after school and community employment child care programmes. In that context, I ask the Leader for a debate on child care in the autumn. Yesterday's important announcement, which went under the radar, will greatly enhance the State provision of child care to low income families. The eligibility criteria will be expanded for the after school programme. A new option is being made available which is important for the parents of primary school children. It will provide not only subsidised after school child care places but also a pick-up service from schools. That will be a huge support to parents who wish to re-enter employment or upskill or train so as to enhance their employment opportunities. That the programme is being extended to children up to 13 years of age, an increase from the current age limit of five years, as well as the general expansion of child care provision for low income families is welcome. I hope we can have a broader debate on child care provision in the autumn.  I commend the advocacy initiative conducted by a large range of social justice NGOs, civil society groups and the community and voluntary sector.It held its final conference yesterday at the RDS - I was privileged to be invited to speak at it - to look at the future of social justice advocacy in Ireland and the role of the community and voluntary sector in pressing for a more equal and inclusive society. I ask the Leader for a debate in due course on the role of the community and voluntary sector in enhancing social justice and seeking a more equal society. I commend Ms Anna Visser and all her team in the Advocacy Initiative.

The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, will be before the United Nations committee on Monday next in Geneva for exchanges on how well Ireland is doing in complying with its human rights obligations. I wish to advise Members that one of this month's newsletters of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights featured the Seanad Public Consultation Committee report that has gone in to the committee in Geneva. It notes that it is a matter of good practice and that, as we found in the hearings, it is rare when parliamentary Members participate in the process of reviewing their country's human rights obligations under a UN human rights treaty. The United Nations noted the matter in its newsletter of this month, put on its page a screen grab of our website calling for submissions on civil and political rights, and quoted the committee's chair, Senator O'Donovan, with regard to what we are doing. It is quite significant, certainly in the United Nations and human rights world, that our committee has been noted in that newsletter that has gone out around the world. In light of that, I wish to ask the Leader two questions. First, I ask that he would ensure that the Minister for Justice and Equality, in her remarks in exchanges with the committee in Geneva on Monday next, will refer to our report, which, I suppose, was an effort to support the Government in its exchange with the committee. Second, as Members may be aware, after every such hearing committees release concluding observations on the exchange with the member state. I ask that, in the autumn, the Leader might ask that the Minister come into the House and that we could have a debate on those concluding observations.
#CatherineNoone	unknown-#CatherineNoone-party	unknown-#CatherineNoone-dob	unknown-#CatherineNoone-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	18	Yesterday was a bad day for Dublin, particularly, I suppose, if one was a Brazilian Garth Brooks fan. Not to be flippant about it in any sense, Mr. Brooks followed through on his threat to cancel all five concerts and it is a considerable blow to the Dublin economy. For a variety of reasons the tentacles of 400,000 fans attending a particular event in the city are far-reaching and affect everything, from restaurants to hotels, to hairdressers, to transports to taxis. It is devastating for the city. I would agree with Senator Darragh O'Brien on this, that the city manager does not seem to have been in any way prepared for this scenario as it unfolded and when officials continually repeated that there would be three concerts and yet, at the same time, communicating to those involved with Mr. Brooks that there could be four potentially. This sort of horse trading might be acceptable to us here in Ireland but, clearly, it does not wash internationally. Those who were complaining in the area where these concerts were to be held were complaining about being inconvenienced by having to listen to music for a few days but it must be said of Mr. Brooks and his concerts, if one were to think of a lot of the events that will happen this summer in Ireland, they would be the least of residents' worries when it comes to fans being potentially unruly and matters getting out of hand. These are the same people who would be complaining about the state of the economy and things not being done. Clearly, there are a lot of people to blame here.

I note that at the time the then Clerk of the Dáil communicated the unanimous resolution to the House of Commons and to the Government of the United Kingdom, and the silence and lack of response since then is deafening. I will say no more on it. If the shoe was on the other foot, I am sure there would be clamour in the United Kingdom or in the North. I primarily rise today to ask the Leader to get the relevant Minister - I am unsure whether it is under the Departments of Education and Skills or Social Protection - to immediately reverse the mean removal of the €20 SOLAS training allowance to those in the national learning networks throughout the country. I received a brief e-mail from one such person, who I will not name. It states that some national learning network students will speak at the AV Room in Leinster House today at 2 p.m. about the removal of the €20 SOLAS training allowance and how it has impacted on their lives and that the correspondent is a constituent and would like if I could come to hear how this cut is impacting on the amount of money that the students have during their training. The invitation states that these disadvantaged persons have decided not to stay in bed and want a better life, but the removal of the training allowance is holding them back, and asks is this the direction that a government should take or is it some sort of a stunt coming up to the end of term that will be forgotten in September. I raised a similar issue about the advocacy for those who are deaf yesterday and I will raise it again tomorrow morning, if necessary. Somebody must listen to the plight of these people. Imagine these people, who are in some way disadvantaged, trying to get back into society and trying to make a case for themselves, having to travel from west Cork, Donegal, Mayo and elsewhere to meet us here today on an issue of removing a paltry sum of €20 of a training allowance. Shame on us all as public representatives. We are letting these people down. I propose an amendment to the Order of Business, to ask the relevant Minister, be it the Minister for Education and Skills or the Minister for Social Protection, to have this cut reversed immediately and to come into this House today, not tomorrow, to explain why these students should travel from all over Ireland to meet us here today on an issue that is beyond explanation.
#AideenHayden	unknown-#AideenHayden-party	unknown-#AideenHayden-dob	unknown-#AideenHayden-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	23	I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Finance to attend the House as a matter of urgency to discuss the report published yesterday afternoon by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform on the mortgage arrears crisis and the measures that are contained in the report to resolve it. The report contains some 47 recommendations aimed at levelling the playing field between distressed borrowers and lending institutions. In particular, I note that the report recognises that banks are acting as judge and jury in determining what options distressed borrowers will be offered, with one bank, in particular, offering significantly more limited options. The report also recognises that the Central Bank must intervene and issue a definition of the term "sustainable solution". Many of us raised this issue previously in this House, that there is far too much differentiation between the lending institutions as to what constitutes a sustainable solution. I am pleased to note that the report highlights the position of joint borrowers. It is one issue that is causing significant difficulties where there is a breakdown in a relationship, with one borrower co-operating and the other borrower not, leaving borrowers in a limbo where they are getting one solution from the courts, yet are put in a situation where they are getting no solution on their mortgage debt. As I stated, there are 47 recommendations in this very important report. If those recommendations were to be implemented by the Minister, Deputy Noonan, whom I am assuming will not be part of the impending Cabinet re-shuffle, it would go a significant way in helping distressed borrowers in this country to achieve an equitable outcome in their situations.

His birthday falls next week and just in case he is not present, Members should remember it by mentioning it today and should celebrate it because, as the Father of the House, he is the longest-serving Member here. I would love to have a debate on the introduction of some form of online information whereby each citizen could see where his or her taxes are being spent. This is available in other countries, where one simply gets that information online. I raised this issue last year and the Minister, Deputy Howlin, stated it was already available. However, that is not the case as not even the information is available. I seek a facility whereby all citizens could go online and see where every penny of their taxpayers' money is spent and on what it is spent. Every citizen should have such information, as it is available in other countries, and states within the United States are also able to do this. Yesterday, Members had a good debate on the Competition and Consumer Protection Bill 2014 with the Minister, Deputy Bruton. However, in the near future, when Members return after the recess, there is room for a debate with whoever is Minister at that stage, regardless of whether it is still Deputy Bruton, on the fact that jobs are available. I read in one newspaper article that something like 400,000 people are on the live register but hoteliers cannot get people to work in hotels. When one visits a hotel or restaurant now, one invariably encounters people from a country other than Ireland. There must be something that can be done to encourage it and while I believe that is possible, it will require a debate. Yesterday, the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation had a good debate involving a number of young entrepreneurs, who clearly identified that there are things we should be doing. Members should make sure they have this debate, hopefully after the summer recess.

It has increased by 50% to a total of €450 million in 2013. This reflects the confidence in the industry and in the dairy industry in particular, ahead of quotas being abolished in 2015. Agriculture has continued to grow right through the recession but it is of vital importance to continue to support and encourage farmers, particularly given the difficulties being encountered by farmers in the beef sector. Members must do everything possible, prior to the autumn sales of weanlings, to make sure the beef sector equally can move ahead and find the finances necessary to grow its business from 2015 onwards.

Members should reflect on one key policy priority of the outgoing Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, which was that all outpatients should be seen by a consultant within 12 months, while all inpatients should be seen within nine months. Today, I received figures from the Health Service Executive, HSE, regarding University Hospital Waterford, which is located in the Leader's native city, showing that 4,176 patients in the south east have been waiting for more than 12 months to see a consultant or to be seen at the hospital. There are a number of key pressure points in dermatology, ear, nose and throat, ENT, and orthopaedics but 4,176 patients who should be seen within 12 months have been waiting for a longer than that time. Moreover, nearly half of them have been waiting for more than two years and clearly, the policy has failed. In a hospital within the Leader's native city, there still is no 24-7 cardiology cover, despite a promise made by the outgoing Minister for Health that this would be provided. Proper dermatology services are still lacking because consultant posts cannot be filled and yet, a recent OECD report shows that consultants in this State are paid more than in most countries in the OECD. I again ask for the new Minister for Health, when he or she is appointed, to come into the House to have a debate on the failures of the outgoing Minister for Health, as well as on the impact those policy failures are having on patients across the State. I certainly will take the opportunity to raise the real concerns of the people of Waterford and the south east in respect of cardiology, dermatology, ENT, neurology and orthopaedic services, all of which are critical areas in which there are backlogs and long waiting times. I appeal to the Leader to arrange such a debate as soon as the Cabinet reshuffle has been completed and Members can get down to the serious business of fixing the problems in the health service.
#JohnKelly	unknown-#JohnKelly-party	unknown-#JohnKelly-dob	unknown-#JohnKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	29	The blame game with regard to the cancellation of the Garth Brooks concerts continues but over the past week, all I heard with regard to the residents around Croke Park was a single word, around which I could not really get my head, namely, "lockdown". I was told it was quite serious and was led to believe that people around that area could not go out and buy a loaf of bread for five days. They would lead one to believe they were somehow in Beirut rather than Croke Park and that Garth Brooks fans were terrorists coming down Jones Road. However, I discussed this matter last night with a member of the Garda Síochána. He told me that although the GAA is being criticised for not making a public statement on this issue, the association had agreed parking facilities for the residents at Jones Road, which are free and just across the road. Moreover, they get passes in and out of Jones Road at will. Local kids are employed in an array of services that are provided to the public but they will not be getting that opportunity now. There is emergency access for general practitioners and ambulances. They get tickets to the event, as well as an offer of €500,000 for either local services or some kind of local community development. People must understand that while life would be uncomfortable for them, one cannot make an omelette without breaking eggs. It was ironic that last Sunday, two days before the decision was made to cancel the five events, a friend of mine, Shane Curran, who played in goal for Roscommon, wrote an article in the Sunday Independent headed "A new stadium would breathe life into ailing region". Mr. Curran suggests that consideration be given to building a new stadium outside the M50 in the midlands - either west or slightly east of the Shannon - in a neglected part of rural Ireland where there is no development and obviously no intention of development for the foreseeable future.

I second Senator O'Donovan's proposed amendment to the Order of Business. Further to raising an issue yesterday regarding abuse of social media and anonymous tweets, I brought the issue to the attention of Mr. Billy Hawkes, the Data Protection Commissioner. In a warning to an MEP not to repeat lies on Twitter, unless he takes down those tweets he will be open to prosecution by the Data Protection Commissioner. I hope to proceed in this regard as that will teach certain people lessons about how to treat others and to have some respect and manners for the ordinary citizen and not to walk on the ordinary citizen. I certainly will campaign to protect the rights of Irish citizens in respect of social media and the abuse thereof. I certainly will investigate what other action should be taken in the State in this particular regard. What is happening at present is that tweets and statements are being put up by anonymous sources, which can be and will be traced. However, these are then fed into the system and become a reality. Then, media such as TheJournal.ie carry out an investigation, check the sources and will not put them up unless they are satisfied the facts are true and cannot be challenged in court or otherwise. This is an area the Seanad should debate in the autumn. The appropriate Minister should be brought into the House to outline precisely what action is being taken in the State. The citizens have a right to be protected and I note Members have protection in the Chamber.We have the right of response in this House and we have the privilege to make statements to alert people to this issue and, if necessary, name those who are abusing the system. When a statement goes up, it leads to further abuses throughout the country and it ends up as a fact when it is only fiction. For all time, that will be in Google. If one Googles a name, those wrong statements will appear. I am alerting the House to this issue. I will be considering a Private Members' Bill and I have been in contact with the Data Protection Commissioner to see if he requires further support. He could bring that to the Government. I support the points made by Senators O'Brien and Bacik on the situation in Gaza. It is outrageous. I ask the Israelis to desist and ask Hamas to stop firing bombs into Israel. It is only provoking a very powerful foe.

In respect of the events over the weekend, which have reached a crescendo with yesterday's cancellation of all five concerts, it is incredulous that a concert promoter and a venue could agree a deal of this magnitude, sell tickets and then express amazement when permission is refused even though they knew full well the imposition it would have on residents and the already fraught relationship that exists there. Over the weekend, Henry Mountcharles expressed surprise that the potential for such licensing difficulties did not occur to those involved. He is not unused to holding events of this magnitude and his views should be taken on board. Is it seriously to be suggested that a five-day event which attracted nearly 400,000 people did not ring warning bells in the heads of those involved in the organisations concerned, particularly given the residential setting? I urge Senators to read the statement from Dublin City Council, which seemingly advised the promoters at every stage of the process that it was concerned about the number of shows and their impact on local residents. We now have a situation in which many locals are understandably furious because of the promises they were given and ticket holders who bought their tickets in good faith are also very annoyed at what has occurred. If promoters and venues are not willing to act responsibly, the Oireachtas should do it for them. I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to the House to discuss amending the legislation to ensure tickets for large-scale concerts cannot be sold in advance of acquiring the requisite licence.

Given that we lack guidelines on after-school care, it would be a very welcome opportunity to have a debate. The issue I wish to raise concerns investment, Ireland and the European Commission. We are sleepwalking into the next round of the European Commission. We often say Ireland punches above its weight at the EU. However, while it is fantastic that Mairead McGuinness, MEP, was elected Vice-President of the European Parliament, in terms of chairs and vice-chairs of European Parliament committees, there is no Irish member in the leadership of the 22 parliamentary committees. In respect of the Commission, it is suggested that Ireland should seek the agriculture portfolio. That sounds great because agriculture is important to Ireland but the work has been done on agriculture. Ireland should be seeking the digital agenda or taxation portfolios. The digital agenda is something that could benefit Ireland. We could bring investment into Dublin and the rest of Ireland. It is a missed opportunity to build on the work that Commissioner Kroes has done to date. We should be having a discussion on the portfolio we will seek, as well as putting forward the right candidate for that portfolio. I know my calls will fall on deaf ears but if we are serious about maintaining our influence in Europe, we should be looking for a portfolio and an agenda on which work will be done over the next five years.

Equally, however, it is wrong in our democracy that any one man, such as the individual to whom the Senator referred, should have so much power without any checks and balances or right of appeal. It is wrong in any democracy and it calls for redress. He should at least have listened to council members. Perhaps when we return in the autumn, and hopefully matters are calmer, we will reflect on these events and devise or put forward views and ideas as to how the system should operate. It is a frightful mess as it stands.

Last week my colleague, Senator O'Donovan, spoke about the difficulties US citizens face in getting work permits in Ireland. I am delighted that on of foot of our discussion in the Seanad on the one-year J1 intern programme, the programme is now being extended until 2016. I thank the Leader for raising the issue with the Taoiseach. I am also concerned about another issue raised by Senator O'Donovan, namely, the cuts to the advocacy service for members of the deaf community. A number of us received leaflets on the subject as we entered Leinster House this morning. There is nothing more ironic than a Government cutting funding for a service that speaks for people who cannot speak for themselves. They were told in an e-mail that their appeal would be heard by telephone. That is the equivalent of asking an illiterate person to make an appeal in writing. This issue needs to be debated. I am disappointed we did not debate it yesterday because the Members opposite were unable to support our amendment to the Order of Business. I ask them to reconsider in order that we can arrange a debate next week on the cuts to funding. I support my Seanad colleague on the appeal for a debate on the Dublin-Monaghan bombing. Some 33 people were killed in a mass murder. All we ask is that the British Government release the files. That has been called for by all parties in this and the other House. If I were the British Government and had been accused of mass murder by another state, I would like to clear my name by releasing those files. It does not want to release the files, however. Perhaps Senator Coghlan raised the issue when he had lunch with the British ambassador and the files may be released before 2016.

The Committee of Public Accounts has written to the Joint Committee on Health and Children to tell us we cannot deal with any of the organisations that are funded by the HSE. Approximately 25% of the HSE's budget, or €3.27 billion, is being paid out to 2,600 organisations. We are unable to examine how that money is being spent by these organisations because the Committee of Public Accounts claims it is the only committee that is entitled to examine this expenditure. It is only investigating two organisations but another 2,598 are also being funded by the HSE. The Chairman of the committee should be brought into this House and asked to explain why we are not allowed to do the job we were appointed to committees to do. We are not allowed to investigate how 25% of the HSE's budget is being spent. It is outrageous and the Committee of Public Accounts should stop acting as if it is in complete control of the health budget. The only way to achieve that is by asking the Chairman of the committee to come into the House to explain why an embargo is being imposed on members of the Joint Committee on Health and Children.

The massing of troops and tanks by Israel as a prelude to an assault on a downtrodden, deprived and defenceless people is reprehensible. The only thing that can come from such an assault, as we have seen in the past, is the slaughter of the innocents. Surely we must have learned something from the other trouble spots in the world - Iraq being an example - which is that force is no substitute whatsoever for dialogue. There should be dialogue in this case. When a government of unity was established by the Palestinians, I thought that all of us, including Israel, would welcome that. Instead, however, Israel went on a diplomatic offensive to undermine it. We saw exactly what happened in the North of Ireland when we took the power-sharing approach and dialogue began to move forward. That is precisely what is required at the moment.  My voice may be small-----

I know they listen because of the missives I have received from them in the past any time I have spoken on this issue in the House. I spoke on the invasion of Iraq along exactly the same lines. I do not want to say "Weren't we correct at that time?", but I ask Israel, for once, to let decency prevail in this particular case. As we sit here, hundreds of Palestinian prisoners are on hunger strike. A large number of them have already been hospitalised. Do we need to look at Northern Ireland to realise what that means, and the potential it has for further conflict and further loss of life? I genuinely believe that Israel is not listening. I am hearing this from among the Irish people and I can see it in the media. The Israeli ambassador would be doing good not just for his own country or for a Palestinian state, but also for humanity, by relaying what he is hearing on the ground here back to his own masters in Israel.
#JimWalsh	unknown-#JimWalsh-party	unknown-#JimWalsh-dob	unknown-#JimWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	44	Much has been said in recent days about the terrible loss of revenue arising from the cancellation of concerts in Croke Park. It is self-evident and does not need any further embellishment from me. However, there are certain issues from which lessons must be learned. One is that no amount of spin will substitute for real and meaningful reform of local government. The fact that any one person is allowed to make decisions of this nature, particularly somebody who has no electoral mandate and is appointed in a system that is highly questionable, must be examined. I may not be up to speed with how the Local Appointments Commission currently functions, but when I was involved in local government it was pretty evident that it operated as an old boys' club. The names of people who were going to secure positions were often known well in advance of any interviews or recruitment process. At one stage, I heard a Minister describe the Local Appointments Commission as being corrupt. It needs to be looked at and we should move away from executive decisions. There should be an incremental movement to reserve functions of the council so that elected members, who have a mandate from the people, can exercise decisions. They are accountable to the public and will be held responsible for their decisions subsequently. I ask the Leader to invite the new Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to attend this House for a full debate on the issue.

I agree with my colleagues, including Senator Ó Murchú, who have eloquently articulated the situation concerning the Palestinians and what is happening in Israel and Palestine at the moment. It is a real travesty that Israel set about ensuring that the peace talks under the US Secretary of State, John Kerry, would not make progress. It was a brave move on Mr. Kerry's part as peace talks had failed so many times. In the lead up to those talks, I happened to be in Israel and Palestine with a group from the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs. It was evident to us from our discussions, both in the Knesset and also among the Palestinians, that while the Palestinians were hopeful, there was no doubt that the Israelis did not want it to succeed.  The continuation of the settlements, the imprisonment of Palestinians and their treatment in prison, and particularly the treatment of youngsters in Palestine, have no doubt led to the radicalisation of a number of those people. It is very difficult. If any of us were young Palestinians and we saw the manner in which President Abbas, who has made strenuous efforts to get an agreement, has been treated and the dismissive approach of the Israelis, I think one would be steering towards Hamas as the only ultimate solution for a resolution of the difficulties in Israel.
#MartinConway	unknown-#MartinConway-party	unknown-#MartinConway-dob	unknown-#MartinConway-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	47	I find myself in agreement with Senator Daly on the removal of the advocacy service for the deaf community. This has been an oversight in reform, so I sincerely hope that this situation will be remedied. There are many ways in which that can be done. I urge the Government and the new Cabinet to identify a way of restoring the advocacy service. For obvious reasons, the deaf community feels totally isolated. Unfortunately, deafness has been isolated as a disability. We have had productive discussions here on Irish Sign Language and I respectfully suggest that Seanad Éireann is a friend to deaf people in Ireland. The message should go from this House that we believe there is a case for this advocacy service to be funded. Common sense should prevail. I also agree with Senator Ó Murchú and others who have spoken about the international situation. Senator Walsh referred to the licensing issue with one person having the final say. In any society, it is always good to have a structured system of appeal. We have it in the planning process and social welfare area, as well as for medical cards. It operates in myriad areas in society, so why should the licensing structure be any different? We need fundamental reform of this matter because it is embarrassing not just for the 400,000 people involved, but also for our reputation internationally.

We are told that is part of a drive to reduce TV licence evasion, but it seems to me that the Minister is proposing to allow the rifling of private data to facilitate RTE. He is proposing to grant a power that not even the Revenue Commissioners possess. The Minister is acting in keeping with the uncomfortably close relationship between the Government and RTE. A broadcast tax has been promised that would be levied on every household in Ireland regardless of whether people are accessing RTE television content. Not satisfied with that proposal, which seems unjust to me, the Government now wishes to reach into the data of private individuals to satisfy the bloated bureaucracy in RTE. Let us remember that RTE is back in surplus. It has had an increased allocation from the licence fee and is sitting on a massive landbank in a prestigious area of Dublin. It is proposing to go ahead with a massive development of the order of €350 million. It seems that special treatment is being given to RTE in these situations.  If a person has a private contractual relationship with a service provider, be it for television, online betting or a magazine subscription, the data created as a result of that relationship is private, unless there is an overwhelming public interest in releasing it, for example, in a criminal investigation. It should not be the business of RTE or An Post to snoop on the activities of private citizens for revenue-raising purposes. This crosses a line, so I would be grateful if the Leader could invite the past, present or future Minister - whoever he or she may be - so that we can debate this matter because major issues of concern have arisen.

In debates on the Israeli-Palestinian question in the House, I tend to have a lot of sympathy for the Israelis. I am aware that would be a minority position. In the past, the Israelis and the Jews, in particular, have been the victims of dreadful atrocities, including the Holocaust. Israel is a nation under siege. However, it is time Israel recognised that there is a political solution on offer which it should negotiate with the Palestinians and that it is to its benefit to do so. It has peace treaties with Egypt and Jordan and other nations in that area are not out to destroy it. I agree that Israel should take a more measured response to what is happening.  However, I do not agree that Hamas should be given control. Hamas is the agent of Iran. It discriminates against women in an awful way in the West Bank and Gaza, but that is a little beside the point. I would never say that Hamas should be given a leading role in anything. It would be good if the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade came to the House for a debate.

A Russian television network highlighted the speech by Pope Francis in the Santa Maria basilica on 15 June in which he criticised Europe for being tired because of the high level of unemployment and discarding the elderly. This Government has caused huge stress and anxiety to older people in our society. Older people have suffered a raft of cuts under this Government. Over the past three years, the telephone allowance has been abolished, the household benefits package has been slashed and the fuel allowance has been cut by six weeks. I can assure Members of the Government parties that Fianna Fáil will resist any tampering with the free travel pass introduced by Mr. Haughey, as Minister for Finance, in outstanding legislation in 1967. Ministers are supposed to be innovative and creative. That is what they are there for and not to let the bureaucrats tell them what to do. We will fight this on the doorsteps and on the plinth.

I support the request from Senator Jim D'Arcy that the Leader invite the new Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to the House to discuss two issues, if we have time which, I hope, we will. It is important to discuss the situation in the Middle East. I listened with interest to the comments by my colleagues about the current crisis. While Garth Brooks is on the front page of every newspaper, there is a situation developing in the Middle East with profound long-term consequences to every citizen of the globe.  I accept what Senator Walsh said that we must reflect on the plight of Palestinian young people and ask what would we do if we were them. However, I would also ask colleagues to reflect on the plight of Israeli young people, not just today but for generations. Their existence is deemed by a certain number of states and terrorist groups as being dispensable. Let us acknowledge that, even as we speak, there are states whose avowed intention is to wipe the state of Israel off the map. If we were living under those conditions, we would feel very defensive. I am not condoning the excessiveness of the Israel military operations but we must always see both sides of the story and we should strongly proclaim the right of Israel to continue exist. That should be at the centre of our debate.  The second reason to ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to the House is that we urgently need a debate on the political situation in Northern Ireland. The House will be in recess on 31 August, the 20th anniversary of the 1994 ceasefire, which came 25 years too late for 3,000 people. However, it would be useful if we debated the current situation in Northern Ireland before the recess, if possible.

They had a press conference this morning and will hold a demonstration at lunchtime and I hope to see Members of this House supporting them. In my own town of Kilfinane, the Leader group, Ballyhoura Development, is the major employer in the town. It is probably the only organisation in the town bringing people into the area. Efforts made by Ballyhoura Development and its predecessor, Ballyhoura Fáilte, over the past 20 years have benefited the area and the town hugely. In that part of south east County Limerick and north Cork, from Cappamore to Kilmallock to Mitchelstown to Castletownroche, Ballyhoura has become byword for quality. We have the fantastic Ballyhoura mountain bike trial and the Ballyhoura hostel and there are food brands which carry the Ballyhoura name. It has almost become a quality mark in the region. We have opened up this Chamber as a forum previously. I understand alignment to an extent and I know that some Leader organisations are not as good at what they do as Ballyhoura is in my area. Ballyhoura should be the ideal to which everybody aspires. We are in the middle of a Cabinet reshuffle and there will be a new Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government. Limerick has suffered already with the amalgamation of the county and city councils. I ask the Government hold back on alignment for now until we have a proper debate in this Chamber with the CEOs of the different Leader organisations and the new Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government. Let us hear their points of view. I hope the Leader can facilitate that as soon as possible.

While Senator White said she would be particularly suited to the Department of Justice and Equality, I think she would be well-qualified to take on any ministry save that of defence because I doubt she could sit on the fence for very long. On the sixth of anniversary of Dáil Éireann passing a motion calling on the British Government to hand over any original documents it has on the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, I join with Senator Darragh O'Brien and others in calling on it to do so. I further suggest that we have an all-party motion in this House calling on the British Government to stop hiding behind many false walls and hand over whatever original documentation it has on these two atrocities which occurred on this part of the island. I join previous speakers in calling for a debate on the planning process, specifically as it applies to major events such as the proposed Garth Brooks concerts, which ended in a fiasco. It is not right to vest in one individual the power to decide whether an event should proceed. If only one person in each country had the power to decide the judicial outcomes of civil cases and his or her decision was not subject to an appeal mechanism, our democracy would be a poor one. Having said that, the location of a major arena in an urban area is not a reason for ignoring the wishes of local people. Local people, including those living near Croke Park, should be given adequate consideration with regard to any plans to hold major events in future.

The Government has sought on a number of occasions - as did, I presume, the previous Government - the relevant documentation from the British Government and the Taoiseach has sought it from the British Prime Minister. The Government will continue to try to obtain the relevant documentation, which the British Government is not currently releasing. I assure the House that the Government will continue to press this matter with the British Government. A number of Senators raised the question of the negative publicity arising from the Garth Brooks debacle. Short-term, knee-jerk reactions, especially regarding planning legislation, will not provide a viable solution to the problem. In light of the current controversy, it appears that certain aspects of the current regulations require review, in particular, the timeline requirements for the submission of applications by event organisers, the deciding of such applications by the relevant planning authority in advance of an event or a series of events, and the absence of a specific appeals mechanism in respect of decisions on event licences, which is an issue a number of Senators raised. Judicial review is an avenue that can be pursued. In light of the current controversy, the Taoiseach has requested the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to conduct a review of the planning regulations with a view to preventing a scenario arising in future similar to that which has arisen with regard to the Garth Brooks concerts. A great deal of time and effort has been put into bringing this event to Ireland, including by businesses such as hotels and bars, and large numbers of people from abroad had planned to attend the concerts. A great deal of work is invested in trying to attract this type of business to the country, and in that respect it is an absolute disgrace that this has happened. A number of Senators raised the current conflict in Israel and Palestine and the unacceptable atrocities that have taken place in recent weeks. I will accede to the request to invite the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to the House to set out the Government's position on the conflict and outline the European response. Senator Darragh O'Brien called for a report on the progress made in the pyrite remediation scheme. As the quarterly review of the scheme is due soon, we will probably arrange to discuss the matter in September. Senator Bacik raised some of the same issues as Senator O'Brien and called for a debate on child care. She also welcomed the announcement that after-school child care is to be extended and commended all the individuals involved in the Advocacy Initiative. Senator Zappone raised the report of the Seanad Public Consultation Committee on human rights. I compliment the Senator on her input into the report and I will ask the Minister for Justice and Equality to comment on it. It is good that United Nations publications note that the Seanad has spoken on this matter. I will request the Minister's attendance for a debate on the concluding observations of the United Nations when they become available. Senator O'Donovan referred to the removal of the SOLAS training allowance and spoke about advocacy services for deaf people, as did a number of other Senators. I will not amend the Order of Business to have a Minister come before the House to discuss this issue today as it can be addressed at any time, with a Minister present, if the Senator raises it on the Adjournment. Senator Hayden referred to the necessity to implement the recommendations of the report on mortgage arrears. I fully concur with her and hope it will be possible to have the relevant Minister come before the House to discuss the report and its recommendations. Senator Quinn spoke about the possibility of having information provided online to notify people of where tax revenue is spent. I recall the Senator raising this matter with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, last year. He also noted that a significant number of job vacancies are not being filled, despite the fact that 400,000 people are unemployed. Senator Comiskey welcomed figures on investment in farm buildings, which augur well for the future of farming.  Senator Cullinane referred to hospital waiting lists. While some people have been waiting for up to two years, the position has improved significantly since the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, took office. One need only recall the waiting lists in place when he took office. A difficulty has arisen in filling consultant posts. While the Senator argues that consultants are paid too much, consultants argue that they are not paid enough and suggest that this explains the failure to fill 20% of posts.I agree that something must be done to address the matter.

Senator van Turnhout spoke about child care and after-school care, and she also gave her views on the next person to fill the portfolio of EU Commissioner. I am sure the Government is working on that as we speak. Senator Colm Burke referred to the €3.7 billion paid to various health organisations and the health committee not being allowed to examine these. That is a matter for the Committee of Public Accounts and the health committee, and I have no wish to get involved in the arguments. I am sure they can sort it out between themselves. Senator Mullen spoke about the television licence fee. The Minister has indicated that information should be used by An Post to identify licence fee evaders, and licence fee evasion is an ongoing scourge, as we know. We estimate the proportion of people not paying their television licence fee is running at over 15%, and that is more than three times the rate of our nearest neighbour. That means approximately €25 million to €30 million of potential revenue for RTE is lost annually, as the objective of the television licence system is to fund public service broadcasting. The revenue lost through fee evasion has an immediate impact on the quality of service which can be provided and it also creates inequality between compliant licence holders and evaders. As long ago as 2004, the Comptroller and Auditor General highlighted the fact that there was no legal obligation on cable or satellite television service suppliers to inform An Post of the names and addresses of persons availing of services. Given that ComReg estimates that over 73% of television households have such services, this measures should significantly reduce the level of evasion. An Post will have access to the information solely for this statutory function related to television licence fee collections and the commercial confidentiality of the information will be safeguarded. With this proposal, the licence fee inspection and collection system can enter the 21st century. The remaining Senators raised matters which I have already addressed. Senator Bradford spoke about the political position in Northern Ireland and I will endeavour to have the Taoiseach come here to discuss the matter in early course. Senator Heffernan spoke about the work of the Leader organisations, which should certainly be lauded for their past work. I am sure the work will be continued by the local development organisations with an input under the local authority umbrella. We have had comprehensive debates in the House on this matter over the last year and when the appropriate Bills came before the House. I must mention my colleagues, including Senator White. Fianna Fáil has a bit of a brass neck to speak about cuts.

I wish her well on her elevation. I remind Senators that a Senator may speak only once on Report Stage except the proposer of an amendment who may reply to the discussion on the amendment. On Report Stage, each amendment must be seconded. Amendment No. 1 in the names of Senators Cullinane, Reilly and Ó Clochartaigh has been ruled out of order.

I am sure she will have a very busy few hours and days ahead. We will not spend too much time on the Bill today as we spent a lot of time on Second and Committee Stages discussing all of the issues. We have retabled amendments because we were simply not happy with the responses we received. It is unfortunate amendment No. 1 was ruled out of order. A blunt instrument was used but we must accept the ruling of the Cathaoirleach. Amendment No. 2 deals with the habitual residence condition. Deciding officers have the power to revisit the matter of whether the habitual residence condition continues to be satisfied in their review of claims and payments. The Department needs the ability to take action to ensure payments are made only to people entitled to them. We have expressed concerns to the Minister about the eventual outworking of this. Perhaps the legislation should include some safeguards. We would not like to see a situation where an unfair burden is placed on people to continually jump through hoops to prove they are habitually resident. Anybody who deals with people on a regular basis with regard to social welfare claims, or a raft of social welfare entitlements, is very familiar with the habitual residence condition.That presents problems for people who were born here, moved to Britain and returned to this country. They now find themselves in difficulty because of that, nor would we like to see someone not leaving the State to visit relatives because they have a fear they will be cut off. That is an issue on which FLAC has lobbied all of us. We have spent some time on Committee Stage dealing with this and the Minister responded, but we are not satisfied that sufficient safeguards are in place in this area and for that reason we will be pressing the amendment.

The five factors are derived from the European Union legislation, Article 11 of Regulation 987/2009, the European Court of Justice jurisprudence, the Swaddling case, and the Knock case, among others, and they are listed in section 246(4) of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005.
 Guidelines on habitual residence have been published by my Department. They are freely available to everybody and are updated regularly to take account of developments nationally, at EU level and at the European Court of Justice. Full training is given on the use of the guidelines to all deciding officers and designated persons, with refresher training offered when the guidelines are updated. If a person is dissatisfied with a decision given relating to habitual residence there are two avenues of appeal open to the person. He or she may seek a review of that decision, in other words, if information was omitted in regard to the application he or she can bring in the new information and ask for a review or he or she may appeal to the social welfare appeals office.  As the elements for the decision making process are already laid down in primary legislation, and there are adequate means of redress through the review and the appeal procedures, I remain of the view that it is unnecessary to provide secondary legislation as proposed by the amendment. The Senator mentioned the FLAC submission. As he is probably aware, there has been a general welcome for the fact that the two year rule no longer applies but on the other hand, if people are claiming social welfare, we do not want to be paying it to people who have left the country for the periods concerned. The Senator also mentioned Irish emigrants who may return home to Ireland. This is a very important point for all the Senators. The EU rules prevent discrimination on nationality grounds in regard to social security. As I believe the Senator is aware, it is not possible to exempt a particular category of Irish citizens such as returning emigrants from the habitual residence condition, HRC, without extending the same treatment to all EU nationals. However, the guidelines regarding determination of HRC specifically address the issue of returning emigrants. The guidelines state: "A person who had previously been habitually resident in the State and who moved to live and work in another country and then resumes his/her long-term residence in the State may be regarded as being habitually resident immediately on his/her return to the State." This was a much more vexed issue when I became Minister three and a half years ago and we worked to address the problems that were causing some difficulty. A number of Senators on both sides of the House raised specific cases with me at the time.  Arrangements were agreed with Safe Home Limited, a registered charity, to assist with the difficulty experienced by a minority of returning Irish emigrants in demonstrating their intention to live here permanently for the purposes of satisfying the HRC. To assist with this issue, Safe Home Ireland Limited has drawn up a check list of a range of documents that will help returning emigrants, whom we are happy to have return, show that they have returned to Ireland permanently. Safe Home has also designed a declaration that will confirm where a customer is engaging with it as part of the repatriation process. It is intended that the declaration will be associated with any social assistance claim that a customer might make. This measure should help to expedite the decision making process in these cases as it can be accepted as proof that the customer has returned to reside in the State on a permanent basis. If there are cases where the person still has residence outside the country and, for instance, he or she is simply returning home for a short period while retaining residence in another country, that is not somebody who is becoming habitually resident. However, we have used the arrangements with Safe Home Limited in particular to take account of older people coming back from, say, the United Kingdom, who might understandably be confused between the complexities of the two separate social security systems. To my knowledge, those arrangements are working very well unless Senator Cullinane is aware of cases to the contrary. It was an issue when I became Minister but as far as I am aware, we do not see anything like the volume of queries. Cases can arise from time to time where someone has not decided to do it permanently and, obviously, they have issues to address.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22396	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	159	I am very pleased to have the opportunity to introduce this Bill to the Seanad today. The Bill, which has passed all Stages in the Dáil, has been recognised as progressive legislation which will provide us with the flexibility required to keep pace with the global skills market while simultaneously prioritising the rights of foreign nationals who choose to work in the State. This amending legislation, and the new regulations which will support it, will enhance our employment permits system in order that we can continue to develop enterprise in the State for all of our benefit, while also protecting the Irish labour market and the employment rights of those migrants who come to work here. The following are some of the key objectives in the Bill. First, it recognises the different types of employment scenarios which arise for enterprises, both Irish and multinational, in the modern workplace. It provides for a range of employment permit categories to facilitate foreign workers to enter employment legally in the State, thus meeting our demand for highly skilled personnel, as well as filling temporary gaps and accommodating intra-company transfers and contract service providers. It will allow for flexibility, by way of regulations, to provide for both eligible and ineligible employments for employment permits dependent on skills shortages and surpluses and efforts under way in the education sector. Second, it strengthens the requirement that preference must be given, wherever possible, to Irish and EEA nationals in the awarding of contracts of employment. This policy underpins the Government’s employment creation objectives by requiring employers in the State to hire in a balanced manner from the local labour market and fulfils our EU obligations regarding community preference under the treaties. Third, it amends the 2003 Act to provide a defence to a migrant who is in breach of employment permit legislation despite his or her efforts to work in line with statutory requirements. These amendments address the Younis case, which was delivered on 31 August 2012. Fourth, the Bill establishes a category of employment permit to assist those migrants who have fallen out of the employment permits system through no fault of their own. I am pleased to be in a position to facilitate my colleague the Minister for Justice and Equality in bringing forward proposed changes to legislation under her remit. The Minister wishes to make a number of technical amendments to the Immigration Act 2004 and to the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act 2000 which will provide for urgent and badly needed efficiencies in the operation of the immigration system. I propose to outline the main provisions
of the Bill, as passed by the Dáil. It consists of six Parts, and 39 sections. Part 1 contains the Short Title, collective citation, construction and commencement provisions, and interpretation. Part 2 amends the Act of 2003. Section 3 amends section 2 of the Act of 2003 to provide a defence to a foreign national to the offence of having been employed without an employment permit. It ensures the transfer of a foreign national in the intra-company transfer situation is included in the general requirement to have an employment permit, and it provides an exemption from the requirement for an employment permit for certain foreign nationals who are in the State under the terms of the Diplomatic Relations and Immunities Act 1967. Section 4 amends the Act of 2003 by inserting an additional section 2B and 2C which permits a foreign national, who can satisfy a court that he or she took all reasonable steps to comply with the requirement of having an employment permit, to take civil action for compensation against the employer, notwithstanding the illegality of the contract. This is in addition to potential criminal prosecution of the employer. Part 3 amends the Act of 2006 to provide for nine new purposes for which I, as Minister, may grant employment permits, to strengthen the requirement for employers to consider EEA nationals before foreign nationals, and to focus on the particular needs of start-up companies by providing necessary flexibility with key sectors of economic growth and make provision for the role that IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland play in enterprise development and job creation. Section 6
inserts new section 1A into the 2006 Act. That section which was introduced on Committee Stage in the Dáil, is a revised definition of remuneration for the purposes of the grant of an employment permit and provides for different components of remuneration for the different categories of employment permits. Section 7
inserts new sections 3A, 3B, 3C, 3D, 3E and 3F into the 2006 Act. Section 3A sets out the different purposes for which employment permits can be granted. They cover critical skills employment permits
for attracting
foreign nationals with skills that are in short supply in Ireland and which are critical to our economic success, such as ICT skills, dependant-partner-spouse employment permits for attracting highly skilled foreign nationals or researchers, general employment permits for skills of a more general nature where the employer was unable to fill the position from the EEA labour market, intra-company transfer employment permits for facilitating transfers between branches of a company for a specified duration and project, contract for service employment permits for facilitating the temporary employment in Ireland of foreign nationals working in a company based outside of Ireland that has won a contract to provide services to an Irish company, reactivation employment permits for foreign nationals who entered the labour market on a valid employment permit but who have subsequently fallen out of the system for a variety of reasons, including redundancies, exploitation, and ignorance, through no fault of their own - this permit type is a direct response to cases that the Migrant Rights Centre of Ireland has brought to our attention over the years - exchange agreement employment permits for dealing with reciprocal international arrangements - the Fulbright Scholarship is among the best known of such programmes, sports and cultural employment permits for dealing with sports and cultural professionals, and internship employment permits for dealing with applications related to student internship programmes involving work experience in employments on the highly skilled occupations list. Section 3B inserts a new provision in the 2006 Act which recognises the role that IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland play in giving advice on applications made by their client companies and provides for the Minister to consider their recommendations without being bound by them. Sections 3C to 3F, inclusive, set out a number of supplementary conditions applying to dependant-partner-spouse, intra-company transfer, contract for services and sports and cultural employment permits. Section 8 amends section 4 of the 2006 Act. The amendment provides for application requirements following on the new categories of employment permit. It also provides for a minimum period of employment for the critical skills employment permit, and transitional arrangements for the spouse, dependant or partner of current so-called green card holders. Section 9
replaces the current section 6 and section 7 of the 2006 Act concerning information to be provided with an application. Section 10 amends section 8 of the 2006 Act in line with the new employment permit categories. It sets out what employment permission the employment permit grants to the foreign national and the duration of the employment permit. Section 11 amends section 9 of the 2006 Act which concerns the type of information to be included on an employment permit and permits the Minister to include any additional information considered appropriate. Section 12 amends section 10 of the 2006 Act which provides powers to restrict the granting of an employment permit on the basis of what is commonly known as the labour market needs test and the 50-50 rule. The labour market needs test is now dealt with in the new section 10A which is inserted by section 13 of the Bill. The 50-50 rule requires that employers seeking to hire foreign nationals on an employment permit have at least 50% of their workforce from Ireland or the EEA. The amendment requires the 50-50 rule to be applied in all situations except in the case of a start-up company. Section 23 of the Bill provides for safeguards by imposing a limit on the duration of the renewed permit. Section 13 amends the Act of 2006 by inserting a new section 10A to deal with the labour market needs test. The labour market needs test seeks to ensure an offer of employment is first made to people already in the local and EEA labour markets and will ensure that such tests will apply to relevant applications for employment permits irrespective of who makes the application.The labour market needs test will, subject to the specified exceptions, apply to the general employment permits and employment permits relating to contract for services agreements. Section 10A also provides that the Minister may make regulations regarding the requirements of the labour market needs test. Section 14 amends section 11 of the 2006 Act, which concerns the matters to which the Minister must have regard when considering an application. The amendment adds a provision in order that consideration will include the nine new purposes specified in section 3A(2) inserted by section 7 of the Bill. Section 15 amends section 12 of the 2006 Act, which provides the grounds for refusing to grant or renew an employment permit. There are two classes of amendment. First, those relating to issues identified in the operation of the current Acts and second, those which are consequential to the amendments to the Acts made by the Bill and in particular those made by section 3A. Some of the amendments introduce new grounds and others broaden the scope of existing grounds. Section 16 amends section 13 of the 2006 Act to give the Minister the power to review a refusal to grant a permit. Section 17 amends section 14 of the 2006 Act, which provides the Minister with regulation-making powers to provide for each type of employment permit and to regulate for different requirements to apply depending on the type of employment permit and the different circumstances. Section 18 inserts a new section 14A into the Act of 2006 which ensures that when making regulations in respect of remuneration, the Minister can take into account the going rate in the marketplace for such employments and can refuse to grant a permit if the remuneration offered is less than the minimum annual remuneration specified in regulations in respect of the employment concerned, regardless of whether the hours of work for the employment concerned are equal to or less than 39 hours per week. If the weekly hours of work for the employment concerned exceed 39 hours, the minimum annual remuneration must be increased pro rata. This underpins the public policy prerogative that a foreign national should be earning a sufficient remuneration to prevent his or her recourse to the social welfare system. Section 19 amends section 15 of the Act of 2006 and identifies the criteria which the Minister may consider in regulating under section 14. The amendments strengthen the provisions of the existing Act by providing regulation-making power in respect of the experience of a foreign national as a criterion. Section 20 amends section 16 of the Act of 2006 by providing for additional grounds for the revocation of an employment permit. Section 21 amends section 17 of the Act of 2006 by providing for the intra-company transfer situation. Section 22 amends section 19 of the Act of 2006 by deleting the distinction in that Act in respect of applications by foreign nationals. Various other sections of the Bill make similar deletions, including sections 25 and 26. This has the effect of ensuring that all applications are treated on an equal basis and are subject to the same rules when being considered for an employment permit. Section 23 amends section 20 of the Act of 2006, which deals with the renewal of employment permits and sets out the circumstances in respect of which a permit may or may not be renewed. Importantly, the amended section 20 exempts renewal applications of existing, pre-enactment, permits from the 50-50 rule on the basis that, at the time the initial application was made, neither the employer nor the foreign national could have foreseen this new requirement. In addition, the amendment provides for renewal of applications in the case of start-up companies and sole employees. Section 24 inserts four new sections, namely, sections 20A, 20B, 20C and 20D, into the Act of 2006. These sections give an additional six months to certain permit holders who are made redundant to find employment and apply for a new permit. They also exempt them from certain rules that would otherwise apply such as, for example, the labour market needs test and eligibility criteria with regard to the job. This provision is inspired by cases brought to the Government's attention over the years by organisations like the Migrant Rights Centre and Nasc in Cork. Sections 25 and 26 amend sections 23 and 24 of the Act of 2006, respectively, by removing references to applications by foreign nationals. It also clarifies the obligations in an intra-company transfer situation. Section 27 tidies and updates the provisions of section 27 of the Act of 2006 with regard to the requirements on an employer to retain records for inspection. It also clarifies these obligations in an intra-company transfer situation. Section 28 includes new terms used in the Bill, such as "relevant person", who is the person who has entered into a contract with a foreign service provider, and "connected person", who is the linked company in the State into which the foreign national is transferred under an intra-company transfer arrangement. Section 29 amends section 29 of the Act of 2006, which provides for regulations setting out the process and information requirements for the making of an application for an employment permit. Section 30 amends section 30 of the Act of 2006 and sets out further provisions concerning regulations. Section 31 amends section 31 of the Act of 2006 to allow for the issue of notices or documents by ordinary prepaid post instead of registered prepaid post. Section 32 amends section 37 of the Act of 2006 to provide for the sharing of information with the Garda Síochána. Section 33 amends Schedule 1 to the Act of 2006 to update references to various employment enactments that are relevant in the context of prosecutions under employment permits legislation. Part 4 provides for amendments to the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act 2000, which I am taking on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality. Section 34 substitutes section 5 of the Act of 2000. The amendments include the removal of the "on notice" provision in section 5 and for a number of other amendments and new subsections. These other amendments provide for the inclusion of certain safeguards that are considered necessary owing to the removal of the "on notice" provision. They also take account of other developments relating to judicial reviews in the asylum and immigration area. Part 5 provides for amendments to the Immigration Act 2004 and Aliens Order 1946, which I also am taking on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality. Section 35 amends the Immigration Act 2004. The amendments primarily concern the registration of non-nationals in the State to achieve the following aims. First, to provide for the transfer of the registration function from An Garda Síochána, which currently responsible is for it, to the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, INIS, in the Department of Justice and Equality. Second, to provide registration facilities to non-nationals, which may be from a single central location or through a number of regional locations around the State and third, to remove the exemption to register for persons under 16 years. Section 36 is a consequential drafting amendment to the Aliens Order 1946. Part 6 makes an amendment to the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, repeals a number of provisions of the 2006 Act and provides for transitional arrangements in respect of employment permits already in force. Section 37 amends the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. Section 37(a) inserts a new section 124A in the 1997 Act and seeks to impose an income tax charge on any payments made under a court order under new section 2B of the Act of 2003 and to have the PAYE system applied to the payments. Section 37(b) puts beyond doubt that the exemption provided for in section 192A of the 1997 Act does not apply to payments made under a court order under section 2B of the Act of 2003. Section 38 repeals a number of existing provisions primarily to remove the distinction between applications by foreign nationals and employers. It also repeals section 35(2) of the Act of 2006, which provides for evidence given in proceedings for an offence under the Act to be video-recorded, as video recording is no longer required. Section 39 provides for transitional arrangements and savings in respect of employment permits that are in force or applications on hand immediately before the coming into operation of the Bill. In conclusion, I thank Members for providing time to consider this Bill. I am sure we will have an extensive discussion on the issues here. The background to this legislation essentially is that in a modern global economy, it is necessary to have a modern system for identifying the critical skills that must be provided in the Irish economy and for allowing employers who need to find those skills to find them overseas if they are not available in the European market. Moreover, a system is needed that is quick and easy to operate. Through the officials of my Department, that system has been streamlined on an administrative basis quite considerably and I believe the turnaround time to deal with an application has halved. The Department continues to try to make it more user-friendly and in this Bill, the Government recognises that companies supported by Enterprise Ireland and the IDA are trusted partners in the context of work permits. Where companies are being supported by the aforementioned agencies, they will be recognised as having some form of a fast-track for dealing with permits. At the same time however, the Government recognises that Ireland still is a country with high unemployment.Many people are struggling to find skills. That is also true of the rest of the European Union. We have to make sure such people have the chance to avail of employment opportunities. This Bill strikes a balance between the needs of certain employers to recruit scarce skills and other sectors where there is an ample supply of skills at home. That is the background for the labour market needs tests, but in certain skilled occupations, such needs tests are lifted. It provides us with a flexible tool that allows us to respond to the challenges of a changing environment. Reference has been made to the war for talent, which drives many location decisions because the success of enterprises depends on the flow of change. We need to be in a position to ensure our enterprises can grow. One of the strengths of Ireland in recent years is the sheer variety of skills available here. We have a truly global environment in many areas, particularly in our cities, with a great mix of skills and backgrounds. That has created a good hub for starting and developing enterprises. We need to make sure we can retain that. This Bill modernises our legislation but it also responds to a report on employment by the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the rapporteur for which was the former Senator, Deirdre Clune, MEP. The report identified this as an area in which we needed modern legislation that is capable of responding to changing needs. As this has been identified as an area that we need to modernise, I am glad to have the opportunity to present this Bill.
#MaryMWhite	unknown-#MaryMWhite-party	unknown-#MaryMWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryMWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	160	Fianna Fáil broadly supports the provisions of the Employment Permits (Amendment) Bill 2014. The purpose of the Bill is to amend and extend the Employment Permits Acts 2003 and 2006 to provide greater flexibility to deal with the ever-changing skills needs of businesses and the overall economic development needs of the Irish economy, which often require a rapid response. The Bill also provides for an improved employment permits regime with greater clarity, and updates provisions for the employment permits schemes in line policy and economic developments since 2007. In 2012 Senator Quinn put forward a Private Member's Bill entitled the Employment Permits (Amendment) Bill 2012. The Government did not oppose that Bill and allowed it to progress to Committee Stage. However, the Minister expressed his intention to deal with the matter comprehensively in this Bill and to advance ahead of the Senator's Bill, thereby fulfilling the primary objective of the latter. Inspired by Senator Quinn's Bill, the Employment Permits (Amendment) Bill 2014 affords foreign nationals a defence and relieves them of an offence where they have taken all reasonable steps to comply with the legislation. We are all acutely aware of the importance of the information and communications technology sector to the Irish economy. If that sector is to thrive it is important it has the best possible range of skilled people available to recruit. It is important that the growth of the sector is not impeded by a lack of suitably skilled staff. In this regard the reduced processing time for permit applications is to be welcomed. Despite our continuing high rate of unemployment, Ireland is experiencing skills shortages in certain key areas. The employment permits regime is designed to encourage migration of non-EEA nationals with skills that are currently in short supply so that enterprise growth and the knock-on economic benefits of such growth are not curtailed by vacancies of key personnel in the short to medium term. These skills and labour shortages are in occupations in key economic sectors, such as health care, information technology and financial services. For this reason I welcome the Bill's focus on attracting highly skilled positions to the Irish economy, which will in turn generate growth in employment opportunities and expand the pool of talent and skills available in Ireland. The continued expansion of PayPal in Dundalk is a great example of this. It employs a large number of Irish people as well as people coming from abroad. Ireland needs cross-fertilisation of ideas among different nationalities if we are to induce creativity and innovation. The Minister stated that his ambition is to fill three out of four vacancies in the ICT sector by graduates from Irish colleges by 2018. The design and delivery of information and communications technology courses at universities will be crucial to achieving this target. The history of third level courses in this country suggests that they have been slow to adapt to market needs and we must ensure they are not slow in this case. Every support should be given to people who are willing to go back to the education system and make themselves available to work in the ICT sector. When my husband worked in the IDA early in his career, he went to UCD to persuade it to gear up its computer courses because they were not sufficient to attract multinational computer companies. I welcome that there is a new category of employment permit for spouses, civil partners and dependants to enable family members of holders of critical skills employment permits and researchers to work in the State. This issue arose in the context of the civil partnership legislation because it was regarded as important that an individual be able to take a partner with him or her when coming to work in Ireland. This is a crucial factor in encouraging people in civil partnerships to move to Ireland. When people are making the decision to relocate to take up an employment opportunity, they will need to consider many other factors, including whether their families can travel with them. This is an overdue reform and it should underpin the other provisions of the legislation. In discussing the issue of making it attractive for people to come to Ireland to take up employment opportunities, there are other issues to consider besides the provision of employment visas. In particular, the cost of living increasingly influences people's decisions on where to locate. In the Grand Canal Dock area of Dublin, there is a large population of people working in the ICT sector for firms like Google, Facebook and eBay. There have been reports that many newly arrived persons looking to take up employment locally have encountered considerable difficulties in obtaining suitable accommodation at a reasonable price. While this issue is outside the scope of the Bill, it is none the less an important factor in ensuring we can fulfil the demand for ICT employees. Just as we need to get employment legislation, including permits, correct, we also need to ensure those who take up those jobs enjoy a good quality of life and standards of living. I commend Mr. Barry O'Leary on his remarkable tenure as chief executive of the IDA and welcome the visionary appointment of Mr. Frank Ryan as its chairman. Over the years, Governments of all parties have supported the IDA in presenting the image of Ireland abroad as a safe and reliable country with which to do business. Now the remarkable debacle of Garth Brooks is tarnishing that image. We need an inquiry or investigation into the matter. This controversy has undermined all the good work done by the IDA over the years. We came through the bubble and the crisis but Mr. O'Leary was able to maintain investors' faith in and optimism for Ireland. It is important to put that on the record. We will only emerge from the current crisis by developing our economy and looking for new ideas for job creation. In addressing this issue of employment permits we must also address the needs of those who come to this country to assist us in developing our economy. We should welcome them with open arms. In this regard, I pay tribute the remarkable approach by the former Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, to giving people Irish citizenship. He awarded citizenship to 4,000 people recently. They want to be Irish citizens and to participate in the economy. In the late 1990s, when the economy began to take off, we could not get people for Lir Chocolates and we had to be imaginative in getting people from abroad when it was not the thing to do. All the people who came to Lir Chocolates were outstanding staff and we are in debt to them. It gives me great pleasure.Some 129 languages are spoken among the people who got citizenship the other day. It was important in our economic history that we joined the EU, thanks be to God, and we leapfrogged over Britain. I also think it is important to attract people from abroad with different skills and creativity from our own. Look at the problems that President Obama has because he cannot get Congress to agree. They need new skills there but the Congress will not support that.  I thank the Minister for bringing this Bill before the House.
#MartinConway	unknown-#MartinConway-party	unknown-#MartinConway-dob	unknown-#MartinConway-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	161	I welcome the Minister to the House and wish him well in the forthcoming changes that we are all eagerly awaiting. I will not repeat what the Minister has said about various sections of the Bill, which are essential housekeeping. We have seen the shortcomings and, as the Minister pointed out, there has been some case law in this regard. This legislation effectively tidies up the case law in reaction to loopholes that have been identified within that case law. Over the years, we were all shocked and horrified to hear of illegal immigrants being exploited in work, be it collecting mushrooms or working in kitchens, the hospitality sector, warehouses or in back-rooms of certain minority businesses. It is wrong that they are here illegally, but their exploitation is even worse. They were paid a pittance, yet were expected to work double or triple the normal hours thus breaking the EU working time directive. When these stories hit the media, people were horrified. In addition, due to loopholes in relevant case law, the exploiters got away with it. Two wrongs do not make a right, however, so we need to right those wrongs. Exploitation horrifies the vast majority of people. It is our duty and obligation to prevent exploitation however we can and wherever it occurs. The Bill is critical legislation. I assume that it is not being opposed by any part of the House. We do not have a skills base in certain areas, including the ICT sector. When we need to acquire a skills base abroad so that our economy's architecture operates effectively, we must ensure it is both efficient and user-friendly, unlike so much in our society. The Minister must be complimented on reorganising the permit structure which was described by those using it as being difficult, cumbersome, intimidating and not user-friendly. He has made significant progress in that regard. The Minister is also tying certain elements from other Departments into this legislation, particularly the justice area, which must also be welcomed. I would like to have seen another provision in the Bill, although it is perhaps a matter for another day. It concerns students coming here to learn English who are allowed to get part-time jobs. We have seen the debacle with certain English-language schools closing and foreign students being left high and dry. That situation might need to be tightened up in future legislation. We have also discussed ad nauseam the issue of people in direct provision centres around the country. If people in direct provision have a skill to offer, they should be able to work and make a contribution to society, as well as paying their taxes. All too often, we hear about the undocumented illegal Irish in America and we all do our bit to campaign for them. To some extent, however, we should practice what we preach. There is a case for facilitating people in direct provision centres who have skills to offer. They should be able to exercise those skills, hopefully, in the not too distant future. I was very taken by a lady I met recently from a direct provision centre in Galway who had an unusual baking skill. Having listened to her story, I have no doubt that if she had the opportunity sell her produce she could make a good living for herself and her dependants. We need to look outside the box in this regard. The legislation before us should get a swift passage through the House so that the Minister will be in a position to enact it soon.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	162	I welcome the Minister. He is getting fond of this House and seems to be coming in quite a lot in recent days. The Bill covers a range of issues related to employment permits. I welcome the fact that it addresses the loophole related to the dreadful treatment of Mr. Mohammed Younis who was exploited for years. This is what I tried to achieve through a Bill I introduced about 18 months ago, entitled the Employment Permits (Amendment) Bill, to which Senator White referred. I felt that it fell to us as legislators to remedy the anomaly that affected certain non-national workers. That particular case was very sad. The person in question had been here for a number of years and had been treated almost like a slave. Given that his employer, to whom he was related, had kept his first-year work permit, it turned out that he was an illegal worker and was thus unable to address the issue with his employer. I had my Bill examined by a number of experts who advised that it was watertight. That is why I was disappointed that the Bill was rejected by the Government on those grounds. While I will not directly accuse the Minister of plagiarism, he copied some of the wording from my Bill precisely. My wording in section 4A is almost the same as in the Bill before us. I am sure the Minister meant it as a form of flattery but I would have appreciated being credited. However, Senator White has gladly made up for that today. It is a pity that legislation to protect workers such as Mr. Younis has taken so long. In the two years since my Bill was ready, many other cases of exploitation have probably occurred. I do not know for certain but it is quite likely that they have. Under the terms of the Bill, it is welcome that there is an ability to seek some redress against employers who exploit employees. It will also allow undocumented workers to apply for a new work permit in cases where they have become undocumented through no fault of their own. I hope Mr. Younis will be able to get redress and that this Bill will set the conditions so that such cases will likely be reduced. If similar cases do occur, however, the employee will be put in a much stronger position. The Minister will say that part of his objective is to achieve that and I hope he will achieve it in this case.  The Minister referred to the ICT sector which we have debated here on a few occasions, as well as at the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. As many as 5,000 job vacancies could be filled if we only had the requisite ICT skills. I am not sure that changing visa requirements alone will attract the necessary number of people to fill those vacancies. We need a big change in our education system in this area. Neither the Department of Education and Skills nor the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation systematically collects, analyses and distributes information on jobs that students get after graduating. I have been involved with the Springboard scheme for a few years. It is interesting to go back and see how many people availed of that scheme. Springboard is the HEA body that identifies people with third level skills that may not be suitable for the moment, so they are steered on to other jobs. These critical data will help us to get people to study in areas like ICT. The collection of such data is absolutely crucial for policy-makers. Some European countries, including the Netherlands and Italy, collect vital figures on jobs that graduates get. We should seek to emulate those models. These data are vital for future planning, especially in terms of youth employment and further education, but we are not currently collecting such data. Could the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation collect and publish data on what jobs graduates get?I would like the Minister to comment on this. This is crucial when it comes to planning for further education and training so that students are directed to critical areas, such as ICT. This would be a concrete way to help to get people to study ICT and thus fill the massive shortages in this area. It would complement the recruitment of foreign nationals. To further this idea, would the Minister consider the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation rating universities and higher education institutions on the success rate for graduates getting jobs? It would possibly encourage people to choose different universities, improve standards and encourage universities to offer courses following which there are job openings. I am glad the Minister is setting the conditions for interns and others to get hands-on experience in companies but in terms of filling the gaps in ICT, we should look at ideas in other countries. In 2010, South Korea created a network of vocational meister schools. The word "meister" is the German word for master craftsman. It did that to address the country's shortage of machine operators and plumbers. It is interesting that the South Korean Government pays students' room and board as well as their tuition. We have a massive shortage of ICT professionals here. Could we consider something similar to address that skills gap? We know there is a skills gap but what are we doing to address it? We need to give some very specialised assistance to ICT. Giving incentives to foreign students in this area could improve the educational standards as well as getting them to stay on in Ireland and filling some of the vacancies. There is a need for language skills for ICT jobs. When it comes to filling gaps in the ICT sector, one of the things that is missing is getting Irish people to speak foreign languages. Getting the ICT skills is fine but that is often not enough as the large ICT companies want ICT skills plus foreign language skills. We need to be innovative in this area. I hope I will be able to speak directly to the new Minister for Education and Skills and the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation about this issue.  I have always been very keen on this question of getting children to learn a foreign language. I think I told the Minister previously that my wife and I sent all our children to school in France for the summer term when they were approximately 13 years of age. There was only one problem in that the two girls fell in love with French men at the age of 13 and are now married to French men. We have a load of French speaking grandchildren, which is wonderful. I have spoken here before, although maybe not to this Minister, about the Michel Thomas method of teaching a language because it breaks it down into component parts and enables learners to reconstruct the language. This is a British system, which is not unlike our Gaeltacht system. I never really developed my Gaeilge skills except when I went to the Gaeltacht and was immersed in and spoke the language. The Michel Thomas system, which is used in Britain a lot, is a wonderful one for people who have never learned to speak a foreign language. An article in The Guardian stated that he astounded staff at a school in north London by teaching a group of teenagers deemed incapable of learning languages. In one week, they learned the amount of French it normally takes five years to acquire. The Minister and I have attended French classes. We have not become fluent enough to be able to handle everything, although maybe the Minister has. I would like to think we were capable of doing that. The No. 1 way to learn languages outside of school in the UK is now the Michel Thomas method. Has the Minister come across this method? Would there be a possibility to trial the method in some of our schools or even in the workplace? It is a method that must be given serious consideration. I remember when Hewlett Packard or another company announced that it had 50 jobs on offer and it was asked what skills were required. It mentioned the skills but it also said the ability to speak a modern foreign language. One of the reporters said that no Irish need apply because we are just not very good at them. We really must do something about that. I know it is not this Minister's baby but it should be part of his remit and whoever takes over as Minister for Education and Skills. I would like to see big tax breaks for companies to buy language lessons for their employees and give them one to two hours off per week to do the classes. Would the Minister be open to a tax break in this area? That would be a massive statement to the outside world that Ireland is serious about its workforce upskilling and it would mean a large number of Irish people could fill ICT vacancies. Will the Minister comment on the idea of utilising a language teaching method, such as the Michel Thomas method? I have never met Michel Thomas but it seems the system is amazing. Along with getting skilled foreign workers and easing the employment permits process, we must look at upskilling existing workers and getting the concrete data on what jobs graduates get. That is crucial to directing people to areas where there are massive shortages, such as in the ICT sector. The Minister has identified these shortages and is working on them. We must really concentrate on them over the next couple of years because I think we can work wonders. I congratulate the Minister on the Bill, which is worthy of support.
#JohnKelly	unknown-#JohnKelly-party	unknown-#JohnKelly-dob	unknown-#JohnKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	163	I welcome the Minister and the legislation. I compliment the Minister on the way he addressed this issue in a very clear and concise way. This legislation is about reform of the way we deal with employment permits and makes it more focused on our ever increasing needs and demands. I will not go into the same level of detail as the Minister but we had four work permits, which will be replaced by nine. The green card has gone and will be replaced by a critical skills employment permit. I welcome the reactivation employment permit for those whose permits expire or whose work come to an end. I compliment Senator Quinn for initiating this back in November 2012. It was quite clear Mohammed Younis was the victim of a miscarriage of justice. He was exploited by an employer for seven years and when he brought it to the attention of the authorities, the rights commissioner found in his favour but that was overruled by the High Court and as a result, this young man was not in a position to get compensation. If this issue arises following the enactment of this legislation, compensation will be available.  I agree with Senator White about the Garth Brooks debacle but I do not think he was refused a visa to come to this country. However, I know of a man who is having great difficulty getting a visa to come to this country. He is not looking for a work permit. He is an Iraqi-born businessman who has lived in Saudi Arabia all his life. He is an extremely wealthy man and he has highlighted the need for at least 40,000 houses in Saudi Arabia. A company in Galway manufactures these houses, which are affordable, and it has a showroom in Monaghan. This man needs to visit Ireland for four days to visit the showroom. He applied for a visa but was refused. The reason he was refused is that in 2008, GMIT invited him to speak in the college. When he applied for a visa, the courier in Saudi Arabia delivered his application to the British Embassy by mistake. He was refused a visa by the British Embassy so when he applied for a visa to visit Ireland, he was refused because he had been previously refused a visa by another embassy in 2008.  This is not directly the responsibility of this Minister but there is supposed to be inter-departmental co-operation between the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. I suggest the Minister should have a greater role in cases like this because there seems to be a view that when somebody from a Middle Eastern country is looking for a visa that they have ulterior motives for being for doing so.I assure the House the individual in question does not have an ulterior motive. He wants to invest millions of euro in an Irish company and create jobs but is being blocked from doing so by the Department of Justice and Equality. It takes between 12 and 14 weeks for that Department to make a decision on a visa application. An applicant may then be refused on the basis that there is history. Further, a return ticket is not considered sufficient evidence that an individual plans to return home. What type of evidence does the Department expect people to produce? Jobs are a major issue. I hope the Minister will take a hands on approach to the Department of Justice and Equality and ensure the circumstances I describe are not repeated. 
#JillianVanTurnhout	unknown-#JillianVanTurnhout-party	unknown-#JillianVanTurnhout-dob	unknown-#JillianVanTurnhout-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	164	I welcome the Minister to the House and applaud and congratulate him on the ratification by Ireland today of the International Labour Organization's convention on domestic workers. This is a landmark day for workers' rights, migrants rights and human rights. All too often, we speak about the position of the Irish abroad without making the connection to migrants who come here. This is a proud day and I acknowledge the work of the Migrant Rights Centre of Ireland and Domestic Workers Action Group. I also acknowledge the Minister's work in making this day happen and thank him that we have at last ratified this convention. The Bill addresses some important issues. All too often, the environment is an enabling factor in the abuse of workers and migrant rights, which many of us have seen at first hand. Senators will be aware of the case of Muhammad Younis, the details of which have been outlined in the House by me, Senator Quinn and other Senators. The Bill takes a pragmatic approach to address and modernise our employment laws and, I hope, force out cases of forced labour, which amounts to modern day slavery.  Reading through the Bill brought me back to my experience in the private sector. People think of me as having been involved solely in children's rights, whereas I was a private sector employer for more than 15 years before working in the Children's Rights Alliance. At that time, we found it made more financial sense for us to pay for a highly skilled staff member to fly home to South Africa and renew her work permit at the Irish embassy there than have her go through the procedure here, despite both facilities being State run. The decision to bring employment permits into line and provide for a system of transferring them is a very good one. I also welcome the amendments being introduced to address the case of Mr. Younis and measures relating to migrants. It is welcome to see a Minister link up with other Ministers and portfolios. In that respect, the work being done jointly by the Minister and Minister for Justice and Equality to address deficiencies in the immigration system is very welcome.  I propose to raise the issue of au pairs, which cannot be addressed in the Bill because it falls between many different portfolios. The idea behind having au pairs is to provide for a cultural exchange and I have no difficulties with the system when that is the case. The problem, however, as highlighted by organisations such as the Migrant Rights Centre, is that women are frequently trafficked into the country as au pairs to do domestic chores for in excess of 50 hours per week. This does not reflect the idea behind au pairing, nor does it amount to a cultural exchange. Many au pairs, primarily women, are not vetted and are working with children. Everybody loses out when there is no system of regulation in place. The individuals in question are often not paid or paid a pittance. I have met women who have been locked into houses and abused. I find it very upsetting that these practices are taking place in my country. When one raises this issue, one is told that au pairs do not fit in anywhere because the issue is not an employment matter and does not fall within the area of tourism. We must identify where it fits because the issue of au pairs will have to be addressed, especially as the economy picks up.  The Bill has my full support and I congratulate the Minister on bringing many different elements together in legislation that will regularise employment and ensure people are treated as equal in the workplace. This is something for which all of us stand. I thank the Minister for his work. 
#KathrynReilly	unknown-#KathrynReilly-party	unknown-#KathrynReilly-dob	unknown-#KathrynReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	165	I welcome the Minister to the House. Sinn Féin wholeheartedly supports this important Bill. I, too, commend the work done by Senator Quinn on this issue and in highlighting the case at the centre of the legislation. As Senators will be aware, in 2012, Mr. Justice Hogan found that existing employment permits legislation left undocumented migrant employees of rogue employers in a precarious position. It is important, therefore, that we recognise again the role of Mr. Muhammad Younis, whose case is at the heart of the legislation. The Younis case and similar cases should not have come as a revelation because the Migrant Rights Centre had been highlighting the relevant loophole in the legislation since 2006. That said, the measures being taken by the Minister are welcome. The American Chamber of Commerce Ireland has also welcomed the provisions of the Bill. Broadening the eligibility for highly skilled occupations will boost companies with a heavy reliance on niche skill sets, including fluency in less common languages. Accelerating recruitment processes by reducing bureaucracy and enabling senior executives to be based in Ireland for the initial stages of a start-up will aid foreign direct investment. Introducing such flexibility in the system makes sense.  The Bill will be welcomed by advocacy groups, particularly as it relates to employment permits and, in exceptional circumstances, to carers and medical professionals caring for people with severe medical conditions or where a person has developed a high level of dependence on a migrant worker.  As discussed, we would like a provision to be introduced to provide for the waiving of fees in cases of hardship involving applicants who are seeking to renew permits but cannot afford the fee. The Migrant Rights Centre has highlighted the cost of obtaining a work permit, as has the European Committee of Social Rights which considers the fees charged to be excessive.  While I do not wish to go over some of the ground covered by previous speakers, I will briefly add to Senator van Turnhout's comments on the working environment for au pairs and their rights in this country. Traditionally, au pairs were young people who took part in a cultural or language exchange programme for a limited period. Increasingly, however, they are being recruited as carers of children, the elderly and people with disabilities or for domestic work. While protected under existing employment legislation, most au pairs are not aware of the rights afforded to them and most employers are not aware of their responsibilities to them. Au pairs are a sizeable group of highly vulnerable workers that is being increasingly exploited. These workers are paid below the minimum wage and do not receive basic entitlements. In recent years, demand for au pairs has increased as working families find it difficult to pay for child care. While the code of practice for protecting persons employed in other people's homes was introduced and placed on a statutory footing on 2007, I am not certain it is being enforced. Moreover, it does not provide in full for the experience of au pairs.  Anomalies arise in the labour market and these irregularities must not be allowed to go unchallenged and unchecked. Sinn Féin supports the call by the Migrant Rights Centre for an immediate and co-ordinated response to ensure the employment rights of workers are upheld and enforced, with a particular emphasis on recruitment agencies and direct employees. In saying this, I welcome the legislation and congratulate the Minister and Senator Quinn on their work in producing it.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22396	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	166	I thank Senators for their contributions. Senator Mary White correctly noted that the cross-fertilisation of ideas and creation of an environment of mixed skills are an important part of delivering the type of vibrant environment in which new companies grow. This is very much in evidence and is the way in which the economy needs to be developed. Countries cannot hope to fill all the skills requirements in the economy. An obvious case in point is languages. Even more important, however, is the issue of outlook.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22396	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	168	I will not get into that tricky territory.I also thank her for her kind words regarding Mr. Barry O'Leary's role in the past number of years. There is no doubt his focus and drive within IDA Ireland has been a very important asset and the half-year results for IDA Ireland published on Monday speak for themselves. Under his guidance, this will be the fourth-best year for the agency and the best in a decade. I also express my appreciation for the Senator's support for the appointment of Mr. Frank Ryan, who is a fantastic public servant with great experience. He comes from many years of stewarding Enterprise Ireland and he brings an important insight to the interplay between IDA Ireland companies and Enterprise Ireland firms. We must break down those barriers and see the two as mutually reinforcing so as to develop supply complementary supply chains. He has an important role. As the Senator noted, this legislation is welcome. To be fair to the higher education sector, when we took office we set the target of doubling the number of ICT graduates and that goal is already in sight. We have set a higher target for 2018. The sector is responding, although the response may need to go broader and deeper not just in the ICT sectors, but in other areas which may not be as well organised. One of the strengths of the ICT sector is that it can guarantee placement positions because of density and organisation. Springboard courses have been exceptionally successful in ICT and we need to see that sort of approach expanded to other sectors, where we can develop better links between employers and the institutes of higher education in order to get relevant skills. Many Senators would have come across some discontent with the level of skills coming out, and this is one way to ensure an improvement. Senator Conway correctly raised the issue of exploitation, which many other Senators would also highlight. I apologise for not giving due credit to Senator Quinn in my opening remarks, as there is no doubt that his work was very important. We had to be careful of the law of unintended consequences, as there was a fear that the way in which the Senator formulated his legislation, particularly with regard to making illegal contracts legal, so to speak, would have had some unintended consequences. Although it mirrors some of the Senator's formulation, this Bill is different in its composition for good reasons. Senator Conway also raised a concern about students of language schools. I know this is a concern but the matter falls to the Department of Justice and Equality rather than my own area, as such students would not have work permits but a student visa which allows them work for 20 hours. We do not issue work permits to them so it would not come under this legislation. The Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, INIS, has intervened where there has been a concern about certain colleges, and it has also dealt with students affected by closures in a humanitarian way. We need to strengthen our reputation in this respect, as an area of opportunity is in a robust, quality education offering, and we must protect that by ensuring any provision is substantive and to a high quality. As well as dealing with the important case which was the subject of his own legislation, Senator Quinn recognised that we are introducing a retrospective element allowing persons in the period from which he initiated his Bill to the passing of this Bill to have the opportunity to take claims. This is not retrospective law because the Bill is essentially making the provision that work done which should have been remunerated to at least the minimum wage ought to have such remuneration paid. As I understand it, this retroactive operation does not contravene any principles of fair play. Senator Quinn had interesting comments about promoting new ways of encouraging outsiders to take up courses here and having new methods of teaching. This is relevant and I certainly look forward to the development of trainee programmes and apprenticeships by the SOLAS board. It is top of the agenda and there is now an approved new model of apprenticeships designed to go well beyond the traditional, which were largely construction-related skills, into new areas. Trainee programmes will be offered as a more flexible on and off-job model, and that will be an essential issue. We allowed the grass to grow under our feet in some respects during the boom time, and some of the FÁS work was not sufficiently focused on these emerging skills. We must reassert those elements, and the new SOLAS board has an appetite to do so. I agree with the Senator that we must rate the outcome of different courses. I will ask the future skills group, which spans both my Department and the Department of Education and Skills, if we can get that data. I have seen some data of that nature, mixed in quality, and it is interesting. Science graduates do not do particularly well, which is surprising, and it seems one must be in technology, engineering and mathematics because those graduates are in scarce supply. The Senator is correct in saying that students should see more of a course outcome in order to make choices on a more informed basis. We can see what data can be obtained, and I am sure the Higher Education Authority can play a significant role in this respect. Interestingly, there is a tax break for language, although it is from old God's time. I remember it was introduced in the 1980s and I have just checked it. The limit for the tax relief to be claimed is €1,270 and perhaps it has fallen into disuse. It was for ICT and foreign languages in the 1980s. The advantage of an existing scheme is that it is easier to expand it rather than getting the Department of Finance to introduce a new scheme. Maybe there is an opportunity to prise the door open if we can show the tax relief is generating some interesting activity. We will have to see if there is a demand from employers and workers. There is no doubt in my mind that there is a big gap in Ireland in international selling skills, which takes in selling and languages. We need to get the finger out in developing international selling skills. Everybody likes to do marketing but nobody seems to want to do the selling. Selling is what butters the parsnips. Senator Kelly mentioned an individual and I will get his name later. There are some officials from the Department of Justice and Equality with us because we are handling some justice issues with the Bill, so they can follow up the issue. I thank Senators for their compliments for the domestic workers convention. It is a significant landmark and it was great to see the enthusiasm of those directly affected and who campaigned for this when we formally publicised the signing of the convention. Senators also raised the issue of au pairs, which is of some concern. There is no doubt that cultural exchange used to welcomed and it has never required a work permit. Nevertheless, incidents of exploitation can arise, and the National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, works close with the Migrant Rights Centre of Ireland, which indicates cases for inspection. NERA has pursued and prosecuted some cases, so it is very much aware that a boundary can be crossed.It is not acceptable to transgress on people's rights in the name of cultural exchange. We will pick up whatever issues remain on Committee Stage. I thank Senators for their support for this Bill, which has been uniform. I look forward to the passage of this Bill. It will provide us with modern legislation that is flexible and recognises the needs of people who are looking for work. It factors in our ambition to fill as many posts as we can through our education system and by the development of that education system. It also recognises in a fast-changing global environment that employers must be able to get the necessary skills and if those skills are to be found outside the European Union, we should facilitate that.  I thank the officials who have worked to get this Bill through and to modernise legislation which, as Senator Conway said, grew like Topsy with ad hoc pieces added on here and there. It needed to be properly organised and that is now being done. The officials are also delivering a quality service which is continually improving against a background of diminishing resources.

To amend section 58C of the Act of 1970 by inserting the following new subsection:“(13) Notwithstanding any other part of this section, the agreement, referred to in subsection (1) shall not:(a) include any provision to restrict the criticism of the Health Service Executive, or the Department of Health;(b) impose an obligation upon any general practitioner to limit criticism of the Health Service Executive, or the Department of Health;(c) require any general practitioner to notify the Health Service Executive, or the Department of Health in advance of making a public statement;(d) require any general practitioner to receive prior approval from the Health Service Executive, or the Department of Health, for any public statement they wish to make;(e) require any general practitioner to dilute their natural rights to freedom of expression implicit in article 40.3.1, of Bunreacht na hÉireann and explicit in article 10.1 in the European Convention on Human Rights.".Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit. It is good to have an opportunity today to discuss a part of our health system that does not get the attention, credit, support or resourcing it deserves. I believe it faces a number of threats, some of which are being added to by the potential actions of the Government in this regard. General practice in Ireland, which is sometimes called primary health care or family practice, is the least dysfunctional part of our therapeutic health system.The three great sins of our very dysfunctional hospital system are that it is inefficient, of mediocre quality and tremendously unequal. General practice addresses most of these through varying degrees of success and is certainly more successful than the hospital system. In the first instance, unlike our hospital system where much of the care is delivered by trainees, patients who see a general practitioner, GP, will see a fully trained specialist in the speciality of general practice. They will see an appropriately experienced competent, well-trained doctor who will give them the care which they deserve. That is one-nil to general practice versus the hospital service. A group of quasi-independently operating GPs provide a very low overhead and low administrative-burdened service. Much of the money spent on the service is actually spent on providing care rather than administering care, unlike our hospital system. Third, and spectacularly, is the equality issue. Patients who go to a general practice will pay either out of their own pocket or have the service paid for by the Exchequer through the medical card scheme. The point is that they will all have been seen by the same doctor, in the same surgery and waited the same time. Essentially, they will all have had the same access to care. This is a system that works relatively well. We mess with it at our peril. Instead, we should be fostering and encouraging our GPs. I hope the Minister, Deputy Reilly, is given the opportunity in the years to come to continue with the reforms he has instituted in the health service. We have a need to foster a culture in which we remove much of the inappropriate care which takes place in hospitals and put it into the primary care setting. This will not happen accidentally but only when the appropriate development and investment in the primary care service is made. It will only happen by encouraging medical practitioners to go into primary care, to stay in it and not go part-time or leave the country. I have had extensive consultations, like the Minister, with many representatives of the general practice organisations who are feeling very concerned about the future of their specialty. They are concerned that some of the administrative reforms which will be introduced will make it a much less attractive speciality. They see a new way of defining a group of their patients with the free care for children under six which will impose a whole series of administrative burdens on them. There will be a statutory obligation on them to perform extra evaluations which they have not had to perform before. Neither are these well validated or based on a good scientific, evidence-based medicine approach. There is also a subtle cultural inference that GPs are becoming more direct employees of the public service, losing some degree of their critical independence and their power to make their own decisions. There is an ability often used appropriately to very good effect by all front-line public service health professionals to identify problems in services and advocate on behalf of their patients. Another area of concern to GPs is that this might be in danger of being subsumed into a corporatist mentality. Like a form of neo-Stalinism, it suggests that if one does not actually agree with what the corporation or the system is doing, then one is being disloyal to the system. The primary loyalty of any health care provider should be to their patient, not to the system. We all understand we work, operate and practice not in a vacuum but in a context in which there are communal as well as individual obligations. However, if we begin to impose any kind of a gagging order on GPs in determining whether they can or cannot be signed into the scheme and, accordingly, be a participant, then we are giving the State an inappropriate and awesome level of power. Amendment No. 1 prohibits this from happening. I understand this was included in the previous agreement and there was ample reassurance that there would be no question of a gagging order. Accordingly, I cannot see any reason there would any objection to this amendment. This new contract will extend the current General Medical Services scheme to a new group of patients, namely, those under the age of six, regardless of health or natural circumstances. I am supportive of this overall. However, it imposes an extra burden of clinical responsibilities in routine evaluations and other interventions on GPs which do not occur elsewhere in the existing GMS agreement. As such, I am not sure as to why there should be this two-tier approach. Why should one group of patients be treated differently from others? GPs will find this obligation onerous. Until there are adequate levels of resources in general practice, more GPs, better doctor-patient ratios and appropriate levels of administrative support to enable GPs to have their time freed up exclusively for clinical care, then they do not want to waste their time. They have a sense this agreement or contract will force them to spend a big chunk of their time doing routine assessments on people who are healthy at the expense of other people who are ill while, in the process, potentially increasing waiting lists, etc. In addition, we are a little troubled that this agreement is term-time limited as opposed to the permanency of a GMS contract. GPs are thinking this is the thin end of the wedge to introduce this kind of contract to the broader GMS scheme and, as such, they are very concerned about it. Setting minimum requirements for practice premises is unnecessarily intrusive. Either a GP has an adequate practice premises or they do not. It struck many of the potential participants in this contract as being yet another stick with which they could be beaten. My GP colleagues are troubled by an apparent opening of a little chink in the armour of doctor-patient confidentiality. Those who sign up to this contract are becoming more deeply embedded within the system. It is not clear, however, that there is an absolute respect for doctor-patient confidentiality as a result. As I always say to patients, they must know the only person I am giving advice to or caring about is them. As a policy advocate, I may have positions that would involve resource allocation issues which could limit access of certain people to some care because others cannot get more important care. A patient sitting across from a doctor’s desk needs to know the only person the doctor is thinking about is them and the only person who will have access to their records is the doctor or another professional with whom the doctor believes it is in their interest to share it. There is a sloppiness in the wording of the agreement which leads us to believe there could be a vulnerability on the question of confidentiality, with which we are not happy. My GP colleagues also feel that it needs to be clear that if one has qualified or does not have a disciplinary action against one or any other impediment, then there should not be any other administrative impediment for one to sign up to this contract. Historically, general practice has not been a big offender in this regard. However, in this country extraneous factors often go into someone’s ability to apply for a publicly funded contract. It needs to be spelled out that no spurious impediment could be advanced in the way of a GP with a clean record and who is appropriately qualified and experienced. Am I now at the end of this section of the amendments? Are we breaking and then addressing the last two amendments?

#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	184	I welcome the Minister of State to the House and thank him for the work that he has done. I note there will be some changes but, in fairness, all of the Ministers at the Department of Health, Deputies Reilly, White and Kathleen Lynch, have been extremely innovative and hardworking in dealing with the Department over the past few years. There is a lot of work done, but a lot of work still to be done on the required reform. On the amendments put forward by Senator Crown, it is important that we would have a debate on the important issues he has raised. I attended a GP meeting in Cork. There were over 350 GPs at it and they raised all of the issues that Senator Crown raised. It was of concern to them that a draft contract was put up online and there was an impression given that it was written in stone. I am glad that such a message has changed, that there is ongoing consultation and discussion with the IMO. In fact, I spoke with the IMO as recently as this afternoon and it confirmed that those discussions are ongoing, which is welcome. On Senator Crown's amendment on not having any restrictive clause on contracts, I support what he is saying but do not think it is necessary to have it in legislation. If one tried to put that into a contract, any court would hold that where there is a valid public concern in relation to health care, general practitioners and medical practitioners generally are entitled to bring that to the attention of the general public and one cannot restrict people in any way from making public comment. I know of staff who work with the HSE and while they may have got warnings from HSE administrators that one cannot make public comment on issues, where there is an issue where it is important that the general public is aware of genuine health concerns then they are entitled to bring it to the attention of the general public. It is also important that medical practitioners are entitled to debate and make available information to the public as regards why a particular service is having difficulties and why they are having difficulties in delivering a service, either through lack of resources or through lack of the necessary support staff. It is important that there is no restriction. While I would agree with what Senator Crown is saying, it is not necessary to put it into legislation. Senator Crown referred to general practitioners. General practitioners have provided a superb service in this country over a long number of years. We need to acknowledge they make a considerable commitment and are dedicated, and provide a high level of care to their patients. Every GP I have ever dealt with has gone away beyond the call of duty in the level of care he or she provides to his or her patients. It is important, therefore, that in the introduction of any new scheme to expand the number of medical cards or GP-only cards there is full consultation with that group of medical personnel. I am delighted to see that the IMO, as a representative body of doctors, is engaged with the Department at this stage. The concerns general practitioners raise are listened to by the Department and the HSE. One of the issues I want to touch on which is not covered by these amendments is an issue on which I published a Bill, namely, the requirement of all medical practitioners in this country to have insurance. I am not clear whether or not we are writing that into the contract that is now being provided. While one cannot drive a car on the road without having insurance and I cannot practice as a legal practitioner without having insurance, there is still no legal requirement on medical practitioners to have insurance. I suppose it is not really a big issue in the case of general practitioners as such. Where it is a real issue is in relation to those who are providing cosmetic surgery, particularly where staff are coming in from abroad to provide it. We still do not have such insurance legislation in place. The Bill I published seems to have been parked and we do not seem to have made any progress on that over the past two years. The Minister, Deputy Reilly, introduced his own Private Members' Bill in 2009 and here we are five years later and we still do not have that legislation in place. It is something that should be given priority. A requirement to have insurance is certainly something that should be put in place as a condition in contracts for GPs. I am not too sure whether or not it is included in the existing contracts but it certainly should be introduced. The other issue I wanted to raise with the Minister of State relates to services being offered by GPs. I understand there is a difficulty where some practices began to offer scanning services. I discussed with the MPS and other insurers who provide insurance for GPs whether this service is covered by normal general practice insurance. It is also something that needs to be looked as there is a growing number of practices offering scanning service. It is a welcome development, but it is also important that there is adequate insurance cover for them and that they fully understand that their insurance policies provide such insurance. I welcome the decision by the Government to provide free GP care for those under six years of age. While there has been much criticism of it, there are many young families which are falling into the trap where they find it difficult to get private health cover and do not qualify for medical cards. This is one development which is welcome, especially to give support to those who have young children so that they have access to medical care when they require it. I certainly hope that the consultations and discussions with the IMO come to a satisfactory conclusion and that this scheme can be started at the earliest possible date. I thank the Minister of State for bringing forward this legislation.

I would be inclined to go a little further and say that the services offered by GPs are pivotal because they are the gatekeepers of the services. Senator Colm Burke referred to a meeting of 350 GPs which took place in Cork earlier in the year. I was at that meeting. I went further, to another meeting in Tralee where there were another 85 GPs present and I listened carefully to their concerns. Senator Crown seems to outline clearly and succinctly the concerns expressed by the GPs with regard to the proposed new contract. However, we cannot support Senator Crown because what is in the legislation and what is in the contract are two different things, and we are talking about the legislation here today. Amendments Nos. 1 to 7, inclusive, as proposed by Senator Crown, would have the effect of binding the Minister's ability to negotiation the new contract and we must remember that the Minister is the upholder of the public interest here as well. Either as a legislator here in the House or in the other part of my life where I spent ten years as a trade union negotiator in the health service, I have never come across a proposal to so bind a Minister. I have never seen either the necessity or the desirability of including the amendments that Senator Crown proposes in legislation.While I would share most of his concerns with regard to the negotiation of a new contract, both separate issues, restraining the Minister in his negotiations with a third party with regard to their contract is not what we would like.

I have different views on the Bill. While I am supportive of almost everything Senator John Crown has said. However, I am not sure I support amendment No. 3 which states: "The agreement, referred to in subsection (1) shall not require any general practitioner to perform annual, or otherwise periodic assessments of patients who are healthy." I understand that in China - I am not sure if this is still the case - the doctor got paid if one was well. His job was to keep one healthy, and he did not get paid if one got ill. That is an excellent idea. I would hate to think if we accepted Senator John Crown's amendment that it might restrict the opportunity to do that at some point in the future. However, everything else he said makes sense. I grew up in the marketplace and I am used to the customer deciding whether to go here or there or whether to buy this or that. Currently I have that freedom. Is there any danger that freedom will be taken away? As a patient living in a locality, I have been with the same GP service for more than 40 years but I have a choice in the practice as to which doctor to go to. In that area I have a choice of half a dozen GPs to whom I can go. I am concerned that 98% of GPs said they would not sign the particular contract. I understand what Senator John Gilroy said that this is not the contract. We are not talking about the contract here. The GPs claim that no negotiations have taken place in regard to the contract. Will the Minister of State please put my mind at rests that is not the position? I believe my contract with my doctor is with that doctor, with that GP, not with the HSE. It appears to me as though Big Brother is coming in.  GPs say they would have to agree to do the work as dictated by the HSE and other government bodies. These could inspect the GP, interview his or her staff and take his or her records as they wished. I do not see that in the Bill and ask the Minister of State to put my mind at rest. I understand Senator John Crown is concerned that the freedom for the GPs to give the advice and medical service will be interfered with by the State. I do not think any of us want that interference and I doubt if the Minister of State wants it. Certainly, I do not believe patients want it, they want to be able to deal exactly as Senator John Crown said, that is with their GP on a confidential basis. All of the points he has made make a great deal of sense and I ask the Minister of State to put my mind at rest in that regard.

We have had an Adjournment debate on this issue. Like others, I have attended a meeting in Galway of approximately 250 GPs where I learned that it is the one part of the health service that is working well. Some 98% of GPs reported that their patients did not need to go to hospital and that they were able to deal with them and that they were being resourced by a very small proportion of the health budget. The figure escapes me but I think it is less than 5%. Perhaps the Minister of State would clarify that. This is a patient-doctor relationship that is working well. I would not like to do anything to dismantle that service. Given that 98% of GPs are not willing to work with the Minister on free GP care-----

The information available to me from the UK is that one can wait seven days for a seven-minute appointment. If I have a sick child under the age of six years - I have had occasion to be that mother - I do not want to wait even for one minute once I know the child is ill. In those circumstances, I have to find a doctor straight away, therefore, I will have to pay unless that person is on my doorstep or local. We have had situations in Galway, with which I am sure the Minister of State is familiar as they have been well documented, whereby we could not get GPs to take up the lists in remote areas. We have situations where many of our young doctors are leaving the country, so why are we seeking to reduce the service which is effectively what will happen? I want a relationship with a caring GP, not with a bureaucrat. For that reason I support many of Senator John Crown's well-crafted amendments. Perhaps I can speak to one or two specifically. The amendment with which I have great difficulty is the one where GPs would be gagged and would have to sign a confidentiality clause. We want to ensure the doctor is not hamstrung and is not whipped by bureaucracy as there could be occasions when that would be dangerous to patient care. We must remember that doctors have to lobby. If they are gagged or have to sign a confidentiality clause that could be so restrictive that at the end of the line the patient would lose out. An important issue for me is that they would always act in the interest of the patient and would not be restricted in doing that. The issue raised in amendment No. 3, in the name of Senator Crown, was raised during the meetings. In theory, I support universal health care. I voted and lobbied for this but as a country I do not think we can afford it right now. I want to see the people in need getting the service, that the service would follow the need, and that the money would follow the patient in need. I would like the time and resources of the GP spent on the person who is unwell. By making the service universal we will clog up waiting rooms in a way that could come against the people who suddenly have a child with a very high temperature, spots or whatever, or meningitis with no possibility of getting an appointment quickly.  Speaking to amendment No. 6, it is critically important that medical records are limited to the medics and would be released only with the consent of the patient. We do not want information used in a way that is not intended other than for the well-being of the patient. I believe that should be restricted to the important GP-patient relationship.  Amendment No. 10, which we are also discussing-----

I look forward to the Minister of State's replies on where the negotiations are at in terms of the percentage of GPs who are not willing to sign the contract, given that there has been a number of moves since I raised the matter on the Adjournment. Based on the Minister of State's knowledge of the take-up of GPs, how reliable will the service be? For example, I am based in Galway. Will I have to travel ten miles to get a GP who is willing to sign up to this contract or will have to travel 20 or 30 miles if I am in rural Galway? Those are critical issues. What is the point in having a service in name if it is not a service that will deliver when one has a sick child under six years of age?
#SeanDBarrett	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	198	I welcome the Minister of State.I agree with virtually everything Senators Crown, Gilroy and Colm Burke have said. The general practitioner service is the part of the health service that works. In a situation in which well over 90% - I am sure the Minister of State can correct me on the number - of people who attend accident and emergency departments are never admitted to hospital, does this not illustrate the scope for developing the GP service? I would like to see such a service provided in the evenings and at weekends because, after all, people also get sick at those times. I also would like to see group practice GPs, in which perhaps three or four people got together. If one had been involved in sports in college, he or she could specialise in that, while another may have an interest in paediatrics and so on. There is scope in this regard because once one gets inside the door of a hospital, whether into the accident and emergency department or certainly if one gets upstairs to the beds, one's costs will be far higher than the €55 the Minister of State mentioned on Second Stage as being the cost of a GP visit. Senator Crown has extolled the virtues of the doctor being fully trained. He or she has low overheads and it is not a two-tier system. Moreover, the GP service does not have the edifice complex with which the Minister, Deputy Reilly, and the Minister of State must deal in the Irish health service, whereby we keep on closing hospitals and opening new ones. It seems to be never-ending and the arguments always are about buildings and edifices, not about patients. It is important that the general practitioner service be kept onside. I do not know whether there have been developments in respect of the National Association of General Practitioners. There appear to be some differences of opinion between that association and the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, which appears to be the negotiating body. However, as Senator Healy Eames has noted, society as a whole, including all Members, would not like to have any GPs who are unhappy in this regard. This is an important part of the health service and Members wish to ensure the Government is negotiating with people who represent the entire sector. As for the GPs, if I take the 410,000 children who are aged between zero and six, according to the Start Strong report, the Minister of State's estimate was that approximately 40% of those children already have cards. The Minister of State may have more up-to-date figures in this regard. Consequently, this measure pertains to the remaining 60% of that 410,000 population. As I perceive it, this will change the relationship between 250,000 patients or customers of GPs and they are entitled to be concerned. They appear to be quite happy, and on Second Stage I mentioned the income distribution statistics to the Minister of State. I appreciate that in a policy sense, the Minister of State wishes to have them included but under no measure of poverty do the aforementioned 250,000 people count. They are not in DEIS schools, they are not in consistent poverty and they do not qualify under the survey on income and living conditions, SILC, study. Nevertheless, it has been decided politically that this relatively well-off section of the population of 250,000 people are to have their relationship with their GPs changed. While this is a relationship I consider to be working, it is getting the intervention of the bureaucracy, the kind about which Senator Crown has expressed concern. In a health service that still employs approximately twice as many bureaucrats as it does doctors and dentists, I share that concern. The system is working well and there is no need to have layers of bureaucracy involved. If one wishes to help people on low incomes, that should be done directly through the medical card system by extending eligibility as the circumstances of the country permit. However, I refer to the suggestion that these additional 250,000 people, whose parents currently pay the €55, can be catered for with €37 million, which is the figure the Minister of State mentioned on Second Stage. This does not stand up because the last time something like this was done, I believe most ill-advisedly, was when medical cards entitlements were extended to the over-70s. The first budget was €19 million for 39,000 beneficiaries but the outturn, as the Brennan commission report stated, was €55 million for 77,000 beneficiaries. Moreover, it was necessary to introduce a gold card system because some private patients were worth more to the doctors concerned than was on offer from the State by giving them all medical cards. Consequently, on the track record, I worry about the cost. Had I tabled an amendment today, it would have been to propose the capping of this programme at the €37 million figure mentioned by the Minister of State. At present, the General Medical Services system costs €2.8 billion and to extend it by quarter of a million people for €37 million will require some miracle of loaves and fishes. I worry about that aspect. I also worry about what it is doing to the GPs. I prefer the system in which they themselves provide the premises and the involvement of building sections is avoided. When the arguments about Balbriggan, medical centres and so on arose, my question was to ask why build them at all. I was not interested in whose constituency they were but in why they were necessary when this was a job the GPs had been doing well for decades past. If one wishes to help people with low incomes or if one wishes to extend eligibility to other people, a goal I do not share in this instance, one should not undermine a system that has served us well in the face of massive costs in accident and emergency departments and the unnecessary frequenting of such units. The Minister, Deputy Reilly, has referred in this House to the deskilling of GPs because a hospital culture has been built in which people do not think it is the practice of medicine unless one gets a letter to attend a hospital. People have stated that sometimes GPs are virtually confined to letter-writing, that is, to an employer to state someone is sick when he or she is not or to a consultant when the treatment could take place in the GP surgery. I would like to see that service developed and the freedom to comment, which doctors always have had our society and which is covered by Senator Crown's amendments, retained and enhanced. I worry about turning GPs into civil servants, given the problems we have had in the health service heretofore. Again, however, the Minister of State is most welcome and I value the manner in which this debate is organised, as it allows Members to refer to so many aspects that I hope will be of assistance to the Minister of State in what I definitely hope will be an ongoing role in developing the GP service. I thank the Minister of State in that regard.

#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	200	I thank all the Senators for their extremely helpful contributions on these amendments and I will address some of the specific matters raised shortly. As agreed by Members, amendments Nos. 1 to 7, inclusive, are being taken together. These proposed amendments seek to insert new sections after section 5, which effectively seek to determine the shape of the GP contract for the provision of services to children aged five and under. With respect, it is not appropriate to include provisions in legislation that would restrict the terms of any agreements which the HSE may enter into with GPs for the provision of services to children aged five and under, as provided for in the proposed section 58C(1) in the Act of 1970. Members will be aware that the Department of Health and the HSE are currently in discussions with the IMO within the context of the framework agreement I signed on 4 June last. This framework agreement sets out a process of engagement on all aspects of the GMS contract with GPs with due regard to the IMO’s representative role and within the context of legislation underpinning the introduction of GP care free at the point of access. Substantive engagement with the IMO is under way with regard to the draft contract for the provision of services to all children aged five and under. Under the aforementioned framework agreement, the IMO can fully represent its members in respect of discussions around all aspects of this draft contract, including fees, and in respect of the GMS contract. That is the appropriate forum to address the concerns of GPs concerning the draft contract, which was published on 31 January 2014.I do not propose to accept the amendments proposed by Senator Crown. Amendment No. 1 is clearly prompted by what has been referred to as a gagging clause in the draft contract. The specific clause in the contract as published, which is clause 28.4.4, was intended to reflect and be protective of the HSE's interests given that the primary statutory obligation to provide general practitioner medical and surgery services will rest with the HSE. It is not in any sense intended to impose unwarranted or inappropriate restrictions on individual GP contractors advocating on behalf of their patients. The clause in question should be viewed in the context of the entire draft document where the intent is to balance the duties, obligations and rights of both parties while at the same time having due regard to the overriding statutory obligations that will rest with the HSE. Nevertheless, in view of the reaction to this clause in particular, the HSE and the Department are willing to discuss the matter further with the IMO. There is no intention on my part or on the part of the Department, the Minister or the HSE to effect the kind of restrictive environment that seems to be suggested in the amendment. While I do not propose to accept the amendment, I am sympathetic to the thrust of the points the Senator made. It would not be appropriate to restrict criticism, impose obligations to limit criticism in the kind of circumstances he outlined, require a GP to notify or get prior approval from the HSE in advance of saying something or in any way dilute the natural right to freedom of expression implicit in the Constitution. Although I have huge respect for the Members of this and the other House, I do not think it is appropriate or even possible for them to manage the negotiations on this contract. I say that with all the respect that is due to Members. Negotiations on any contract are a matter for the parties involved and that is how matters should proceed. I accept that there are concerns about the aforementioned clause. The Department and the HSE are committed to addressing such concerns and, for my own part, I believe the matter can be resolved to the satisfaction of both parties. Section 58C deals with the contracts the HSE may enter into with GPs for the provision of GP services to all children aged five years and younger. Subsection (1) provides that the HSE may enter into a contract on such terms and conditions as it considers appropriate, and subsection (2) provides that the contract shall specify the services to be provided by the GP. The proposed amendment No. 2 seeks to ensure the contract shall not include greater specification of services to be provided by the GP than is included in the GMS contract. The draft under-six contract encompasses the strengths of the existing GMS contract while also seeking to address, in so far as is practicable, its weaknesses and limitations. This new draft contract provides a unique opportunity to refocus primary care towards prevention and health promotion, in addition to diagnosis and treatment. It is wholly appropriate that a contract being introduced in 2014 should reflect the requirements of today rather than simply reflecting the terms of a GMS contract introduced 25 years ago. If the amendment were accepted, it appears it would confine the services to be offered under it to those already provided. I do not regard that as appropriate and I am not prepared to accede to such a proposition. In regard to amendment No. 3, when drafting the contract consideration was given to the document, Healthy Ireland: A Framework for Improved Health and Wellbeing 2013-2025. This is the Government's national framework for action to improve the health and well-being of the population over the coming generation. Based on international evidence, it outlines a new commitment to public health with an emphasis on prevention and stronger health systems. This is related to Senator Quinn's point on China. It addresses risk factors and promotes protective actions at every stage of life, including early childhood. Healthy Ireland has been informed by feedback from an extensive consultation process with Government, the health sector and the wider public and provider society. It reflects international experience and evidence of what determines health and reflects best practice on how to prioritise and invest for long-term sustainable health benefits. A key feature of the draft contract is to refocus primary care towards prevention and health promotion, in addition to diagnosis and treatment. As well as ensuring equitable access for young children to health care, GP care without fees will reduce the financial burden on young families, many of whom face unemployment and negative equity. It also increases the likelihood of conditions in children, such as obesity, being identified and addressed at an earlier stage, and of vaccination rates being maintained. A broad range of evidence from the international scientific literature attests to the value of health checks and health-promoting activities for issues such obesity in early childhood. The detail of the relevant clause of the draft contract, that is, clause 13, will be discussed with the IMO within the terms of the framework agreement referred to. Perhaps Senator Crown will disagree but to say there should not be annual or periodic assessments is tantamount to saying there should be no assessments. It is problematic, at the minimum, to suggest we should not have health assessments of persons who are healthy. That may be a point of disagreement between us but I think it would be inappropriate to exclude such assessments from the remit of the contract. This is intended to be a contract with GPs but not all the services we are proposing to contract with a GP need to be carried by that individual. This issue turns on the configuration of staffing and resources for general practice. Practice nurses and many other well-trained primary care professionals are capable of carrying out much of this work. If the contract is for the provision by the GP of a service, he or she does not have personally to perform all the individual actions required, whether they involve weighing a child or taking bloods. Many of these tasks can be carried by other trained primary care professionals. However, the contract for delivery of the service is with the GP. Amendment No. 4 refers to the contract duration. The draft contract proposes a contract duration of five years, with the option of extending it for further periods of five years subject to satisfactory outcome of performance reviews. Performance reviews are a widely recognised feature of contracts for services and for this reason they have been included in the draft contract. To the extent that there is a concern about restrictions in the number of years, that is amenable to negotiation and engagement among the parties to the contract. It is wholly unsuitable to suggest some form of statutory intervention into the matter. It should and will be a matter for discussion with the IMO. In respect of amendment No. 5, clause 13 of the 1989 contract includes minimal requirements for practice premises. For example, the contract requires a waiting room with a reasonable standard of comfort and hygiene sufficient in size to accommodate the normal demands of the practice for both eligible and private patients with adequate seating.Second, a surgery sufficient in size for the requirements of normal general practice, with facilities, including electric light, hot and cold running water, an examination couch, and other essential needs of such practice, including a telephone. That is the existing position. Clause 12 of the new draft contract seeks to build on these requirements to reflect current needs and expectations. However, I again emphasise the comments received as part of the public consultation process and those made today concerning practice premises and the term of the contract have been carefully noted and these issues will be discussed further with the IMO. In regard to the plain intent of amendment No. 5, the Senator is perhaps unintentionally calling for a situation where there would be no minimum requirements set for practice premises. That would be a regression because it would seem to suggest that even the minimum requirements there currently ought to be removed as it has been suggested there should be no restrictions. In regard to amendment No 6, I emphasise there is no intention to interfere with the doctor-patient relationship and the contract will not provide for any inappropriate sharing of patients' medical information. This was raised in recent months and it will be discussed with the IMO. Any concerns as to what is intended can be addressed in that context. I will return to the matter in a moment, if I may. In regard to amendment No. 7, section 58C provides that the HSE will be entitled to enter into a contract with any suitably qualified and vocationally trained general practitioner for the provision of GP services to all children aged five years and younger. The requirement is that a doctor is registered on the specialist division of the register of medical practitioners and holds a current certificate of registration in respect of the specialty of general practice. This is not new as the Health (Provision of General Practitioner Services) Act 2012 includes the same requirements. However, the Bill provides that the HSE may enter into a contract for relevant services with any registered medical practitioner who already holds a GMS contract for the six-month period following commencement of the section. This is in recognition of the fact that some older doctors, while fully qualified, may not have registered on the specialist register. The draft contract includes a reference to English language competency but, I would respectfully say, there is no need to go in to this level of detail in the legislation. The 1989 contract includes procedures concerning complaints, suspension and termination of the contract. These are important features of any contract. However, the draft under-six contract includes a more comprehensive, practical and fair set of processes and procedures, including disputes resolution arrangements. These arrangements will be the subject of further discussion with the IMO. I wish to respond to some of the points I may not have fully addressed. The House would expect me to say, but I want to emphasise it, that there is no intention in anything we propose to do in this legislation or elsewhere to undermine or still less, to use Senator Healy Eames's phrase, to dismantle our system of primary care and our system of general practice. Why would we do such a thing? Why would we have such an objective? It is absurd. We seek to improve and enhance primary care and the provision of our health service. Everybody in this House wants to achieve the same objective. We may disagree about some of the policy choices but there is no wish, in any sense, to undermine what we do.  There is ample evidence that fees at the point of delivery for general practice constitute a significant barrier to attending one's general practitioner. This is not just my assertion. The evidence is very considerable. People, even relatively well-off people, put off going to see their doctor because of the barrier of fees and I have read studies on this. People like me and most Members of this House, who are not medically trained, are not in a position to make an informed decision as to whether we need to go to see a doctor. I would say with respect to Senator Quinn that sometimes the issue of the market intervention or the fact there is a fee and a commercial relationship enters into that dynamic and I would respectfully submit that it should not. I am not opposed to the market determining distribution of services and resources in different parts of the economy and society but perhaps this area is arguably wholly unsuitable to the question of how one distributes and facilitates the distribution of health care. The fees have been shown demonstrably to be a barrier to attendance. As people do not go to see their doctor, because they do not wish to pay €50 or €55, we cannot begin to encourage them to come into primary care for the preventative strategies we want to put in place in primary care. Who will go to see his or her doctor about a problem he or she thinks he or she might have in 20 years' time? Who will go to see his or her doctor to say he or she thinks he or she might be a candidate in ten, 20 or 30 years' time for diabetes? Who will pay €50 or €55 for that exercise? It is very unlikely people will do so. We use the term "free GP care". I was criticised for making the following comment in the media. I said I accept - I think this will please Senator Barrett - that nothing is free because it has to be funded. It is a decision by society and by the Oireachtas as to whether it is appropriate to fund something or not. We have the honour to be here and to be the people who decide on that. We use short-hand terms such as "free GP care" but we know it has to be funded. I believe it is absolutely something that deserves our taking steps to introduce.  I understand Senator Healy Eames's point that she agrees with universal access in theory. By extension, it seems she is making a distinction between agreeing with it in theory but not necessarily agreeing with it in practice. Our challenge, if we agree with it in theory, is to bring forward that policy in the way the Government has decided in the programme for Government and in its subsequent decisions in that regard.  I addressed the issue in regard to GPs and I agree with Senator Crown. Who better to make the point than he about the importance of advocacy and the professional independence and autonomy of doctors, general practitioners, medical specialists and others to do the job they do but also to be in a position to advocate on behalf of their patients, patient groups or on any issues they regard as important that should raise, whether in this House, outside it or anywhere else. I am a strong believer in that. I am also a strong believer that doctors and medical people should have the right to do that and should not be restricted in that regard. One can take whatever one wishes from what I have said but one can take it that it is certainly my view and that of the Minister for Health. There is no intention to interfere with doctor-patient confidentiality. If Senator Crown is right that there is some sloppiness in the wording of the agreement - I am not quite sure where he finds that sloppiness - we can address it in the course of the engagement underway with the IMO. In regard to Senator Colm Burke's questions on insurance cover, the draft contract includes provisions on warranties and indemnities. It will also be the subject of discussion with the IMO because it would want to address that with us. On the legislation in respect of a requirement to have insurance, I am advised drafting of that legislation is continuing. I hope we will be able to repot progress on that soon.  Senator Gilroy made a point, reflected in the remarks of other colleagues, that the very real concerns of general practitioners throughout the country must be respected and taken on board. Senator Healy Eames and others made that point also, with which I agree. However, things have moved on since some of the meetings to which Senator Healy Eames referred. I heard about those meetings, know a lot of what was said at them and have read what was said in the media in respect of them. Things have moved on considerably. I spent some weeks negotiating an agreement with the IMO. I emphasise the agreement is not an agreement on the contract but on how we do business together.We needed to do that, arising from the uncertainty and difficulty associated with the competition law environment. We have now secured an agreement with the IMO which will facilitate a good competition law-proofed way of engaging the State services with the general practitioners, GPs. I am confident that will facilitate a very good level of agreement between ourselves and the doctors, which is necessary, and I agree with colleagues on that. Senator Quinn said there should be negotiations on this and engagement with people. There will be. Such negotiations and engagement are under way. It is very easy to fall into the trap of decrying and criticising bureaucrats. I understand the frustration people sometimes feel, not just with the health services. We need good people to administer our health services. Of course we need doctors and medical professionals but we also need people to administer the service and to work on issues such as the contract. There is overarching political involvement in it but there are very engaged, professional people in the Department of Health and the HSE who worked hard to put in place the draft contract and then listened to, and engaged with, the GPs and the doctors. I assure the Members of this House that is happening.  These people, who do a terrific job on this, are entitled to a little more support than they sometimes get. I am not necessarily talking about this House but more broadly. The quick dismissal of bureaucrats is often misplaced. It is not a question of gratuitously wanting to interfere in general practice or to arrive in the dead of the night to go through everything in the surgery to see what people are doing, to look around corners, correct GPs homework or look into their computers for no apparent reason. That is not what anybody wishes to do. There will be no interference with the professional autonomy of doctors, whether in regard to data or any of the other aspects of the contract. It is simply a case of getting it done properly and economically on behalf of the State. That is what we intend to do. I agree with Senator Barrett’s point that GPs ought to be available outside what we normally regard as working hours. Most general practitioners will say that there is such a service. There are good cooperative services in most, if not all, parts of the country now. GPs are not confined to nine to five hours. They work at different times in the evening and weekends as well. I agree with him that it is right that we should go for practices of four or more GPs. The model of the sole practitioner, whether in an urban or rural area, is in decline for good reason. It is not economically possible to sustain that model. That is why we are developing primary care centres. I was interested in Senator Barrett’s point about the edifice complex. One thing that saddens me about health care is that people talk about hospitals only, defending them against closure. I might be on the streets if I lived in a town where the hospital was going to close. I would love to see the politics of health care moving to advancing, and advocating for, primary care services in the community. I was in Schull in west Cork to open a primary care centre a few weeks ago. This is transformative for a relatively remote area. People no longer have to make a 100 km round trip, whether to Bantry or somewhere else, to go to an acute setting for example, to have a wound dressed, or something else done that should be done in the community. It has a transformational effect on the way people access health care because having to get on the road and travel is one of the most stressful things for people who are ill and vulnerable. While Senator Barrett is right about the edifice complex, I would seek support for a different type of edifice, a small primary care centre that combines under one roof, GPs, physiotherapists, speech and language therapists, and all the other health care professionals collaborating and working together so that people do not have to go to the much bigger edifices. We can then transform our health care services in the way we want that to happen.  We had an exchange the last day we debated this Bill, about the universal aspect, of which Senator Barrett is at the very least sceptical. I respectfully continue to disagree with him on that point. We are an outlier, compared with any country in Europe or the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, where primary care does not have the commercial barrier of requiring one to pay fees. We must remove the barrier of fees in primary care so that people do not have to go to the accident and emergency department in the hospital. We should do that universally, for all our citizens. We need to find ways to do and fund that as quickly as we can. Senator Barrett said the GP service works well, and Senator Healy Eames and others pointed out that it is the one part of our health service that is working well, and asked why interfere with it. Taken in isolation I agree it is working well but the health system is not working well. We have to look to primary care as the engine of change in the health service. Whereas one can say without fear of contradiction that the GP service is working well, it has to change in order to help the rest of the system to work well. That is why we are pressing for the expansion of primary care. The broader system is not working well and primary care is the way to go to resolve so many of those issues. 
#JohnCrown	unknown-#JohnCrown-party	unknown-#JohnCrown-dob	unknown-#JohnCrown-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	201	I thank the Minister of State for his thoughtful and considered reply to my amendments. I understand the broad thrust of his not wishing to bind the hands of negotiators with legislation when circumstances can change. The negotiator in this case, however, is the HSE, an organisation of which there is a general feeling there needs to be enhanced political scrutiny. That is all we are trying to do here, to make sure that not only do we have civilian control of the military but we have political control of the civilian infrastructure as well. It is not inappropriate to set out broad guidelines about what the HSE can and cannot do within its contract. The HSE has a conflict of interest, not only does it run the general practice but also the hospital and other services. In fact, it runs a breathtaking array of services. It is quite staggering to see the breadth and scope of the services for which it is responsible. In attempting to deal with high profile budget problems in some parts of the service, such as the hospital service, it is all too easy for it to push work aside onto other parts of the service. That is one of the things that I and my GP colleagues fear in terms of the carte blanche approach to what it can put in the contract. In effect, it can be prescriptive about services, tests and treatments which can and cannot be provided and it can ask GPs to perform services which it could be argued could be best performed in some other part of the public health service by public health nurses etc. That was the genesis of those particular objections. I will press for a vote on the amendment on the gagging order. I feel strongly about that. The point needs to be made because it does not apply just in general practice or the health service. The country has suffered on multiple fronts because of a lack of whistleblower protection. We are told there will be enhanced whistleblower protection. In the first draft of the first contract offered to the GPs it was being suggested that somehow the essential nature of whistleblower protection would be undermined. It has to be enshrined in every Bill governing any part of our public service, that this can never happen. This is as good a starting point as any. On a more general point concerning the Minister of State's questions about the management, the managers and the officials in the HSE and the Department of Health, I do not hold them individually responsible for the problems in the health service although I think they have collective responsibility. As the largest vested interest group in the health service, HSE managers stand to lose most from true health service reform, as a result of which they would cede virtually all of their power.  The key problem is profound and relates to the culture of management and leadership. People in officialdom and politics used to tell me to be quiet about health policy because I knew nothing about it. In the memorable words of one senior civil servant in the Department of Health, I was just a technician and the civil servants were the people who knew how the health service should be run. To prove the individual in question wrong, I signed up to do a health care MBA to which I gave two of my precious middle years. I found this an extremely interesting and informative activity. The first lesson we learned in the first lecture on the first day of the first semester was the difference between management and leadership. The key problem we have is that we do not have much leadership in the health service. For example, there is a lack of an appropriate cohort or adequate number of full-time academic doctors providing intellectual powerhouse medical schools, rather than mere "degreemails", as is unfortunately the case at present. We have far too many medical schools per head of population. Many of them are also small and understaffed, with approximately one tenth of the number of full-time consultant level people employed in them as one would find in equivalent institutions abroad. One whole side of what should be the leadership part of the equation of Irish medicine and health care is missing. In our hospital structures every single consultant is co-equal with every other consultant and there is no question of an individual being the leader of a department, exercising autonomy and trying to hire and fire or bring in people. We simply do not do this.  I do not mean my remarks to sound pejorative but the specialists in human resources, physical plant and procurement should deal with human resources, physical plant and procurement, respectively. Instead, however, the people who are in a leadership situation, the technical managers, default into leadership roles. This is the reason we have most of our current problems.  The people who run and provide the intellectual inspiration for a law firm are the lawyers, not some group of professional managerialists who regard the lawyers as technicians who merely interpret the law. That is the core problem. We need to develop a cadre of leaders in nursing, medicine and the ancillary areas who will lead the service and tap into the expertise of managers, while having their activities subject to appropriate civilian control. That is not the current position. The reason so much flak is rained down on those who manage the health service is that they are doing the wrong job. The core problem is that they are doing a job they are not trained to do.  I will press the amendment because it is a very important issue of principle. We will dispose of the others when they come before us.

We have not yet been given full clarity, however. I am a strong advocate of primary care, of which general practitioners form the backbone. The primary care system does not work without general practitioners. I built up a business case for a primary care centre in Oranmore for three years, during which time I was told one could have all the public health services and speech therapists in the world but it would not be of any use without buy-in from general practitioners. I want general practitioners to be on our side.  The Minister of State referred to theory versus practice. While I am fully in favour of the proposed measures in theory, how will they work in practice unless we have a sufficient number of general practitioners to deliver them? Does the Minister of State have a deadline by which he will make a decision on the contract? Is there a minimum number of general practitioners required to commence the roll-out and, if so, what is it? It is great to hear that matters have moved on but I do not want an apartheid style system to emerge in the area of GP care for children aged under six years. Such a system was evident in BreastCheck for some time. I want universality and uniformity of service. The number of general practitioners needed to achieve this matters because if a child of under six years must wait seven days to interact with a GP for seven minutes, it will not be a proper service. Does the Minister of State agree? I fully concur with the Minister of State on health promotion and prevention. I also agree that people will not make an appointment with a doctor to find out if they or their children could be candidates for diabetes if they must pay €50 to do so. However, there are other ways of rolling out these types of services. For example, we have rolled out screening programmes and developmental, sight and hearing tests in schools for many years. Having worked in the area of health promotion, I agree with the Minister of State that we must prioritise health prevention and promotion. To return to the basic point, how many general practitioners must sign up to the contract if a universal service is to be provided? While I am pleased the Minister of State is willing to speak about the gagging clause, I share Senator Crown's view. Why would one want to hamstring a general practitioner who is acting for the good of a patient? The Minister of State is right to address this issue. He is also correct that it is not appropriate to manage negotiations on the contract from the Oireachtas. However, our job is to remove the unsavoury principles that underpin the negotiations and will prevent a deal being reached. I refer, for example, to the gagging clause and the provision prohibiting the sharing of medical records. Did the Minister of State indicate that the medical record will be sacrosanct between patient and doctor? The Minister of State also indicated that a change in competition law will make it easier to negotiate with general practitioners. We must have clarity on whether that is the case. We require accurate facts and figures on the numbers of general practitioners who are willing to sign up to this contract. Otherwise we will have a theoretical framework that will never work in practice.  Amendment No. 10 refers to the modernisation of diagnostic services.

The Minister of State is correct that we must shift our focus from hospitals to primary care and the community setting. To do this, we must help general practitioners to buy the diagnostic equipment they require to carry out X-rays in the community and procure the information technology that enables them to send X-rays to hospitals. If general practitioners are so hamstrung by the Government that they cannot sign up to the contract, universal health care for children aged under six years will not be implemented and general practitioners will not be able to sign up to the contract as they will not be able to afford the equipment they need. This is a catch-22 scenario. How many general practitioners must the Government have on side if it is to deliver a semblance of universality?

He suggested the Health Service Executive has most to lose from a reorganisation.It seems to be some sort of tautology or, at minimum, a circular argument. In the 30 years I worked with the health services, I have never been accused of being a defender of the HSE and I am one of its greatest critics. Nevertheless, Senator Crown's diagnosis of the problem at managerial level in the HSE does not really capture the entire picture. There are many other interest groups involved which have a special interest in maintaining the status quo and are required to do so by their members in many ways. The managerial position in the HSE outlined by Senator Crown - with managers making decisions - is the reality but there are some clinicians who also make decisions. For example, in the mental health services, the clinical director rules the roost within the catchment area in which those services are delivered. I have spoken in the Seanad many times about the postcode lottery. If a person experiences mental health difficulties, he or she is required to go to the consultant in the geographical area in which that person lives. If the consultant in question is a good clinician that is great, but the consultant must also be a good manager. If the consultant is one of the two, the patient is in trouble, and if the consultant is neither, the patient is in real trouble. The postcode lottery maintains poor service within the mental health sector as there is no way to judge outcomes from one catchment area to another; the patient or service user has no choice only to avail of the services in a particular area. This is an illustration of my point about Senator Crown's analysis of the managerial problems within the health services and how the entire picture is not captured. A legislative proposal that would provide a GP not be required to adhere to evolving and best practice would be problematic and undesirable. It is premature to put the provisions of amendment No. 9 into legislation when we are unsure of an outcome, and we do not even know the final agreement under the June framework. It would be not only premature but reckless and careless to insert a legislative provision in advance of knowing what a contract will ultimately contain.
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	208	Senator Healy Eames mentioned the Competition Authority. The Irish Medical Organisation was involved with proceedings with the Competition Authority and that agreement is in the public domain. It relates to the way in which the IMO can work in future, and the agreement is in the public domain because it was the subject of High Court proceedings. The Minister has clarified that there is consultation with the IMO, and the Department and HSE are anxious that an agreement could be reached. In fairness to the Department and the HSE over the years, they have worked well with general practitioners and there is no reason they should not work well into the future. As part of that working together, the Department and the HSE must take on board the concerns that GPs have, and I have no doubt that the Minister and the Department will take on board the concerns which were initially raised. It was unfortunate that the contract was published before consultation with the representative organisations of the GPs, and I am not sure it was the best way to deal with the matter. It caused problems and fear that there would be no going back in the terms of this contract. It was not the right way to deal with the issue and the Minister and the Department should take on board the mistakes made by putting this draft contract on-line at such an early stage, even before there was consultation with the IMO. To clarify, the Competition Authority and the IMO have reached an agreement that is in the public domain. The Department is working within the terms of that agreement in trying to ensure we can get a contract with broad acceptance by the majority of GPs. Of course there will not be a contract agreed by 100% of people but the Department and the HSE are anxious for there to be full co-operation by all parties in the improvement of a comprehensive medical service, and particularly in trying to ensure the service is available for those under six. That is very important.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	209	I thank Senators for their further remarks and contributions. It is entirely a matter for Senator Crown to press the amendment but I am sorry he proposes to do so. I hope he and others have heard what I have stated in respect of what has been termed a "gagging" clause. This is in addition to what I have stated outside the House and the Minister for Health's comments about our intentions and bona fides with regard to the matter. So be it. There was an interesting discussion about conflict of interest, which was raised by Senator Crown and picked up by Senator Gilroy. Perhaps it is an issue for another day but I must question what people believe the "interest" is of the HSE other than the public interest. Perhaps it is an academic debate. It has been determined that the HSE is to be abolished, although we will still need people to manage our health services. People in the health services come and go; some retire and others come along to do the work. I am not fully sure what is the "vested interest", which was the phrase used. Perhaps that is just a difference between us. Everybody would recognise that historically there is tension between practitioners and managers. I would not describe Senator Crown or any of his colleagues as mere technicians but nor would I put down people who do important work in the service as mere bureaucrats. It is a little facile for us to engage in that kind of phraseology or debate as it does not get us anywhere. We need both our administrators and professionals, and the challenge is to have the correct balance between them and ensure that professional autonomy, for example, and leadership is facilitated. I was very interested in what Senator Crown said about professional leadership. I am not as fully informed about the gap he sees in professional leadership and whether the system needs to address it in a better fashion. I might discuss it with him on another occasion, as there was much sense in his comments. There is no question of being prescriptive with, for example, a HSE manager being prescriptive as to what test a doctor should appropriately implement for a patient or illness. That would be absurd and why would anybody think it would be remotely appropriate? Why would one think it is intended that the HSE should say that a particular test should be used or a doctor should engage in a particular fashion in respect of the care and management of a patient? That could not arise. There is another issue pertaining to the debate of who makes decisions about health services. We were criticised by some practitioners for going ahead with legislation without having agreement from the medical profession. I must respectfully repeat the point that the question of policy and the distribution of resources allied to that policy is a matter for the Oireachtas and not a matter for the profession or any other group. I do not for a moment say the profession should not have an input, and it would have an elevated input because of its expertise, which I accept. The policy making must remain a matter for the Oireachtas as the distribution of a resource - whether in health care, education, justice or social protection - is a matter for a policy makers. It should remain as such, and I therefore do not accept that the drafting of legislation should be made contingent on the agreement of any vested interest or profession.I say that in all generosity to them. The input, however, has to be respected and taken on board. With respect to Senator Healy Eames, to some extent she is putting the cart before the horse. I am not going to speculate as to how many doctors will sign up to this contract. It is a voluntary question for anyone in any contractual position. No party can force the other party to engage in or sign a contract. The GSM system is founded on a contract between the system and the individual general practitioner.

Senator Burke made the point about the settlement agreement in the High Court proceedings. Separately from that, the framework agreement I have signed is not a settlement with the IMO in the context of litigation. That is an entirely separate matter. I have concluded and signed a framework agreement between the Department and the HSE on the one hand, and the IMO on the other about how we structure our negotiations and our engagement on all of these matters. The State was not involved in those proceedings. This is an agreement between the Department and the IMO to direct and manage-----

Instead, I am going to encourage, in every way possible, the parties involved to conclude an agreement. I have every confidence in GPs and their representative body and I believe we will be able to deliver this service in the autumn with good will on all sides. I believe there will be a sufficient number of GPs to do so. There will be capacity issues in the system as we move on from the under-sixes that will have to be addressed. This will be done in the negotiations with the IMO. The question as to how many will sign up to this is somewhat academic because we have not yet made a single contract offering to any GP yet. There is only a draft contract to drive the process but no actual contract has yet been sent out. We are some distance off this but we are getting closer.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	15190	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	220	I welcome the opportunity to introduce Second Stage of the Radiological Protection (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2014. The Bill has two main objectives: to provide for the dissolution of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, RPII, and transfer its functions to the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA; and to introduce the necessary statutory provisions to enable Ireland to ratify the 2005 Amendment to the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material, CPPNM. The Bill also provides for the updating of certain fines under the Radiological Protection Acts, updates the definition of "ionising radiation" to the latest international standard and makes provisions to enable the RPII and the EPA to hold radioactive substances or irradiating apparatus, necessary for the fulfilment of their functions, without requiring a licence. As part of the comprehensive spending review of all areas of public expenditure, the programme for Government includes a policy of reducing the number of State agencies. A Government decision of 15 November 2011 provided for the rationalisation of 48 State bodies and agencies, and the critical review of 46 other bodies by the end of June 2012. The merger of the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, and the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, RPII, was considered as part of this critical review process. Following completion of the critical review in October 2012, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform announced that the EPA and the RPII were to merge, with a target date of summer 2014 for the merger. To meet this target, enabling legislation needs to be in place before the summer recess. I want to place on the record that there will be no diminution in the functions of either agency, or of the levels of service provided by them, arising from this merger. In fact, the synergies and greater linkages between environmental and radiological functions will enhance the capacity of both organisations. It was concluded that the most efficient and economic means of merging the two bodies was to dissolve one and transfer all its functions, staff and assets to the other, rather than to dissolve both and create a completely new entity. This approach requires significantly simpler legislation, less cost and less potential disruption to service delivery. Accordingly, it was decided to dissolve the RPII and transfer its functions, powers, staff and assets to the EPA, as the larger of the two organisations. The merger will take the following approach which is reflected in the Bill. First, on a day appointed by ministerial order, the RPII will be dissolved and its functions, powers and staff will transfer to the EPA. It will become the Office of Radiological Protection within the agency, headed up by a director, taking the number of offices in the agency to five. The other four offices are environmental enforcement; climate, licensing, research and resource use; environmental assessment; and communications and corporate services. The Bill will make the necessary repeals and amendments to all relevant enactments and statutory instruments to ensure the EPA has the requisite powers to assume the radiological protection role. In this regard, all current functions of the RPII become functions of the EPA from the date of transfer. The second principal objective of the Bill is to enable Ireland to ratify the 2005 amendment to the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material, CPPNM. The convention was signed in March 1980 and included all EU member states as signatories. Ireland ratified the convention in September 1991, the terms of the treaty being provided for through the Radiological Protection Act 1991. The convention required that the international community affords certain levels of physical protection to nuclear materials, including during international transportation. The CPPNM established a framework for co-operation among states that are party to it for the protection, recovery and return of stolen nuclear material. It also set out a range of serious criminal offences involving the misappropriation or harmful use of nuclear material which participating states were to make punishable in national law or for which offenders could be subject to extradition. In July 2005, the states that are party to the CPPNM agreed the text of an amending treaty to strengthen its provisions, primarily by extending the provisions to require ratifying states to protect nuclear facilities and materials in peaceful domestic use, storage and transport. It also provides for extended co-operation between and among states to enable rapid measures to locate and recover stolen or smuggled nuclear material and to mitigate any radiological consequences of sabotage. The original CPPNM required that states introduce a series of offences relating to nuclear materials. These included unlawfully obtaining or demanding nuclear materials or using or threatening to use such materials in a manner that would cause death or serious injury to a person or substantial damage to property. The 2005 amendment to the CPPNM extends the range of criminal offences to include also offences relating to sabotage of nuclear facilities; smuggling of nuclear materials; or facilitating, conspiring or directing offences that could lead to deliberate, malicious and dangerous dispersal of nuclear materials or release of radiation from a nuclear facility. It also requires ratifying states to make it an offence to engage in any deliberate activity that releases radioactive materials, or radiation through the sabotage of a nuclear facility, in a manner that causes significant harm to the environment. This amending treaty, when ratified, will create the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material and Nuclear Facilities, CPPNMNF. It is an important milestone in international efforts to improve the physical protection of nuclear material and facilities. It is regarded internationally as being significant for nuclear security and is expected to have a major impact in reducing the vulnerability of states to nuclear terrorism. It also increases nuclear security internationally by requiring common high standards of physical protection of nuclear material and facilities, requires parties to the convention to introduce a range of offences to prevent acts of terrorism involving nuclear material or against nuclear facilities, and allows for international co-operation to meet such threats. Dr. Yukiya Amano, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, expressed the strong hope that Ireland would ratify the treaty soon, as it requires 96 ratifying nations to enable it to come into force. Ireland has committed to ratifying the amendment as soon as possible. Ireland has been a key driver of non-proliferation since the 1960s. The then Minister for External Affairs, Frank Aiken, was the first minister to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The 2010 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, NPT, review conference called on all states parties to the CPPNM to ratify the amendment to the convention as soon as possible. It is important that Ireland does so to maintain our good standing as a state party to the NPT and at the IAEA. Ratification of the CPPNMNF is also regarded by the EU as a key element of Europe's nuclear security policy. At present, 26 of the 28 EU member states have ratified the treaty, with Italy very close to concluding its own ratification process. However, the EU, through the EURATOM treaty, cannot ratify the treaty until all 28 member states have ratified it first. In this context, our EU partners have also communicated their concern to us that Ireland ratifies the amendment at the earliest possible juncture. However, this ratification cannot take place until the necessary primary legislation is passed. As such, it is important that the enabling legislation to allow this ratification to take place is enacted, similar to the merger provisions, before the summer recess. The Bill is divided into five Parts and one Schedule. Part 1 contains three sections. Section 1 sets the Short Title of the Bill. Section 2 defines the use of key terms and phrases. Section 3 allows for the repeal of sections of the Radiological Protection Act 1991. Part 2 contains 12 sections providing for the dissolution of the RPII and the transfer of its functions, powers, staff and assets to the EPA. These are standard legal provisions necessary to ensure the smooth transition of the merger. Part 3 makes various technical amendments to legislation to ensure the EPA can continue to carry out all the functions of the RPII without interruption after the RPII is dissolved, and to provide the EPA with the necessary functional authority to do so. It consists of 16 sections and is divided into three chapters. The first chapter makes the necessary amendments to the Radiological Protection Act 1991, the 1991 Act. The second chapter amends the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992, the EPA Act, and the third chapter amends other relevant legislation and statutory instruments. Part 4 contains 9 sections which make the necessary statutory provisions to enable Ireland to ratify the 2005 amendment to the CPPNM. Part 5 contains 4 sections and outlines a number of miscellaneous provisions updating the definition of ionising radiation and making certain licensing exemptions for the RPII and the EPA to hold radioactive substances and devices necessary to carry out their functions.The Schedule to the Bill incorporates the text of the 2005 amendment to the CPPNM. This is an important Bill which should be enacted without undue delay. In part, it is a technical Bill that allows for the merger of the RPII and the EPA as required to meet the Government's agency rationalisation objective. The Bill also seeks to put in place the necessary legal provisions for Ireland to be able to ratify the amendment to the CPPNM. This is an important convention in terms of international nuclear security and to mitigate the potential for nuclear terrorist acts. It is important that we live up to the standards we have always held on nuclear matters by meeting our responsibilities regarding this convention. If not, we risk undermining our position and the reputation we have developed over the past 40 years as champions of international nuclear safety, security and non-proliferation. I commend the Bill to the House.

As the Minister of State pointed out, there are two aspects to the Bill. I will start with the second one he mentioned, which is to enable us to ratify the 2005 amendment to the International Atomic Energy Agency Convention on the physical protection of nuclear material. That was a very important convention. The Minister of State did not provide in his address an explanation for why we are the second last of the 28 countries to ratify the convention, and that we needed urging from the other 26 EU countries that have already ratified it. That gives rise to questions. I note that in general we are slow to ratify various conventions we support. That seems to illustrate a lacuna in various Departments in terms of dealing with the conventions as we endorse and agree them and then move on with the necessary legislation so that they can be properly enacted and ratified. I suggest to the Minister of State that is something all Departments should consider. Could he elucidate for us in this instance how the situation arises, in particular given-----

#JimWalsh	unknown-#JimWalsh-party	unknown-#JimWalsh-dob	unknown-#JimWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	225	-----that we were very strong on this issue for the past 40 years? As the Minister of State outlined, we were one of the countries that championed this area of precaution. Could he comment also on nuclear waste and how it is affected by the ratification of the conventions? A debate has ensued for many decades on the disposal of nuclear waste, much of which is discharged at sea. The nefarious effects of such waste last for thousands of years and therefore is in itself a considerable environmental hazard. There has been much discussion about waste from Sellafield that has been dumped in the Irish Sea. I would be interested to hear the benefit or otherwise the convention has for environmental protection in terms of nuclear waste, as distinct from nuclear material itself. The threat of nuclear fallout and ensuing radiological poisoning is a dreadful vista for this country. It is important that we continue to guard against any such possibility and that we prepare to deal with it adequately. I recall controversy some years ago on our preparedness to deal with nuclear fallout. In replying to Second Stage, it would be interesting to hear the Minister of State’s observations on the steps we now have in place to ensure public safety.

#JimWalsh	unknown-#JimWalsh-party	unknown-#JimWalsh-dob	unknown-#JimWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	227	That is correct. The Minister of State remembers the incident as well. I listened to the interview at the time. It illustrated the point that we often feel secure on the basis of being in a state of blissful ignorance rather than by virtue of any great precautionary measures that are in place to protect us. I would welcome a comment in that regard. The programme for Government, and in particular Fine Gael’s five-point plan, made a great virtue of the abolition of 105 State agencies. The Minister of State indicated that 46 agencies have been abolished to date. My information is that 45 have been abolished due to mergers. The corollary is that 33 new quangos have been created during the lifetime of the Government. Some like Uisce Éireann are monster quangos. The net effect is a reduction of approximately a dozen quangos. I strongly supported the abolition of quangos. I would like to see greater emphasis placed on such an approach as quangos are very costly. I note that the propensity of the Government has been to merge quangos rather than abolish them. There might well be good reasons in certain instances for that but one of the difficulties with merging quangos is that the attendant costs of the quangos continue, albeit under a different and larger budget umbrella. Given the fiscal crisis, I would have thought eradicating the costs in some instances would have been an attractive target to achieve. The Minister of State’s observations would be welcome on Committee Stage, which I understand we will have tomorrow. I note that the Minister of State indicated that the merger of the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, and the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, RPII, are complementary. However, in many ways that is not the case. The RPII was specifically set up to protect individuals from the harmful effects of radon gas and to examine the health implications whereas the role of the EPA is to protect against the degradation of the environment by human activities. They are two different objectives. I understand that any analysis carried out prior to the decision being taken showed no meaningful benefit would be derived from such a merger. The Minister of State could correct me if I am wrong. While I do not object to mergers in principle, anything we do in that regard places emphasis on the benefit to be derived from a higher public awareness of the dangers of radon gas. The RPII was particularly good in that regard and created such an essential awareness in terms of public health. I would not welcome any dilution of its power. The name of the organisation - the RPII - is important and I have tabled an amendment so that it is reflected in the organisation following the merger.How it functions within the organisation is also very important and it needs a statutory underpinning. Those are issues that we can deal with on Committee Stage.
#CaitKeane	unknown-#CaitKeane-party	unknown-#CaitKeane-dob	unknown-#CaitKeane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	228	I welcome the Minister of State. The Bill will enable Ireland to ratify the 2005 amendment. The previous speaker asked the Minister of State why it took so long; nine years is a long time. Ireland is one of only two EU countries yet to ratify it. However, in 2013 more than 60 countries had ratified the amendment and a total of 96 ratifications are required before it enters into force. I have also read that two thirds of the countries need to be signed up before it becomes effective. So although only two EU countries remain to ratify it, it needs another 36 before it enters into force. I ask the Minister of State to comment on that. Even though only two EU countries remain, will we be waiting for the other 34 non-EU countries before it comes into force in Europe? The overall purpose of the Bill is to comply with international obligations as laid down. In addition, it will enable the dissolution of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, RPII, and the transfer of all its functions to the EPA, decided as a part of the Government's programme. The Bill also makes a number of technical amendments to the Radiological Protection Act 1991 regarding licensing and the Radiological Protection (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2014. It also provides for the establishment of contingency plans and quality assurance measures by the RPII, updates fines specified in the 1991 Act and amends the definition of ionising radiation. As we know there are no nuclear power plants in Ireland but we need to ensure we comply with all international and national best practice relating to nuclear research on other islands. There are many radioactive substances, and certain substances used in medicine, while highly radioactive in some cases, are not nuclear materials. While Ireland is not a nuclear country, we have nuclear and radiological protection legislation in place, as every country has to have, principally in the form of the Radiological Protection Act 1991, as amended. With both agencies being merged, as the Minister of State has said it will not lose any of its importance. Obviously the funding that was in both agencies will be transferred to the merged agency. The accounts will need to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas within six months and a report from both agencies is to be provided to the Minister within 12 months. We will obviously need to keep an eye out when they are laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas because sometimes things get laid and while we get notification through the Order Paper, it is up to us to keep an eye out. I acknowledge the work and expertise of the staff of the institute and commend them on what they have been doing in the many years since it was established to protect citizens from the harmful effects of ionising radiation. They have many other responsibilities too numerous to outline in detail. Radiation can occur in the environment, our homes, educational facilities, and industrial and commercial areas. Radiation can be utilised in positive ways, as we know from X-rays and other medical applications which are essential in everyday life. At the same time, it is important that we know and recognise the risks of radiation to the general population and human health. That is why it is most important for State agencies - either individual or merged - to ensure they do their duty. The State agencies are there to licence and monitor the use of radiation in the health sector, industry and commerce, and education. Part 2 makes provision for the dissolution of the board and as the Minister of State has said a lot about that, I will not go into it again. Section 9 outlines provisions relating to liability for loss arising before the dissolution day which is a very important part from the aspect of the Comptroller and Auditor General. All accounts are to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. In the transfer of staff we always ensure that the rights, duties and obligations will transfer from the individual agency to the merged agency.  The Department published an initial regulatory impact assessment for the aspects of the Bill relating to the ratification of the CPPNMNF - it is nearly easier to say it in its long form. Following publication of the initial RIA, there was a consultation phase. A final RIA was anticipated after responses to the consultation were reviewed. I just looked at the website and there were no submissions received from the public consultation phase and the RIA as drafted was left as it was. This will also benefit Ireland by helping to reduce the risk of criminal or terrorist activity and ensure we all feel safer in travel, in homes in our country, and in other jurisdictions we deal with. The International Atomic Energy Agency has appealed to all members to ratify the amendment as soon as possible. As Ireland has been consistently supportive of any improvements to international nuclear security, by not ratifying the amendment, our position would be contradicted and our international negotiating power in future nuclear safety discussions could be diminished. Other countries will have to look into ratification of the amendment and see how long down the road it will be. Even though it is not part of the Bill another aspect of environmental protection that is a very important responsibility of the RPII is naturally occurring radon. It is an issue close to my heart. It occurs naturally all around us, but is most prevalent in the south east. I have heard recent reports that indicate we have the highest incidence in Europe. We know there is work to be done on that. I congratulate the RPII on the work it has been doing in educating the public and the tests that were done and working with the local authorities there. I want to ensure and stress that this work will continue when the RPII is amalgamated into the EPA. It is a concern that has been raised with me on many occasions and, as I said, I am also doing some work on it. I welcome the strategy that was published in February. It is important and it has to be done. I am looking forward to the Minister of State outlining why it took us so long.

Both the RPII and EPA are established, well-known and autonomous organisations. Senator Keane and I are both members of the Oireachtas committee that heard evidence from various stakeholders including the chairman of the RPII, Professor Reville. There is a need for mergers and amalgamations, but I believe the Government has been overzealous at times, particularly in my own area of interest, the arts, where the amalgamation of the National Library and National Museum are inexplicably bound for merger for no other reason than perceived saving of money. I believe that certain payments are due to a member of the board of a Government organisation, particularly if that person is giving his or her own time and making available his or her expertise to that board.My sense relating to the RPII and the EPA is the merger is purely for cost reasons. There are technical issues relating to the ratification of a treaty but the aim of the merger seems to be to save around €80,000, which is roughly the cost of the fees of the chairman and directors. The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland is based in Dublin but if the Bill is passed and this merger proceeds there will be additional costs because the EPA is based in Wexford. Unless every member of the board based in Wexford is appointed there will be significant mileage costs. Was a cost-benefit analysis carried out on this merger? I can see no reason other than cost behind this merger but the saving is actually minimal. Members of this House may know I am very concerned about the possible use of nuclear energy in the current global energy crisis. As recently as March 2013, the Secretary of State at the Department of Energy and Climate Change in the UK, Ed Davey, granted a development consent in respect of a 3,268 MW nuclear power plant development at Hinkley Point, Somerset. This is around 150 miles from the densely populated east coast of Ireland. The facility will be as close to many Irish people as to UK residents. For many Irish citizens nuclear power facilities cause serious concerns regarding risk to health, the environment and the economy. Essential industries such as fishing, agriculture, food and tourism are affected. This House need not be reminded of the long-standing concerns and the documented record of accidents and discharges into the Irish Sea arising from the UK's nuclear facility at Windscale, which was rebranded as Sellafield. Relatively recent disasters at Chernobyl, Fukushima and Three Mile Island also come to mind. Despite these legitimate concerns and the pro-active stance taken by previous Irish administrations on securing access to Sellafield for Irish nuclear specialists, it appears there has been a fundamental failure in consultations between the UK and Ireland on the trans-boundary effect of the Hinkley Point development. The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, was in this House when I previously raised this issue as an adjournment matter and he said there had been consultations between the two Governments. However, there is a transboundary screening exercise report and it does not mention an EU member state regarding a possible accidental nuclear discharge. It seems the document is the reason the UK Government decided not to consult with the Irish Government and, more importantly, the Irish public. Glasgow was consulted regarding its geographical relationship with Hinkley Point in Somerset but not Dublin or Wexford. My point is that the RPII is a very important part of all this. It issued in 2013 a very detailed report on all issues relating to nuclear power and its relationship with Ireland, including the threat of nuclear discharge. Some will argue that there is a one in 33 million chance of a nuclear discharge incident at, say, Wylfa power station in Anglesey, which is only 100 km from the east coast Ireland, but the impact could be huge. People would be advised to stay indoors as much as possible during the passage of the plume, which takes between 24 and 48 hours. There would be food controls and changes in farming practices to ensure long-term radiation doses from contaminated food would not reach levels that could increase cancer risk to the population. I am not trying to use scare tactics but my argument comes back to the naming of this new organisation. The word "radiological" should be included in its name. The Minister's Department has much experience of creating names for organisations. Keeping the EPA without including the word "radiological" suggests our citizens will not feel protected and informed. It is a branding issue and Senator Keane alluded to the report issued today by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland on radiation doses received by the Irish population. If it had been published by the EPA there would have been a sense of obfuscation and people would have wondered whether it actually addressed the same topic. I will support the amendments on Committee Stage that seek to rename the new organisation as it should be simple to include words such as "radiological protection". Perhaps the EPA could be changed to the environmental and radiological protection agency, ERPA. I seek branding that will give an optical reassurance that the Government is looking after its citizens. I ask the Minister to include the word "radiological" and to examine this matter on Committee and Report Stages.

The two parts of this legislation make sense but I have some points to make. Rationalisation can make sense not only in terms of costs but by bringing organisations together to improve output. I sympathise with the previous speaker on his fears as to whether this legislation could dilute the role of the RPII by merging it with the EPA. However, I am also concerned about the role of the EPA generally and I will speak on that issue later today in other business before the House. The role of the RPII is very important, especially for people in my part of the country around County Tipperary. The Minister of State will be aware that levels of radon in Tipperary are among the highest in the country. Radon detection is a very important function of the RPII as Ireland experiences up to 250 deaths each year as a result of radon and this rate is higher than average annual road deaths. More money should be spent on this issue to ensure safety and to ensure people in Tipperary and counties around the south east are not exposed to high levels of radon gas. Last week a house in Tipperary experienced radon exposure ten times the acceptable level. Last year some 1,200 homes around the country were tested and it was found that 25 houses experienced radon gas at ten times the acceptable level. Such work would not be possible were it not for the RPII. It is important to ensure that this work continues and that it increases when the RPII merges with the EPA. The Government's policy on mergers and rationalisations was trumpeted when the Government first began. As I said, many of those mergers and rationalisations were necessary to cut costs and make organisations more effective. It remains to be seen whether the merger of the RPII and the EPA will prove to make the resulting organisation more effective. Some time ago many of the functions of the EPA were carried out at local authority level.Many of them were different functions and were not carried out as well as they should have been. We did decide to set up the EPA through legislation in 1992 and we have seen how that has grown and what its role has been. I am prepared to wait and see. Those who complain about the job of the RPII being subsumed and being given less importance have a good point. It is up to the Government and the EPA to prove that it remains relevant and does not lose its identity in the bigger context of the EPA. The second part of the Bill is extremely important. It brings us into line with most other EU member states. It was lying on the shelf since 2004, as Senator Walsh said.

I commend the Minister of State for bringing this legislation forward and ensuring that we are signatories to this agreement, which moves it along the road for us. Eventually it will be signed and become an effective treaty, whereby we will have better checks and balances for nuclear energy and waste. People of Senator Mac Conghail’s vintage and my own have been concerned about this since the protest at Carnsore Point. That was a little bit after Senator Walsh’s time. We were concerned that there might be a nuclear energy plant there. In our youth we protested to ensure that it did not happen. There were whispers that a similar plant might appear in Carlow when the sugar factory closed down but that concept died fairly quickly thanks to the common sense on the part of the people of Carlow and the public representatives in the area. It is important that we play our part in ensuring that everything to do with nuclear energy and waste is policed and is kept in proper order so that we do not endanger this country or others. I look forward to both parts of the Bill passing through the House. There are several amendments tabled for Committee Stage and I expect that the Minister of State will address them fully because some of them are good amendments which need to be debated before the legislation is passed.
#RonanMullen	unknown-#RonanMullen-party	unknown-#RonanMullen-dob	unknown-#RonanMullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	233	Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit. I welcome the Minister of State and wish him a fair wind as the ship of his political career navigates the waters in the days ahead. This Bill is very welcome and, as the Minister of State has said, it does several useful and important things, it provides for the merger of the RPII and the EPA, and provides the enabling legislative framework to allow this State ratify the 2005 amendment to the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material. It is important that all the states of the EU ratify it before the EU can ratify it. It is necessary to do important work in the protection of nuclear facilities and materials and peaceful domestic use. That may not apply in this country. It also provides for extended co-operation between member states to enable measures to locate and recover stolen or smuggled nuclear material, which is a frightening thought and is important for the prevention of terrorism. There are other measures in the Bill, such as the definition of ionising radiation and so on.  Fianna Fáil, with my support, has tabled some amendments. Like others, I have received communication from the RPII. I recall hearing of its good work when in my student days I attended a lecture by its former chief executive officer, CEO, Dr. Tom O’Flaherty, who explained the phenomenon of radon, how it works and the danger it poses. In recent days we have heard from Professor William Reville. Great credit is due to him. Many people know of him through reading his excellent columns in The Irish Times. He does a very important job in making science comprehensible and accessible. That was part of his job in University College Cork. His is a voice of sanity and clarity in bringing issues to the surface. He is concerned about the name of the new merged entity and the need to make the RPII more visible. The RPII has been calling for statutory underpinning of the new office for radiological protection. Those are very reasonable issues to raise. We must take the source of these recommendations seriously, the RPII and its chairman, Professor Reville. In his briefing he tells us that the board had only minimal success in having its views incorporated into the provisions of the new Bill. It is the Government’s prerogative, backed up by the Civil Service, to prepare legislation and propose it in these Houses but I am nonetheless surprised to learn that the RPII believes its recommendations have had only minimal success. Others have talked about radon. We heard this morning that Ireland had only slightly increased levels of radiation. When we think of radiation we think of the nuclear fall-out zone but of course most radiation occurs naturally. A total of 7% comes naturally or artificially from food. Some comes from beneficial medical treatments. It is surprising to some that when we discuss lung cancer the focus is on tobacco but approximately 13% of lung cancer cases are caused by radon. There is a synergistic connection between radon gas and the incidence of lung cancer caused by tobacco smoke. Radon is a worrying phenomenon because it occurs naturally coming from the degradation of uranium far below the ground. The differential pressure between indoors and outdoors makes a build-up of noxious radon gas in houses possible. It is important to underpin the work of the RPII and its successor office within the new merged entity. As Senator Walsh pointed out there is a difference between the two roles. The RPII has worked to protect people from environmental harm while the EPA works to protect the environment from being degraded by human activities. Professor Reville, on behalf of the RPII, tells us that though the union of these entities has been described as a merger it is better characterised as an incorporation or takeover of the RPII by the EPA. I do not think that is complimentary language. When the idea of a merger between the two was first mooted the board of the RPII considered the matter and decided it was not in favour of a merger. There was already sensible co-operation and synergy between the RPII and the EPA. He says he can see no significant advantage in the proposed merger, only disadvantages, even hazards. He asks how the independent scientific advice the RPII is required to provide to Government can continue if it is to be part of a combined organisation. He does rightly acknowledge the prerogative of Government to make arrangements in these matters. Despite misgivings it has worked with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, to facilitate arrangements to ensure the administration of radiological protection will continue.  I would like to know why the RPII is reporting that it has had no more than minimal success. The two key issues it is raising are the need for the name of the new body to reflect the work of the RPII - it is proposing "environmental and radiological protection agency" as a name - and the need for statutory underpinning whereby the office of radiological protection is established in the primary legislation setting up this new body. I would like to conclude by asking the Minister about the national radon control strategy. It has been reported that the strategy recommends that vendors of houses should be required to provide information about radon levels in buildings to prospective potential purchasers. We have seen that some aspects of the new building regulations are posing unnecessary difficulties for people building or proposing to build houses on their own land using direct labour. The principle behind this proposal is the protection of future purchasers. Can the Minister of State give us an update on whether the vendors of houses are required, or will be required in the future, to provide information about radon levels to potential purchasers of their houses?
#DavidCullinane	unknown-#DavidCullinane-party	unknown-#DavidCullinane-dob	unknown-#DavidCullinane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	234	I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I hope he will not be fretting too much over the next 24 or 48 hours. I am sure he will get the call. My main knowledge of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, RPII, which this Bill proposes to merge with the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, comes from its reports on the threat posed by releases of radioactive material from the Sellafield nuclear facility into the Irish Sea. In 2009, after conducting a survey of over 500 people, the RPII issued a report which concluded that levels of radioactivity in the Irish Sea were low and did not represent a significant level of threat. That conflicts with many people's perception that radiation from Sellafield is dangerous and is responsible for cancer. A report produced by the RPII in 2002, after it was given access to the plant and allowed to conduct its own examinations, was far more critical of Sellafield. It concluded that the quantity of radioactive material held in storage tanks was so high that it would represent a severe risk to people at a far distance from the plant if an accident were to happen there. Despite its acceptance of a study that found no link between the occurrence of Down's syndrome in the Louth area and emissions from Sellafield, in 2001 the RPII insisted that Sellafield remained a danger due to the levels of radioactivity in the Irish Sea and the risk of an accident. It is clear that this State still needs to have the capacity to monitor the levels of radioactivity emanating from Sellafield. I hope this remains the case when the merger of the RPII and the EPA takes place. The need for such capacity was illustrated earlier this year when Sellafield claimed that higher levels of radioactivity around the plant were caused by naturally occurring background radon, rather than anything concerning the operation of the nuclear facility. It is clear from the past that we cannot rely on such self-monitoring and that, therefore, we need our own agency. The RPII has conducted other research into artificial and naturally occurring radioactivity. In 2008, it found that levels of exposure among Irish people were much higher than the global average. While some of that is due to the accident at Chernobyl and the proximity of Sellafield, much of it is connected to high levels of radon in the atmosphere here. The RPII has emphasised that radon continues to be an important concern and that its current work must continue when it is merged with the EPA. I note that the RPII is opposed to being amalgamated with the EPA. Perhaps the Minister of State might address that point. Its chief concern appears to be that radiological protection will not have the same priority. I understand it is requesting that a reference to its functions should be included in the EPA's name. It also wants the radiological protection office within the EPA to have a statutory basis or footing. I welcome section 12 of the Bill, which provides that all the staff of the RPII will be transferred to the EPA with the same pay and terms of employment. I hope the RPII's concerns regarding the need for a continued focus on the importance of monitoring any radiological threat will be noted. Section 23 states that "radiological protection expertise" will be a consideration in the appointment of directors of the EPA. Perhaps that should be amended to provide that at least one of the five directors of the EPA, as expanded by section 21 of this Bill, will be someone with this kind of expertise and background. The same thing applies to the provision in section 25 for appointments to the EPA advisory committee, which should also contain someone with such expertise. It appears that an office of radiological protection is to be established within the EPA. The RPII is concerned that the functions of this office might change over the course of time. For that reason, it would like it to be established under this Bill to ensure it will concentrate solely on issues which have been the responsibility of the RPII until now. One of the RPII's priorities has been the monitoring of natural radioactivity caused by radon. It is vital that this work continues, given the high levels of radiation detected here. As I have said, these levels are well above the international average. It is believed that this is in large part as a consequence of radon. Radon is the second highest cause of lung cancer in this country. It causes 250 deaths per year. As the RPII has pointed out, this is higher than the average number of road fatalities but nothing like the same level of importance or preventative programming is being devoted to it. On the basis of its research, the RPII advised homes and places of work on the level of risk and the measures that can be put in place to reduce that risk. It is vital that this research work continues. I would argue strongly in favour of strengthening the references in the Bill to an office dedicated within the EPA to radiological protection.

I am glad he is present. In recent times, we have seen him frequently with the hat he has been wearing. I hope we will see more of him in times to come when he is wearing another hat. He has an interest in science, as we are all aware. I have a real concern that almost every time anybody mentions anything new in science here, somebody says we must not touch it. People argue that we should not have anything to do with genetically modified organisms or hydraulic fracturing, for example. I say that in the presence of Senator Mullen, who is a strong advocate of making sure we do not have fracking even though it has solved many problems around the world. It is being pursued in Europe and the US with very few difficulties. There has been the odd difficulty. We should not knock everything. The same thing applies to nuclear energy. We should have a discussion on it. We should make sure we discuss it. The only time it is mentioned is when people are talking about Sellafield and the Irish Sea. France, which went nuclear 40 years ago, has no problems in this area now. It is not worried about oil coming from eastern countries like Ukraine and Russia because it does not need to import any oil. There have been no nuclear problems in France. I mention all of this because I know the Minister of State wears a science hat. I would love to see us becoming much more enthused about science. Given that Dublin was the city of science two years ago, this country should be setting standards and saying, "We have done things here and we can do things in the future". Why is Ireland the 27th of the 28 EU member states to ratify the 2005 amendment? While I am not blaming any person or any party when I ask that question, it seems that these Houses are very slow to get things done. As someone who comes from a different background, I wonder why it takes so long for things to happen here. I was delighted to hear Frank Aiken being mentioned this evening. He was a friend of my father. He led the way as Minister for External Affairs, as the position was known at the time. He was the first person to do many things.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	15190	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	236	I will do my best to reply in as comprehensive a fashion as I can to the various points that have been raised. It has been suggested that the potential exists for expertise to be lost as a result of this measure. I assure the House that this will not happen. All of the inspectors and scientific and administrative staff of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland will transfer to the Environmental Protection Agency. It is important to state for the record that they will continue in their current roles after the merger.In addition, arrangements have been made to provide that the chief executive officer of the RPII, Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, will become a fifth director of the EPA, Environmental Protection Agency, for a transitional period up to 30 April 2016 to ensure there is no loss of corporate memory and help radiological protection functions bed down in the newly merged organisation. The chairman should be assured on that point. All staff of the RPII will transfer to the EPA and their statutory terms and conditions of employment, pay and superannuation will be protected. For professional staff, there will be some additional benefits. For example, radiological inspectors will gain additional legal protections while undertaking bona fides duties relating to the radiological protection functions of the agency that they do not currently possesses in the EPA. There will be certain additional statutory terms and conditions under the 1992 Environmental Protection Agency Act which will apply to staff transferring there which will include the requirement to declare any relevant interests they may have and a prohibition on running for local government office while still serving as an RPII staff member. Everyone agrees on the dangers of nuclear waste and its effect on the environment. We have been implementing a radioactive material source reduction programme over the past several years which has involved several Departments and agencies. The number of sources of relevant radioactive waste has been reduced from some 3,300 to just over 100. The provision of independent scientific advice on radiological matters will still exist in law. The EPA will be obliged to provide this function. All the necessary expertise will transfer to the EPA to do so. Will this legislation allow Ireland to ratify the International Atomic Energy Agency Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material, CPPNM? The Attorney General’s office has provided comprehensive advice and instructions as to how the amendment to the CPPNM requires to be incorporated into Irish law so that we may ratify it. All of these elements either have been included in existing legislation or will be provided for by the enactment of this Bill. Other aspects to the CPPNM will be given effect after Ireland ratifies it and the amending convention comes into operation. The irony of Senator Walsh raising the point about this not being ratified between 2005 and 2011 is not lost on me. I accept the point was made in good faith.
#JimWalsh	unknown-#JimWalsh-party	unknown-#JimWalsh-dob	unknown-#JimWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	237	It is an official issue. That is why I raised it. I do not expect a Minister to be examining it but officials employed in Departments to be taking these initiatives.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	15190	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	238	I do not necessarily agree with that. Ministers have policy responsibility for their Departments. On our watch, we are moving to ratify that. Ireland signed the original amendment in 2005 and we strongly support the convention. The then Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, in consultation with the then Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Foreign Affairs, considered there was a possibility of ratifying the treaty without the need for legislation. The Attorney General then advised that legislative changes would be necessary to ratify the amendment, however. Initially, it was proposed to piggyback the CPPNM amendments on legislation from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to ratify the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism. The Department of Justice, however, decided not to proceed with this legislation at that time. The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government then commenced the process of drafting a memorandum for government with the general scheme for the legislation at the end of 2012. There was a delay of some months because we were waiting to receive observations on the memorandum. It was decided to draft the legislation to merge the EPA and the RPII because it would not have been appropriate to have two Bills going through the Houses at the same time amending the same legislation. It was decided to combine the merger Bill with that to incorporate the terms of the CPPNM. I sympathise with Senator Denis Landy’s point on the merger’s impact on the national radon control strategy. I hail from Mallow which has one of the highest incidences of radon in the country. The control strategy was prepared by an interagency group and published in February this year, setting out 48 recommendations with the ultimate aim of reducing the number of radon-related lung cancer cases from 250 per annum. Successful implementation of the strategy will require action from a range of Departments, public bodies and other stakeholders. A co-ordination group, chaired by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, has been established to monitor implementation of the strategy which will report annually on progress. In 2018, at the end of the four years covered by the action plan, it will make recommendations to the Government on what further actions it considers necessary. The comprehensive action plan which is being implemented will not be adversely affected by this merger. I understand Senator Cáit Keane is preparing a Bill to implement the recommendations of the national radon control strategy and has been in contact with the Minister in this respect. Senator Mac Conghail raised the RPII’s monitoring of UK nuclear power plants. There is a mechanism by which we monitor Sellafield which this legislation will not change. He also referred to other specific nuclear sites and their proximity to Ireland which the Government should also monitor. There are open-ended engagements with the UK Government on all nuclear-related matters which the Department has worked on in recent years. This will continue and the merger of the two bodies will in no way lessen the high level of scrutiny applied to the Sellafield issue. A visit by the Department, EPA and RPII representatives to the Sellafield site is being arranged. Whether it can be expanded to include other sites can be discussed at another stage. The aim of the Government’s agency rationalisation programme is to reduce the number of State bodies while integrating their roles and responsibilities with those of other existing bodies. There is no intention whatsoever to diminish the functions or role of either agency. Any reasonable assessment of this legislation will acknowledge that. It is envisaged that there would be costs savings of up to €260,000 per annum from 2016 onwards while there are other savings in the intervening period in staff efficiencies of €100,000 per annum. Further workforce planning, including a review of structures, roles and responsibilities, will be completed later this year.That will further clarify and identify future needs and capacities as well as scope for further efficiencies.

In particular I thank my colleagues in the Seanad and those from the Independent Taoiseach's nominees group who have facilitated the early taking of the motion. I was keen for the matter to be dealt with prior to the Houses rising for the summer recess. I am grateful and pleased to see the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, taking the motion. I commend the Minister, in the spirit of the motion, as set out, on his tremendous work, much of which has yet to be fully appreciated. However, I believe it will be in the fullness of time. I was pleased three years ago when the Minister, Deputy Hogan, indicated his intention not to marginalise the green issue or the environmental issue, but to mainstream, embed and embody them in Government legislation and policy. I believe he has achieved that to a great extent. I am not in any way being frivolous and I say it with affection as the Minister knows. I wish him well in his future endeavours, whatever they may be and wherever they take him. He is affectionately known around the Houses as "big Phil". I hope he performs better and succeeds better than big Phil did last night in the World Cup. Whatever the future holds for him this week I hope it does not come to a penalty shootout or any other kind of shootout as he pursues his ambitions and endeavours. Wherever they take him I am sure he will represent the people of the country well in whatever fashion that arises. We have come a long way from the time that the country was an embarrassment in the sense of the number of plastic bags strewn up and down our highways and in our hedgerows. Much of this comes from a change of public perception and opinion. However, many things were left kicking around during the past 20 years. These were hot potatoes that no one wanted to touch or look at. However, the Minister, Deputy Hogan, addressed them. I commend the Minister on his work in the area of the registration of septic tanks. There are 440,000 septic tanks in the country. The Minister has taken a similar and correct approach to tackle climate change and the environmental issue. It should be done at a local level, one building block at a time. In future, the Minister will be recognised as a visionary and pioneering Minister in respect of the final establishment of an Irish water authority. There has been considerable debate about it. No one wants an extra bill in the door, especially in times of recession but, ultimately, this will prove to have been a good idea to ensure that the citizens of the State enjoy a safe, clean and secure supply of water in future. I commend the Minister, Deputy Hogan, on his efforts in this area. This approach also fits the bill in terms of the reform agenda of the Government. Instead of having multiple agencies doing the same work we rationalise and, where possible and appropriate, we reduce the number of quangos which are not accountable to the Government, the citizens or the State. We should put those powers back into agencies that are accountable to the Government of the day, with proper oversight, transparency and accountability. However, there is one significant fly in the ointment and it is in the area of the Environmental Protection Agency. When reports were brought to me initially in respect of its operation, function, oversight, inspection and enforcement, I greeted them with disbelief. It did not believe it was possible in this day and age for this to happen. I took the view that this could not be happening and that it would be an appalling vista that the watchdog, which the State and Government established to protect the public interest, public health and the environment, would not do its job in the most thorough, effective and efficient manner and in policing the environment and public health for us. I would have thought it was not possible. However, I am distressed and concerned that this is, unfortunately, the case. I do not believe the EPA as it functions is fit for purpose. It is not doing its job. It is not living up to the remit that the Minister and the Government have charged it with, that is, to protect public health and the environment from pollution. I am not referring to an accident or one-off incident or something no one could have foreseen. I am referring to systemic and systematic failures. I am not just talking about local issues. This is the case throughout the country. I have been inundated with representations from members of the community and the public who all have the same sorry tale to tell. They all maintain they are living in misery because the EPA will not come to their assistance, believe them or help them. They believe the agency categorises them and routinely dismisses them as cranks and people who do not know and are not aware of what is going on. Nowhere is this more shockingly manifest than in my home-town of Portlaoise. I raised this matter previously in April and I was hopeful that at that stage when we put it on the public record the EPA would be stung into action. On the contrary, unfortunately, the agency is still in denial. I say as much with reluctance and with full consideration of the seriousness of the charges I am making. There is nothing I would say in the House that I am unwilling to repeat outside the House. While I am no scientist, environmental scientist, chemist or physicist I know people who are damned good ones and the data are staring us in the face.The evidence is staring the EPA in the face. It is aware of high levels of concentration of unlicensed, unregulated emissions from the industrial oil recycling plant in Portlaoise, Enva Ireland Limited, which is owned by a wealthy and profitable publicly quoted company, DCC. This is not a small time operation but a huge plant which operates on an international level. I am sorry to say it is emitting harmful toxins such as benzene, toluene and volatile organic compounds into the atmosphere on an weekly basis. This is not acceptable in this day and age. We have at our disposal best available technology and systems that could prevent this from happening and could stop it in the morning if there was a willingness by the EPA to enforce and implement the standards and by the company to invest in this technology and these standards. The company is on record as saying to the EPA that it is not willing to spend the money as public health is not worth the investment. We have suffered in this country due to poor regulation, light touch regulation and lax regulation. By turning a blind eye, we know what happened in the area of child protection, in the area of financial services and the banking sector and in the charities sector. Will it take another tribunal, another "Prime Time Investigates", to expose the ineptitude of the EPA before we are stung into action? As public representatives we cannot turn a blind eye when information is brought to our attention. It is our duty and responsibility to protect public health and the public interest. Having appointed a watchdog, we thought we could sleep easy in our beds and that it would do its job, but we now have to second-guess whether it is doing its job.  I ask the Minister to take on board our concerns and representations. I know the Minister is a good and honourable man and will not allow this to continue. While the EPA has been established as an independent body, that does not mean it is not answerable to anybody or that it is not accountable. It must be held to account. I ask that we investigate what is happening in Portlaoise and the conduct of the EPA because it is no longer acceptable.

In my town of Carrick-on-Suir and in many other towns there were open dumps, as they were known, landfills, while raw sewerage was running into the River Suir and there was no air quality monitoring. We also had the beginning of the famous Hanrahan v. Merck Sharp and Dohme case which finished ten years later in the Supreme Court in which Mr. Hanrahan, who lives three miles from my home, won a very important judgment against the US company. That set the scene and was the backdrop to the setting up of the EPA. The EPA was established in 1992 under the Environmental Protection Agency Act. It was strengthened by the Waste Management Act 1996 and by the Protection of the Environment Act 2003. It was mandated to protect the environment, monitor changes in the environment, and detect early warning signs of neglect and deterioration. It was the body that was supposed to police local authorities and industry on behalf of the Irish citizen. Its primary functions were to licence, enforce, oversee environmental planning, monitor, analyse and report. It was also charged with environmental research and waste management control and it was supposed to carry out these functions without fear or favour. Management of air quality is a major issue. Up to that time, municipal waste and commercial waste was disposed of in landfills across the country without any monitoring. Since 1992, the EPA has been responsible for this monitoring. How successful has it been in monitoring air quality, water quality and landfill? While local authorities still have control and have functions regarding landfill, air and other areas, the EPA is the overarching body. In 2013, the EPA, as the national agency for the protection of air, water and landfill, undertook 11 prosecutions in three counties in areas such as waste discharge, landfill and other waste areas. All of these prosecutions were against local authorities; none was against industry or commercial entities. The local authority, as per the 1992 Act, must have regard to the instructions of the EPA and the EPA can instruct local authorities to carry out certain functions. How much of this is being done? Section 54 of the 1992 Act provides for the Minister to transfer any role or function from the local authority to the EPA. This has been done in many instances, as the Minister is aware, such as in the area of waste management. In view of what has been outlined by Senator John Whelan, I ask the Minister whether it is time to reverse this provision and give these functions back to local authorities who have local accountability through locally elected representatives so that the people on the ground can feel safe. The 2002 programme for Government set up an office of enforcement to establish an audit performance system for local authorities. Who is auditing the performance of the EPA? In my opinion, nobody is doing so, and for that reason we do not know whether it is doing a good, bad or indifferent job.  I return to Hanrahan v. Merck Sharp and Dohme, the outcome of which was that John Hanrahan won the case in the Supreme Court. The outcome for the area where I live in south Tipperary was that we have a better environment and 350 jobs in Merck Sharp and Dohme, which is an excellent employer in the area and one of the biggest drivers of the economy. Therefore, industry and the environment can live hand in hand but the policing body is not doing its job. I support Senator John Whelan. If the EPA does not do the job properly, should it be in place?

One thing that is certain is that the Minister will be an EU Commissioner. I do not know who should be worried more, the people of Europe or himself, but that remains to be seen.The reason I have tabled this amendment is because what really is needed is the implementation and delivery of the climate change Bill. While this was a commitment in the programme for Government, it still has not been implemented and three years into the Government's term of office, Members still await the Bill.

The heads of the Bill do not in themselves constitute a Bill and I will outline why I am concerned that although the Government may not see its full term, even if it does, less than two years remains to it. Consequently, I am concerned that even at this stage, the heads of a Bill do not in themselves constitute a Bill. The importance and urgency of having an actual Bill pertain to the following points. First, a climate change Bill would, by implication, be obliged to set targets. Second, it would be necessary to have public engagement with NGOs and interested parties on various aspects of the Bill. Obviously, there also would be a need to have some sort of report. Therefore, much work remains to be done before Members get to a Bill. Climate change continues to be an ongoing issue both in Ireland and on a global level. In Ireland, the damaging impact of global warming has been seen all too frequently in respect of increased rainfall and of severe flooding, which extracts a huge cost from society in both human suffering and the monetary cost to local authorities and the State. This was seen most recently a few months ago, when there was severe flooding in many parts of the country, including County Waterford and some parts of the Minister's native County Kilkenny. The effects of climate change can be seen globally and felt locally, from floods in the cities and towns to rain-sodden fields of corn and to do nothing simply is not an option. The issue of climate change must be addressed and the implementation of a climate change Bill is required urgently, not simply the publication of the heads of a Bill. This is essential for economic growth, for protection of the environment and for global environmental justice. A climate change Bill is needed that is both robust and has specific targets regarding emissions that are monitored by an independent body. As the Minister is aware, in 2013 Sinn Féin introduced such a Bill in the Dáil. This Bill was based on an updated and modified version of a climate change Bill that was published by a sub-group of the Oireachtas environment committee composed of current Government Ministers, of whom I believe the Minister was one. The Sinn Féin Bill was not introduced in a partisan manner but rather its aim was to offer a blueprint in an attempt to spur the Government into action.

The Minister could have taken the Bill and perfected it, if he thought it had problems or faults. The Minister is very good at finding fault but Sinn Féin would have been open to any amendments tabled by the Government. As the Minister is aware, Sinn Féin was seeking the implementation of a climate change Bill. As I stated, the Sinn Féin Bill is a redraft of a Bill produced by the climate change sub-committee in 2010, which was supported by the Fine Gael and Labour parties when they were in opposition. Consequently, there is no reason these parties cannot still support this Bill while in government. Sinn Féin's Climate Change Bill is comprehensive and could be the cornerstone for Ireland's low-carbon sustainable economic growth. It will give much needed certainty for industry and potential investors, particularly in the development of the green economy. Had the Bill been passed, key actions would have been taken, one of which would have been the introduction of five-year carbon budgets. This is not a monetary budget but a limit set on the total amount of emissions that are allowed over the five-year period. This would have assisted in the management of Ireland's reduction of carbon emissions. A carbon budget would hold consecutive Governments to account. The Taoiseach of the day would be obliged to present this budget to the Dáil each year and would be open to questioning and scrutiny, which would have achieved greater transparency and accountability. It also contained a science-based target for 2050, namely, a reduction in emissions of 80% by 2050 compared with a 1990 baseline. The Sinn Féin Bill would also have led to the establishment of a climate change commission. This would be independent of the Government, would prepare an assessment of the potential impact on the State of climate change and would review on an annual basis the progress made. It would advise An Taoiseach on steps to be taken to meet agreed targets. If the Governments policy of "hear no evil, see no evil" remains in place, it will have serious implications for Ireland and the wider global community. Sinn Féin's Bill had the potential to change all that and consequently, the Government must support such a Bill. It must stop playing silly politics and silly games on this serious issue and there must be delivery on what was a commitment in the programme for Government. It is clear that the Minister, Deputy Hogan, will not be the Minister who will be implementing a climate change Bill. Whoever the incoming Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government may be, I hope he or she perceives this issue to be a priority. If that is the case and if the new Minister brings such a Bill before the Dáil and the Seanad, it will have Sinn Féin's full support. I will conclude by again wishing the Minister well in his new endeavour.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	262	First, I thank Senator Whelan and his colleagues for this timely motion, as well as for their kind words on the work my Department has carried out over the past three years and which has been completed successfully. This praise of course must be shared more widely. I believe the links between environmentally-beneficial policies, sustainable growth and job creation are recognised centrally by the entire Government, which makes my role in environmentally-proofing Government policy that much easier. I note, for example, the Delivering our Green Potential document, which sets out Government policy on growth and employment in the green economy in Ireland. This document was published in November 2012 and aims to embed the green growth agenda across the relevant policy areas. The Government recognises that the green economy presents a major economic opportunity for sustainable employment creation in Ireland. Ireland has significant strengths and advantages, which it can leverage to exploit business opportunities in major international sectors such as renewable energy, smart grids, sustainable food, tourism and energy-efficient products and services, as well as environmental opportunities for developing a sustainable, low-carbon society. Ireland also recognised the importance of the green economy issue in its medium-term economic strategy, which applies now that we have exited the EU-IMF bailout. This recognition is combined with a co-ordinated approach applicable to the green economy that involves all relevant Departments and agencies. The development of the green economy is overseen by the Cabinet committee on climate change and the green economy, which is chaired by the Taoiseach. That same committee provides the same oversight and guidance with regards to the progress of measures contained in the framework document for sustainable development in Ireland, Our Sustainable Future. As the benefits of greening economic and social policy are centrally recognised, it follows that my Department is given and takes the opportunity to participate as an active partner in all the major economic and social policy initiatives, recent examples of which include national transport and tourism policy and a sustainable education strategy. The ability to demonstrate that environmental policies are contributing positively to economic reform and growth can of course only strengthen our message. I also wish to tell Senator Cullinane that the Government will enact a climate change Bill this year. I am pleased by the progress made this year on the heads of the Bill and on all the consultation that has taken place. The Government will be considering the publication of this Bill in the autumn, with a view to having it enacted by the end of the year. I will now turn to other particular aspects of environmental policy. Waste policy is a key environmental concern and in this respect, the Government published its policy in July 2012 entitled A Resource Opportunity. The policy provides a roadmap on how Ireland will move away from over-dependence on landfill by putting in place the most appropriate technologies and approaches to reduce waste, while at the same time maximising the resources that we can recover from waste. The policy document, A Resource Opportunity, contains a commitment to complete a review of the respective regulatory and enforcement roles of the Environmental Protection Agency and local authorities by the end of 2013. This review was completed earlier this year. It recommends providing for the transfer of a number of existing waste enforcement functions currently discharged by local authorities to three regional waste enforcement teams or regional lead authorities. The City and County Management Association will shortly designate the lead authorities for purposes of waste enforcement functions, which is in line with what Senator Landy mentioned during his contribution. The specific enforcement functions to be carried out by the lead authorities generally will be those targeting waste enforcement matters that cross local authority functional areas or that have particular security risks attached for enforcement staff. The lead authorities also would have responsibility for developing regional enforcement plans that would take account of national enforcement priorities and for ensuring that local authority waste enforcement plans take the regional enforcement plans into account, such as those pertaining to cross-Border movements of illegally-laundered diesel in particular. In addition, as envisaged by A Resource Opportunity, a national team or national steering group also would be established with a focus on organised and serious criminal activity in the waste area and on supporting the work of the lead authorities. I am confident this will clearly support the achievement of consistency of approach to waste enforcement generally across different authorities.It will also help with the prioritisation across local and regional level authority areas and counter the perception of a lack of coherence in regard to the treatment of waste streams and would deliver efficiency gains in terms of getting the most out of the available funding. In addition, this structure would also clearly recognise the need to maintain boots on the ground at a local level as an immediate first wave response to the bulk of activities that would be subject to enforcement action. This would also facilitate the lead authorities becoming centres of excellence for enforcement functions in specific waste streams, for example, in end-of-life vehicles, WEEE, tyres, etc. Roll-out of the new structures will commence in the second half of 2014 with a view to going live in early 2015. The EPA will play a pivotal role in implementing the waste policy. A key aspect of ensuring adequate waste policy is the EPA's environmental licensing programme. This helps to protect the environment by regulating integrated pollution prevention and control, IPPC, activities. These include waste, fuel storage, municipal wastewater discharge, extractive waste, GMO and dumping at sea undertakings in a manner that is risk based, proportionate and in keeping with the principles of better regulation. The environmental licensing programme in this context is responsible for a range of tasks which could have an impact on the environment. In addition to licence application assessment, the environmental licensing programme also undertakes a broad spectrum of licensing work which includes pre-application discussion with potential applicants, article 11 inquiries, article 27 notifications on by-product status, article 28 notification of end-of-waste status, being statutorily consulted on developments that require environmental impact assessment, foreshore licensing, appropriate assessment, BREF development, regulatory design, licence transfers, and licence review requests. These activities are undertaken by the technical staff of the environmental licensing programme. Typically, the EPA receives approximately 15 new IPPC applications per year, 20 IPPC review applications per year, ten new waste applications per year, 15 waste review applications per year, 20 GMO applications per year, and five dumping at sea applications per year. As mentioned in the motion, it is the EPA's mission "To protect and improve the natural environment for present and future generations, taking into account the environmental, social and economic principles of sustainable development." At this stage, I wish to refer to what Senator Whelan raised in his contribution. I checked the matter because I expected him to raise it. I understand one complainant has expressed very serious concerns about emissions to air from four oil reprocessing tanks in Portlaoise. The EPA considers that these are adequately controlled under the conditions of the licence as the emissions are not pumped and have a very low flow rate. However, in response to the complainant's concerns, the EPA has undertaken extensive further assessments. The information gathered to date from these assessments does not indicate that these emissions are of significance. However, the investigation is continuing. I note the serious concerns expressed by Senator Whelan and I will take an interest in this matter. I will ask the EPA to carry out a very detailed investigation and to provide a report to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government on this matter. The report will then be made available to the public.  I urge Senator Whelan and others who believe they have evidence of any collusion in regard to these matters to report such evidence to the appropriate authority - the Garda Síochána. The Senator has raised serious matters and it would be remiss of me not to express the hope that we have, without fear or favour, an independent agency, the Environmental Protection Agency, which operates to the highest standards in terms of environmental sustainability and in the interests of public health and the environment. Since its establishment, the agency has been at the coalface of environmental protection and policing and it is important the work it is doing in carrying out this role is done to the highest possible standards. In addition to its vital regulatory role, the EPA is actively engaged in awareness raising and education and regularly organises national workshops, conferences and public lectures as well as providing a wealth of information on its website in regard to its activities. It is also strongly committed to aiding businesses and organisations, through funding from the environmental fund, to grow a sustainable and resource efficient way to reduce waste. In recent years, the agency has also increased the reach and depth of the EPA BeGreen resource efficiency programmes. The EPA has provided €300,000 in grant aid to businesses through the cleaner greener production programme, which is an example of the various initiatives being undertaken. Reinforcing the cross-governmental nature of environmental policy, the agency has an input in its advocacy role for the environment, including, the Action Plan for Jobs and the policy statement, Delivering our Green Potential, both produced by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation; the Department of Health's Your Health is Your Wealth policy framework; the NESC's climate change review; the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine's Food Harvest 2020 strategy; and numerous reviews from my own Department, including the recent announcement I made about smoky coal regulations and building regulations. The agency's submissions highlight the importance of a good quality environment to the health and well-being of the nation and to economic recovery. In recognition of the interaction between health and the environment, the EPA established in 2012 a health advisory committee under section 41 of the EPA Act to advise the agency in the carrying out of its functions. This will allow for a more structured, formalised and proactive interaction between the EPA and other authorities, in particular those with a public health remit. Topics discussed at recent meetings include health assessment, licensing and a health research programme. This committee arose from a recommendation of the EPA review, which I asked to be carried out a number of years ago. The report of the committee was published in May 2011 and contained 58 recommendations across a number of different themes, such as governance, resources and licensing. As Members may be aware, the review was carried out by an independent group. The purpose of the review was to assess the performance of the EPA, its scope and mandate and to examine whether the agency has the optimum structure and governance arrangements in place to continue to deliver its objectives effectively, in particular in view of its expanding role and additional functions. The review found that the EPA has provided "considerable benefit for Ireland's environment and for the health and well-being of its people" since the foundation of the agency, but nevertheless it certainly made a lot of recommendations. On foot of the recommendations made in the review, the EPA, in conjunction with the Department, agreed on a plan to implement the various recommendations. A number of these have been implemented while others will continue to be progressed. I would like to draw Members' attention to some priority actions which have been implemented already, including the establishment of an additional specialist advisory committee to address the interface between the environment and human health, which may be of assistance to Senator Whelan on the issues he raised in regard to emissions; greater access to environmental information for the public, in particular a dedicated web resource to complement the report, Ireland's Environment 2012: An Assessment; enhancement of air quality data mapping - the EPA developed a new air quality index for health and launched it in 2013, the European Year of Air; and to continue and extend progressively the process of making enforcement information available on the Internet. Since 2012 the EPA has placed all historical monitoring data from 2000 onwards on the EPA website. The agency also publishes every public drinking water supply audit online and works with local authorities to ensure up-to-date monitoring data and the details of any quality breaches are placed on their websites. The Department has been in contact with the EPA in regard to its update of the priority actions identified for completion. The agency submitted an update on the actions in May 2013 and I will ask for further details on whatever recommendations have been implemented in the meantime. The Department intends to publish a progress report on the implementation of the review when finalised shortly. The number of staff in the EPA has decreased from 340 at the end of 2009 to 310 at the end of 2013 while at the same time, the level of statutory responsibilities assigned to the EPA has increased exponentially since its formation in 1992. For example, in 2012, the agency was involved in issues such as having a supervisory role in implementing the provisions of the Water Services (Amendment) Act 2012, helping Ireland to address the European Court of Justice judgment against Ireland, and reference was made to this. When I became Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, there were 31 European Court of Justice judgments against Ireland and they are now down to eight. We have enlisted the support of a lot of specialist people, including the EPA. The EPA got a good deal for Ireland in the negotiations with the European Commission on the septic tank and groundwater quality issue. Some of the staff have developed an expertise which has been very beneficial in regard to the water framework directive, which did not impose too much, as was mentioned by speakers, on the Irish citizen. It made sure the registration process was successful and that the solution found to be compliant with the European Court of Justice judgment was not too much of an imposition on the public. The strategic plan for 2013 to 2015, Working with Others for a Better Environment, was published early in 2013 and is the fourth formal strategy since the EPA was established in 1993. It specifies nine strategic priorities for the EPA across its core functions of environmental regulation, knowledge and advocacy. The agency has developed a new EPA research programme for 2014 to 2020, further to the completion of STRIVE in 2013. The new programme consists of three pillar areas, namely, climate change research, water research and sustainable environment research. I wish to reiterate that the EPA is an independent public body established under the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992. I authorised a review to be carried out and a significant number of recommendations - 58 in total - were made following that review.They are in the course of being implemented. I am anxious to meet not only the spirit but the actuality of the issues that have been raised in this debate about openness, transparency and accountability for all organisations. The EPA review recognised the value of independence which is well provided for in the legislation. There are other legislative measures regarding the EPA and the radiological protection agency going through the Houses. If Members feel accountability should be strengthened for an agency, particularly the EPA and the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, I am sure the Government will be glad to look at the matter. I am of the belief that we need an independent professional organisation that is able to deal, without fear or favour, with the environmental protection and public health issues of the day. I hope we can make the necessary changes and implement the recommendations in the EPA that will assure people that has happened. I note the serious comments made by Senator Whelan, in particular, and I will seek a detailed report on the issues he raised.

A debate, or consideration, on the protection of the environment must be welcomed. Too often, the topic is seen as peripheral in nature in parliamentary debates. The people who express concerns for the environment are very often misrepresented as some type of loony hippy from the 1960s but nothing could be further from the truth. They are pragmatic people. A report compiled by the fifth International Panel on Climate Change left us in no doubt about the serious challenges facing us and is a wake-up call, but whether we hear it remains to be seen. If we do not put protection of the environment central in all our thinking, we have a serious problem facing us down the road. I have head unfavourable comments about the EPA and perhaps they are true. Part of its weakness is a lack of legislative framework, particularly when one considers the relationship between the EPA and An Bord Pleanála. We can all point to cases from personal experience and wonder how these things happen given the concerns that have been expressed in this debate. I do not think any of us, and I mean that in a non-partisan way, should acquiesce in any kind of congratulatory comments on what has been done to date. That does not mean that a certain amount has not been done, but it is infinitesimally small when compared with what remains to be done. Let us look outside the shores of Ireland to America, in particular, and the manner in which it has dragged its heels despite all the efforts being made in other countries. America dragged its heels when it came to a doing anything proactive to ensure our environment would not be destroyed. This life and environment are only on lease to us and will be passed on to the next generations. Based on the reports, backed by scientific evidence, we are not certain what we will pass to the second, third and fourth generations into the future. There is a degree of selfishness involved. It is like drinking the well dry while not caring what the future holds. In this particular case we can see the results of climate change. For instance, on television we can see tsunamis, flooding and all the other things that happen in the world, particularly the number of crisis areas, which must leave us in no doubt that they are related to climate change. To some extent, we have seen its effects in a more moderate way in this country. If that is where we have come from and where we are now, the question is how serious we are about tackling the problem. We set out a stall that 2050 would be our goal and there would be no doubt whatsoever that our goals and commitments would be leading up to 2050. However, we have not had sufficient courage as of yet, and I do not say that in a partisan way. None of us has had sufficient courage to put down a marker from here to 2050. If we do not do so it will not just be ourselves who will be damaged. The people who suffer the most from climate change are the poorest countries in the world, the countries that are least resourced in almost genocidal proportions. At times we can expound in a profound way about human rights, etc. but we do not avail of an opportunity to do something about climate change. I hope future debates are held sooner rather than later, but I hope this debate will lead us to realise that we need partnership and not partisanship on this subject. Both sides of this House and both sides of the Dáil need to agree that this is one area where we must all work together with a sense of urgency and courage, where we would put down the markers leading up to 2050, but above all else that Ireland would use its position in Europe to ensure Europe does not fall behind in its responsibilities and requirements. We have a long journey to go. We need to admit to ourselves that we have failed dismally, not on the smaller issues, but on the bigger issues. Sometimes one must confront vested interests when dealing with a subject like the environment and its protection. I wish the Minister well in whatever role he has in the future. I would much prefer to see a partnership on this subject which to me is one of the most important challenges facing humanity and humankind.

As was said, we must wake up to the problem. The Minister has been, and has been shown to be, very courageous and wide awake. He went into the Department with his eyes wide open and his actions have demonstrated courage. He could never be accused of not being courageous. He has been a very courageous Minister who took a stand where necessary and on issues where other Governments failed. Today we are talking about the climate change Bill. Before I became a Senator I looked at things from the outside and had great faith and hope that something would be done about climate change, particularly as the Minister at the time was John Gormley. Perhaps he got an anaesthetic and slept during his watch. However, I commend and compliment the current Minister, Deputy Hogan, on his assurances. I am a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht. The committee worked on the heads of the climate change Bill and the policies and made recommendations. I will comment further on the matter but I could not resist replying to Senator Ó Murchú's remark about going to sleep. The earth is our only home which we share with seven billion people and, therefore, we must mind it, protect it and ensure it is protected. The Environmental Protection Agency and the RPII, which it was agreed today will merge with the EPA, are charged with protecting the environment.I have great confidence they will do so. Environmental issues, whether ozone depletion, greenhouse effect, global climate change, environmental pollution, the green economy, biodiversity reduction are all important elements on which we must ensure that positive steps are taken to protect our environment. The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan has been very positive in ensuring that our environment is protected. Thanks to his achievements in the Department, environmental policy is no longer a niche or peripheral area but has become mainstream Government policy in recent times. This is very progressive and shows that as a society and a Government we have evolved and recognise the importance of conservation and environmental protection. The Minister has had to implement many reforms that were not popular and were criticised. It took courage to implement them, particularly to work on the EU recommendations. When he took office he was faced with 32 infringements of EU law and he has reduced that number to eight. He did not say how much money that saved the country. Had the infringements been allowed to continue, the Government would be out of pocket by €12 million annually. If we had to continue to pay that €12 million, as had been paid prior to Deputy Hogan becoming Minister, the country would be in a sorry state. By ensuring the environmental infringements were corrected on his watch he has addressed the significant financial implications this had for the country. They have been reduced to eight and the Minister is still working, and may be in the Department long enough, to get the number down to zero. The Minister referred to Delivering our Green Potential and the waste policy document A Resource Opportunity. That contains a commitment to complete a review of the respective regulatory and enforcement roles of the Environmental Protection Agency and the local authorities. This review was completed in early 2014, just a couple of months ago. I am aware that 91 submissions were received in response to the consultation document. Ireland is performing well in EU terms on the issue of recycling and is meeting the majority of the annual targets. The rates of household recycling in Ireland have increased dramatically since the late 1990s. The EPA is the agency with overall responsibility for environmental protection in the State and it monitors the rates of recycling as well as other areas, that were referred to earlier. Repak is the principal organisation for recycling. Ireland, at 79%, has the second highest rate of recycling, just behind Germany. That is an achievement that those involved in recycling can be proud of. We rarely hear about the positive stories, because that does not make news. The concept of best available techniques, BAT, was introduced as a key principle in the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control, IPPC, Directive. The Minister alluded to this in his speech so I will not elaborate except to say that this policy is being implemented. The EPA is bound to ensure that modern technologies are used in testing and other work. The general scheme of the heads of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill, together with the national policy position on climate action and low carbon, were released on 23 April 2014. I do not know whether the Senator who said that no action was taken and that it was only the heads of a Bill was aware of all the work of the Joint Committee of the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht on the Bill and I wonder if he was asleep when its report was released just two months ago. As the Minister said, the work has been done and the Bill will be ready at the end of the year. The national policy position on the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill has progressed the national low carbon transition agenda, national policy position and the general scheme which are parallel and complimentary pillars. The Environmental Protection Agency is fundamental to achieving a sustainable environment for the future and regulation enforcement and ensures the public and commercial-----

I will refer in this regard to what the EPA did about the case in Portlaoise.

I know this is not his swan-song because he is probably going on to greater things, but he can look back at the past three and a half years of great success. The Minister was present to hear the contributions by Senators Whelan and Landy. Senator Whelan spoke with such vigour, courage and concern about the experiences he has had. Senator Landy spoke about his experience with the Hanrahan farm in his area. It is a reminder of what those who are close to these things have to do and also of their concern about the EPA. I wish to raise hydraulic fracturing, or fracking as it is called and the use of shale gas. This issue has a potential interplay with the quality of water, something the EPA will continue to monitor alongside Irish Water. What is the EPA doing in this regard? Is it conducting studies on the environmental impact of fracking? I would like to see it do more so that we can come to a decision on whether we go ahead with fracking. As in many other areas, the Government simply commissions studies and then nothing is done. Correct me if I am wrong but given the political implications of fracking, it is clear that some politicians are even afraid to say the word, "fracking". I am not for or against it per se but I believe we should have a debate and a decision should be made on that basis. Look at the fact that other countries are racing ahead in this area. It has the potential to create perhaps up to 100,000 jobs and drastically reduce our reliance on foreign energy. The use of fracking in the United States has drastically reduced energy bills for businesses and for households. If that was replicated here it would be a massive boost for our economy. We have not had a discussion on fracking, so I urge the Minister to do something about it. The EU Energy Commissioner - I do not know what job the Minister will have if he goes to Europe - was quoted last year as saying that energy Ministers recognise that the boom in shale gas extraction in the United States is a game-changer, which has had knock-on effects in all areas of energy. He said that EU member states are open to shale gas and the European Commission will accompany this process by overseeing the environmental concerns through water legislation. I believe that this is something that needs to be done. If the Minister goes to Europe I hope he finds that whatever job he has, he will be able to influence this area because the answer to future challenges in regard to energy rests with us.
#SeanDBarrett	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	272	I welcome the Minister and I give him my best wishes in all fields of endeavour. One of the things I noted about environmental scientists in TCD, which I liked, was men and women wearing Wellingtons as they headed off to do the work in the field. I was surprised to read in the EPA report that the site visits to establish air emissions are carried out by external contractors. Why do the people we appoint not put on their Wellingtons and go out and do the work rather than contract others to do it? When one reads on further in the report, one sees that the sites are monitored only once a year.A lot more data will be required in order to do this. While a few sites consistently breach their licences, 75% to 80% are fully compliant. We accept between 20% and 25% non-compliance and let somebody else do the work. Out of the budget of €57 million I want to see people doing it themselves. In respect of the Portlaoise case on which Senator Whelan spoke so eloquently, one of the complainants is another State company. It is not a case of environmentalists seeking to make life miserable for people in Leinster House or for Ministers. There is a complaint that the groundwater near this Enva oil boiling premises is at 1,000 times the EPA limit for groundwater wells. The response is that there are no wells within 5 km of the facility in Portlaoise. I dispute that. I do not know of any place in Ireland that is 5 km away from wells. That has to be independently monitored. I would like to see independent monitors go out from each regional technical college or universities, at the Minister’s request. If the watchdog is not barking, Parliament has to get somebody to bark at, or instead of, the watchdog. More independence in the monitoring sector is needed. In respect of air, 19% of licensed sites had an EU exceedance of some type. The visits occur only once a year. We need more frequent monitoring of everything, including roads and safety. In respect of the Portlaoise case there must be some independent monitoring. There is undoubtedly a difference of opinion between those who spoke to Senator Whelan and what has been reported to us. It is no harm that every agency faces checks, balances and scrutiny, as we have always said. For the €57 million we need some urgent answers and inspections more frequently than once a year. The people in the organisation that we pay to do the job need to do it. I wish the Minister well and I am glad to hear that the climate change Bill will be introduced, even if the Minister will not be here to present it.

I compliment my colleagues, Senators Landy and Whelan on bringing up this issue. It is very important and in some of the cases cited the issues are very serious. It is quite amazing that the EPA does not seem to have the power to insist on higher standards for the protection of people’s health. The Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA shut down the accident and emergency department in Roscommon hospital because it was not safe enough. We are not asking for that here. We want the EPA to insist on higher standards to be put in place in this plant in Portlaoise. Years ago, in my own town of Ballaghaderreen, there was a problem with a landfill site that was too close to people’s homes. There were regular methane emissions from it. The locals were getting sick. They went through serious pain and suffering. The county council denied for years that there were any emissions. The EPA came in but all it did was log the complaint and said that it would deal with it. It had to be pushed kicking and screaming to go to court and fine the county council €1,200 or €1,400 and continue as normal. Many people have serious reservations about the independence of the EPA. It is there to protect the people, not local authorities or big businesses, as in the Portlaoise case. Senator Quinn mentioned fracking. I have not heard any Minister say we will not progress with fracking in this country. The best response we can get is that there will be an EPA report. No matter how many reports on fracking are commissioned, nobody will definitively prove that once a drill is stuck in the ground, which drills for hundreds of metres, water will not be contaminated. There are also problems associated with pylons and wind turbines. Senators Whelan, Landy and I have raised this issue over the past three years. The EPA has done nothing to protect people from these problems. The message seems to be job creation at any cost. The EPA is supposedly an oversight body but we need another body to oversee it because An Bord Pleanála and the EPA are playing ball with one another and An Bord Pleanála is not independent. Many agencies are set up to protect people’s health but jobs seem to come first and health second.

I support Senator Whelan and his colleagues on this motion. When I read the documentation he provided it sowed a seed of doubt in my mind about the adequacy of the current oversight arrangements. The Minister’s commitment to an investigation is appropriate. This should be an opportunity for concerned citizens and their public representatives to make submissions. I have got into trouble before for stating things I believe to be true, such as that the Chernobyl disaster had far fewer health consequences than is generally assumed in the lay press. No increased incidence of congenital malformations has ever been verifiably attributed to the Chernobyl disaster, with the exception of the sad occurrence of thyroid cancer which undoubtedly affected children in the area. There has been no evidence of a long late cancer causation associated with the disaster. That does not mean that there are not environmental consequences from chemical, radiological and other emissions. There have been many huge disasters caused by regulatory failures. One of the classic examples was Minimata Bay in Japan where the poisoning of water by mercury from an industrial plant, which went undetected until it was too late, resulted in a colossal environmental disaster, with many people getting mercury poisoning, dying, being crippled or suffering irreversible brain damage. As a result of appropriate environmental regulation, we now limit the use of materials such as asbestos, benzene and other hydrocarbons. These regulations are based on good science, not on some kind of fluffy bunny-hugging, Luddite, anti-industrial policy. There is sound science, medicine and epidemiology behind them all. The concerns about specific chemicals associated with hydrocarbon disposal are very real. It may well be that there are adequate processes in place for the supervision of the safe disposal of these products but the contention as advanced that it is not adequate is plausible and requires full evaluation and I urge an appropriate, health-only focused investigation, taking into account the data presented by Senator Whelan. With respect to the other issue, to say I was troubled would be too strong but a tiny bit of unction arose when I read the text of the Minister’s reply with its heavy emphasis on job creation, troikas etc. Being concerned about the environment does not make one unpatriotic, unconcerned about economics or jobs, but if we store up real health disasters now, we will have to pay for them later. There is an appropriate balance. All of these decisions need to be based on good science, medicine, epidemiology and public health. Let us get this one right.

I would like to include Shannon in this because in that area we have had experience of dealing with the EPA and Enva.In 2002, the seed bed for the waste water at the Schwarz Pharma plant in Shannon was not working. It took between a year and a half and two years to convince the EPA that this was the problem. The company repeatedly denied it. After it was proven in court, the company was fined €200,000 by a judge, while still denying it was the cause of the problem. During that whole period, the EPA was a disaster in my opinion. I do not think anything has changed since then. Last year, I attended a meeting at which the horrendous smell that caused a serious problem in Shannon for the last couple of years was discussed. The smell was coming from the treatment plant, but I have always asked what was going into the treatment plant to cause the problem. There are 350 inadequate treatment plants around the country, but they do not all cause such a smell. We received figures from Enva in Shannon last year. These figures are on the public record. In 2005, Enva dumped 10,000 liquid tonnes of leachate, which is the run-off from Gortadroma dump and a dump in south Galway, into the Shannon treatment system. That figure was 6,000 tonnes in 2008, but by 2012 it had increased to 25,000 tonnes. The figure was 17,000 tonnes last year. The EPA will try to tell us the leachate is not the cause of the problem because it is treated in the plant. The problem with this kind of self-monitoring system is that when one calls to give two weeks' notice of one's intention to call out, one can be sure the boys will have the figures well doctored by the time one gets there. I absolutely believe the dumping of this leachate into the treatment plant in Shannon was the cause of our smell. I have no doubt in the wide earthly world that this is the case. I have asked Irish Water to investigate the matter. The problem is that this thick black liquid substance - one can imagine the run-off from a septic tank or a silage pit - stays in the system. I attended a meeting last year at the invitation of the local town council. An EPA official, Mr. Peter Cunningham, was in attendance. I do not mind putting his name on the record because he wrote this letter. One of the three council officials in attendance was the council chemist, who is a super lady. This top-class woman has tried her best over the years to break down the walls of the EPA and many other groups. During the course of the meeting, approximately ten minutes into the presentation, I asked a simple question. I wanted to know whether the council officials were happy that the EPA was telling us the truth. There are two answers one could give in response to that question - "Yes" or "No". There was stunned silence before the council official, in fairness to her, said "No, I am not happy that we are being told the truth". Therein lies the problem. There is literally no contact with the local authority in any of the regions unless the EPA is dragged pulling and screaming into making contact. The same EPA that licensed the Shannon treatment plant in 2006, and said it could not take any more effluent, subsequently licensed Enva to dump extra material into the system. In fact, some 200,000 tonnes have gone into the system since that time. I acknowledge that the Minister, Deputy Hogan, gave us €4 million for the upgrade of the Shannon treatment plant. While I thank him for that money, he might as well throw it out into the car park as long as those boys are putting that volume of stuff into the system because it cannot work in such circumstances. Other towns around the country that have treatment plants which take in the normal domestic effluent - some of them have industrial stuff going in as well - do not smell like the town of Shannon smelled when it was reeking for months on end. The problem was particularly bad in the summer, when the stuff in the system heated up. The smell traversed the whole town because the Smithstown industrial estate is on the north side of the town and the treatment plant is 5 km away on the south side of the town. The EPA says it trusts the companies that are self-monitoring, but I do not trust them at all. Having seen the EPA in action, I know what it has done. It constantly uses phrases like "we did it right" and "we got it right" as a defence. When I asked EPA officials whether it is possible that the leachate could be contributing to the smell, they said it could be but they could not say for definite. Surely the tonnage of stuff that is going through a normal treatment system - this is not happening in any other town - must be contributing to the smell. While I missed the earlier part of the debate, unfortunately, I would agree with everything Senator Whelan has said. I am asking for an independent investigation into the leachate that is going out of Enva and into the Shannon treatment system. I have put Irish Water, which trusts the figures it is given by the EPA, on notice that this needs to be investigated properly before a new treatment plant is built and this is allowed to continue. The local authority officials need to have actual teeth with the EPA. When there is an issue, council officials should be able to go in and investigate these sites at short notice. This should be done jointly with the EPA so that the agency cannot take the "I'm all right Jack" attitude all the time. The EPA often says "you could not be right, you are just county council officials, what would you know?". Four years ago, some 300 m of the pipe network was wiped out when nitric acid was put into the system. This is the kind of dodgy stuff that is going on. There is a lot of stuff on these sites. I would say we have had six or seven issues with two companies in Shannon, Enva and Chemifloc. There was an explosion two years ago. This goes far beyond this great agency, which is very arrogant when it is questioned. Its officials do not like having to answer questions. Senator Whelan found that out directly when he asked certain questions. I would like investigations to be carried out in Portlaoise and Shannon. The common denominators here are Enva and the EPA. The same company and the same agency are involved. Nobody is going to tell me there is no problem. I am living in the problem.

Senator Whelan spoke very well earlier. Nothing is more important than the environment, and the protection of the environment, for the future of our country and its citizens. Everyone who has spoken - we have heard a rainbow of speeches - seems to have a similar story about the EPA. I would like to refer briefly to my story, which comes from the beginning of my research. Coincidentally, in light of Senator Whelan's motion, I met some people from Askeaton, County Limerick, in recent days. New evidence has emerged to suggest that a report carried out by the EPA into sickness among animals and humans in Askeaton since the early 1980s was seriously flawed. I wish I could join Senator Landy in talking about the wonderful victory that was achieved some years ago. I come from the same area. I live right across the river from Merck Sharp & Dohme. This is not a story of a wonderful victory, however. The EPA has written a report on the Askeaton case. Reports have been authored by many other bodies, including Teagasc. According to a report by Adrienne Murphy, a journalist who has investigated this case:It is impossible to say that the authors of these reports deliberately got it wrong. But the effect, in my view, was that they covered up the industrial poisoning of a community on the basis of the evidence I have analysed .... The Aughinish Alumina plant is a huge aluminium processing plant, located beside the farmland of Askeaton. Waste streams are discharged from this plant, which are stored in ‘open waste lagoons’ directly adjacent to the farms. Aughinish’s Annual Environmental Reports (AER), which are on public record and were therefore accessible to the EPA, document that some of their waste streams contain fluoride as a contaminant at concentrations of up to 9,000mg/k. According to Declan Waugh, the Irish scientist who has been researching the dangers of fluoride [Senators will be familiar with him] this makes the Aughinish waste lagoons not just the biggest single source of fluoride pollution in the country but also one of the most fluoride-contaminated sites in the world. The prevailing wind blows right across these lagoons towards the area of Askeaton.Animals in the area have died and have had miscarriages. Ladies have had miscarriages at the same time. Farmers have had to sell up and move to Tipperary. There is a farmer still there whose farm is useless. I will not read any more of this long report by Adrienne Murphy other than to record her assertion that "what is utterly shocking in the context is that the EPA - the acronym stands for Environmental Protection Agency - apparently made a conscious decision not to investigate the possibility of fluoride pollution in the area, citing the 'absence' of industrial sources of fluoride in the area as its justification". I intend to drop a note down to the Minister, Deputy Hogan, about this matter. These people need help. Senator Whelan has thankfully brought the EPA to account this evening. This is another example of an area in Ireland that needs to be properly investigated. The citizens need to be assisted in this regard.

I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on these important environmental matters. I commend my colleagues, Senators Whelan and Landy, for putting forward this motion with the support of all of us in the Labour Party group. I thank the Minister, Deputy Hogan, for the speech he made earlier, which was a comprehensive response to the issues raised in the motion.

Other speakers have focused on different aspects of the motion, but I would like to comment on the fourth paragraph of it.The motion “commends the Minister for the particular efforts he has made at all times to mainstream green-environmental policies and legislation and, in particular, to advance the climate change Bill”. We have also commended the policy in the programme for Government for environmental protection, as well as the Minister and the Department for their commitment to the use of recycling, resource-efficiencies and so on. Climate change is a significant issue and the biggest challenge facing us internationally. It is creating environmental catastrophes across the world with floods becoming more frequent in some parts while in others, droughts occur. Developing countries are worst hit by climate change, which we know from being an international aid donor, while developed countries produce most greenhouse emissions. It is important that countries like ours are early adopters of legislation to take action to reduce our emissions. That is why I welcome the commitment in the programme for Government to take legislative action in this area. In 2007, when I was first elected to the Seanad as an Independent, I introduced a Private Members’ Bill, the Climate Protection Bill 2007, with Friends of the Earth Ireland, which would have signed us up to binding emission-reduction targets. The then Fianna Fáil-Green Party Government had a commitment to similar legislation but, unfortunately, it was unable to agree the text of a Bill. I commend the Minister, Deputy Phil Hogan, for the progress he has made in this regard. It is significant the heads of a climate action and low-carbon development Bill were unveiled on 23 April, following long consultations with different stakeholders with a huge input from the relevant Oireachtas committee. Earlier versions of the planned legislation were criticised by quite a number of environmental groups. There were also critiques of these heads produced in April for containing no specific medium-term or long-term targets for the key dates of 2030 and 2050. It is accepted, however, the Bill commits Ireland to meeting international climate change targets which has been welcomed by IBEC, the Irish Business and Employers Confederation, the IFA, Irish Farmers Association, and environmental groups which have asked for specific changes. The Government has clearly set out that there will be a binding commitment to EU and UN climate change targets for between now and 2050. This legislation will, accordingly, tie the State to an unequivocal commitment to future and present obligations. The Bill has been described as more robust than previous versions. The Minister will be required to produce a national low-carbon roadmap every five years rather than every seven. The other major change is the enhancement and strengthening of the role of the expert advisory body. Under the heads, its membership will be increased to as many as 11 and its role will be analogous to that of the fiscal advisory committee. It will make recommendations to the Minister on compliance with every relevant climate-related obligation of the State under EU and other international agreements. The fiscal council is required to publish reports within ten days of giving them to the Minister whereas the expert body on climate change will not have to publish its reports until between 30 and 90 days. Friends of the Earth Ireland has argued if this relatively minor provision could be changed, it would create greater transparency around public debate on climate change policy. The heads of the Bill do not include global climate justice as a principle to be considered, despite the fact the Government has spoken in support of initiatives taken by Mary Robinson in this area. A strengthened Bill would provide for that. The Bill should also deal with some sectorial inputs to the national roadmap. I note the Oireachtas environment committee recommended drawing up the national roadmap before the sectorial ones. The draft heads of the Bill do away with the sectorial roadmaps, leaving just the national one. Ultimately, there are several changes that could be made to the final draft of the Bill which would strengthen the level of environmental protection it can offer and our commitments in the programme for Government. It would be worth doing this to prove we are early adopters and serious about tackling climate change. The critical point is that a climate change Bill will be published and enacted during this Government's tenure. Despite all the consultations, failure to deliver this type of Bill was ultimately the big failure of the previous Government. I hope our Bill will be published in the summer and introduced, hopefully, in the Seanad rather than the Dáil in the next term.

Maith thú for the excellent job you have done so far as the Minister of State with responsibility for the Gaeltacht and I hope you will continue in this role. I commend the Labour Party Senators, in particular Senators John Whelan and Denis Landy, for tabling this motion and their contributions earlier. I also want to give a warm welcome to Pat and Nuala Geoghegan from Askeaton, County Limerick, to the House, a welcome which has not been extended to them by many State agencies. They, along with many other families in the area, have lived in the shadow of the Aughinish Alumina plant there for many years. There has often been an omerta among public representatives when it comes to the pollution emanating from the plant. While there is a tacit acknowledgment by public representatives that pollution and poisoning has been taking place in County Limerick for many years, many of them have been afraid to speak out about it because of the implied threat to jobs in the area. I want jobs in my county as too many of my friends and relatives are living abroad. I do not want the health of people who voted for me, as well as those who never voted and who may never vote for me, to be put in jeopardy because of the need for jobs, however. Pat Geoghegan and the Irish Environmental Forum have fought tirelessly to bring the issues of harmful toxic emissions from Aughinish Alumina and elsewhere to the public arena. Along with others in the Askeaton area, they have maintained a very dignified, well-researched and well-documented campaign since 1997. In that year, the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, began an investigation which took four years and cost £5 million, a bizarre length of time and cost for such an investigation. While the investigation was ongoing, the EPA granted an integrated pollution control licence to Aughinish Alumina, a point made in a Hot Press article. I also challenge the mainstream media to look more into this matter. It seems investigative journalists do not want to touch this area. There is a sense in Askeaton of a massive State cover-up of the industrial poisoning occurring in the area.This raises serious issues of a conflict of interest. The question needs to be asked as to who is policing the police. I will reference another example given by the Irish Environmental Forum regarding a complaint made to a Dr. Kelly about polluting premises which had an integrated pollution prevention and control, IPPC, licence. Dr. Kelly passed on the complaint for investigation. The reply showed the person who investigated the matter was the same inspector who recommended the known polluter for an IPPC licence ten years earlier, and the same person who supervised the premises for years as it continued to pollute and destroy the environment. This is not good enough. It is unacceptable. An outside investigator or independent ombudsman should be appointed to investigate possible breaches of the licence. Section 15 of the Environment Protection Act 1992 Act states:No action or other proceedings shall lie or be maintainable against the Agency or any body referred to in section 44 or 45 for the recovery of damages in respect of any injury to persons, damage to property or other loss alleged to have been caused or contributed to by a failure to perform or to comply with any of the functions conferred on the said Agency or body.What is the EPA afraid of? If it is carrying out its role properly and investigating matters properly, why is there a need for immunity from prosecution? One of the Minister's predecessors, John Gormley, asked for a review of this. This review was done and the report, which issued in May 2011, stated the EPA blanket statutory immunity when carrying out its functions is difficult to justify in a modern context and should be revised. I believe it should be abolished. I challenge the Government to live up to commitments made in the programme for Government to provide an ombudsman for all statutory bodies. This is the gauntlet I lay down to the Minister and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government. Get rid of the immunity. Why be afraid? Proper powers should be given to an outside body to investigate what are serious breaches of regulations.

It is stirring and heartening that we can agree on matters of such national importance for all our citizens. I thank all colleagues for their contributions and support. I say to the EPA that we in this House will not relent until we have satisfaction, resolution and solutions to the issues we have raised this evening. We are not just going through the motions. We will stick with this until we have a result and resolution for the families who trust us and have asked us to help. I am extremely grateful to the Minister, Deputy Hogan, for his courteous, comprehensive and considered contribution. He is open-minded. I am glad he confirmed an ongoing investigation is taking place into the situation in Portlaoise regarding Enva, and that he has asked the EPA for a report on the matter. He has also confirmed he is open to accepting contributions and submissions from Oireachtas Members and others who may have evidence or data to submit. The report and investigation will be all the more thorough, comprehensive and credible if it accepts independent and verifiable scientific data. Our case is not based on frivolous grounds but substantive data. I take exception to one remark with regard to the EPA to which the Minister referred. It was suggested I go to the police if I have a problem. I do have a problem, but with regard to environment and pollution, the EPA is the police. I have gone to the police who have turned a blind eye. It is a good job the Garda does not police in the same way as the EPA does. If the Garda was to enforce regulations in the same way as the EPA, it would notify everyone in advance where the speeding or drink-driving inspection roadblock would be, would only carry out inspections once a year on a particular stretch of road; and when one was stopped, one would be asked whether one was drinking or speeding, to which one would answer one did not believe so, and one would be told that is grand and whatever one thinks oneself. This is how the EPA conducts regulation, inspection and monitoring. Self-regulation is not regulation. We are foursquare behind the climate change legislation which the Government committed to introducing this year. Climate change starts here. We cannot save the planet unless we get our own house in order. Dealing with climate change starts when we clean up our own act. I am looking forward to further engagement with the Minister on this issue and with the EPA. This saga continues.

The small areas policing programme, which has been in operation in Dublin for five years, has had considerable success. The programme reconnects An Garda Síochána, whose mission statement is to serve and protect, with the communities. The programme has been very successful in reducing petty crime, making people feel safe in their homes, and giving them assurances that the members of An Garda Síochána not only know them but work to protect them. For decades, whether in urban or rural areas, everybody knew their local gardaí because they lived primarily in the communities. Many members of the force lived in the stations. There was always a garda living in most Garda stations. As that was phased out they lived within the community but, unfortunately, the police service has become more upwardly mobile with members living outside their jurisdiction and commuting to work. That is not the fault of any member of An Garda Síochána; it is just modern living. There was a time when teachers, gardaí and doctors lived in their parishes. That is no longer the case but it is not as essential for teachers or those in other professions to have as much of a knowledge of the area in which they work as it is for gardaí. This excellent programme has had remarkable success. A recent newspaper article applauded the gardaí. Unfortunately, the Garda has been a much maligned organisation recently but under the surface, so to speak, its members are doing remarkably good work. I would like this programme to be rolled out nationally, starting with it being piloted in each county. It would be an excellent initiative in my county of Clare, for example, that would empower what is already a fantastic Garda force in County Clare by giving it the task of reconnecting in a direct way with the communities. It would work very well if it was formalised, particularly in cities such as Limerick, Cork, Galway and others. Taking a professional approach that sees the programme being part of policing policy would enhance community policing and give the general public a renewed sense of pride, engagement and opportunity in that they would believe the gardaí know them. We often hear it said, rightly or wrongly, that people no longer know the gardaí in their communities. With resources that have been cut to the bone the members of the force have done their best but a programme such as this one, which is well resourced and funded, could be a significant step forward in terms of partnership between An Garda Síochána and our communities.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	284	I thank Senator Conway for raising this matter. I appreciate the concerns raised and his highlighting of this programme. The House will be aware that the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, throughout the Garda organisation. This allocation of resources is constantly monitored by the Commissioner and her senior management team in the context of demographics, crime trends, policing needs and other operational strategies in place on a district, divisional and regional level. That is done to ensure optimum use is made of Garda resources. The small areas policing programme being developed within the Dublin metropolitan region is a community policing areas project. Aspects of it will be familiar to the Senator. Aspects of it are already in place throughout the country but this is a comprehensive programme. It sees the Dublin metropolitan region being divided into a series of community policing areas, known as CPAs, with a view to allocating responsibility for a specific geographical area to a team of nominated community gardaí. These community policing areas are in line with the Central Statistics Office's small area populations, electoral areas and Garda district and sub-district boundaries. There are no additional costs associated with this project. It is effectively a reorganisation. The particular project the Senator has raised is in its infancy but a good deal of work has been done to ensure we get a better and more efficient Garda response in local areas to the particular policing challenges identified in local communities. It is very much about highlighting the need to work with local communities, which is essential for effective local community policing. It is being rolled out in the north inner city in particular and includes the following: liaising closely with the community; providing a consistent community policing service to that particular area; working with stakeholders in the area; the creation of a stakeholder database within the CPA; identifying areas that require particular attention; identifying local community groups; and identifying the particular demographics and issues in that area.  Each community policing team is responsible for all policing within their assigned areas, including the monitoring of crime trends. That monitoring is done through youth diversion programmes, for example, and it is important to have that kind of data, identify what is happening in an area, intervene and work with the different groups, whether it is groups of young people or local business people, in a particular area. As the Senator is aware, we are implementing a comprehensive programme of justice and policing reform. I have already said that the spectrum of issues that must be addressed is complex and deep-rooted, not just relating to high-level issues such as oversight, change management and the role of whistleblowers but also to matters of basic policing, and a number of basic policing issues were identified in the Guerin report, and local administration that need attention. I am pleased with this new community-based approach to policing. It is an important development in fostering engagement between local communities and the gardaí in targeting the concerns of local residents. We hear constantly that people want their concerns responded to by local gardaí, and it is a cost effective approach. The Government is very supportive of this new initiative and approach to policing. This particular model is at an early stage, although many elements of it are in operation in different communities throughout Ireland. We will see how this precise model works before we could consider extending it.We should explore the scope of extending the small area policing plan to other priority areas. I will have discussions with the acting Garda Commissioner on the development of the model and how it could be rolled out. It is a progressive model, it is what local residents want and has the potential to deal with crime and decrease the instance of crime in particular areas.

I tabled the motion following concerns expressed to me by library staff in County Leitrim due to a recommendation by the shared services workforce planning group established in January. It was tasked with examining workforce planning requirements and guidelines for the public library service and to develop a framework for the regional resource network. Decisions have been made but once again Country Leitrim has suffered due to its low population base which was not taken into account by the shared service organisational structure. In fact, three levels of urban centres were identified the lowest of which had a population of over 5,000. Carrick-on-Shannon, the largest town in the county, does not have 5,000 people although it is close to the figure. As a result the new shared service structure means the merger of library services in Sligo, Leitrim and Roscommon.  From a Leitrim perspective, a problem arose with comments made in the executive summary of the public library strategy. It mentioned that the overall impact of applying the guidelines differs for each library service in terms of the variation between current or projected senior staff totals. Also, for library services with greater than average numbers of staff exceeding the projected staff complement, the application of a transition phase will enable the rationalisation of numbers. It also mentioned that the implementation working group will ensure that the programmes of Opportunities for All are implemented as quickly and as effectively as possible and that senior staff structures are realised as soon as possible; the ongoing impact on the library service arising from the considerable number of current vacancies at city county librarian status is expedited; and the momentum of the shared services and workforce planning exercise continued. However, none of that seems to have happened and that is the reason I raised this matter on the Adjournment. There has been no county librarian in Leitrim since the retirement of Seán Ó Súilleabháin some years ago and the acting chief librarian retired some time back which means the library service is headed up by an acting senior executive. The county has nine branch libraries which is the largest number of branch libraries in the proposed merger even though Leitrim has suffered from a drop in population. I am interested to learn what the Minister's thinking is on the matter, where the new library service headquarters will be located and how the process will work. More importantly, I want him to give an assurance to the staff of Leitrim County Library that their jobs are protected and all the issues related to the merger are clarified sooner rather than later.

Its recommendations include a review of the library service organisation and delivery in order to establish more effective and efficient public libraries in the context of local government reform and shared services. A strategic working group was established by the libraries development committee of the Local Government Management Agency to facilitate the review and identified the need to create an appropriate scale to deliver a modern library service. Overall, the strategic working group's review found that in order for the public library service to be in a position to maximise service delivery opportunities and achieve best outcomes in terms of effectiveness, efficiency and customer service, the current structures of organisations, workforce and service delivery are in need of some reform. The review also determined that efficiencies could be achieved through a shared services approach to the delivery of library services in line with other existing and newly-formed shared service models in local government. In order to achieve this the working group determined the following: some new shared services structures should be established for library authorities; a proposed minimum population target of 100,000 would be an appropriate basis for determining a library shared services structure which would be in line with the Local Government Efficiency Review Report 2010; and shared services structures for affiliated cities and counties should also be established to deliver a single management structure with consequent resource efficiencies; that in order to implement the proposed minimum population standards six new shared service structures would be required, creating a total of 22 library services; and all authorities with populations under 100,000 should be realigned to provide new structures serving a population in excess of 100,000. The latter applies to Sligo, Roscommon and Leitrim. The working group is continuing its deliberations and is in the process of consulting with all stakeholders. No decisions have been made on the new structures or mechanisms for new reorganised library services. However, these will be based on change management best practice and minimising disruption to staff having regard to logistics and national policy agreements. The working group is also recommending that the library service will continue to maintain local branding. The overall objective of the reorganised services is to enhance further the excellent service that the library service provides to the public and to provide the scale to enable more opportunities for growth and development. Efficiencies are being pursued in the management of library services. I can confirm that there will be no diminution of the services provided. The Opportunities for All strategy identified the good work being done by all those involved, including the staff, in the library service despite challenges and difficulties and identified that an excellent community service is being delivered on the ground.

However, there was one nugget of good news in the third last paragraph. My question was specifically about the uncertainty among the library staff in Leitrim who are concerned about their future and the future of the library service. The Minister has gone some way in reassuring us about the continuation of the service provided by the library. However, he only mentioned that the working group will continue its deliberations on staffing arrangements. Most of the other elements of his response are more or less the same as what I put on record and his response took a lot from the executive summary. I appreciate that he can only operate within what he knows. It seems to me that the working group's deliberations have not yet arrived on his desk. Can he give me a timeline for it? Since January there has been uncertainty but that situation should not be allowed to continue. There must be a timeline provided. Perhaps he will give some indication about it that I could pass on to staff. In his response he could reassure the library staff in Leitrim about their future.

Let me give the fire service as an example. In Carlow-Kilkenny, Longford-Westmeath, Laois-Offaly or Sligo-Leitrim there is no need to have the higher paid echelons of staff structures in place. We want people to give a service to the general public on a day-to-day basis, we want to keep the services open and to maintain the opening hours. Local government efficiency requires us to do so in the interest of the public. If the working group does its work properly, in consultation with staff and their representatives, I have no doubt it will work out a very good solution that will provide a good service, and a continued good service in places like Leitrim, but equally to minimise the disruption to staff in the process.

I tabled a short question on the construction of a service area between exits 2 and 3 on the M9 motorway. The matter is of huge concern to local inhabitants. They are worried about the damage it may cause to their thriving businesses located near the motorway. In previous years the roads budget has been cut. The Minister was under extreme pressure to address safety and accident blackspots but he has done a super job of maintaining the motorways and roads.Dublin to Waterford as a one hour 55 minute journey. From Kill to the proposed location of the motorway service station is a 22 minute journey, Kill being the last service station. I drive that way most evenings. Simple questions asked of me every day in the local are what is it costing, why not locate it halfway down the motorway?

As Minister for transport I have responsibility for overall funding in regard to the national roads programme. The construction, improvement and maintenance of individual national roads, including service areas, is a matter for the National Roads Authority under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2007 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned. In particular, section 54 of the Roads Act 1993 specifically provides for the National Roads Authority or a local authority to provide and-or operate service areas. In 2005, the then Minister for Transport asked the NRA to review its policy of not providing service areas on national roads, particularly on the expanding network of access-controlled motorways and dual carriageways. Arising from this review, the NRA decided to proceed with a programme to provide service areas across the major inter-urban network. The imperative to have service areas on the network arises as a result of a number of factors, including the EU working time directives which contain specific requirements for permissible driving and rest times for professional drivers, including hauliers; the significant road safety benefits of rest areas for other road users; and the trans European network for transport regulation, TEN-T policy. Much of our national road network is part of the THN-T network, and the regulations include specific requirements for parking and rest facilities on the core road network. In October 2007, the NRA published its initial policy on the provision of service areas which incorporated a map showing indicative locations. In light of the funding constraints that emerged, the NRA scaled back on the development of service areas. At present, there are NRA service areas at three locations on the network. Two are located on the Ml, at Lusk and Castlehellingham on the way to Belfast, and one is on the Galway road at Enfield. All three of these service areas provide a high range of services, including parking, fuel and restaurant facilities. The current NRA service areas that are in operation were developed as PPP projects. Overall, the NRA has indicated a high level of public satisfaction with these service areas. A second group of three service areas is currently under development. The one at Gorey is at construction stage as part of the N11 PPP scheme. The NRA has initiated advance works and advises that costs to date for the development of the service area on the M9 at Kilcullen are of the order of €2 million. I understand that the PPP tender to finance, build and operate this set of service areas is well advanced with good interest from the private sector. These service areas, which are located on one side with an overbridge, are due to be in operation at some stage between now and 2017. In light of developments at EU level, including the TEN-T regulations, the NRA published a revised draft policy document entitled NRA Service Areas on the National Road Network. This document sets out the background to the existing NRA motorway service area policy, the legal context, plans for future needs, proposed locations and so on. Members of the public, interested groups and industry were invited to review the document and participate in the public consultation process. The needs analysis carried out by the authority determined an objective of locating online NRA service areas approximately every 45 to 60 km along the motorway and high quality dual carriageways which, in my view, is much more frequent than is required. In addition, the road safety strategy sets out the need for a total of five additional service areas, to be provided by 2020. That is more in line with my thinking. It is acknowledged that the revised motorway service area policy is a long-term plan and the full programme of proposed locations would involve a very substantial commitment at a time of severe budget constraints. The purpose of the public consultation was, therefore, to seek views, examine options and allow interested groups to submit suggestions and proposals. The public consultation process was managed by the NRA and the closing date for receipt of responses was 23 June. I understand that more than 20 submissions were received which will now be reviewed. My officials expect to meet with the NRA in the coming weeks to discuss the feedback from the public consultation. As I indicated in response to a Topical Issues debate raised by my colleague Deputy Martin Heydon in the Dáil on 12 June, I hope that private sector operators and developers have taken the opportunity presented by the public consultation process to indicate very clearly what they could offer, whether online or offline services, therefore saving taxpayers money. As regards the M9, Dublin-Waterford motorway, a service area is needed. One can almost drive the entire length of the motorway without finding anywhere to stop for petrol or to take a break. Originally, there were to be two service areas, one at one third of the way along the route, at Kilcullen and one at about two thirds of the way along the route, at Paulstown, which is probably how the NRA came up with the location. Had there been a plan just for one, a location closer to the halfway point between Dublin and Waterford would have been chosen but that decision was made a long time ago.

I am aware I am almost asking the Minister to micro-manage his response because he kindly met me and some of the local representatives. As he said, it is sad that the NRA feels the frustration due to budget constraints. The distance between Kill and the Kilcullen service station is 23 km while the entire distance is 163 km, therefore it is on the close side. As the Minister said it was decided a long time ago and we will have to live with it. On the positive side, it will bring many jobs to the local area.
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-07-09 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	294	I welcome the Minister. The matter I seek to raise is a follow-up to a presentation made by the Irish Pharmacy Union at a recent meeting of the joint committee. It concerns a new medicine service. This applies to people who have a long-term illness but have been prescribed a particular new medication. It has found that people who experience complications are reluctant to go back to their GPs. Pharmacists are offering to provide a follow-up service where the person could come back to the pharmacy within a three to five day period, to ensure that the medication prescribed is working and that they do not have difficulties with it, and if difficulties arise they will be dealt with at an early stage. As the Minister is aware, there is a complaint about medication being prescribed and not being properly used. When this happens with older people, there is a need for a direct connection between the pharmacist and those who have prescribed the medicine. The Irish Pharmacy Union is talking about providing this service as a follow-up service which would be put in place once the person has been prescribed the medication.

I refer to the current approach underpinning the delivery of community pharmacy services in Ireland. The supply of prescribed medicinal products to eligible persons by community pharmacists is governed by the terms of the 2007 community pharmacy contractor agreement. Clause 9 of the agreement provides that prior to dispensing a prescription, a community pharmacy contractor must ensure that a pharmacist reviews the medicine therapy of the individual for whom the prescription is issued. The review shall include screening for any potential drug therapy problems which may arise out of the use of the medicines prescribed, including therapeutic duplication; drug-drug interactions, including serious interactions with non-prescription or over-the-counter medicines or food; incorrect dosage or duration of drug treatment; drug allergy interactions; and clinical abuse and-or misuse. The review shall also include an examination of the rational and cost effective use of the medicine prescribed, including the choice of the medicine and the potential for wastage. Following the completion of the review the pharmacist shall offer to discuss with the individual for whom the prescription was issued all such matters as the pharmacist, in the exercise of his or her professional judgment deems significant, including any special directions and precautions for correct preparation, administration and use of the medicines; the importance of compliance and the directions for use; any common severe side-effects and adverse reactions or interactions and therapeutic contra-indications that may be encountered, including their avoidance and the action required should they occur; techniques for self-monitoring during therapy and the need for patient compliance; prescription repeat information, as necessary; and, as necessary, any other matters which may be included or referred to in the patient information leaflet supplied with the medicine. The existing community pharmacy contractor agreement, therefore, provides that pharmacists deliver a comprehensive ongoing support service to their patients in terms of ensuring they are fully informed of all issues pertaining to their prescription medicines. However, as Senators will be aware, the Government has embarked on a major reform programme for the health system, the aim of which is to deliver a single-tier health service, supported by universal health insurance, where access is based on need, not on ability to pay. Implementation of the Future Health: A Strategic Framework for Reform of the Health Service 2012-2015 document is a priority for Government in this context. Delivering on the Government's goals in primary care will impact on primary care health professionals, including community pharmacists. As part of implementation of Future Health, pharmacists will be expected to identify and contribute to implementing evidence-based and cost-effective solutions to ensure the effectiveness and sustainability of the healthcare system, by addressing key medication issues such as medicines wastage, inappropriate usage of medicines, supporting and improving chronic disease management and patient adherence to medication. The Minister for Health looks forward to working closely with pharmacists who will have an important role to play in delivering on the goals of Future Health.

The reply deals with the obligation on pharmacists to discuss the medication when a person calls to collect the medication. There is no obligation under the present procedure for the pharmacist to provide a follow-up service. That is what the pharmacists' union is saying. It is saying pharmacists can play a very important part in making sure the follow-up service is there and there is a provision that the person can call back to the pharmacist within a five-day period to discuss any issues that arise with the new medication. That is what pharmacists are saying is worth doing. They are referring particularly to people who are prescribed medication for the first time on which they are likely to remain into the immediate future. Pharmacists are looking for this procedure to be put in place with the HSE and that it would be a co-ordinated approach involving doctors, pharmacists and the HSE.
