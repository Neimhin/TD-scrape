The matters raised by the Senators are suitable for discussion. I have selected Senators Seery Kearney, Fitzpatrick, Chambers and Cummins and they will be taken now. The other Senators may give notice on another day of the matters that they wish to raise.

He is a very good and diligent colleague, a very hard worker for our party and was also very good to me when he was Chair of the Committee on Transport and Communications, which I commend him on. I am about to have a hissy fit and it is not personal. Deputy O'Donnell is a Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and this is a matter about families and it is under the Department of Health. It is outrageous the Department of Health saw fit to send in someone from a different Department to address what is a very serious issue for families and it also, a Chathaoirligh, shows absolute contempt to the Seanad that the Department of Health thinks such a response is all right. I completely object to that. Last December, the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, came out in a great flurry and was very well-received by the surrogacy community in Ireland for the announcement of the memo to Cabinet about the fact the Government is going to legislate for international surrogacy. Such legislation will have two elements, namely, a prospective one for babies that will be born and a retrospective one to address the babies born and families living here where the second parent in all those families has no standing in law - none - with regard to their child. If the child is more than two years old and the parent has cohabited with that child, the parent gets an opportunity to apply to the District Court for guardianship of that child. The parent does so only on the consent of the biological father of that child. If that relationship has broken down, that ends up in a very abusive, coercive situation. Irish Families Through Surrogacy and I are supporting at least ten families, predominantly women and two men, who are the second parents in these situations and are having their access to their own child limited. Thus the child may be weaponised in situations of family breakdown. There are also situations where the biological father has a terminal or very serious illness. In the event of that father's death, the child would be left with no parent in the State. I can predict the Minister of State's speech. I predict it says this is complicated, there are many amendments to come through and we are the first state to legislate for this, which is a lie, by the way. I have heard these speeches from the Department of Health a million times at this stage. It is not good enough. There are families suffering detriment because of the fact the Government is slow and not urgent about bringing forth this legislation. This week I made a very simple data subject access request in respect of my daughter concerning a very small matter. I sent in her birth certificate and stated I am her mother and am entitled to make that claim. They came back contesting that because the birth certificate is a foreign one. I had to produce the court orders to prove I am the mother of my child. That is not good enough. I should have had an Irish document that shows my parental order. My child should have an official State document that has my husband and me as her parents. As for the possibility that the relationship between myself and my husband were to break down, I am thankful we have strong marriage but I had to say as much in the email. I had to say this is a District Court order for guardianship and custody but our relationship is very sound. You end up overexplaining your personal life because the Government has dragged its heels and is making an absolute meal out of this when there should have been a level or urgency. The report of the Joint Committee on International Surrogacy was delivered last July and we are now into February. I need a timeline for when these amendments are going to get into the committee so applications can be made to the court.
#KieranODonnell	unknown-#KieranODonnell-party	unknown-#KieranODonnell-dob	unknown-#KieranODonnell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-15 00:00:00	Gnó an tSeanaid - Business of Seanad	3	I acknowledge how serious an issue this is for families. Obviously, Senator Seery Kearney has been a pioneer on this, has campaigned on this and has done a huge amount of political work on it. It is a matter that needs to be expedited. With that, I begin by thanking the Senator for giving me, on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, the opportunity to inform the House of the up-to-date position in respect of introducing legislative provisions for the regulation of international surrogacy and historic surrogacy arrangements. As the Senator is aware, the Minister for Health, together with the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Children Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, submitted proposals for the consideration of Cabinet in respect of both the regulation of international surrogacy and the recognition of certain past domestic and international surrogacy arrangements. This policy direction and draft outline legislative scheme were approved by Government in mid December 2022, and the Minister wrote to the Attorney General before Christmas to request the prioritisation of the formal drafting of these legislative amendments.The drafting process by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, in conjunction with the three Departments, as appropriate, is well under way. I have followed up on it myself. It is being prioritised. I have spoken to officials directly and people are working exclusively on this issue in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel in the Attorney General's office. I am aware of how important it is for both the Senator and for parents, of which she is one. The intention is to insert the finalised new legislative provisions in respect of international surrogacy and past surrogacy arrangements into the Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Bill 2022 on Committee Stage, along with any other proposed amendment to the published Bill. These new provisions will need to be approved by the Government following completion of formal drafting by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel. That was agreed in December 2022. The process, therefore, of drafting new provisions in respect of prospective international surrogacy, the recognition of past domestic surrogacy arrangements and the recognition of past international surrogacy arrangements is being undertaken in tandem with the drafting of potentially substantial proposed amendments to the 11 Parts and 134 pages of the published Bill. On behalf of the three Ministers and the Government, I reiterate their gratitude for the work undertaken by the special Oireachtas Joint Committee on International Surrogacy, of which the Senator was an esteemed member. She made reference to the report that is informing these amendments. The stated position of the three Ministers and the Government is to seek, insofar as appropriate and possible, to implement the recommendations of the committee. However, Senator Seery Kearney will appreciate that it is crucial the final detailed provisions are robust and able to withstand rigorous scrutiny, given the range of complexities involved, the rights of the various parties involved in surrogacy arrangements and the necessity to ensure consistency with any related existing legislation in the Statute Book. I understand the Senator's frustration but I think everyone here wants to get this right. In this regard, it should also be noted that the three Departments are not aware of any other state that has attempted to provide such a bespoke and comprehensive legislative solution to the issues arising from its own citizens engaging in international surrogacy. The Senator has already made reference to that. The Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, is aware, and completely understands the reasons Senator Seery Kearney is eager to know when these amendments will be ready for publication. However, at this juncture a definitive timeline as to when Committee Stage of the Bill will be scheduled cannot be provided. I have spoken to the Minister and the official. I have asked for it to be prioritised. Nevertheless, it is anticipated that the three Ministers will be in a position to bring the proposed new three surrogacy Parts of the Bill to Cabinet within the next couple of months. Finally, the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, wants to reassure Senators, particularly Senator Seery Kearney, that he wishes to progress this much-needed and long-awaited historic legislation as quickly as possible. He wants to ensure that both the goal of providing a route to formal recognition by the State of past surrogacy arrangements or surrogacy arrangements in other jurisdictions is achieved and that a robust regulatory framework for assisted human reproduction more broadly is put in place.

I am grateful for that. However, there are other concerns here. For example, the position paper approved by the Cabinet talks about application to the High Court for retrospective surrogacies. The regulatory authority would also have to be established. If that is what we are looking at my daughter, who is now almost eight, will be ten or 12 at the rate at which this is operating. Even were the legislation to be in place by the summer, we are still looking at another year before there will be applications to court. People like me, whose documentation has already had judicial oversight on not one but two occasions still have to apply and go to the expense of applying to the High Court. There are things in this, which are not person-centred or child-centred. As there is no sense of urgency, I ask the Minister of State to bring that back. It is my understanding that the Attorney General is sticking strictly by the High Court. I will be objecting to that all of the way through, as being totally unnecessary and cumbersome unless they are going to financially support it. We have already paid out tens of thousands to get in and get the legal orders we already have. It is unacceptable that there are any more delays like that.
#KieranODonnell	unknown-#KieranODonnell-party	unknown-#KieranODonnell-dob	unknown-#KieranODonnell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-15 00:00:00	Gnó an tSeanaid - Business of Seanad	5	I will conclude by emphasising the urgency with which the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, wishes to be in a position to bring the new surrogacy provisions on Committee Stage of the Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Bill 2022 to the Select Committee on Health for consideration. He is particularly determined to seek a way to speedily resolve the predicament and uncertainty faced by parents of existing children born through surrogacy. Although it would not be appropriate to comment on individual cases, he is fully aware of the difficult situations some families face in ongoing court proceedings. Other key principles underpinning any new legislation measures on international surrogacy will be protection of the rights of all children born as a result of cross-border surrogacy arrangements and the safeguarding of the welfare of surrogacy mothers. I will bring the points raised by the Senator back to the Minister. I will ask him to correspond directly with her. It is a matter she has highlighted and it is a matter I will bring to the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, and I will ask him to communicate directly with her on those points. Formulating legislation adhering to these principles is challenging, given the absence of an international framework, and the challenges associated with overseeing practices and services in other jurisdictions. This includes having assurances that surrogacy arrangements are of the highest ethical standards and prioritising those who may be most vulnerable to exploitation in international surrogacy. However, building on the work of the Oireachtas committee, of which the Senator was a member, and the interdepartmental group, the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, hopes to be able to put forward the finalised new legislation to Cabinet shortly and ideally, when approved, to brief the Oireachtas accordingly .
#MaryFitzpatrick	unknown-#MaryFitzpatrick-party	unknown-#MaryFitzpatrick-dob	unknown-#MaryFitzpatrick-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-15 00:00:00	Gnó an tSeanaid - Business of Seanad	6	I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House today. This morning I seek an update from the Minister for Health on the proposal to name the new national children's hospital after Dr. Kathleen Lynn. The campaign to name the national children's hospital after Dr. Kathleen Lynn has been led by the 1916 Relatives Association and has the support of my own party, Fianna Fáil, as well as of SIPTU and Fórsa. It also has the support of Dr. Kathleen Lynn's alma mater, Alexandra College, and other political parties, non-political parties and organisations like the National Women's Council of Ireland. There is broad support for the campaign and the proposal to name the national children's hospital after Dr. Kathleen Lynn. For those who are not aware, Dr. Kathleen Lynn was both a medical doctor and a revolutionary. Maybe we would call her a disrupter in modern parlance. She was a pioneer of children's and women's health, and a champion of social justice. She was born in Mayo, she was not a Dubliner, in 1874. She studied medicine and was a suffragist. She was involved in both the 1913 Lock-out and the 1916 Rising. She was arrested and imprisoned. She did time in Kilmainham and Mountjoy prisons. Following all of that, which one would think was enough excitement in one woman's life, in 1919 she founded St. Ultan's Hospital, the first children's hospital. That was but a stone's throw from here on Charlemont Street. In that hospital she pioneered the provision of healthcare for children and women, many of whom would never have had access to healthcare. Certainly they would not have had access to professional healthcare. She has a legacy today that we all enjoy. She started and fostered a tradition of caring for children and those health needs that are particular to children and their mothers. She cared for women's health needs. Women's healthcare has come a long way but still has so much further to go. She was a woman who provided healthcare to people of a socioeconomic background who would never have been able to access it. She not only championed it as a value. She lived it and made it real. Her legacy is undisputable. Her contribution to our Republic we still enjoy. We rightly celebrate the fathers of our Republic but there is very little celebration of the mothers of our Republic. Very few women of Irish history are properly and appropriately commemorated. I believe, together with many others, that the creation of a national children's hospital providing best in class, up to date, best quality healthcare for our children is absolutely what our State should be doing.That care and provision should be informed by the values of Dr. Kathleen Lynn. The values of provision of healthcare based on one's health needs and the provision of healthcare based on social justice. What I would like today is an update from the Department of Health and the Minister for Health on what the process is and where the Department is in the process of naming the national children's hospital after Dr. Kathleen Lynn.
#KieranODonnell	unknown-#KieranODonnell-party	unknown-#KieranODonnell-dob	unknown-#KieranODonnell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-15 00:00:00	Gnó an tSeanaid - Business of Seanad	7	I thank the Senator on behalf of the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, for this opportunity to update the House on this important matter. The children's hospital project will truly transform how paediatric care is delivered in Ireland. The new children's hospital building is at the heart of this transformation bringing the acute paediatric hospital service and specialties in Children's Health Ireland under one roof for the first time, leading to improved clinical outcomes and a better experience for children, young people and their families. This is a much-needed and much-deserved investment in our children and young people and for the dedicated staff working in children's health in Ireland who are currently providing excellent care. This much-needed reform will support the expert tertiary and higher level care treatment for all children and young people, who represent 25% of our population, in world-class state-of-the-art facilities where healthcare providers can deliver care leading to better health outcomes. In satellite centres we already see the benefits of the investment in the new children's hospital project with the two new pediatric centres in Tallaght University Hospital and Connolly Hospital helping to reduce waiting times for children, young people and their families. In 2022 more than 22,000 children presented to the urgent care centre at Children's Health Ireland, CHI, at Connolly Hospital. More than 92% were discharged home after their visit. There have also been more than 15,000 outpatients attending CHI Connolly. In 2022, more than 36,000 children presented to the emergency care unit at CHI at Tallaght Hospital with more than 4,000 outpatients attending. Both of the satellite centres provide a new model of ambulatory care fully aligned with Sláintecare, ensuring the right care in the right place at the right time. On the naming of the hospital, which is the matter the Senator put forward for debate today, following its establishment Children's Health Ireland was put on a statutory footing in 2009 and the opening of the satellite centres in Connolly and Tallaght, Children's Health Ireland's sites are currently referred to as CHI Crumlin, CHI Temple Street, CHI Tallaght and CHI Connolly. As the physical building progresses apace on the new children's hospital there is an emerging need for a permanent name to be assigned to the hospital, as the Senator identified. A clear name and entity are essential for identification purposes to enable the organisation to raise awareness of its services and view the name with a positive messaging association. The Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, is aware of this need and of the importance of the name of the new children's hospital and as such the process for naming the children's hospital is currently under consideration. I will conclude by noting that the new children's hospital is more than just bricks and mortar. It is a key enabler of strategic reform of the way we deliver health services for our children and young people. This hospital, and the wider pediatric network, will provide the right care in the right place and at the right time for the children and young people of Ireland. The process for naming the new children's hospital is currently under active consideration by the Minister.

I should have thanked everybody who is still working on the construction of the hospital. That was remiss of me. It is tremendous to see it coming out of the ground and everybody who has worked on it is to be congratulated and commended. It will absolutely transform not only the provision of care for the patients, the young people who are 25% of our population, as the Minister of State referenced, but it will also transform the work environment for everybody who works in the hospital. I also commend and thank, and we can never do so enough, those who work in our health services, and not just in Crumlin and Temple Street, which is in my constituency of Dublin Central, but in Tallaght and Connolly, the Mater and the Rotunda. Our GPs and our community nurses are fantastic. In terms of the naming of the hospital, I take encouragement from the Minister of State's reply because I think it acknowledged and recognised that there is a need for a proper identity for the hospital and a naming of the hospital that is appropriate and will not just represent the future of paediatric care but also the values that will inform it. Those values are captured perfectly in the name of Dr. Kathleen Lynn as are the values of social justice, equality and care for children and those who need it.

I can see how passionate she is in respect of putting forward the name of Dr. Kathleen Lynn as the name. This significant undertaking and the children's hospital project shows the commitment of the Government to develop paediatric services for children and young people, or dare I say to further develop them. The key enabler of the new children's hospital project will be the hub, a national network of paediatric services. This network will support regional local hospitals to deliver acute paediatric care close to home for children, finding more ambulatory care, and integrated locally with community provision. The two supporting satellite centres at Connolly and Tallaght, which represent major milestones as part of the wider reform effort, are completely and fully operational. This hospital, and the wider paediatric network, will substantially develop children and young people's healthcare within the wider Sláintecare vision, providing the right care in the right place at the right time for children and young people throughout Ireland for generations to come. As previously stated, and in terms of the key element of the Senator's Commencement matter this morning, the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, is mindful of the importance of the naming of the new children's hospital and as such the process for naming the new children's hospital is currently under active consideration.
#LisaChambers	unknown-#LisaChambers-party	unknown-#LisaChambers-dob	unknown-#LisaChambers-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-15 00:00:00	Gnó an tSeanaid - Business of Seanad	10	I wish to raise once again the issue of the western rail corridor and the all-island strategic rail review that has been sitting in draft form on the desk of the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, but has not yet been published. When I raised this matter a number of weeks ago, I was told by the Minister that he was not in a position to publish the document. He said that because it is an all-island strategic rail review, there is a need for an Executive and a Minister for Infrastructure to be in place in Northern Ireland because they have to publish the document jointly. I raise this matter because the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Chris Heaton-Harris, has said he will not be calling assembly elections for another year, which would be January 2024. Now is the time for the Minister to reflect, change his position and publish, without further delay, the all-island strategic rail review in order that we in the South can advance our rail projects. Surely it is not reasonable or acceptable to delay the advancement of our rail projects while we wait for those in politics in Northern Ireland to get their act together. When will the all-island strategic rail review be published? When will we see the projects to which I refers being advanced and delivered? In that context, I am specifically interested in the western rail corridor and the line from Athenry to Claremorris.
#KieranODonnell	unknown-#KieranODonnell-party	unknown-#KieranODonnell-dob	unknown-#KieranODonnell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-15 00:00:00	Gnó an tSeanaid - Business of Seanad	11	I thank Senator Chambers for the opportunity to address this issue. I would first like to outline the Minister for Transport's belief in the potential of rail. The Government is strongly committed to providing all citizens with reliable and realistic sustainable mobility options, and the rail network plays a key role in the delivery of this goal. As the Senator is aware, the Department of Transport, in co-operation with the Department for Infrastructure in Northern Ireland, has commissioned an all-island strategic rail review. The two Departments have collaborated closely throughout the review. The Ministers for Transport and Infrastructure have met on several occasions to launch the review, announce the public consultation and to be updated on the latest progress. The results of the review will inform the development of the railway sector on the island of Ireland over the coming decades. The strategic rail review considers the future of the rail network with regard to the following ambitions: improving sustainable connectivity between the major cities, including the potential for high or higher speed rail; enhancing regional accessibility; and supporting balanced regional development and rail connectivity to our international gateways. The review is considering the scope for improved rail services and infrastructure along the various existing or potential future corridors of the network, including disused and closed lines, such as the western rail corridor, which the Senator made reference to. The review has been informed by a public consultation process, which concluded last year and which received a great response both North and South. A draft report is being finalised. I have made inquiries WITH the Minister and his officials ,and I expect the Minister will receive a draft of the report within the next month. The draft report will be submitted for approval to both Ministers, as well as the Irish Government. After the necessary approvals have been secured, the Department of Transport will publish the report. Until the report is finalised, it would be premature to discuss publication arrangements or specific projects within the report. However, it is worth emphasising that this has been a collaborative effort between the two Departments from the outset. This is the first all-island review of the network since the formation of the State and will provide a framework to develop a much-improved rail network in the decades ahead. I look forward to its publication as I believe the review will provide an opportunity for transformative system change. I feel it is also important that the Senator notes the huge investment already being made in our rail network. I note the point she raised in respect of the Northern Ireland Secretary. My understanding is that if the assembly is not restored by 18 January next year, he will then request an election within 12 weeks. We live in hope that it will be restored prior to that date. I note the Senator's point and it is a matter I will bring back to the Minister. The DART+ programme will triple the amount of electrified track in the greater Dublin area from 50 km to 150 km, resulting in a lower carbon and higher capacity system, with more frequent and faster passenger services. I will just cover these projects generally. A ten-year fleet arrangement between Irish Rail and Alstom also received Government approval in December 2021. The rail network in Cork is benefiting from significant new investment. The Government also recognises the importance of the rail freight sector. I am pleased that funding has been announced for redevelopment of Ceannt Station in Galway and track and station improvements at Oranmore. Both projects are scheduled to be completed by 2024 or 2025. In November 2022, the Government approved the final business case for the Waterford North Quays project, allocating over €170 million in Exchequer funding to the project. I thank the Senator for her interest in this matter and look forward to hearing her comments. I note the points she raised. I will come back on some of the other points in my concluding remarks.
#LisaChambers	unknown-#LisaChambers-party	unknown-#LisaChambers-dob	unknown-#LisaChambers-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-15 00:00:00	Gnó an tSeanaid - Business of Seanad	12	I appreciate the Minister of State listening to the comments I made and responding to them because perhaps that was not information he would have been in a position to give. The Minister of State's response reads, "After the necessary approvals have been secured, the Department of Transport will publish the report." Can he please tell me what necessary approvals are required for the report to be published? He also said it would be premature to discuss publication arrangements or specific projects until the report is finalised. I do not agree that it would be premature to discuss publication arrangements. We can absolutely discuss publication arrangements. Is it the Minister's intention to publish when the report is finalised? What does he need in order to publish it? As the Minister of State indicated, we hope that we will see an assembly and an Executive restored before next year but they may not be restored within the year. They may not be restored within the next five years. We have no idea. The idea that we would delay development of our projects and the publication of this worthwhile report, considering the public interest in it and the interest in contributing to the public consultation, and that we would sit back and wait for politics in the North to get its act together is absolute madness. The Minister of State has already alluded to the importance of this type of work. We have seen already the success of the western rail corridor in the Limerick to Galway section. The numbers continue to grow, despite all the challenges. The west of Ireland is a disadvantaged region when it comes to every metric. Whether it is public investment in infrastructure, our roads network or our rail network, we lag behind every other region. We need this project. In the west of Ireland, we would like to have public transport like everywhere else. We would like this rail connectivity. My question is very specific. What exactly are the necessary approvals in order to publish the report? What is needed? Is it the Minister's intention to publish once the draft is finalised?
#KieranODonnell	unknown-#KieranODonnell-party	unknown-#KieranODonnell-dob	unknown-#KieranODonnell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-15 00:00:00	Gnó an tSeanaid - Business of Seanad	13	The Senator's first question was about the approval process. As I said, a draft report is being finalised. The Minister expects to receive that within the next month. The draft report will be submitted to the Ministers for approval, as well as the Irish Government. The necessary approvals, based on what has been provided to me today, would be from both Executives, that is, the Government here and the Executive in the North. The Department will then publish the report. Until the report is published, it would be premature to discuss publication arrangements or specific projects within the report. That is the approval process. Uniquely, the strategic rail review is being conducted on an all-Ireland basis, in full co-operation with our colleagues in the Northern Ireland Executive and at an official level within the Department for Infrastructure, to provide a holistic overview of the potential of rail on the island. The review is considering the scope for improved railway services and infrastructure along the various existing and potential future corridors, including disused and closed railways. It would be premature to commit to the reopening of the western rail corridor or any line before the review is finalised. It should be noted that the reopening of disused lines is endorsed by the review. A comprehensive body of work would still be required before any such decision is taken, in accordance with the public spending code and other guidelines and regulations. Reopening the line to passenger traffic would initially involve a detailed baseline survey to understand the requirements to bring the line back within operating safety and regulatory compliance. As I said, the Government is not waiting to continue to invest in the rail network. I made reference to DART programmes and Cork commuter programmes in this regard. The Senator's points are well made. I will bring them back to the Minister.
#JohnCummins	unknown-#JohnCummins-party	unknown-#JohnCummins-dob	unknown-#JohnCummins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-15 00:00:00	Gnó an tSeanaid - Business of Seanad	14	I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House. This is an important matter. It calls on the Minister for Education to introduce a voluntary national post-primary redeployment panel which would facilitate the transfer of teachers from one area of the country to another while retaining their permanent status under contracts of indefinite duration, CIDs. As someone who taught in an education and training board, ETB, school in Waterford city until my election to this House, I know this issue very well. I had colleagues who commuted very long distances to work. Some are happy to do so while others wish to be closer to home but cannot move because they would risk their job security. It is a fact that some teachers are commuting up to 200 km per day, probably more, which is not conducive to a healthy lifestyle. That is even before one considers the carbon emissions involved. I know the Minister of State will say that a teacher in one area can apply for employment in another in the normal fashion. However, that misses the point that doing so involves risk. In the best-case scenario, everything works out and the teacher is interviewed again after 12 months, which is another bugbear of mine that I will not pursue now. In that best-case scenario, everything works out and the teacher has a permanent contract, going forward. However, let us consider a worst-case scenario. A teacher leaves a permanent position in Waterford and takes a 12-month contract in Cork. After 12 months, the teacher re-interviews for the position and the job is given to someone else or the hours are reduced. That leaves the teacher in a vulnerable position. Perhaps the teacher has family and mortgage commitments. It is easy to see why teachers would not risk leaving a permanent position in one location to seek employment in another, even though it would be better for them and would allow them to be closer to their families, obligations and support networks. A group of teachers operates under the name "fair post-primary redeployment for teachers". The group has been campaigning on this issue for some time. Its membership totals approximately 700 teachers nationwide, all of whom feel that this is a necessary change. I agree with them. There is a redeployment scheme in place on a yearly basis but only a small number of applicants are successful. One of the reasons is that one must apply in February for redeployment but schools in a particular area may not know they have a shortage until much later and closer to the next academic year. The number of teachers who are successfully redeployed is small. The group is seeking something I support, that is, the introduction of a voluntary scheme that would facilitate the transfer of a teacher from one location to another if there is a matching teacher in the other location. Perhaps a PE teacher in Waterford is looking to move closer to family in Wicklow and a PE teacher in Wicklow is looking to move to Waterford. How can that not be facilitated? It makes complete sense. Those teachers are unhappy in their workplaces. The schools have two unhappy teachers who want to be closer to home and their support networks. If you are unhappy in your working environment, you cannot give your all in the classroom, and that negatively affects students. It makes complete sense to facilitate such a transfer of teachers between locations. I suggest that a dialogue commences between the Department, the ETBs and the unions on this matter. It has been put on the long finger for far too long. It makes sense. I ask the Minister of State to relay that message to the Minister, Deputy Foley. Dialogue needs to commence as a matter of urgency.

I am responding to the matter on behalf of the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley. I note the points the Senator has raised about redeployment. I will bring those back to the Minister and will highlight the points the Senator has made. Teacher allocations to all second level schools are approved annually by the Department of Education in accordance with established rules based on recognised pupil enrolment. The criteria for the allocation of posts are communicated to school management annually and are available on the Department's website. The recruitment and appointment of teachers to fill teaching posts is a matter for each individual school authority as the employer. The deployment of teaching staff in the school, the range of subjects offered and ultimately the quality of teaching and learning are in the first instance a matter for the individual school management authorities. Post-primary schools employ teachers with the appropriate subject mix to provide for a range of subjects that can be offered to students. It is an important aspect of the annual timetabling process that schools work towards achieving this outcome where possible. Matching the subject mix on offer with the qualifications of individual teachers who typically have more than one subject can be a challenging task for schools. It is important that schools as employers retain the flexibility to employ teachers with the capacity to teach varied subjects to maintain a wide range of subjects on offer to students. I note the point the Senator raised in respect of the February deadline and that is a matter I will highlight to the Minister. The core function of the redeployment arrangements is to facilitate the redeployment of surplus permanent teachers to other schools where vacancies exist. Such a scenario may occur in instances where enrolment drops in a school. Redeployment may also arise in instances where the qualifications of teachers no longer match the subject needs of the school or where surpluses arise from the inclusion of career break and secondment service in the eligibility criteria for granting a contract of indefinite duration. This scheme includes provision for a teacher in a surplus school who wishes to volunteer to redeploy from that school to another location subject to the agreement of school management. Where this occurs, compulsory redeployment can be avoided. Ensuring efficiency in the annual redeployment processes is significant in terms of managing the overall teacher numbers and help to provide a supply of teachers to fill vacancies. Following discussions and agreement with relevant stakeholders, a voluntary redeployment scheme has operated on a pilot basis in specific regions in recent years. Permanent teachers employed in these regions are given an opportunity to volunteer for a transfer to other areas of the country if such a transfer would free up a vacancy that would facilitate the redeployment of a surplus permanent teacher in that region. To date, the pilot voluntary redeployment scheme has operated in 24 counties. The pilot voluntary redeployment scheme helps the Department to achieve its objective of redeploying all the surplus permanent teachers. Teachers who apply under the pilot voluntary scheme and are not facilitated with a transfer continue to have the option of applying for posts in their preferred location that are advertised in the normal manner. I have no doubt but that the Senator will address some of the points I have raised. Since the introduction of redeployment at post-primary level, more than 800 teachers have been redeployed ensuring an equitable and fair teacher allocation system to all schools. The teacher redeployment arrangements are reviewed annually by the Department of Education involving the education stakeholders, including teacher unions and management bodies. It is open to members of the school community to liaise with their representative bodies on any matters of concern they may have. As part of the review, the education stakeholders can raise issues or concerns with the Department in respect of the operation of the redeployment process generally. The review in respect of the 2023-2024 redeployment process took place last December with education stakeholders. The pilot voluntary redeployment scheme will operate in counties Longford, Westmeath, Laois and Offaly for 2023-2024 school year. The criteria for the allocation of teachers to schools including the redeployment arrangements for the 2023-2024 school year is available on the Department's website.

He made comments in respect of the operation of the pilot voluntary redeployment scheme, which is fantastic for counties Longford, Westmeath, Laois and Offaly, but what about every other county in the country? There are teachers in those areas who want to get closer to home and if there is a matching teacher in another location, it does not make sense for a redeployment not to be facilitated. A teacher should be able to move from one location to another while retaining his or her permanence and without risking job security, considering all of the obligations a teacher may have. We cannot recommend to an individual that he or she take such a risk. The scheme only applies to surplus staff. The Minister of State, Deputy Butler, responded to my colleague, Senator Seán Kyne, in the Chamber last year on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Foley. She said that "... the only way to reach a solution to an issue is through positive engagement around the table". I could not agree more, but that has not happened. I am suggesting dialogue between the Department of Education, the ETBs and the unions to come up with an acceptable scheme that makes sense to facilitate teachers who wish to move from one location to another while retaining their permanence.Anything less would just be tinkering around the edges. It makes sense and it needs to happen soon.

I note the point he has made in respect of the pilot schemes. It has operated in 24 counties but not all at once. At present it operates in counties Longford, Westmeath, Laois and Offaly. I note the point Senator Cummins has raised and I will bring it back to the Minister, Deputy Foley. I also note the point Senator Cummins has raised on dialogue and engagement between the Department of Education, the education and training boards and the unions, and I will bring it back to the Minister. Dialogue is key. It is important that the voluntary aspect of the redeployment process does not inadvertently cause undue delays for the recruitment of teachers by schools or cause additional challenges to teacher supply throughout the country. Members of the school community are advised to discuss areas of concern with their representative bodies. The review in respect of the 2023-24 redeployment process took place last December with education stakeholders and the pilot voluntary redeployment scheme will operate in the four counties I have named. The criteria for the allocation of teachers to schools, including the redeployment arrangements for the 2023-24 school year, are available on the Department of Education's website. I note the points Senator Cummins has raised and I will bring them to the attention of the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, for her consideration.

My thoughts are with their families and friends at this difficult time. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a n-anamacha dílse. Yesterday the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, dismissed the board of Inland Fisheries Ireland and in his proclamation given under his hand on St. Valentine's Day, 14 February 2023, he stated a number of things. He gave the background, which is fine. He pointed out that the number of members of Inland Fisheries Ireland had significantly reduced given a number of recent resignations from the board and that as the required quorum of five members for a meeting pursuant to section 25 of the Inland Fisheries Act 2010 cannot be attained, Inland Fisheries Ireland is as a consequence unable to act. The Minister failed to state that the reason there are not enough members is because he failed to appoint people in place of those who had resigned. Is the Minister actually blaming the members who are present and who are turning up for meetings that there are not enough of them? There was a resignation on 28 April 2022, another on 30 April 2022 and another in October 2022. None of those members was replaced by the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan. Part of the reason for disbanding the board is that there are not enough members because the Minister did not appoint enough members. The Minister also stated that Inland Fisheries Ireland has not implemented the recommendations of the report dated 12 July 2022 of Mr. Conleth Bradley, SC, submitted pursuant to section 18(3) of the Inland Fisheries Act 2010. An impartial observer might regard that as valid - 12 July 2022 is a long time ago and one would think they would have done something since then. Of course, in referring to that misleading date, the Minister does not say that the report from Mr. Conleth Bradley did not actually go to the chairman of Inland Fisheries Ireland until 26 September 2022 and was not given to board members until 9 November last year. An absolutely misleading date has been put in there, I will not say on purpose by the Minister, but on purpose by departmental officials advising him. That date should not be stated as 12 July when the report was only given to the board members on 9 November not 12 July. Therefore, they had a much shorter period to deal with this. There are serious questions as to why exactly the Minister disbanded the board. I know he will not do it because the Deputy Leader has previously asked for the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, to come in here and discuss Inland Fisheries Ireland. I know this is a small part of his very important brief, but he might show it a bit of consideration and come in here for statements on matters relating to Inland Fisheries Ireland.

More than 17 million people in that area have been affected. There is talk about more than 38,000 people having died already. The costs will run to in excess of €100 billion. When we go about our daily business we need to keep that in mind. I acknowledge the Government's donation of €10 million towards the emergency response. I commend all the NGOs and all the people who are working on the ground. I want to ask that all of us be kind to refugees and those who are suffering. If we can, we should donate to the Irish Red Cross and the Irish Emergency Alliance. More locally, in Dublin Central I want to celebrate today the really bad news for drug dealers and anybody engaged in antisocial behaviour around O'Devaney Gardens, including people who opposed the building of homes there. I want to really shout the great news for anybody, be they young or old, who wants to get a home in Dublin Central. After decades construction has commenced on more than 1,000 homes in O'Devaney Gardens. These will be 1,000 social, affordable, private homes and will be built to the highest standard. They will be A-rated for energy. They will not be homes built on their own in isolation. They will come with a crèche, community facilities, shops and quality public spaces. There will be a local apprenticeship and employment clause. This deal has taken far too long to get to this point, but construction has commenced and now people in Dublin Central will have a real opportunity to have a home in Dublin Central. They will have a choice. It can be a social home, an affordable home, an affordable cost-rental home - something that others have objected to strenuously - or even a private home. I congratulate Dublin City Council on getting this construction commenced and let us push on with that project. I pay tribute to Nicola Sturgeon, a woman in her prime, a capable and strong female politician, who this morning announced her resignation from office. She has said she will not be retiring from politics entirely. She cites the brutality of political life. I often describe it as an extreme sport. It is like hurling without a helmet, without rules and without a referee.

I salute him for continually referencing this issue and the concerns about the governance of that body. Before coming to the House this morning, I read the transcript of his contribution in the House on 24 November 2022. I would stop somewhat short of describing anyone in Inland Fisheries Ireland as rotten or corrupt but the language the Senator used demonstrated his concern. There are serious concerns to address. A number of whistleblowers raised concerns regarding this organisation and the Senator has raised many concerns in this House. They are perhaps the strongest concerns I have ever heard raised in my time in the House about any organisation. We have an oversight agreement and a delivery agreement between the Minister and Inland Fisheries Ireland and we also have a code of business conduct for the board of that body. After all of that, why have the issues of responsibility, accountability and allocation of budgets, resources and personnel not been addressed? Why have the issues around integrity, transparency, public concern and lack of confidence and potential conflicts of interest, whether actual or perceived, in this organisation not been addressed? I join Senator Kyne in asking for a debate and statements. I do not accept the Minister, Deputy Ryan, not coming to the House. We have the Order of Business here every day. I am flagging to the Leader now, rather than have it come as a surprise to her, that I may bring forward a proposal on the Order of Business tomorrow, or perhaps an amendment, calling on the Minister to attend the Chamber for such a debate. I hope everyone in the House will support Senator Kyne in that call. I certainly do and I will make a case for others to do the same. I ask that we unite in our strength in this House tomorrow by putting in a formal request for the Minister to come to the House, if not this week then next week. I want to be reasonable and fair but Senator Kyne has raised serious issues. He is a member of one of the Government parties. He deserves a full response, as does the public. I will reflect on this matter and talk to the Leader later in the day. We should work together to ensure the Minister comes to the House to give some sort of statement and that we have some sort of debate on Inland Fisheries Ireland. It is an important issue.

It is the coming together of a range of political parties, NGOs, civil society groups and a plethora of community and voluntary organisations from right across our Thirty-two Counties. At the heart of that coming together is a celebration of the richness of our diversity, including our cultural, ethnic and linguistic diversity, as a great positive and strength for all of us in society. I encourage people to attend the rally to celebrate our diversity and our strength in that diversity. I ask that we unify and unite in support of marginalised new communities, members of which are feeling a great deal of pressure, stress and threat. Many of them have been victims of violence. Solidarity is key and so too are practical actions, including encouraging people to take part in Saturday's rally and engaging in that type of expression of support. It is important we in these Houses always reflect on our language and engage in positive expressions in supporting the people who find themselves on the margins and need our support. I certainly agree with the sentiment of Saturday's rally that an Ireland at its best is an Ireland for all. It is an Ireland that cherishes, protects, celebrates and elevates all. A number of us have asked on several occasions for statements from the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the continued breaches of international law by the Israeli Government. We have seen ongoing and escalated levels of violence in the West Bank and Gaza as well as the loss of life of a number of Israeli civilians in recent weeks. This leads to a state of perpetual hopelessness for those of us watching from afar. I can only imagine what it is like for the people who have to endure it day in, day out. I am keen to hear what measures the Government is taking at an international level, whether through the EU or the UN. I am also keen, as I know are many others, to engage with the Government on what action it can take on its own merit. I am very proud that the Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill 2018 was initiated and passed all Stages in this House in the previous term. We need to take action that stands up for international law and acts against those who would be in breach of that law. I ask again that the Minister for Foreign Affairs come to the House for statements on this issue.
#AnnieHoey	unknown-#AnnieHoey-party	unknown-#AnnieHoey-dob	unknown-#AnnieHoey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-15 00:00:00	Gnó an tSeanaid - Business of Seanad	25	At the weekend, we heard of the horrific death of a young girl, Brianna Ghey, who was trans and whose murder was potentially a hate-motivated crime. Unfortunately, hers is one of many deaths across the world as a result of inadequate policy, advocacy and trans allyship. Between October 2021 and September 2022, there were 327 reported murders of trans and gender diverse people across the world. A report commissioned by Emily Logan when she was chief commissioner of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, showed that Ireland is really deficient in addressing hate crime. However, the situation in this State is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the realities trans people face every day. The data in the report were collected from across a number of countries with strong LGBTQ groups. There are many countries in which trans people experience awful violations of human rights, with very little reporting and media coverage. It is important to reiterate that remaining silent on this issue is simply not enough. We need to speak up and show allyship. We need to create a shift in our society towards parity between all individuals regardless of gender, race and background. I have been reflecting on the massive lack of allyship throughout the media in the reporting of this terrible loss of life, with reporters using incorrect and exclusive language and even going so far as to deadname Brianna and contact people who had very tangential links to her to find out that name. All of this is a massive contributor to the hatred experienced by the LGBTQ community throughout the world. I am thinking today of Brianna Ghey and the loss of a really beautiful young life. I think of all those who knew and loved her. The second issue I raise concerns the racism and xenophobia that is happening on our college campuses at this time. Last week, we saw what may have been a racially motivated attack at a Luas stop near Technological University, TU, Dublin, which has left a number of students in the area feeling afraid. No student should fear for his or her life in a place of education. It is terrifying that people would target individuals based on the colour of their skin or where they believe their victim has come from. We must recognise that these attacks are part of the bigger misinformation campaign being run by various actors. It is important we in both Houses of the Oireachtas and the Government do our best to debunk the misinformation and stand in solidarity with those affected to show that all people are welcome in Ireland. Students at TU Dublin held an antiracism protest on 13 February with the aim of showing solidarity. The student union has called for a greater Garda presence in the area to make students at the university feel safe. It is shocking we are in a situation in which we are calling for Garda supports on university campuses to make students feel safe. This is a serious state of affairs. As I have said before in the House, if the Government does not get to grips with what is happening and the misinformation that is going around, I do not know where we will end up.

It is a group of hedge growers who are protesting about the amount of hedging that has been cut in recent years with the instruction or acceptance of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. The group that is here today has written to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and is looking to meet him today to present him with a letter about its genuine concerns. Obviously, hedges play a key role in terms of biodiversity and environmental impact in rural Ireland, in particular in counties like my own, Tipperary. Their request is that there should be financial incentives for farmers and landowners to keep hedges as opposed to cutting them. I would appreciate it if Members could go out to meet them and, if the Minister has time available, he should meet them. It is a genuine cause. They are here from 12 noon until 1 p.m. and they will be presenting a letter to the Department, with the hope of meeting the Minister, Deputy McConalogue. Second, I ask for a debate with the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, in regard to the report by RTÉ's Robert Shortt yesterday on energy prices and the response by Electric Ireland on the reduction in the wholesale cost of energy prices taking 18 to 24 months to come back into people's pockets. I understand that hopefully, the Government is bringing forward measures this week in regard to the cost of living for people who are struggling, and one of those is possibly an extra €200 credit on bills. I welcome that and fully support it. However, why is it falling back on the taxpayer to support them when energy companies are fleecing the payers of bills? We have seen the amount of money they made in 2022 in regard to energy.

It cannot always be the Government that people fall back on.

I am going to make a political point, by the way. It would be nice if, once in a while, we saw someone from Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael attend a union meeting when they come to make their presentations. Again, parties from the left, like ourselves, were there but there was nobody from Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael. That is genuinely a shame because they would have heard workers’ voices explaining the fact there is a major issue in the industry with not getting enough hours of work. What is happening is that employers are using pools of labour and giving workers flexible scheduling. Those workers who are the good boys and girls might get some hours but any worker who raises an issue will not be on the schedule for the following week. This is based on a survey of 3,000 workers, so it is not anecdotal. The other myth that is out there is that it may be students who are working in retail but that is absolutely not the case. Only 3% of those surveyed showed that study was a reason they could not do more hours. There are fixes available for this. One of the fixes is to just strengthen the existing miscellaneous provisions Bill to ensure that existing workers get first option for hours, which is a very reasonable point that all of us should be able to agree on. The second point is to finally get rid of the sub-minimum rates of pay, something that Sinn Féin and the Labour Party have been trying to do for a number of years. There is no justification for paying young people less for doing the same job than somebody who is older, but that is what is happening at the moment, particularly across the retail sector in Ireland. Sinn Féin has produced a Bill in this regard. I hope we will bring it through the Seanad in the coming months and I hope it will get the support of all in this Chamber. I am calling for an urgent debate in regard to the current state of work in the retail sector to see what we can do to ensure that people who work for a living can earn a living.

All is forgiven. On 15 July 2021, the report of the independent review group into the siege of Jadotville was brought to the Seanad. The Minister at the time was quite taken aback by the response he got to that report. To say it was welcomed coolly would be to understate the situation. It was rejected by this House and by most who spoke. The Minister in his summing up stated, “There are also things on which we need to reflect over the summer and I certainly look forward to coming back to this House at the appropriate time when we can continue this debate.” Sometime after that, the Minister signed a Defence Forces regulation which provided for the award of a medal to Commandant Pat Quinlan, with which nobody would disagree. That regulation did away with the requirement for the person making the recommendation to actually witness the action and did away with the requirement for a time limit. As a result, Captain Noel Carey and two of his senior NCOs who survived Jadotville - Noel is the last surviving officer of Jadotville - resubmitted 34 recommendations for medals. I must make clear that at no stage have any of us who have advocated for the treatment of people from Jadotville said medals must be awarded to A, B, C or D. What we have said is that they must be entitled to an independent medals board. If a group of people who did not witness the events in Jadotville can make a recommendation, then surely if we have three people who submitted 34 recommendations and who witnessed the events on the ground, those recommendations must also be recognised.

There is a rumour out there that the judicial review that Leo Quinlan and I took into the independent review group was struck out by the courts. We agreed to strike out the case because the Department of Defence gave us what we looked for except for the fact the independent review could not be adjudicated on by the courts because it is not a statutory report and it has no status outside the Defence Forces. For that reason, no judge was about to adjudicate on it. Therefore, it is never have been seen by the courts and has not been adjudicated on by the courts. That is an important thing to put on the record. I thank the Chair for his indulgence.

I know from our own situation that we have unions at our parliamentary party meetings and we have private meetings. We are very aware of this situation and I know what the Senator is talking about. Other parties, particularly Fianna Fáil, do take part in this and they have done quite a lot for workers down through the years. With regard to anything related to workers who are not being treated properly, of course, we want that stamped out and, of course, we want better conditions and better ideas. However, the Senator should not say that other people do not appear at those meetings. That is all I ask. It is totally inaccurate.

We were all shocked by the comments and the statement by Deputy Naughten that he will not be going forward as a Deputy in the constituency at the next election. I know he will be with us for the next period of time and we wish him well. I wish to acknowledge the help he was to me when I came in here in 2016 and the work he has done, particularly in regard to Roscommon University Hospital, on which he stuck very much to his beliefs. I want to raise some very good news. On Monday last, we had the full opening of the hospice unit in Roscommon town for the county of Roscommon. It is a fantastic new €6.3 million, eight-bed unit. The Leader will be well aware of this and I am well aware of the hospice in Castlebar. It is very important to point out that the funding to put those buildings in place came from the people of Roscommon and the people of Mayo - fully from the people on the ground.That needs to be on the public record. Senator Chambers and I were involved and I acknowledge that the Minister gave the funding for staff. About 30 staff members are coming into that hospice now beside the hospital grounds, which is a fantastic development and much needed. I compliment Martina Jennings, the chief executive of the Mayo Roscommon Hospice, Mike Smith, the local people and all the other people, those on the ground in particular, who have given so much money over a number of years for that much-needed facility.

I believe it is appropriate that the Minister comes to the Chamber to address the key issues regarding how the RTB is actually working or trying to work with the general public. We have heard scenarios in the office where cheques have been sent to the RTB and it has written saying it never received the cheques, but the cheques have been cashed. How in the name of God could an organisation work in such a scenario? We are also dealing with the issue that the contact details are a PO box in Clonakilty. The RTB is literally untouchable and uncontactable. We have no idea exactly how it operates. I do not know what the €80 goes towards. I had a lady in the office who wrote to the RTB, gave it a cheque for one property and wanted forms for another property. The forms came, the cheque was cashed and she has been informed that the cheque was never cashed. This is a bizarre scenario. We have done our best to contact the RTB on numerous occasions. The direct line is an absolute joke at this stage. The email address is an automatic response. There is no contact and no ability to get information. People are in and out of the office every day of the week banging their heads against a brick wall. The Minister should come to the Chamber. He should come with an update on, first, how the RTB interacts with the public and, second, its traceability when it comes to cashing cheques and then informing the public that the cheques have not been cashed, writing to them saying their property is not registered because the money has not been paid. There is an issue somewhere; I do not know where. I am not saying fraud is involved but there is an issue. We need to make sure there is a decent RTB service in place. We do not have that at the moment. I propose through the Leader's good name that we ask the Minister to come to the Chamber at the soonest possible moment to discuss these serious issues.

It is an area we could do better in Ireland in politics. The public at large is interested in it. I understand that last month, solicitor Susan Gilvarry requested, and the Taoiseach subsequently approved, the 16th extension to the deadline of the final report of the commission of investigation into the National Assets Management Agency, NAMA, which was established in 2017 to investigate NAMA's disposal of the Northern Ireland loan portfolio to US vulture fund Cerberus Capital Management in a €1.4 billion transaction known as Project Eagle. The inquiry was originally due to deliver its final report at the end of June 2018 but has been repeatedly delayed. The commission was established following consultations by the then Government with Opposition parties. Consultation occurred most notably perhaps with the then Deputy Mick Wallace in 2015, who put it to the then Tánaiste, Joan Burton, on 2 July, that a routine audit of the solicitor firms which looked after the deal showed that the portfolio sold for €1.5 billion was comprised of £4.5 billion of assets. It was alleged that £7 million ended up in an Isle of Man bank account earmarked for a Northern Ireland politician or party. While the Government is to be commended for establishing the commission, it must ensure that it is capable of carrying out its duties. I understand that there have been procedural delays owing to the complex legal requirements surrounding evidence via witnesses and that cannot be helped. It is also stated in the 15th interim report that the commission has only a small legal team and limited administrative resources and that this approach was adopted because the commission was, and remains, conscious of its duty to limit legal fees incurred insofar as possible. With the commission now in its fifth year, surely there is a balance to be struck between cost and efficiency. How much is the difference in the cost to the taxpayer between an adequately staffed legal team funded in the medium term and a small legal team funded for years on end? If the Government is serious about accountability, it needs to look at resourcing that commission so we can get to the final report this year.
#MartinConway	unknown-#MartinConway-party	unknown-#MartinConway-dob	unknown-#MartinConway-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-15 00:00:00	Gnó an tSeanaid - Business of Seanad	48	In today's Irish Examiner there is a worrying article by Ciaea Phelan on the delays for people suffering from domestic violence regarding their cases going to court. Our colleague, Senator Martin, deals with domestic violence in his Bill which will be discussed this afternoon, but this is an issue that warrants scrutiny by the Seanad. People brave enough to report and make a complaint about being abused and treated badly at home should not suffer further due to a delay in getting justice. People who suffer domestic violence and abuse should have their cases fast-tracked. There needs to be a system within the Judiciary where a domestic violence case is dealt with very quickly. It should happen in a matter of days, not weeks. The national situation is a four-month delay. In my county, Clare, the delay is eight weeks, which is still unacceptable. These things should be dealt with in eight days, not eight weeks. It should be dealt with in four days, not four months. The delay in this issue is causing extra and unnecessary trauma and should be dealt with. On one other issue, the 9% VAT rate is being discussed at the moment by the Government. I know for a fact that if the 9% VAT rate goes up to 13.5%, people are going to lose their jobs in County Clare. We cannot allow that to happen, particularly when we are dealing with the situation in Ukraine and the challenges the tourism industry is facing anyway. We need to leave that support in place so that jobs and businesses are protected over the next months as they head into the summer period so they can make the moneys they need to get through a difficult winter with fuel, energy and staff costs and the myriad challenges the tourism industry faces at the moment. The last thing this Government needs to do is increase the VAT rate from 9% to 13.5%.

I wish to put on record my thanks for the work he did on behalf of the people of County Longford. He represented County Longford for two terms and even since that has always been supportive of any projects, be it the just transition or gas. I have raised the issue of the N4. I met with Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, which describes it as a priority. That project from Mullingar to Rooskey, which services the entire north west of this country, ties into the national development plan regarding balancing regional development, which is core to the programme for Government of all three parties. However, it seems that the climate action plan is superseding the national development plan, with projects being withdrawn. That is not acceptable. We who live in that region of the midlands and north west are entitled to the same services and support as everyone else in the country. One just needs to look at a map of Ireland and the missing link is that the north-west region needs services to our capital. If what I am hearing is correct, it is a disgrace if that project is taken off that plan. Funding needs to be put in place to bring that project to a planning permission stage, to lock in a route and if there is a delay in the development of that roadway, so be it. Do not kick that can or kick it out of the grounds altogether. It is not acceptable. We are entitled to the same services as every other region in the country. What about the 20 deaths, the 30 serious injuries and the 218 accidents that have occurred on that road since 2008? That is only going to continue because we are putting the climate action plan ahead of the national development plan. This needs to be changed.Those projects need to proceed to the planning permission stage.

This is one of the oldest pieces of evidence of people living in the Chapelizod area. It dates back as much as 3,000 years. It was repaired in the 1970s because it was damaged. At that time, people were a little vague about what was urgent, what was important and what constituted heritage. We had Wood Quay and all of that. In reply to a parliamentary question tabled in 2006, the then Minister for Finance stated that there was no risk of damage to the cromlech but that the Government would look at putting up a little sign. For as long as I have been in the Seanad, I have been working with Chapelizod Heritage Society, Chapelizod Tidy Towns and Chapelizod Old Village Association in order to have this matter prioritised. A heritage site of this importance should be cared for and minded. I asked for fencing around the cromlech and for its heritage to be supported. This did not happen. Two weeks ago, there were track marks found beside it and a whole chunk of it is gone. That chunk was picked up by the OPW, and all of a sudden there is a fence around the cromlech. It should not take for our heritage to be damaged for us to act. I have been in correspondence with the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan. We have received letters saying the OPW will look at it and it will be prioritised, etc. It never is until it is too late. Damage has been done when all that was required was a simple fence. People have been using it, sitting on it, having picnics on it, and doing whatever, not realising that this is something of incredible historical value. I would like a debate in this House on our heritage. I would like to hear from the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, on how we prioritise matters of this nature and what the mechanism is for ensuring that that which is of value to our State and to the people of Ireland is valued by the offices that are supposed to be looking after it.

It behoves us to look to how we can adapt our development plans to recognise that. I wish to express my sadness at hearing the news that we may be losing another strong and constructive woman leader. I refer to Nicola's Sturgeon's announcement that she intends to step down. That is really sad. In a way, I understand her decision. I also think she deserves tribute for the incredible contribution she has made ,not just to Scottish politics but also to international politics, as a very constructive and positive voice who has engaged very well with all of us in this country. I recall her address to the Seanad very fondly. She leaves a great legacy. I was deeply disappointed by the comments made by our Taoiseach at the international meeting last week and the language being used in respect of migration. I refer to his use of the words "fair", "firm" and "hard". It struck me that he was trying to send signals that are not constructive at a time when Ireland needs to be unequivocally clear-----

Do we mean hard borders, something we do not want on our island but which the EU is funding right across Africa? It is pouring money into the wall between Syria and Türkiye rather than pouring money in, as it should, in order to cover the humanitarian needs of the 6.7 million people in Syria who have been displaced, including refugees from all around the world. The Taoiseach also used the word "fair". How is it fair that EU countries that have a long history of ransacking African countries for their wealth and resources, which has contributed to the climate change that makes parts of the world uninhabitable, continue to focus their efforts on identifying how they can be more unwelcoming rather than on how they can ensure that the world is a habitable place? We can do better and we can have genuinely fair policies that are decent and deliver decent services to all who live in this country and to everyone across the globe.

I ask the children from fourth, fifth and sixth classes to put their hands up. Well done. I am so proud of each and every one of them. I thank the teachers, Edel Moriarty and Declan Rynne, who brought the students to Leinster House today. This is my first school tour group and it comes from my primary school. It is the school that I have been talking about in here. We have been fighting for a school building for nearly 27 years since the school amalgamated. We are still fighting for a school building. It is going to happen and there is going to be a fantastic new space for children there. The children represent 20 or 30 nationalities. We have so many nationalities in our schools across Ballinasloe, representing such diversity. This school is absolutely magic because I know the children have been fantastic at outdoor sports. I know they are very interested in working with their teachers and they have been great at doing lots of activities in school. They work very hard with their teachers to make sure that they are going to be proper representatives for their classes. I talked to them this morning. They told me that they are going to try to listen to other students and make things better. I just thought that, in a nutshell, this is exactly what each and every one of us as public representatives do every day. It is about listening to people and trying to make things better. I hope the students have a wonderful day. They will enjoy walking around and they will see lots of things. I know that in another ten or 20 years we will see some of these students back in here. Who knows? They may be in the Seanad or in Dáil Éireann. I am looking forward to it. They have taken the first step to representing their school and their classes. I am very proud of them. I thank them for coming up today.

Before I ask the Leader to reply, on my own behalf and on behalf of the House, I wish Nicola Sturgeon every success in her retirement. As other Senators stated, she has been a very strong leader for the Scottish Parliament. She was the first female leader of a political party in Scotland, the first woman First Minister and the longest-serving holder of that office. We can all remember her wonderful address to Seanad Éireann in 2016, where she very clearly demonstrated her support for Ireland. She spoke about her support for us in terms of the open Border and we will never forget that. We thank her most sincerely for that and wish her well in the next chapter of her life.

He was supported by Senator Boyhan in calling for statements. I have made a request to the Minister to come to the House to speak on the issue. That request has not been acceded to as of yet, but I will continue to work with Senators Kyne and Boyhan in order to try to get statements or answers from the Minister. Perhaps a motion will be the only option for us at some point, but we will work with Senator Kyne on the issue. In fairness, he has been very consistent in raising this issue in the public interest. He has done that almost on a weekly basis in the past number of months. Like many other colleagues, Senator Fitzpatrick wished Nicola Sturgeon well as she resigns from office. Ms Sturgeon is a strong female leader. Regardless of gender, she has been a very good politician and public representative for her community. We should take note of the way politics has gone and the direction in which it is going. We are driving good people out of public office.People are coming into public life, if they are brave enough to do so in the first place, and are leaving prematurely. We may look at Jacinda Ardern and people may ask also why she left politics prematurely. It is well documented and evidenced that female politicians in particular, bear the brunt of online abuse in respect of the personalisation, the attack on the individual, on their appearance, how they sound and look, their family life, and how they walk, talk, and everything in between. It is something to be mindful of here as we will be meeting very shortly with the Ceann Comhairle to discuss safety measures for female Members in both Houses of the Oireachtas. That is where things are at in this country also. We will get to a stage where we will not have people or will only have very few people coming forward to going to public life. We are looking for more diversity and better female representation and I fear that we are going backwards. We are making it a more toxic place and difficult environment to work in.  It is regrettable to see somebody like Nicola Sturgeon feels she can no longer do the job because of the online abuse. She made a very good point in acknowledging that she is a politician but that she is also human being. Words and how you speak to people matters. We are all, every one of us, impacted by what happens in the online space. We do our best not to read it but we are not able to completely disconnect because we have to use those online tools. They can be very good and helpful because they allow you to connect with people, to talk about what you are doing, what you are going to do, and to discuss your ideas and deal with your constituents but there is a limit in respect of how much negativity one person can process in a day. The job is getting to a point where many people are staying away from doing the work they would like to do, or from the online space, because on certain days, they cannot deal with the negativity. It is incumbent on all of us to perhaps support one another as well and to call it out, to not whip up anger or to encourage a pile-on, which often happens. People will know what I am referring to in that regard and that can also happen within these Houses among ourselves. Sometimes we exacerbate the problem, where perhaps we did not intend to and perhaps sometimes we had intended to. In any event, this should be a warning sign to all of us and we will move on now from that point. Senator Fitzpatrick also spoke about the ongoing humanitarian crisis and emergency in Turkey and Syria and the €10 million that has been sent by the Government to their emergency response. She has made a call on all us to do what we can in donating to the Irish Red Cross or to the Irish Emergency Alliance, and to give our support to those people in need. The scale of the disaster is huge, as is the loss of life and the impending loss of life because of the conditions within which people are trying to survive which is devastating. Senator Fitzpatrick also put on the record some very good news about O'Devaney Gardens, an area and development with which we are very familiar, even for somebody like myself from Mayo, because it has been raised consistently in both Houses for a very long time. It is positive news to see that commencement has happened for the construction of 1,000 new homes in a variety between cost rental, social, affordable and private housing units. It is a very good development and is also good to see some good news in the housing sector for that particular community in Dublin Central. Senator Boyhan dealt with a particular issue and we will come back to him and to Senator Kyne in respect of that. Senator Ó Donnghaile spoke this morning and alerted the House to a rally this Saturday in Parnell Square at 1:30 p.m. in respect of an Ireland for All to celebrate our cultural and ethnic diversity in the country and to celebrate the diverse communities we now have an Ireland. He has encouraged Members to attend and take part in that celebration.  He has also requested statements from the Minister for Foreign Affairs on Israel and I will make that request to the Minister and arrange for that debate at the earliest opportunity. Senator Hoey spoke about the young 16-year-old girl, Brianna, I believe, is her name. Senator Warfield also mentioned her yesterday. It is a very tragic case and it is awful to think that that would happen but it could happen here also. This is something that we need to be very mindful of. The Senator is correct in that language and how we speak about people matters. We have a great deal of work to do in that space. We can turn the tide and it has not gone the way it has gone in the UK here yet. We have an opportunity now to learn from what has happened elsewhere and of other people’s mistakes. We can certainly keep that issue alive and keep talking about it in this House. We send our condolences to Ms Ghey’s family, her community and to her friends. Senator Davitt spoke this morning about Georgia and I will put on the record of House that we are approaching 25 years of the friendship group with Georgia which I think is a significant milestone. I wish the ambassador here and all of the team in the embassy well and I thank the Senator for putting that on the record. Senator Ahearn spoke this morning about the group of young students who will be at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine today between 12 noon and 1 p.m. to present a letter to the Department on biodiversity. They are looking for a policy change in respect of a financial incentive to maintain hedgerows and to pay our farmers to do so. I commend those students on taking the initiative and I hope they enjoy their day at the Department and here at Leinster House as well. He has also requested a debate with the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, in respect of the energy sector and I will request that debate. The Senator raised an issue around the price of electricity. We know that the wholesale price is reducing. The Senator made a very good point to ask why, when the price goes up at wholesale level, the consumer price goes up immediately but that when the wholesale price comes down, the consumer price takes 18 to 24 months to reduce in tandem with this wholesale price change. I do not have the answer to that question but perhaps the Minister may be in a better position to have that debate with us. We will request, then, to have that debate with him. Senator Gavan spoke this morning about the Mandate trade union briefing. All I can say to the Senator is that I did not receive an invitation to that briefing this morning, nor did any of my colleagues. I have checked with our party headquarters and it did not receive an invitation to it. We have asked Mandate to contact us on that particular issue. We were not asked to attend that meeting this morning but we always engage with unions on workers’ rights and I am sure it is the same for other Government colleagues. This is an issue about which we care very much but we cannot be in the room if we are not told about the meeting. Perhaps Senator Gavan might bring that back to the organisers as we would very much like to attend the next meeting.

Senator Craughwell spoke this about Jadotville and made the call again for an independent medals board to be established for those who were serving in that area.  Senators Murphy and Carrigy both wanted to put on the record, as did Senator Ó Donnghaile yesterday, well wishes to Deputy Naughten who, although he will not be retiring for another couple of years, will not be running as a candidate for the Dáil again.

I am sure his community will miss as their public representative. Senator Murphy has also welcomed this morning the opening of the eight-bed hospice unit in Roscommon where he also acknowledged the fantastic work of Mayo Roscommon Hospice Foundation. With all of the fundraising, it was the people on the ground who paid for the building of this hospice. It is a great credit to the people in Roscommon and Mayo that they have built both hospices. The Senator is correct to acknowledge also the Department of Health, the Minister for Health and the staff of the hospice. I wish them well. It is a fantastic service and at some point we will all need that type of service as all families are touched by that. Senator Lombard has requested a debate on the issue of the Residential Tenancies Board and the inability to contact that office. I suggest that a Commencement matter would be an appropriate way to deal with that issue at the outset and if that is not sufficient, we can look to have a debate later on. Senator Keogan asked about a particular niche issue around accountability. I do not have a full response for the Senator but I acknowledge the remarks she has made in that regard. Senator Conway spoke this morning about a story by the journalist Ciara Phelan in the Irish Examiner around the delays in court hearings and proceedings for domestic violence cases. As the saying often goes in legal terms, justice delayed is justice denied. The delays are unacceptable and will need to be addressed. That would be an appropriate issue for a Commencement matter with the Minister for Justice in order to get an update as to exactly where that is at but it may require a fuller debate thereafter. He has also spoken about the VAT rate in tourism of 9%. A debate will be happening with the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, next week and with the Chair of the Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media, Deputy Niamh Smyth, who will also be in the Chamber. That will be an opportunity to raise that particular tourism issue and other issues around tourism. We look forward to that debate. Senator Carrigy spoke this morning about the N4, which is an issue he has raised previously, and, in particular, the section between Mullingar and Rooskey, together with the need for proper, balanced regional development. Senator Seery Kearney spoke this morning on an issue that I am not overly familiar with in respect of an historical site in Chapelizod where she has requested a debate on heritage with the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, and we will request that debate also. Senator Higgins spoke this morning about Nicola Sturgeon. I have already dealt with that particular issue and I concur completely with her remarks on that. In respect of the "fair, firm and hard" comments by the Taoiseach on migration, I cannot give the Senator a response as to exactly what he meant by that. I agree with the Senator in respect of our approach to date which has been very good. We have been very welcoming, have done our very best to accommodate people, and the response from communities and from people on the ground in bringing refugees into their homes and communities has been very positive. We have done ourselves proud and I sincerely hope that we continue in that same vein. That is where we want to be and is the space we want to operate in. We are known internationally as being that friendly and helping hand and looking after people in their time of need. I expect that we will continue to do the very same thing and to do our very best to help those who are fleeing, for whatever reason, but fleeing to try to find a better life for themselves. The door in Ireland is very much open for people. Finally, Senator Dolan welcomed her school this morning Scoil-----

In Senator Currie's view, amendment No. 22 requires a straightforward deletion of the requirement to work for 26 weeks before there is an entitlement to request a flexible working arrangement or remote working. As the legislation stands, the idea is that a person still has to prove himself or herself before being entitled to flexible work, which means we are not embracing a new approach to working after all. Some get access to flexibility and some do not. Social benefits and change come when flexibility is made part of a cultural change rather than something subjected to terms and conditions. The requirement to work in an office environment for 26 weeks, or six months, will hold people back from working and living where they want, if their roles allow it in the first instance. Location will remain a barrier to employment as people will have to base themselves where their jobs are before proving they can work remotely. Senator Currie believes our national strategy of bringing remote work to the regions will be held back as a result of this condition. It will hold back lone parents, people with a disability and others who need flexibility from day one. Under the legislation, such people will have no guarantee after six months that they will be given flexibility.

These amendments propose to delete or alter the proposed section 13B(4) in part or in full. It provides that a flexible working arrangement for caring purposes cannot commence before an employee has completed six months of continuous service with the employer concerned. Providing a minimum length of service of six months before an employee can commence a flexible working arrangement or remote working arrangement allows an employer the time to assess the plausibility and practicality of a request from a new employee. An employer may, of course, waive this period. That is an important point to note. The entitlement to many forms of family leave requires a minimum period of employment with an employer. For parental leave and carer's leave, for example, the minimum period is one year. Statutory sick leave requires a period of 13 weeks' continuous service. The directive itself envisages a notice period for flexible working arrangements. These amendments also propose to delete or alter section 20 in part or in full. It mirrors the flexible working provisions providing that a remote working arrangement cannot commence before an employee has completed six months' continuous service with the employer concerned. Under this Bill, a request for remote working can be made from day one and a remote working arrangement can commence at six months. Again, an employer can waive this period as the intention of the legislation is to provide floor-level protections for employees. In effect, an employee may start a remote working arrangement up to 12 weeks earlier than provided for under the original Bill on the right to request remote working, which, as we know, has been amalgamated into this Bill. We believe the provisions in the latter strike a balance between the need of the employee to have flexible or remote working requirements and the need of the employer to have some sense of the practicalities of the implementation of the request. Therefore, I do not propose to accept the amendments.
#AliceMaryHiggins	unknown-#AliceMaryHiggins-party	unknown-#AliceMaryHiggins-dob	unknown-#AliceMaryHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-15 00:00:00	Gnó an tSeanaid - Business of Seanad	75	I seek more clarification from the Minister. I have amendments in this section also. The Minister indicated the employer can waive the requirement but I do not see where in the Bill this is allowed. In fact, the language is quite strong and clear in this respect. On page 14, subsection (4) states, "An employee's approved flexible working arrangement shall not commence before a time when the employee concerned has completed 6 months continuous employment with the employer concerned." The Minister will be aware that my amendment in the grouping would insert, after "not", "subject to the approval of the employer and the employee". If there were a discretionary right to ensure a flexible working arrangement can begin from the first day, with the approval of the employer, it would be fine, but the legislation states "shall not commence". It does not state "excepting where an employer chooses to have a waiver". In fact, it almost seems to prohibit it. Many employers lose out on really good people because sometimes very good people are available only if there are flexible working arrangements. Women returning to work sometimes have vast experience and incredible qualifications but may be interested in returning only on a flexible basis. If they have to work for six months without flexibility, it almost defeats the purpose. This points to a fundamental misunderstanding of flexible working arrangements as arrangements that solely benefit the employee rather than ones that are very positive and workable and result in work that is as good as, or of higher quality than, that which would otherwise be done. The six-month requirement is creating an unnecessary hurdle. If the Minister is saying employers may have a discretionary agreement for the first six months and then operate based on a legislative arrangement, it seems needlessly messy. In that scenario, somebody would be asked to take a job on the basis of what may come down the line in six months as opposed to a clear, improved flexible working arrangement resulting in a common understanding at the point of deciding to take or do the job.The Minister has mentioned this waiving of this six-month waiting period a number of times but I do not see the clause that allows for it. It may be that it is included in another part of the legislation that I have not seen, in which case I would be delighted and happy to withdraw my amendment.

Employers have a right to offer contracts with terms and conditions that exceed statutory minimums. They cannot contract people out of statutory provisions but they can always give more than is statutorily required. I disagree on one hand in that I believe employers can put in whatever working arrangements they wish. I see the "shall" in the Bill as being restrictive with regard to whether there is recourse to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, which would only be the case where these arrangements were decided upon in a discriminatory manner. There would only be recourse to the WRC from day one with regard to employment equality. The "shall" in the Bill would have the effect of denying the WRC jurisdiction but would not prohibit an employer from providing such an arrangement. In that light, I am half way with Senator Higgins.

The Senator has already spoken about how many employers get really good employees by making work as attractive as possible. What we are working to put in place here is a statutory system that, as Senator Seery Kearney has said, employers will not be able to contract out of and through which they will be bound to offer the right to request these arrangements to all employees, including even employees working in firms that do not see the benefit or understand the attractiveness of the offer of flexible work to employees. We are providing this as a basic level of entitlement. It is a very significant step forward with regard to that right to request but it does not take away an employer's right to offer flexible work arrangements from day one, as some already do.
#AliceMaryHiggins	unknown-#AliceMaryHiggins-party	unknown-#AliceMaryHiggins-dob	unknown-#AliceMaryHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-15 00:00:00	Gnó an tSeanaid - Business of Seanad	78	If there is no objection to employers putting such arrangements in place from the beginning, why not accept the amendment, which would allow employers to apply the statutory measure from day one? It is a choice. If one is choosing between two jobs, it would be good to know. I am happy for the provisions to be subject to an additional bar or to mutual agreement in the first few months but, if both parties who are relevant and affected are happy to waive the six-month period relating to the application of this statutory measure, which has justiciability at the WRC and so on, why not allow for that? Why is the State requiring employers to wait six months before this statutory measure can take effect? For persons who are choosing between two competing offers of employment, it seems like an unnecessary obstacle that contracts can only have this one statutory provision. We have come to a couple of other points whereby the State is imposing an assumed preference on the part of the employer on the legislation rather than allowing flexibility. If it is the preference of the employer and the employee for this statutory provision to begin from day one, why does the State want to impose a six-month waiting period? I appreciate that the Minister may wish for the sole right of initiation, which sits with the employee at the moment, to be there but surely there should be some flexibility from the State in that regard.

This is to ensure that foster parents are able to submit such requests even if they do not have access to a child's birth certificate.

It is important to say that the list of documentation provided for under the legislation is not exhaustive. The proposed section 13B(7) provides for the information an employer may require from an employee who has made an application for a flexible working arrangement, which includes documentation such as a birth certificate or certificate of adoptive placement, although this is not an exhaustive list. Our concern is that it may not be appropriate to insert references to care orders or voluntary care agreements into this section due to the nature and types of orders this could encompass. As the list of documentation is not exhaustive, it is not clear to us what is the purpose behind this amendment. There is an openness to the use of documents as supporting evidence so we do not feel it is necessary to go into this level of detail. We understand that these would already be included as documents that could be used.

While the Minister may choose to understand that these documents are included, employers will not be experts on the foster care system, care orders and so forth. The concern is not that the list needs to be exhaustive. We have already spoken about the concerns regarding people who may not in fact be acting in loco parentis and may not be covered by that definition in another part of the Bill. Rather than putting it on employers, who may not know anything about foster care or the system, to figure out if a care order is a legitimate document, why not specifically list care orders when they are a document likely to be used by those providing foster care, who we expect to be able to use the provisions of this Bill based on our debate the previous day? Why not make life easier for both the employer and the employee seeking to activate this provision by mentioning something that we know is likely to be used rather than leaving it for an employer to interpret the provision, an employer who might argue that such an order is not a birth certificate, which may cause needless stress at what is likely to be a stressful time for those involved? I just do not understand why we do not include it.

The legislation clearly provides for the sort of documentation that would establish personal linkage to prove that personal care is being provided as would be provided in the case where a foster parent is providing care to a foster child. Its inclusion risks becoming overly prescriptive, which is why I do not propose to accept it.

I am leaving it wide open for other documents that may emerge as being relevant. I am not looking for every single document to be listed. That would be if I was looking for an exclusionary list. I am simply saying let us put in and name something we know is likely to be used. That is not the same thing. It is important to be clear on what is being proposed. I am proposing the inclusion of two kinds of documentation not the construction of a completely comprehensive list. With respect, wanting to include one thing is not suggesting we will have to put everything in. That would apply to any of these documents mentioned. It is simply one that we know is likely to be used. It is one that people are not likely to be familiar with. It would be better to name it. I regret the Minister cannot accept the amendment.

It is not really typical of how we would normally approach it. We have already discussed the solely needs-based approach rather than a rights-based or good practice-based approach. It does not focus on work-life balance as a positive good but on the balancing of pressing needs. In the way that some of these are framed there is an assumption of a tension between employer needs and employee needs rather than positive arrangements which may be put in place and which suit all. Section 13C states:(1) An employer who receives a request for a flexible working arrangement submitted in accordance with section 13B(6) shall—(a) consider that request, having regard to his or her needs and the employee’s needs, Consideration of the employee's needs is one thing in this particular arrangement. The same language is echoed elsewhere. In this section it relates to the issue of a flexible working arrangement in respect of care. Framing it in terms of an employer's needs is odd. We do not sign contracts simply with abstract references to the employer's needs. Needs can be anything. Needs can be the need for control or the personal desire to see people smiling at you every day. Instead, when making these decisions, I have suggested inserting "relevant to the functioning of his or her business". It is not this very loose and amorphous phrase of the employer's needs, but specifying the employer's needs that are relevant to the functioning of his or her business. Amendment No. 31 proposes perhaps a better way to put it of describing the needs as "relevant to the fulfilling of the employee’s duties,”. An employer may have multiple needs, which I as one single employee should not be bound to be considering or managing. I should be considering whether I do the job that I have been contracted to do and that I am required to do, and whether I can perform the functions that are relevant to my duties as an employee. That is the relevant thing to consider when considering a flexible work arrangement and not a kind of power balance or emotional play-off of needs. That language relating to the employer is not appropriate for workplace legislation. We should be tying the consideration process to that flexible working arrangement. I accept needs might be appropriate in this case which relates to the flexible caring duties or needs of an employee. However, for an employer the key thing to consider is if the employee can perform the role they have been hired to perform and what the employer needs from them for the functioning of the business. That particular one relates to where an employee is requesting flexible working arrangements in terms of care. Amendment No. 53 relates to a different section, section 20 on the right to request a remote working arrangement. Senator Currie has been very articulate on remote working arrangements. Remote working arrangements are not based solely on need. They should not need to be based on need. Remote working arrangements are not simply based on someone's need to care. It should not be necessary to put a needs case forward when requesting remote working. An employee may simply prefer a remote working arrangement. As we discussed the last day, an employee might simply prefer not to commute four days a week or three days a week. An employee may, for example, like to listen to music while they work. They might want to be able to look out their window. They may think they work better when they are at home. There are lots of reasons for seeking remote working. Framing this as the weighing-up of employees' needs and employers' needs is the opposite of seeking a transformative work-life balance which encourages work-life balance as a positive thing wherever possible. I do not understand why this needs framing is being inserted. The same language is being copied across from something which at least on the employees' side has a need basis relating to the need to provide care. Why is that same language being used for remote working arrangements? This is in section 21 on page 27. I have used the same wording in amendment No. 53. I will reserve the right to come back on that because I think that needs framing is wrong altogether. At a minimum, we should be speaking solely about the needs that are relevant to the functioning of his or her business. I think the needs framing in general needs challenging in that section.

The provision sets out that employers must consider their own needs and the employees' needs. I appreciate that the amendment seeks to add more detail to this point, but there is a risk that this might inadvertently limit the consideration to a narrow frame and disadvantage the employee in some way. Section 21 of the Bill deals with the employer’s obligation to consider a request for remote working arrangements, having regard to the employer’s needs, the employee’s needs and the requirements of the code of practice. In a similar manner to the proposed flexible working amendment, we would have a concern about limiting the scope of consideration as is proposed by amendment No. 53. It is important to note that with regard to the needs framing that the Senator talked about, in using that language, we are replicating the language of the directive that sets out needs framing. Ultimately, this section of the Bill is a transposition of EU law.  On perhaps the beauty of the language, I would share the Senator’s view. The flow is not as if we were drafting it from scratch. However, this is transposition. Certainly, in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, there is a strong view that in order to make sure that our transposition is correct, we are using that language of the directive. That section and the balancing section contained within the directive is an essential element in ensuring the employer’s needs, which is the term used in the directive, and the employee’s needs are appropriately balanced within the domestic legislation that is transposing the EU directive. It is important and we need to take a step back in terms of the functioning of the legislation. The legislation strengthens the employee’s entitlement to consideration further than what was set out in the directive by the introduction of the statutory code of practice. That statutory code of practice was called for in the pre-legislative scrutiny process by the joint Oireachtas committee on the original right to request remote working Bill and that code of practice is now part of this Bill. The detail of the consideration of request will be set out in the code of practice, which will be worked through by the Workplace Relations Commission. This language is being used because we are transposing and the advice we received is that it is important to rely on the language used in the directive. It is also for the practical application of the directive. There are strong protections for the rights of employees here through the innovation that we decided to implement, which is the statutory code of practice.

I accept, to a degree, the point on the coherence of the language. I still have concerns on it. I do not accept that my amendments would have in any way inadvertently disadvantaged employees because my amendments solely related to the definition of “needs” in respect of employers and that there be clarity. On flexible working arrangements, the hope would be that the code of practice would then provide clarity on how the needs question gets interpreted in a meaningful way, for example, making it clear that it should be the needs in relation to the functioning of a business or the performance of a employee’s functions - the kinds of things that I have looked to put in the primary legislation. Am I to understand that the Minister believes that those kinds of concerns can be addressed through the statutory code of practice and the guidance it will provide on the decision-making process for the flexible working arrangement? On the question of remote working, they are quite different. One is, as the Minister said, transposition and there is a need for it. There is a clear needs frame. I have not challenged the fact of a needs frame for the employee regarding the flexible working arrangement. However, remote working arrangements are very different. I would ask that the Minister consider whether the needs framing is the appropriate framing in remote working arrangements. That is not bound by the concerns of the EU directive. That is probably the one where I have the greatest concerns.  I have one amendment that I will press but I indicate now that I will bring further amendments on that section on Report Stage. Simply saying “coherence” and that we used it in one place is not a good enough argument for saying that the Government wants to use the same frame to deal with a completely different situation later on. The right tool for the right task is what is appropriate. A better tool regarding the consideration of requests for remote working could be found. I would urge that rather than cut and paste across, we find something targeted and relevant to a positive approach to remote working. I would also check whether the statutory code of practice will be separate for each or if one code will cover both. Perhaps that could be clarified as well.

The requirement to share a need is intended to be a practical element of a request to support fair and balanced consideration by the employer. It is not intended to force employees to share information they do not wish to. Work-life balance is a legitimate reason of its own right if someone is applying for remote working arrangements. Again, guidance on this element will be developed further through the code of practice. It gives that opportunity for that needs analysis to take place. As the Senator knows, there are well-used practices within the Workplace Relations Commission for the development of codes of practice.

Amendment No. 33 effectively is related to the fact that an employer can extend the period of time of making a decision on a flexible working arrangement request. My amendment states that where there is an extension of the time period for making a decision on a flexible working arrangement request, the employer shall notify the employee in writing of the reasonable grounds on which the extension is required. Basically, this is to ensure that it cannot be simply automatic. At the moment, the Bill simply states that they can extend it by another eight weeks. That is two months. Two months is very long for people, for example, seeking a flexible working arrangement because they have a difficult family situation, such as a family member stepping down from hospital in need of care who needs them to be able to work at home for part of the time.It should not simply be sufficient that the employer can say they have taken a month, and now they are going to take another two months and they will get back to you then. I am not objecting to the extension. I am simply saying that a rationale should be provided. It cannot simply be that they decided not to think about it, or chose not to examine the issue, or that they are basically against giving you this leave so will stall it as long as they can in the hope that your family situation resolves itself and that you stop the request. There are lots of things. It should be reasonable grounds. For example, if you are looking at and examining the work balance in the workplace, or at how the rota might work. Lots of reasonable grounds can be imagined. In such circumstances it is fine for an employer to take an extension. However, an automatic two-month extension on not getting back to somebody leaves people in limbo. It means people will be in limbo for three months waiting for the decision, without knowing why they are waiting that extra two months. It is a reasonable balance for the reason to be given as to why the extension is being taken, rather than sought, because it is there for the taking.
#RodericOGorman	unknown-#RodericOGorman-party	unknown-#RodericOGorman-dob	unknown-#RodericOGorman-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-15 00:00:00	Gnó an tSeanaid - Business of Seanad	102	I thank the Senator. A lot of thought has gone into the process of how these requests will be made, and there is an element of trying to balance the needs of the employees, as the Senator articulated, and the needs of employers. We are covering a diverse range of employers, many where the right to request remote or flexible working will be easily or reasonably easily provided for. However, there are others where it will not so easily be provided for and it will be difficult. It may take some time and consideration. The provision for additional time to consider the request is not automatic. It requires the employer to inform the employee that they are taking additional time. In a situation where they have not been able to come to final conclusion about the reasonableness of the request, to require them to set out why they have not come to that conclusion, I am not sure how beneficial that is, in terms of the process. I hope this reassures the Senator, but what is secured is that there is not an automatic right on behalf of the employer to allow the two extra months to just run on. They have to inform the employee who has made the flexible work request that additional time is needed. Again, in terms of a situation where no final decision has been made, to be looking for reasons for the request for extra time is significant and may not be deliverable in a meaningful way.

It is automatic. It simply states the employer may extend the four-week period by a further period, not exceeding eight weeks. It is absolutely at the discretion of the employer to extend it by the extra two months. Simply saying you have informed somebody that you have extended it by two months does not mean it is not an automatic right to extend it by two months. I was not even taking away the automatic right to extend it. I was simply saying that as well as informing the employee they are taking another two months to decide, it would be reasonable to say they are taking another two months to decide for certain reasons. It is a difficult thing for people even to put in this request, and they are being left in limbo for a quarter of a year waiting for the decision. The Minister mentioned that they may not have come to a conclusion. It may be that they have not even begun the process of thinking about it. By inserting my amendment, where they at least have to give a reason as to why they want the extension, it would be a positive incentive for employers to have at least begun the process. They have to at least have begun the process to be able to give a reason as to why they need the extension. At the moment, difficulty assessing the viability could literally be they have decided not to start assessing the viability. Their schedule could be busy and they could have other things they want to do instead. The imperative in the Bill is very low for an employer to decide within the first month. I do not believe the balance has been rightly struck here, and I would again urge the Minister to consider what I think is an incredibly mild amendment. I am not removing the eight week extension. I was simply looking that, be they only two sentences, a reason would be given for the eight-week extension.

I will speak to the overall grouping, in particular amendments Nos. 36, 55 and 57. The point that Senator Currie is quite keen to get across in relation to amendment No. 36 is that whatever the grounds for refusal are, be it for remote or flexible working arrangements, they need to be reasonable and demonstratable. Using existing parental leave legislation is a good approach because it gives the employee conditions to request flexible work in the first place. The grounds for terminating the arrangement are far too wide, in Senator Currie's view. She is quite concerned about their potentially sweeping nature. What the Senator is trying to do in amendment No. 36, and on what she is hoping the Minister reassure her, is that by adding "reasonable and demonstratable" it puts the onus on employers to be reasonable in refusing or terminating the arrangement in a way that they must be able to demonstrate to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC. On amendments Nos. 55 and 57, the issue here is that it removes the condition that someone might have to be available in the office to cover the work of somebody working remotely. Senator Currie does not see the point of this amendment. If the role is remote, someone is not needed in the office to do it in the first place because the person working remotely is already doing that job from a remote location. The point of remote working is that operations accommodate people and their ability to work from home and work remotely. It is not to expect someone else to do their job when they are not there. On amendments Nos. 55 and 57, Senator Currie believes the legislation misses the point of remote working in the first instance.

These amendments seek to amend the provisions relating to the termination of a flexible or remote working arrangement and could represent an undue interference in how the employer operates his or her business. The proposed insertion of the words "reasonable and demonstratable" is unnecessary. The bar for termination is set appropriately high. Employers cannot terminate an arrangement for trivial reasons. The termination provisions can only be used when the employer is satisfied that the arrangement is having, or would have, a substantial adverse effect on the operation of their business. Employers must be able to stand over the reasons for termination, as they are required to provide the employee with a written notice detailing the grounds. The proposed insertion of the word "business" to limit the employer's consideration of their own needs is also unnecessary as the termination provisions can only be used when the employer is satisfied that the remote working arrangement is having, or would have, a substantial adverse effect on the operation of his or her business. This means that the employer's scope to use this provision is already limited to a significant degree. The final proposed amendment concerns the circumstances where an approved remote working arrangement can be terminated. The unavailability of a person to carry out the duties of the employee at the employer's place of business is a legitimate reason for an employer to terminate a remote working agreement. It is right that employers should retain the authority to make decisions in the best interests of their businesses and be able to respond to challenging circumstances. This Bill does not allow for terminations without due consideration. It requires employers to consider employees' needs, as well as business needs, when making a decision and they must also abide by the code of practice.Employees have a right to make representations to the employer with regard to an employer's proposal to terminate an arrangement and can make a complaint to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, if they believe their employer has not fulfilled their obligations under the section. I am not in a position to accept these amendments.

They demonstrate the fact she has a very good understanding of remote working and how it operates. I do not believe there is the right balance. There are problems with the language in the Bill about the basis on which an employer can withdraw the arrangement. It is very fair to put in the words "reasonable and demonstrable" because, otherwise, a considerable amount is resting on the individual psychology or preferences of an employer. I wish to note areas in this section, because I may bring amendments to them on Report Stage. One of them is the fact that only the employer needs to be satisfied with the arrangement. The person who needs to be satisfied by the argument is solely the employer. If the employer can demonstrate that I agree with myself, as it were, that is almost the bar that is being set here. Even if the issue is brought to the WRC, we do not have objective language such as "reasonable and demonstrable". We simply have the test around whether it is trivial and whether the employer is satisfied with his or her own argument. It is a bit of a tautological loop. The other point is about the concern with the employer's satisfaction. I am concerned not only that the arrangement "is having" but also "would have ... [an] adverse effect on the operation". Rather than give evidence, a person can simply say he or she believes it would have an adverse effect. That person is not being required to demonstrate why it would have an adverse impact or reasonably to show that. He or she is given space for speculation and agreement with him or herself. That is a concern. Even if written reasons go to the employer, who might go to the WRC, there is very little for the employee to lean on unless we have objective standards that are not solely in the psychology of the employer, but are separate, "demonstrable", as Senator Currie said, or "reasonable", which is an established phrase in multiple parts of legislation. We are always asking that things would be reasonable. The word has good legal form. The amendments by Senator Currie are very good. I urge that they be properly considered. If the Minister will not accept them at this point, I urge that he examine section 13E, in particular section 13E(1), and look to how there could be some kind of strengthening or improving of the language in them.

[should] only be valid for the period in which seasonal variations occur and upon the conclusion of that period the flexible working arrangement ... [should] resume." The is an amendment to ensure that seasonal variations in work or business do not prevent flexible work arrangements from being agreed on at all or that we do not have a situation where seasonal variations are used as a reason or an excuse to end a flexible work arrangement permanently where it would be appropriate to continue it outside the period of seasonal variation. We know businesses have one, two or three busy months, such as during a good summer in certain areas. The business may have one busy month, such as a Christmas period which is extremely busy, and requires many more people to be there in-person. However, we should not have a situation whereby some seasonal variation or one or two busy weeks or months in the year are used as a reason, with somebody having gone through the laborious process of flexible working arrangements with regard to care, to fully terminate an arrangement that is working for the other 11 months or 50 weeks of the year. There is a concern that, in the Bill, the fact of seasonal variations, which are very common in many workplaces, is being used as a reason for terminating the norm. The exception is effectively being used to overturn the rule rather than simply accommodating the exception. My amendment seeks to recognise there may be periods where a flexible working arrangement may need to be suspended for a period of time but also to ensure it is not an indefinite suspension or termination of such an arrangement. Amendment No. 58 is a similar issue to amendment No. 37. It relates to the termination of a remote working arrangement due to the circumstances described in subsection (1)(a) with regard to seasonal variation and says that termination, and the language should probably be that it should be a suspension, should only be valid for the period in which such seasonal variations occur, and upon the conclusion of that period of remote working, the remote working agreement should resume. The amendment is to ensure seasonal variations in work and business do not prevent remote work arrangements from being agreed upon and that seasonal variations are not used as a reason to end flexible work arrangements permanently when it is appropriate to continue them outside the period of seasonal variation. There is a process to go through and there may be a three-month waiting period. We do not want a situation where every employee who wishes to have a flexible or remote working arrangement is in a position where he or she needs to reapply for the arrangement. An employee may have to reapply in September, because August was busy, wait another one, two or three months and then it is gone again. That is not serving anybody. It is unnecessary and cumbersome and moves both the employer and employee right back to the beginning of the process, when an employer may simply want flexibility around a temporary suspension of an arrangement rather than having to go back to the very beginning.

It is important to make the point that the provisions of the Bill do not preclude employees from making a request for follow-on, flexible working or remote working arrangements to commence, once a period of seasonal variation concludes. A flexible working agreement could address the seasonality of the workplace with regard to the use of shortened or flexible hours during certain parts of the year. However, that would have to be done with agreement between the employer and the employee as part of the flexible working agreement. Where an employer seeks to terminate on the basis of seasonality, the employee can make a new request, which could be designed to reflect the seasonality of work in that workplace.

When things like this are put in legislation, people will apply, they will do it, it will be this whole process, they will get it and then they will find the arrangements pulled out from under them. This may be done by an employer who says they really need people this month. The Bill does not provide the employer with an option of seeking a temporary suspension for, say, a four or six-week period. The option for the employer is also that they must deal with a whole new request and go through the whole process again from the start. How is that serving anybody? How is that not needless extra paperwork? Why would not provide for this in the legislation? If seasonality is an issue and there are such variations, why not recognise that? Rather than giving this nuclear option of termination to employers, we should give them something they can actually use, like a temporary suspension. That might be something that would serve both employer and employee better, rather than going back to the whole process again and starting that whole piece again. Of course, it does not preclude people going through it again if they wish. Do we as legislators genuinely want people to be accessing flexible and remote work, rather than just pretending to offer it to them and having legislation in order that we can go on the plinth and say, is it not great this is available? If we want something that works, let us look to how it will work in practice. We all know how it will play out if many arrangements are put in place coming into termination in August or in December at a busy time of year. We risk having an initial rush of people applying for this and then the process wears them down and it becomes one of those things people can technically go for but they feel it will only be taken away from them again in six months' time. People will wonder if it is really worth going through the hassle. Why not give tools that will work? When we are saying things to the Minister in the Chamber, I have been concerned by the very flat non-acceptance of what are constructive, straightforward ideas. Why not accept a constructive idea that deals directly with the issue of seasonality in a way that suits both employer and employee rather than lumping seasonality, which is a temporary issue, in with the other more permanent and substantial reasons for termination that are here? Why not treat it differently? It is, after all, different.

In doing so, the seasonal nature of a business will no doubt be a significant part of the considerations about the decision to grant flexible working arrangements or not but also how those flexible arrangements operate. Employers who see the importance of this legislation to making themselves attractive to employees will be able to work to design a flexible working arrangement that includes whatever is necessary to get their business, in terms of their business needs, through a particular seasonal variation in work patterns. It may be the case they try it once and the process does not work but subsequent to that, the employee can come back and seek a new arrangement and the seasonal nature of that particular workplace can be reflected. As for an automatic suspension, if the employer has been concerned enough about the impact of the flexible working relationship on their business, an automatic suspension perhaps does not recognise the potential significance of that impact for the employer by allowing a termination in that situation. The legislation also places no restriction on the employee's right to seek a new flexible arrangement. Thus, the legislation allows for the employer to be able to protect the business if there is a particular part of the season where the flexible working arrangement is creating a concern for them, but it also allows a renegotiation of the flexible working arrangement subsequently.

It is worth reading into the record what exactly is in the legislation. The proposed section 21A(6) states:In making a decision referred to in subsection (1), (2) or (3), an adjudication officer or the Labour Court, as the case may be, shall not assess the merits of—(a) the decision of the employer reached following his or her consideration ... of the employee’s request...(b) the refusal by the employer ...(c) the decision of the employer to terminate ...I have engaged with the Minister and his Department officials on this and that was welcome but as this Bill stands there is, in our reading, no right to appeal the substance of a refusal by an employer or the termination by an employer of a flexible working arrangement. I appreciate this is in some ways a hybrid Bill. It is the Work Life Balance and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill and the right to request remote work Bill 2021 forced together. I previously argued we should be treating flexible work and remote work the same but the key point is when we saw the heads of Bill for the right to request remote work Bill there was genuine outrage at the lack of a right to appeal the substance of a refusal by an employer. There was a provision in the heads that were published to appeal the process the employer and the employee would have undertaken but not the substance of a refusal. That would be a significant shortcoming in this legislation and at odds with the spirt of the rest of our employment legislation whereby if there is a change of working conditions a person has, by and large, a right to appeal that change. That this legislation effectively does not allow a right to appeal a refusal or any decision by the employer with regard to an employee's request is a significant shortcoming. I am aware the Department takes a very different view but it is important we bring this amendment forward because of that shortcoming.

Section 13 inserts a new section 21A into the Parental Leave Act that sets out the process for the consideration of a dispute between an employer and an employee related to Part 2 of this Bill. Section 21A(6) sets out that an adjudication officer or the Labour Court shall not assess the merits of the decision of an employer or a refusal of a request made under Part IIA.This is an important provision. The Senator is right because, and we have always been up front about this, the Bill does not introduce an automatic right to flexible working. It is a right to request such working. In fairness, this has always been described as a right to request. Any dispute can only be in relation to the request process and the procedure set out in respect of whether the employer has complied with the various processes set out in the legislation. The Senator's proposed amendment would extend the power of the adjudication officer or the Labour Court beyond what is set out in the Bill and would look at the reasoning and question the reasoning the employer used. I know that is the Senator's intent, but it is not what we are in a position to legislate at this point, nor is it what we were ever proposing to legislate for. That is our position on amendment No. 46. The same concern arises in the context of amendment No. 63. This would provide a right to remote working. Again, this is not what we are purporting to provide here. It is important to say that we have strengthened the process of the adjudication. Bringing in the code of practice will be important in terms of ensuring that there is a robust examination of the process the employer has undertaken regarding consideration of a request. Ultimately, however, this legislation provides for a right to request. We all speak about the changed work circumstances, but it is important to recognise that here are many workplaces in which remote working is not possible. All of us are lucky that many of the jobs we do can now be done remotely, but large parts of the workforce do not enjoy this ability. It is important that we recognise this and the fact that the additional benefits are not fully and evenly distributed as yet. We must also recognise that in certain workplaces a right to request remote working is not going to be a reality because working remotely simply does not meet the requirements of that particular workplace now.

Is that agreed? Agreed. Any Senator who wishes to speak on amendment No. 63 must do so now. I call Senator Higgins.
#AliceMaryHiggins	unknown-#AliceMaryHiggins-party	unknown-#AliceMaryHiggins-dob	unknown-#AliceMaryHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-15 00:00:00	Gnó an tSeanaid - Business of Seanad	120	A pattern is emerging. Of course not every workplace is suitable for remote working. If we have proper legislation, then reasonable grounds can be shown. I refer to the reasonable and demonstrable language Senator Currie is talking about and the kind of language Senator Sherlock is putting forward in respect of reasonableness as well. If there is a reason why remote working is not appropriate, that is fine. However, we must look to the pattern here in respect of the amendments being rejected. I refer to every amendment that seeks reasonableness be applied or inserted into the process anywhere, the idea that reasons might have to be given to explain why decisions have not been yet been taken and a request in terms of reasonableness around the presentation of reasons for terminating an agreement. Equally, there is the point being made in this amendment regarding even allowing the Workplace Relations Commission to talk about reasonableness. There is a line between the right to request remote working and having an automatic right to it. A right to request remote working should be one where there is a right to request this facilitation and that, where reasonable, it would be granted. This is different from having an automatic right to remote working, but it is not as vague as a situation whereby employees are being allowed to shout into the wind. In this instance, who will know what will have happened in employers' minds? Nobody will be able to assess in any way whether the decision made is reasonable. Why should the Workplace Relations Commission not be able to comment on the reasonableness of a response to a request? It may not have the power to force an agreement and an obligation in terms of remote working and this might well be one thing that would be a step further in this context. Surely it should be able to comment on the reasonableness of requests. Going back to some of the other language referred to earlier concerning situations where an employer is satisfied about what might happen in the future, where employees are satisfied and where nobody comments on it, the Minister indicated that they can go to the Workplace Relations Commission. This body is not going to be able to help them at all, however. This whole process that the Minister spoke about regarding all these reasons being written out and provided to the employees to explain why it has been decided not to provide an arrangement or, indeed, to terminate such an arrangement is worth nothing because the Workplace Relations Commission can do nothing with it. The commission cannot comment on the matter. The Minister referred to narrowing the scope. I hope we do not get lots of little videos popping up on Twitter saying that we have brought in remote working and we are brilliant, because the Minister has been really clear that he is not bringing in a right to remote working. The right to request remote working is there as a process, but there is not even going to be a requirement of reasonableness properly inserted into the legislation in respect of the decision-making process relating to these requests. I do not think that this is great news. The Minister stated that he wanted to be clear and not overly ambitious, but I can anticipate the media response we are going to get after this section goes through. The more we look at it, the weaker and weaker it appears. It is really disappointing. The time to introduce meaningful remote working and a right to it is now. The Minister mentioned different employees in different categories. He is correct. That is what this comes back to again and again. There are those who will be in a strong negotiating position with an employer. There will also, though, be many people who desperately need flexibility and who would really like to and know they could do a job remotely, but where the power imbalance is going to be weaker. In this case, the legislation will not even require an assessment of reasonableness in relation to how that power, which is stacked heavily in favour of the employer, is going to be exercised.

We know that not all work is suitable for flexible working conditions. I do not think any of us advocating for a right to flexible work has ever said that, notwithstanding that some on the Government side - and I am not saying this about the Minister - have tried to throw this at us. The key question is whether it is the role of the Government and legislation to decide what work is suitable for flexible work arrangements or whether it should be left up to the Workplace Relations Commission. Effectively, this legislation is reflecting a conservative mindset, truth be told, towards the scope of flexible work here. It is a sad reflection on the Bill that we are not allowing the right to appeal the substance of what is proposed. I accept that we are not going to change anybody's minds here, but it is important to say that the role of legislation in this regard should be to try to facilitate a right to request remote working or whatever. The key point is that we are placing a restriction on employees' right to challenge the substance of refusals.

I have certainly never advertised it as anything else. It is a significant change, and we should be cautious not to talk down what is going to be a significant advance in terms of the rights workers have. We must recognise that the provisions here have been strengthened throughout the process. Significant changes were made between the pre-legislative scrutiny phase and the Bill coming before the Dáil, where is was amended further. An important change is the introduction of the code of practice, which will be developed by the Workplace Relations Commission in the context of its experience in this area. Fundamentally, however, this is about a right to request. That is what is being delivered in the context of the legislation. We have also put in place the ability to review this legislation within a tight timeframe. I do not believe it will happen, but if some of the concerns raised by Senators throughout this process arise, there will be an opportunity to address them by means of the review, which will take place after the legislation has been in operation for two years.
