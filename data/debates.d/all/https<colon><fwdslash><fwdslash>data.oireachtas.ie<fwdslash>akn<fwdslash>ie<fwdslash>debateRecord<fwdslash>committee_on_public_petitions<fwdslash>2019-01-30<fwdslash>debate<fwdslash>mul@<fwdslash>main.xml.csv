The next petition for consideration is Petition No. P00046/18. It is proposed that we correspond with the Department of Justice and Equality seeking an update on this issue when work is finalised and leave the petition open. We will forward a copy of the reply from the Department to the petitioner and inform her that we are leaving the petition open. Is that agreed? Agreed.

The visa is issued to the spouses or partners of workers who have come to Ireland in response to a critical skills shortage and are effectively facilitating the growth of our economy and in many ways keeping the economy going. There is a very strong case for allowing those with a stamp 3 visa the right to work without having to go through the work permit system.That would do justice to the families coming to Ireland and remove some of the related burden from the work permit system. I agree with the recommendation of the committee that we should keep the petition open. I note that the responses from the two Departments involved in this matter have been quite positive in terms of seeking to do something about it. It is important that the committee maintains its interest in this petition.

I am happy to await the update from the Department. It would be appropriate for the committee to keep the petition open on that basis. I think we are agreed on that. I acknowledge the visitors in the Public Gallery who I understand may be guests of Deputy Brendan Ryan. The final petition for consideration is Petition No. P00048/18 relating to motor tax issues. It is proposed that we forward a copy of the response from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to the petitioner and close the petition. Is that agreed? Agreed.
