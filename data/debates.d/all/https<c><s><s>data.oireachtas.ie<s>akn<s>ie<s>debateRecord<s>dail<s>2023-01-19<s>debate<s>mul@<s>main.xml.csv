How are they being addressed in terms of staffing, recruitment hours, overtime and in the proposed changes to work practices, which have been overwhelmingly opposed by workers? I extend my best wishes to the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, in his new role and I ask him to outline how these backlogs will be addressed.

The operation, oversight and delivery of the NCTS is the statutory responsibility of the Road Safety Authority, RSA, and it is the RSA which is responsible for the management of the contract for the NCTS with its contractor, Applus Inspection Services Ireland Ltd. As Minister of State at the Department of Transport, I do not have a specific role in operational matters, including the appointment of personnel by the NCTS or the conditions of their employment in that capacity. Accordingly, I have not had any meetings with trade unions on this matter. However, both I and my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, are cognisant of the difficulties motorists are experiencing when trying to secure test appointments and that this is causing immense worry and frustration. My officials are continuing weekly meetings with the RSA to monitor the ongoing work to reduce test delays and ensure all possible actions are being taken to bring the waiting list to an acceptable level in 2023. My Department has facilitated any appropriate requests made to it as regards improvements. For example, at the RSA’s request, the Department engaged with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to secure approval for the recruitment of inspectors from outside the European Economic Area, EEA. Strong progress is being made in addressing the long-term staffing issues behind this backlog. Over 60 inspectors were recruited locally in 2022 and a further 50 vehicle inspectors started during the last week of 2022, bringing the total number of vehicle inspectors to 595 by the end of 2022. Further recruitment is ongoing in 2023, with seven more inspectors in training and an additional 15 recruits waiting to be trained. A number of other measures to provide additional capacity at test centres are also in place, including increased staff overtime; the temporary transfer of 20 testers from the NCTS contractor’s Spanish operation for a period of three months, eight of whom will continue for a further 12 months; and the forthcoming pilot for additional inspection personnel to assist vehicle inspectors with automated elements of the test. Testers are being assigned to the test centres with the most significant delays. The RSA and NCTS have set a target to return the average waiting list to 12 days, as per the service level agreement. That has been set out for May of this year. My Department will continue to monitor progress towards that goal in the coming months and I am confident that we will soon see the positive impacts of the recruitment that has been done and the changes that have been made. It is unacceptable when a contract-----

The backlog is getting longer, as reported. For mid-January it is 26.5 days and for mid-September and October time it was 24.1 days. The backlog is getting longer and I can see that in the next available test in Greenhills being at the end of August. The next available test in Drogheda is on 18 September and in Kells it is 1 August. That is way off into the distance. I want to ask about the efficient use of the available slots. This priority waiting list is like a black box; it is a great unknown. It strikes me that the NCTS can do more to make efficient use of the available slots and prioritise those who are due their tests in the shortest time.

The message is that anyone who is due a test shortly might see that a test date is set out for a number of months time but they should attempt to go on the priority waiting list. That is there as a means to give people a test much more quickly. A growing number of people are doing that and we need to ensure that those who are due a test shortly do that. I have reflected on this and some of the user interface can be strengthened from a technological perspective. I have seen examples myself where there might be a test in another location not too far from where an applicant wants his or her test that might take a shorter wait time but where the system forwards the test to August, as the Deputy has said. I encourage people who are due a test shortly to go onto the priority waiting list. People on that list are receiving tests much more quickly than those who are looking at the test dates months out.

Does the Department have a clear workforce plan for recruitment for this year, for example? The Minister of State mentioned overtime but NCT workers are contacting me and saying there is overtime available but that the NCTS is not paying overtime rates. It is not giving time-and-a-half so very few inspectors are taking up the overtime. Is that something the Minister of State is aware of? I am sure the Minister of State is aware of the outcome of the ballot. Is there a risk that we will have an industrial dispute at NCT centres between now and the next couple of months? These delays might get worse rather than better because of the intransigence of the company to take the right measures to address the backlog and instead in looking to cut corners, as it is intending to do.

There has also been a significant increase in staff overtime, allowing for 12 tests per tester per day. The RSA has agreed to the Applus proposal to recruit additional inspection personnel at Quality and Qualification Ireland, QQI, level 5 to assist vehicle inspectors with the automated machine-led element. This stems from a November 2022 Labour Court recommendation for a 12-month pilot for Dublin test centres, indicating that no more than 10% of the workforce should be made up of inspection support personnel. All vehicle inspectors are qualified mechanics who will retain responsibility for conducting the NCT tests and for signing off on the issuing of the certificate. The Department has received assurances from the RSA that the appointment of inspection support personnel will not result in the loss of any existing jobs and that there will be no reduction in the quality of tests being carried out at NCT centres.Any new employees will supplement the existing staff to increase testing capacity with the objective to increase the overall number of testing staff to meet the high demand.

Some from the outside might say that they live near the airport, but that is not the reason these communities are angry. They are angry because these routes of take-off and landing do not comply with any of the routes set out in the 2007 planning permission for the north runway or any of the routes that were presented in multiple public consultations since. Has the Minister of State or his Department engaged with any of the authorities on this issue?
#JackChambers	unknown-#JackChambers-party	unknown-#JackChambers-dob	unknown-#JackChambers-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	8	As the Deputy will be aware, Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, holds statutory responsibility for the management, operation and development of Dublin Airport. Noise mitigation at Dublin Airport is subject to substantial regulation and oversight as well as best practice mitigation measures. Following the opening of the north runway in August last year, an issue regarding the runway's departure flight paths was identified that resulted, as the Deputy has stated, in some local communities being unexpectedly overflown. When this issue was identified, I understand that DAA advised local communities and elected representatives that it had commenced a review with the aim of resolving the issue. When the review was complete, the authority reverted to these stakeholders advising that the current standard instrument departures, SIDs, would be updated, resulting in flight paths aligning more closely with those previously consulted on and used as part of the planning process. All flight paths at Dublin Airport are governed by international safety standards and, therefore, the revised SIDs required regulatory review and approval before being implemented. DAA, in conjunction with the IAA air navigation service provider, ANSP, submitted a revised departure process to the safety regulator for the required safety assessment, which was subsequently approved. The revised departure procedure then had to be submitted for promulgation to all aircraft manufacturers as required under International Civil Aviation Organisation, ICAO, safety rules. This is so that the revised fight path can be input to aircraft instrument systems. The ICAO process requires a minimum of two months’ notice and provides for fixed dates as to when such information can be submitted. DAA has confirmed that the new flight path will be operational from 23 February 2023, and aircraft will operate the revised departure process from that date. In the interim, the continued use of the current departure process is necessary. However, DAA has committed to ensuring there are no departures off the north runway before 9 a.m. during this period. Finally, DAA has advised that the overall number of houses in the various noise contours will be similar to that previously communicated. However, detailed modelling is currently being completed, and DAA anticipates that a small number of additional houses may become eligible for mitigation measures as a result of the revised flight paths.

The revised flight paths we are expecting at the end of February were published by the IAA two days ago. There is great concern that the revised plans are not going to be similar to what was granted in the 2007 planning application, and that aircraft will fly over communities that never thought that they would be overflown such as Ballyboughal, Rowlestown and Kilsallaghan. There has been a huge breach of trust and there is a collapse in trust in the communities there. All local and statutory bodies need to be out in the communities speaking with the residents because they feel they are being ignored and are being given the runaround. They feel that they are not being told the truth about what their lives are going to be like in the coming months and years ahead.

As I said, noise mitigation at Dublin Airport is subject to substantial regulation and oversight and best practice mitigation measures. These measures are designed to address the long-term adverse effects of noise, particularly at night, while also facilitating the sustainable development of the runway. With regard to planning matters and enforcement, as the Deputy will be aware, any enforcement complaint can be made by communities. That is a matter for Fingal County Council and the relevant authorities if they wish to submit a complaint, which is their right.

I ask him to ask the DAA and Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, to make a presentation to the communities on the new the flight paths prior to them coming into operation. The communities have requested this on a number of occasions. They are engaged communities that understand the airport, flights and the issues involved. They are adept and experienced with community engagement, but they are being ignored on this issue. The communities and Deputies are being given vague responses. At a meeting of the Joint Committee on Transport and Communication yesterday, we were told that the flights, as they exist now, are in compliance with the 2007 planning permission. Anyone who is on nodding terms with that knows that prima facie there is a question mark over that. There is a huge breakdown of trust. We need to see better community engagement. I ask the Minister of State to ask DAA and the IAA to do that before the new flight paths come into operation at end of February.

There is a process in place relating to ICAO safety rules that includes the inputting of flight data. That has to be promulgated months in advance, and has happened. However, I take the Deputy's point about community engagement. I will reflect the feedback that he has given as an elected representative for Fingal and the necessity for DAA and others to engage with communities so that they can pass on their feedback. The process of engagement will not be able to impact the new flight path, which has been promulgated and will become operational from 23 February.

Antisocial behaviour is a wider societal issue to which public transport is not immune, and I fully recognise that those who regularly use and work within our public transport network are most directly impacted by any associated incidents. Safety and security on public transport are matters that, first and foremost, must be managed by every public transport company, in conjunction with An Garda Síochána, where appropriate. Nonetheless, both my Department and the National Transport Authority, NTA, engage regularly with operators on the issue, and the NTA has established a working group on antisocial behaviour which meets monthly with the operators to discuss developing trends and share best practice. Further, each of the operators have their own safety and security policies in place to deal with issues such as antisocial behaviour, and have introduced a number of initiatives in recent years to help combat the issue. This includes increased investment on security, with a more than 50% increase in spending on rail security in the past five years, from €3.7 million in 2016 to €6 million last year. We have also seen the wider deployment of CCTV. The entire Dublin Bus fleet is fully fitted with CCTV cameras, with up to 11 internal cameras and three external cameras fitted on the more modern vehicles in the fleet. Radios on each Dublin Bus vehicle facilitate immediate contact to a central control centre. There are also text alert systems, and joint initiatives with An Garda Síochána, such as Operation Twin-Track. Additionally, as part of my Department’s sustainable mobility plan, the NTA has committed to develop and publish an annual public transport passenger safety and personal security report and implement measures where appropriate. The combined interventions implemented to date have substantially helped tackle antisocial behaviour. However, it will require ongoing monitoring and, therefore, I am committed to continuing to work with all stakeholders to ensure the safest possible travel environment for members of the public, and the safest possible working environment for the employees providing our valuable public transport services.

In one case, a lady going by the pseudonym of "Debbie" feared she would be raped or killed by a mob. She said she still sees the person when she closes her eyes. It is clear that what the Minister is doing is not working. It has an effect on people using public transport. It has an effect on public transport services in individual areas. Good people deserve the services in Tallaght and everywhere else and it has an impact on attracting people to work in these services. What is the Minister going to do about it that will address it?

It is totally unacceptable and all of us collectively have to make sure they are protected and safe in what they are doing. There was significant development with the Tallaght stakeholder forum meeting this week. That is very important. This best way for us to counter this is for local representatives, trade union representatives, Dublin Bus and An Garda Síochána to work together. There have been additional patrols by gardaí in the area. We have arranged undercover gardaí on a number of the different services. Dublin Bus had to make its call in terms of the route adjustments to protect its drivers. We are all agreed that this is intolerable, however. The greatest suffering, as well as to Dublin Bus drivers, is to the people in west Tallaght who deserve to get the full services to which they are entitled. It is true in my mind that a co-operative approach in the stakeholder forum where we work collectively with public representatives, Dublin Bus, trade unions and An Garda Síochána together is the best way of addressing this issue.

I want to point towards the private security spend of our bus and rail operators and the impact this has on driver recruitment. It is a huge challenge in deterring people from using public transport. The Minister points towards CCTV, which is an after-the-fact matter. It is clear it is not having the impact. When the State wants to respond it is too reactionary, but when it does respond, it puts gardaí on bus services. That is what it did in west Tallaght. That is the approach. I find it incredible that there is not a clear plan to address this problem that involves a public transport unit. We hear it from Fianna Fáil repeatedly, locally and nationally. There needs to be a far clearer and more comprehensive plan to deal with this. It is not just in west Tallaght; it is in other areas as well. We have raised it repeatedly. When the various measures are taken into account, it is clear that the deployment of gardaí on those services really has an impact.

I agree with him on that. I know there are different views. Some people are arguing that we should have another completely separate police service for the transport system. I do not agree with that. I think it is best managed within An Garda Síochána, which is best placed with the immediate response system it has. I agree with the Deputy on that. The Garda manages that in terms of how many gardaí it puts on services. As I said, it is operating more patrols in the areas now where we have a particular problem and has also deployed undercover gardaí. That is the appropriate response. That is an operational matter for An Garda Síochána but absolutely we are supporting it. The Government will support it with whatever resources it needs as it determines how best to work with Dublin Bus as it does with Bus Éireann, Luas, Irish Rail and the other transport operators. I believe An Garda Síochána with its operational capability has the key people who must provide the protection our bus employees need.

My Department is actively assisting the RSA in tackling the long-term labour shortages of qualified mechanics which have contributed to the current testing backlog and the corresponding difficulties for vehicle owners to secure suitable test dates. This is a serious issue that is being addressed by extensive recruitment domestically and outside the EU and EEA, and, in the longer term, by training and upskilling programmes, which the RSA has discussed with the Teachers Union of Ireland, TUI. These are not overnight solutions but we can expect that real progress will be made in the coming weeks towards a target to return to an average of 12 days by May 2023, although efforts will continue to achieve this earlier if possible. My officials will continue to keep the situation under close monitoring and review through weekly meetings with RSA management. In the immediate term, there are mechanisms in place to assist vehicle owners to secure a test appointment. I am advised by the RSA that a priority waiting list is in place and that motorists should apply if they require an appointment sooner than those that are available in the public booking system. NCT test appointment slots become available through cancellations or rescheduling of appointments. Customers are dealt with in the order they go on the list. I am aware that many motorists will have concerns about potential difficulties regarding their motor insurance and not having a valid NCT if stopped by gardaí. Insurance Ireland has indicated that its members will adopt a pragmatic approach where cover will continue to be provided if vehicle owners provide evidence that they have attempted to secure a test appointment before the expiry of their roadworthiness certificate but have been unable to because of the current backlog. Separately, both the RSA and my Department have made An Garda Síochána aware that some vehicle owners have had issues securing an appointment. Motorists should keep a record of their upcoming test date in their vehicle. As the Deputy has stated, it remains an offence to drive a vehicle on Irish roads without a valid NCT under road traffic legislation. It is an essential public health and safety measure, and an important component of the road safety strategy. Since its introduction, through the detection of defaults such as-----

A contract is a two-way thing and they are reaching their contractual obligations.

I had a look nationally at the 49 centres and none of them come in within the 28 days in terms of the information that is published on their website. In fact, nobody has been given what the RSA advertises as a free test if they do not comply with that. Why is that? Who would pay for that? Is that a penalty on the company? Why is it not offering that given that it is on its website? Has the Minister of State asked the RSA about that? There are really serious issues with regard to, for example, when something goes wrong. If there was an accident, would a non-valid NCT lead to a loss adjuster mitigating a payout? It is all very well saying that the companies will be pragmatic and understanding, but people are not in compliance because the system is not capable of being in compliance.

That is why the RSA is in a legal process with Applus on imposing penalties on the company, which is not delivering the service that has been contracted to the State. What we are trying to do as a Department is to provide every assistance we can in terms of getting that extra recruitment, whether it is within the European Union or outside of it. The Deputy outlined some test dates that are projected into the summer and beyond. There is a priority waiting list and the majority of cases are provided with an appointment within the 30 days. The Deputy also referenced the free tests. A free-of-charge test will be provided where an appointment can be offered within a 28-day period but there are a number of conditions attached to that, which are outlined in the customer charter.We are engaging on a weekly basis on this. It is not acceptable that the public service has not matched what is contracted and that is why there is a legal process under way on imposing penalties. On the broader point, a European directive underpins this. Provision of flexibility and dates being extended are not possible under the European framework.

If everybody was on that list, it would not solve the problem of the lack of personnel to do the job. The priority list is for exceptions. People will want to be in compliance. That is why the lists are so long. People are trying to be in compliance. The worst one on the list was Kells at 42 weeks. Nowhere in the country is good but the top ten are all in Leinster. The Dublin centres are all in that top ten. Carndonagh in Donegal is the quickest of the centres but they are all bad across the country. None are in compliance, according to the NCT.

There are 31,200 people on the priority waiting list. The conditions that apply, I have been informed by the RSA, are that a free test will be provided where an appointment cannot be offered within 28 days, unless any of the following apply: the test is overdue by more than seven days at the time of contacting the NCT service; an appointment was offered seven days or more prior to the test due date; the customer has made specific requests regarding suitable days, times or dates; the customer has declined or rearranged two or more appointments; the customer has failed to attend an appointment; or the customer had previously accepted or requested an appointment outside the 28-day period. I encourage everyone with a projected test date far beyond their due date to seek to get on the priority list. We should encourage more people to get on that list. That will put the pressure on Applus to drive the capacity and output that is required and that may result in some on the priority waiting list getting a free test if they go beyond the 28-day period. It is not an acceptable situation. I have reflected that to the RSA. This service is not being delivered as per the contract. Penalties should be imposed. When we contract a public service to a company and it is not delivering, there have to be consequences. It is not acceptable. The service should be delivered to the proper standard. We have been given assurances that it is due to get back to the level in the service level agreement by May this year. We will monitor that closely. It is totally unsatisfactory.

I heard what the Minister said to Deputy O’Rourke about the NTA's antisocial behaviour specialist group but what is the Department doing in respect of it?

The role of my Department, as the Minister of State mentioned on another issue, is working with the NTA and operators. We meet them regularly. If there is an issue with security, reliability, getting workers or other things, while we do not run the bus service or train system, our aim is to make sure they deliver for the public the quality of service we expect. The first principle is that people have to feel that they are secure and that they are in a safe place. Where there are problems, they are in specific localities or black spots. By and large, the vast majority of experience on our public transport system is safe, as people would attest. Where it is not, it is a matter not just for the Government. Local representatives have a critical role because they have knowledge and experience of what is happening and represent the local community best. For them to work with the operators and An Garda Síochána directly is the best approach. What is happening in west Tallaght is totally unacceptable but the resolution to that provides a model that would apply elsewhere. It involves the application of Garda resources in conjunction with the operators, as well as the use of CCTV and other mechanisms. You cannot completely rely on that. CCTV does not protect the driver in the instant. He or she has to have the capability of calling in resources quickly. Our role is to make sure the resources are available. The Minister for Justice is also critical. The Department for Transport has responsibility. That is what we are doing. Communication of the public concern is the first stage.

It is worthwhile that we are discussing this important issue. I agree with him that obviously not all public transport has the threat of criminal activity or antisocial behaviour on it but unfortunately many members of the public are concerned about it. Last summer, my Fianna Fáil colleagues in Dublin and I did a survey of public transport users. There was a significant response. Over 1,300 people replied. Significantly, nearly 90% of them had experienced or seen antisocial behaviour on public transport. Many of them were supportive of there being a dedicated public transport unit within An Garda Síochána. That is where this policy debate is heading. Nobody thinks all these issues can be resolved immediately but we need to recognise the requirement for a unit within An Garda Síochána to be available to police public transport. It is not the Minister’s bailiwick but does he have an opinion on whether that would be beneficial?

The Deputy is right. I said to Deputy O’Rourke earlier that there is an argument in favour of establishing a unit outside An Garda Síochána, but I do not think that would be appropriate or correct. I recently visited the new control centre in Heuston Station, where the Garda response control unit is cheek by jowl with the rail control centre. That closeness, connection and speed of response is an advantage of using An Garda Síochána, as well as all the powers it has under law. The Garda has other units. The transport department unit is a similar example of a dedicated unit. That should be considered. The justice committee might be well placed to do it and I would happily give my views there. I would not rule it out. I would be supportive but it is a matter for the Minister for Justice to consider first and foremost.

I agree with the Minister that it is not a good idea for this country. It would create tensions for An Garda Síochána and the country is not large enough to have a separate independent police force for public transport. However, we need to look for a dedicated unit within An Garda Síochána. This is primarily a matter for the Government and the Minister for Justice. We have a recruitment crisis in An Garda Síochána and I understand why the Commissioner may be hesitant about committing to the establishment of another unit when he has many other demands on resources, but we need to recognise that to see the level of engagement and use of public transport that the Minister and everyone else in the House wants, we have to assure people that when they use it, particularly late at night or on routes some consider dangerous, they will be safe. Unless there is safety for users of public transport, we will not get the increase in usage of it.

We want to get people onto public transport for so many different reasons and making sure there is a safe environment is critical to that. This is happening. I was on the radio this morning and I mentioned some figures I saw yesterday. I think 80,000 young people have taken up the leap cards and new travel cards. They are taking off. On the issue of public transport numbers, I met with an international expert on transport who said that what is happening in Ireland is unusual and outside the norm. Most other countries have not seen the scale of return to public transport that we have done post-Covid-19. The public is, therefore, responding. Some 67 towns have new public transport services. New Local Link and Connecting Ireland services have been rolled out across the country. There has been a major expansion in public transport. We want it to be used and it has to be safe. In any discussion on that, those arguments would make the case for the type of unit within An Garda Síochána to which the Deputy refers. We could go into virtuous circle. The more people who are on the public transport system, the safer it will feel. That is where we want to go. Policing is a critical part of this, but that part of the question needs to be directed towards the Minister for Justice and that Department.

I would first like to address the broader issue of driver testing delays, which is a problem across the State and has been raised by a number of Deputies. The current national average waiting time for an invitation to a test is 19 weeks, which is far above the service level agreement, SLA, of ten weeks. This is reflective of demand on driver testing services which is up by 28% on 2021 figures and is up 27% on 2018 pre-Covid-19 pandemic figures. I am informed that the current increase in demand for driving tests and the time to an invitation for learner drivers have a number of contributing factors. These include an increase in learner permits in circulation, which has grown by approximately 30% since the third quarter of 2019; increased capacity in the driver theory test when the service resumed post-Covid-19 pandemic; and an increase in advanced driving instructors capacity to deliver lessons to learner drivers, which has increased the number of learners becoming eligible and ready to take their test. I assure the Deputy that the RSA is making every effort to manage these demand pressures. The authority conducted a review of the current and evolving needs of the driver testing service in 2022, following which the Department of Transport sanctioned an increase in the permanent driver tester headcount from 100 to 130. I am informed that the RSA is currently deploying a number of successful candidates across the driver testing service, with a focus on geographical areas with the longest waiting lists. It is expected that the remainder will be deployed by the first quarter of 2023. However, I acknowledge there is further work to be done to provide the driver testing services that each customer deserves and that the RSA is committed to delivering.  I have been assured by the RSA that it is keeping this situation under constant review and the authority will report back to my Department on the steps being taken to continue to reduce waiting times. If sanction requests for further increases in driver testers are received, we will evaluate them promptly.

A large number of people get in touch with me and I subsequently get in touch with the RSA. Some have been waiting for six months to get a test and it is just not good enough. The target timeframe is ten weeks but the figures show that people are waiting 19 weeks to get an invitation. I can give many examples of where a test date is nearly due and then the appointment is put back by another month or two. It is not good enough. The Minister of State said that the RSA is making every effort, but what effort is it making because this situation is getting worse? This issue stems back to the fact that last year a cohort of 32 trained driver instructors who were employed on a temporary basis were not made permanent. We have a growing population and we have only 130 testers now.

People are waiting 19 or 20 weeks or even more in certain cases and that is not an acceptable public service. If we are being honest, the service level agreement of ten weeks needs to be examined as well. For me as Minister of State, even ten weeks is too long as I am concerned. There is constant engagement with the RSA on this. There has been an increase in the permanent headcount from 100 to 130. I met with my officials on this yesterday. Building capacity is important from a road safety perspective. The new road safety strategy is called “Vision Zero”. We have to ensure that the driver testing system can be accessed in a timely manner and the ongoing delays are causing frustration for people. Since I entered the role it has been something I want to remedy and bring solutions to. I assure the Deputy that every effort will be made to try to build capacity within the testing system to improve the current position.

Every effort must be made. He has to set out a timeline to achieve those target waiting periods of ten weeks. I am encouraged by his comment that even that is not acceptable and that it needs to be reviewed. We need testers in place to reduce the number of people who are waiting. There is a particular issue on the west coast, particularly in County Clare, regarding the availability of testers to carry out the tests. The waiting periods there are longer and that is why I have asked for the numbers that are waiting in each test area, as well as for the numbers of testers who have been allocated to each test centre. In the Minister of State’s initial reply, he stated that the RSA will redeploy to areas where there are longer waiting lists. If he has those figures for County Clare, he might outline them.

The 30 permanent drivers that have been recruited are being deployed to the areas where people are waiting for the longest. The focus of the RSA and its operational plan is on those who have been waiting for the longest. All of County Clare is beyond the service level agreement time, but those in Shannon and Ennis in particular are waiting far in excess of what they should be. I will reflect the Deputy’s feedback to the RSA, which is deploying additional capacity in those areas where people are waiting longest. I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.

These are two key pieces of infrastructure that would provide a much better connection with Sligo, the north west and Dublin and would provide similar connectivity to what Galway, Cork and Limerick have, reducing the current regional imbalance that has been well documented in recent reports.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	43	These two schemes are distinct from each other, as one is a national road and the other is a local road. I will, therefore, update separately on each scheme. The N4 is the national primary road between Dublin and Sligo and it connects to both the N5 to Westport and the N6 to Galway and Athlone, forming a strategic corridor to the north west. The proposed upgrade aims to address congestion issues in Carrick-on-Shannon and to improve a section of the N4 route between Drumharlow townland in County Roscommon, which is north of Carrick-on-Shannon, and Faulties townland, which is south of Aghamore in County Leitrim. The scheme’s route option selection phase is nearing completion, with the preferred transport solution having been announced. This was displayed publicly in May and June last year. The preferred transport solution is available to view in detail at the scheme website. Following the completion of the route selection, the design and environmental evaluation phase will develop the project design further to allow for progression through the necessary statutory processes. With regard to the eastern Garavogue bridge in Sligo my Department, together with the urban regeneration and development fund, has been providing grant funding for this scheme. The project will support urban regeneration in Sligo by improving community links, facilitating reduced journey times for walkers, cyclists and vehicles between the north and south sides of the River Garavogue on the eastern side of the city and improving access to facilities on opposite sides of the river. The scheme was approved by An Bord Pleanála in 2009, but funding constraints as a result of the economic and financial crisis delayed detailed design and construction. The scheme is included in the national development plan and is now at the point where the detailed design needs to be completed and construction contract documents finalised. I am aware, however, that judicial review proceedings have been initiated regarding the scheme. I understand mediation may help us resolve some of those issues and I hope that will be successful in order that the project can be completed.

As he said, the eastern Garavogue bridge is part of the National Development Plan 2018-2027 and is a key to the development of Sligo in that it will link communities and facilitate development within Sligo town, not least the east ward. Much good work has been done in respect of traffic management on Hughes Bridge, which has alleviated traffic congestion, while the Collooney to Castlebaldwin road has been open for more than one year. When I drive from Castlebaldwin into Collooney, I get a great feeling because I see that we are progressing with modern transport systems. The Carrick-on-Shannon bypass is an issue for people travelling from Sligo. I acknowledge the Minister visits the region quite frequently. The main benefits for Sligo residents and the wider community will include much-reduced journey times for pedestrians, cyclists and vehicles between the north and south sides of the River Garavogue in the eastern quadrant.

I have been trying to get out there. I am visiting Westmeath County Council tomorrow and I look forward to visiting the county councils in both Sligo and Leitrim to talk to them about the climate action plan we have to deliver together. I am looking forward to visiting Sligo in particular because one of the most interesting pathfinder projects in our Department involves transformative plans for the centre of Sligo town, connecting it to the university and the hospital. On the wider issue of the roads programme, we have a limited budget. Even though there is €35 billion within the NDP, more than €70 billion worth of projects are in development, with more added every day. Moreover, we have to take account of inflation in the construction industry. We have to prioritise. I have been saying clearly that we should prioritise bypasses on the roads programme such that we will support our town centre first policy of compact development, and projects such as that in Carrick-on-Shannon tick that box. It would be transformative for the town, bringing life and housing back into the centre. We need to prioritise that sort of project in the roads programme.

Since Covid and Brexit, many people have moved there and, with the Atlantic Technological University, the eastern Garavogue bridge would connect the two areas of that river between the three colleges, the university, the hospital and the business park. It is vital. The bridge in Carrick-on-Shannon was built in 1846 and a new bypass has been selected. A new bridge would help Carrick-on-Shannon to breathe but also allow traffic to get from Dublin to the north west. On a map of Ireland, there are motorways from Dublin to Belfast and to Galway, but in between there are anomalies and we need to address them as quickly as possible. The Minister would be very welcome to visit Sligo. He might even go to Strandhill and do a bit of surfing.

We can go surfing together in Strandhill. The national planning framework gives us the way forward. We need better balanced regional development. There is excess development on the east coast, especially in the greater Dublin area, and we need areas such as Sligo, Cork, Galway, Waterford and Limerick to grow as a counterbalance to that. The best way for Sligo to grow is for it to switch and promote sustainable mobility in order that there will be a high-quality local environment such that the town will work. I look forward to seeing what we can do to make that happen. In towns such as Carrick-on-Shannon, there is a fundamental choice. These are incredible 19th century market towns, or older in many instances, and restoring them and bringing life back into their centres would be one way of tackling our housing crisis as well as helping us to meet our environmental targets. The best way of doing that will involve removing as much traffic as possible in order that life can be brought back in. The towns that do that, whether Carrick-on-Shannon or elsewhere, will thrive.

What steps can be taken to prevent such excessive penalties being imposed?

To this end, eFlow has a dedicated resolution team within its operation, which engages with customers who are experiencing difficulties paying the tolls and penalties. It actively engages with customers who have fallen into arrears on their payments or become subject to enforcement procedures. This team can assist customers in developing and agreeing an acceptable payment plan to resolve their outstanding debt. Where cases escalate to eFlow’s legal enforcement service provider, the process becomes more serious and legal proceedings may be issued if the eFlow customer fails to engage. When a customer engages with eFlow and an acceptable payment plan is agreed, eFlow has systems and processes in place to ensure penalties will not escalate on historical or future transactions while the payment plan is being adhered to and provided that payments are being allocated in line with the agreement. The key to all this is communication and as such it is vital for the customer to engage with eFlow, given that where people do not make contact or engage, any payment will be allocated to the oldest outstanding sum. If the customer continues to use the road without contacting or reaching an agreement with eFlow, the charges will continue to accumulate for outstanding journeys. With regard to non-payment, the registered owner of a vehicle will be notified via correspondence regarding any outstanding journey that escalates to the next stage in the enforcement process. In each letter of correspondence, the customer will be advised to contact eFlow.

He pays €2,000 in rent and, despite working 50 to 60 hours a week, is struggling to pay his bills. He contacted eFlow about his toll bill, which amounted to €240, offering to pay €80 every week over a period of three weeks. The company agreed but stated that by the end of that term, the bill would have increased to more than €1,000. That does not tally with the information eFlow gave to the Minister. A toll of €3.50 increases after 14 days to €46.50. After 56 days, an additional €116.50 is charged, bringing the total to €163. We brought in legislation to prevent moneylenders doing similar; we need to ensure eFlow will not do it either. Does the Minister consider these penalties proportionate?

That would not encourage people to do what my prepared reply recommended, whereby customers in such a position should ensure they contact the company. The Deputy might convey further details on the case to me or the Minister of State, given if it is a constituent of his I am sure he will be equally interested, because it does not seem that would encourage public support. With regard to the issue of fines escalating because of non-payment, I fully understand the Deputy's case that the fines are significant. I imagine the company would argue in defence that it needs some mechanism to ensure people will pay. Personally, whenever I use the M50, I try to ensure I pay the toll promptly, given I am aware there can be a significant escalation. Nevertheless, that is different from what the Deputy cited in the first instance, which sounds like an anomaly, if it was allowed to happen in that way.

What people do not know, as the Minister alluded to in his original answer, is that if motorists receive a penalty of, for example, €46, and they pay the toll on a given day, eFlow will take the payment for that day and use it against the €46 penalty. The company will not tell them it has done that. Then, eFlow will fine them an extra €46 for that day, on which they believe they have paid the toll. This system needs to be examined and changed. I agree that if motorists do not pay their toll, there needs to be a penalty but these penalties are extortionate. Legislation was brought in to prevent people being ripped off by excessive rates charged by moneylenders. This is similar and this area of tolls and penalties needs to be revisited.

If there is an instance where, as the Deputy said, somebody is paying for a toll but has a backlogged fine and the payment does not go towards the toll but towards the backlog and they then get a further fine because they have not paid that toll, it seems so me that there is perhaps a communications issue in that situation in terms of it not being transparent or clear that people have to clear their backlog, otherwise they can get into further difficulty, which is unsatisfactory. I will ask my Department to examine the specifics of the communications around that. It is not appropriate that someone inadvertently builds even further fines.

A key deliverable among the policies we have put in place is the Connecting Ireland rural mobility plan. TFI Local Link services are responsible for the vast majority of new routes under Connecting Ireland. The latest figures from October last year show Local Link delivered 17 of the 25 new and enhanced services. They, therefore, have a leading role in delivering that policy commitment. In the context of their central role, I met with Local Link representatives in December to discuss the future development of the services. Connecting Ireland aims to provide better connections between villages and towns by linking them with an enhanced regional network connecting cities and regional centres nationwide. This will be achieved by expanding Local Link services and prioritising public transport projects that enhance connectivity. To this end, I have secured increased funding for public transport in rural Ireland to improve services across the country. In addition, I have sought to ensure that our key policy statements, such as the climate action plan and the sustainable mobility policy, recognise the importance of public transport in rural Ireland and set challenging targets to ensure continued improvement in the years ahead. The NTA is also responsible for delivering the roll-out of Connecting Ireland by procuring the provision of TFI Local Link and Connecting Ireland services, including with individual public transport commercial operators. The wider project will be achieved through a dedicated professional team of network planners, procurement specialists, contract managers and marketing professionals. In implementing these services, NTA works collaboratively with the Local Link team across each of the 15 Local Link offices, with Bus Éireann, which is operating a significant number of the new or enhanced services and with commercial operators that are also providing public transport services in rural Ireland.

He has had an invitation to go to County Sligo to go surfing; he can come to County Waterford and go surfing as well but I will make him check in with the Local Link operator there if he does. County Waterford provides probably one of the best Local Link services in the country. From my town, Tramore, people can access Dungarvan on one service, and they can get to Dunmore East on another. From Dungarvan, fantastic services serve the Gaeltacht communities, which go through Cappoquin, Lismore and Tallow, for example. We are getting close to an every village, every hour service, particularly on the Cappoquin route. I am hearing that while the Local Link operators are taking up a huge amount of the slack and making a huge expansion to their services, they are not necessarily getting the support they need. They are not necessarily being heard by the NTA in the correct or collaborative way the Minister spoke about regarding route planning. Do they need to be more resourced? Do they need to be more supported in the roll-out of these services?

It has had a central role in designing, promoting and pushing the new Connecting Ireland system. It has been given additional staff resources in the past two years so it can scale up. I agree that the Local Links are the right vehicle. They are community-based and distributed across 15 centres in a network with operations throughout the country with very good local knowledge. In the meeting I had with Local Link representatives in December, the key focus of the discussion was the corporate and governance arrangements and resourcing for them to be able to take, as the Deputy described it, the "burden". This is a huge opportunity for Local Link. This is a transformative moment and it is in the integration with the health transport system as well. We should also look at integration with the education transport system in this way, as well as these new PSO-type services. The response from the public, particularly younger people, has been phenomenal. People are using these services. We need to go further with better marketing of the services, we need bus stops and we need much better timetabling, which require resources for the Local Link operators so they can scale up to the opportunity. It is an opportunity more than a burden.

There is an administrative burden and many people are being asked to do a lot of extra work. It needs support and resourcing. They are the correct vehicle - forgive the pun - for delivering this. Uptake has been excellent. The Lismore-Cappoquin-Dungarvan route provides an hourly service, which is well used. Many people are on that service every day and have a personal relationship with the bus driver. It is tackling rural transport issues but also social isolation issues. It is about putting in the investment. The bus stop issue is totemic and great headway could be made on it in short order. It comes up again and again when talking to Local Link operators. A bit of concrete and a pole are needed, at the very least, to let people know a rural transport service passes through their villages and towns. It could be rolled out in short order and it would be a boost to the service and its visibility.

As the Deputy will recall, we were in Ennistymon recently and I decided to use one of the local services. I did not know where it stopped, which was confusing. There could have been better information online about the timetable and the route. I agree with the Deputy. This is starting to work but this could work even better. In many instances it would be great to have a bus stop with a shelter but that is a much more expensive and difficult operation. In some instances, it could be a plaque on a wall. That is needed as part of the new network we are rolling out as part of Connecting Ireland. It needs advertising, better organisation and a promotional campaign in order that everyone knows there is a significant expansion in rural public transport services. NTA is the key organisation managing and rolling it out, but local authorities are also involved. We must be careful that is does not become cumbersome. Everyone in this Chamber will know, as former councillors, sometimes getting a bus stop can cost a fortune and take years. We need to be quick. It needs to be simple, agile and low cost. We need the stop infrastructure and the advertising infrastructure for the new services.

Sadly, this is far too common. Families need closure. Without remains, they can never have that. Volunteers are going out in horrendous weather doing vital work, not only without financial assistance, but paying the operational costs out of their own pockets. It is not good enough.

However, I can confirm that the Department does provide an annual maintenance grant to support the search and rescue activities of voluntary search groups involved in mountain and cave rescue and community rescue boats. The grant, formally entitled the "coastal and inshore, mountain and cave rescue grant current", provides for grant aid to current expenditure for Mountain Rescue Ireland, MRI, mountain rescue teams and the Irish Cave Rescue Organisation, ICRO. There are ten mountain rescue teams, all of which are constituent members of MRI. They respond to requests for emergency assistance in upland and mountainous areas of Ireland. The Search and Rescue Dogs Association is also a member of MRI. ICRO is the body responsible for cave and abandoned mine rescues within the island of Ireland and works closely with MRI. The assistance of MRI and ICRO in a search and rescue task is provided at the request of An Garda Síochána. The grant also provides funding to Community Rescue Boats Ireland, CRBI, which constitutes the "coastal and inshore" part of the grant's title. CRBI is a nationwide group of independent voluntary rescue boats, which are trained and administered by Water Safety Ireland. It is a declared resource and is available to the Coast Guard to respond to emergencies in its area of responsibility. CRBI units operate entirely independently of mountain rescue units and are, in practice, a different funding stream. The grant allocation arrangement underwent a significant review in 2019 and an increase in funding to those teams was provided on foot of this review. Voluntary search groups also receive occasional funding from other Government sources, including the Department of Rural and Community Development, the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, and local authorities. Water Safety Ireland implements a VAT exemption scheme applicable to independent maritime search organisations.

The Minister of State may recall the previous Minister who was in charge of sport. He could give funding to subaqua clubs, but only for sporting activity, not for search and recovery. The reality is that the only Minister who has given any support whatsoever to subaqua clubs in this country was Noel Dempsey, who was Minister for the environment years ago, when he waived the motor tax on search and recovery vehicles at my request. Nothing else has ever been provided by the State to a service and to organisations that are providing such vital supports across this country.

I have a list of them here. I appreciate the feedback the Deputy has given. I will engage with my colleagues across the Government, perhaps the Minister for Rural and Community Development or the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport, Gaeltacht and Media, on this issue. They provide a vital community service, as Deputy Naughten has referenced. I will reflect on what he has outlined and engage with colleagues. I will also reflect on what happened previously under the Minister, Noel Dempsey.

It is the first response of its type that I have received in this House on subaqua clubs in more than 15 years. The point I make is that they provide a vital service. Sadly, every single community in this country has been impacted by suicide. People stand by the edge of a lake, canal or river waiting for the remains to be recovered. We had a tragic situation in the midlands some years ago where it took weeks for bodies to be recovered. These volunteers are doing this out of their own pocket. They are funding the cost of it, not just in terms of lost time but also the fuel going into the craft carrying out the search and recovery and we need to give them some acknowledgement. I thank the Minister of State for his response this morning.

When tragic circumstances occur, we have volunteers that front up and provide assistance to families. The State cannot abandon volunteers and groups. I will engage with my colleagues across the Government on this. As I referenced at the outset, some of these groups do not specifically come under the Department, but that means nothing to them; they want to know what the broader State is doing. They provide a vital service. I will engage on the issue with my colleagues, and I will also reflect on what was done to support them previously.

There has been a chronic underinvestment in public transport in the region, which is a persistent problem. Its impact has been laid bare during the cost-of-living crisis. Households in the north west are bearing the brunt of the increase in private transport costs because of the lack of reliable and available public transport. I ask the Minister to outline his view and that of the Department on the need to provide rail infrastructure in the north west, in particular in the context of the all-island rail review.

As the Deputies are aware, the strategic rail review is being undertaken in co-operation with the Department for Infrastructure in Northern Ireland. The results of the review will inform the development of the railway sector on the island of Ireland over the coming decades. A draft report is currently being finalised by the consultants for submission to the Departments. The finalised draft report will then be submitted for approval to both Ministers and ultimately the Government and the Executive. Once these necessary approvals have been secured, I will obviously then publish the report. As Deputies are aware, the strategic rail review is considering the future of the rail network with regard to the following ambitions: improving sustainable connectivity between the major cities, including the potential for higher and high-speed, enhancing regional accessibility, supporting balanced regional development and rail connectivity to our international gateways. This also includes the role of rail freight. The review is considering the scope for improved rail services and infrastructure along the various existing, or potential future, corridors of the network including disused and closed lines. The review has been informed by a public consultation process which concluded last year, and which received a great response both North and South. The Government has previously stated its belief in the potential of rail. It is important that we address constraints in the rail sector and pursue a strategy that allows rail to fulfil its potential as a sustainable mode of transport as we move to decarbonise the transport sector, as well as meeting rural connectivity objectives and as a generator of prosperity for people across Ireland. The strategic rail review will assist in and inform that, and I look forward to its completion. It is the first all-island review of the network since the foundation of the State and will provide a framework to develop a much-improved rail network in the decades ahead.

Now we only have a single eastern-based North-South rail corridor on the island. This imbalance is further laid bare by the fact that of the 54 stations in the Northern Six Counties, only three are situated west of the Bann. In Donegal, the situation is far more dire. Rail is simply not an option in Donegal with direct consequences, as the Minister knows, in terms of the social and economic life of the county. We hope that the steering group will seek to provide recommendations to address this acute regional imbalance and that the reviewers also examine proposals that we have submitted to bring forward recommendations relating to directly connecting Dublin to Derry and, by extension, to Donegal. Derry is the fourth largest city on the island of Ireland. The fact that it is not directly connected to Dublin is a major issue. This would go to the heart of addressing the imbalance. The Minister is a frequent visitor to Donegal. Does he believe that we need a direct rail connection between the capital city and the north-west region?

We can create a strong rail link between the west and south, and that can only benefit industry, commuters and the economy as a whole. A very positive opportunity is presenting itself with the westward extension of the Foynes to Limerick line, just as we are doing with DART+ and the new stations in Waterford, Oranmore and Moyross.We cannot continue to delay the publication of the all-Ireland strategic review. Given the deep-rooted insecurities, along with the Northern Ireland Executive not being established, we need to see progress in this area.

We have all seen the maps of Ireland where on the western coast there is nothing in terms of any level of rail connectivity. This obviously relates not only to partition but planning failures over many years. Alongside this, whether I was canvassing in Armagh where people discussed the lack of rail service there or my home town, Dundalk, we welcome the fact that the Enterprise service is to be scaled up. We are somewhat worried about the timeline. Obviously, sooner is always better. It is a matter of moving to electrification and ensuring we have a Dublin to Belfast service that is at least hourly. The quicker that happens, the better. There are multiple other issues that all need to be addressed.

This will not be cheap. I had a series of meetings with ARUP and the UK rail transport expert who was asked by the then Prime Minister Boris Johnson to examine some large projects. I thought providing access to Donegal would see the development of the existing line on the north Antrim coast. In those discussions, what started to come into view was the possibility of a spur from Portadown through Dungannon, Omagh and Strabane. An historical connection involving Monaghan took that route. The line would have to have a spur to Letterkenny in order to ensure a connection to Donegal. It would be transformative for the relationship between Letterkenny and Derry, as well as Strabane, Omagh and Dungannon. It would be of huge benefit to the island and would improve island connectivity. It would be very expensive because we would need to build a new line even though there is an existing line, which the Deputy knows from driving up and down the road. The UK Government would be the key funders of such a line, but in terms of the strategic long-term development of the island it has huge potential and I look forward to seeing what the final conclusions are. Yesterday, I asked for a copy of the latest draft report to see how detailed or specific the idea that is being advanced is. In my mind, it is the right strategic view in terms of where rail could return in importance to our island and would be transformative, in particular in providing access to the north west.  A report started looking at high-speed connectivity between Belfast, Dublin and Cork. There was then a political commitment to look further to the north west and other parts of the island. That search, looking to the north west, has drawn the possibility of that route. It would be transformative for the towns, counties and country that it would run through. In response to Deputy Dillon, when we start thinking strategically about our national rail network, we have existing lines that are hardly used. One such line is the Waterford to Limerick line. Lord knows how many billions it would cost to build if we had to build it today. We face a strategic question of whether we abandon it. In my mind, the answer is "No". We need to extend it, something which is happening in terms of the services from Limerick to Ennis and Athenry. The section between Athenry and Claremorris is not just about those two counties. Rather, it is part of a longer route from Ballina and Westport through Claremorris down to Waterford and Wexford. The western rail corridor is not just a small section between Athenry and Claremorris; it comprises an entire route. In that context, it starts to make sense.

I am particularly conscious that he is the Minister who has responsibility for this important area. We all await the outcome of the all-island strategic review. There are many views on how we connect the north west. That is probably a discussion for another day, but it is the principle we have to have first. I remember meeting the European Commissioner for Transport about 15 years ago, long before I was elected to Dáil Éireann. I showed him a map of Ireland. He pointed to the north west on the map and asked whether it was a barren area because there were no rail lines or motorways. Unfortunately, there is still no motorway or dual carriageway.  Obviously, there are different views on how to connect the region. The Navan rail line could be connected to Derry with a spur to Letterkenny. The key point is that the north west has to be connected. It is not just about rail infrastructure; it is also about prosperity. This year, we will celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement. We will talk about a quarter of a century of peace. However, there was also a commitment on prosperity. Donegal, the north west and Strabane comprise one of the most deprived areas on the island of Ireland. This infrastructure can change things. It will be a social good and can also do good in terms of the environment while, crucially, lifting prosperity for people living in the region.

This week, Cabinet approval was granted for a €750 million project on the Navan rail line as part of the greater Dublin area transport plan, while the western rail corridor still sits in an unpublished rail review report. Reopening the Athenry-Claremorris line should proceed in advance of the rail review. We cannot wait for the Northern Ireland Government to sort itself out. It may never sort itself out. It is inconceivable that the Government sees itself as being prevented from acting in the interests of the people of the west of Ireland by the DUP. Precedent exists in terms of the extension of the Foynes line. Athenry and Claremorris should be completed to coincide with the Oranmore loop and Galway station upgrade by 2025. Dáil Éireann and the Government decide on infrastructure investments against a background of cross-party consensus for action to revitalise the western rail corridor. I ask for the support of the Minister on this.

Can the obstacle produced by the DUP by not allowing an Executive to be in place and Ministers to be in their roles doing the necessary jobs for the people be avoided? Beyond that, I ask the Minister for an update on the rail plans for Dublin, Belfast and beyond to Cork, including electrification. We are still operating on the same timeline in respect of the rail ticketing system, which is obviously necessary from the point of view of producing a tax saver ticketing system. The system operates for people who are now remote working and may only work two or three days a week. There has been a major issue with trying to deliver this and it appears that only a new ticketing system will address it.

I have to bow to the diplomatic reality that we are in. I am glad Deputy Dillon mentioned the reopening of the Foynes line because it is connected to the western rail corridor. We need to think in the long term. The development of Rosslare Port in Wexford is necessary for the development of offshore wind, which means the quayside will have to be developed. We should put the rail line back and reopen the line between Wexford and Waterford. Waterford Port has rail lines right along the quay. Cork Harbour will be a huge area for potential industrial development because of the development of offshore wind. There is rail connectivity right down to the quayside in Marino, which is closed but could be reopened at a relatively low cost. The same could happen in Foynes. There could be major development of the port and rail line right down to the quay. Strategic development along the corridor I mentioned could involve each of the large deep-water international ports we have, which have existing rail freight capability but hardly any services. The only real services are from Ballina south down to Waterford for forest products, Coca-Cola and some other products. If we could complete this network by reopening the connections to the quaysides and create a spine from the north west to the south east, that would be a strategic investment on the part of the State that makes sense to me. The review did not emphasise rail freight; that was not its key objective.We are going to have to do a lot more work to look at how rail freight connected to our ports system would work but it definitely could work.  In response to Deputy Doherty as to whether it is through Navan, Portadown, Omagh, Dungannon or Strabane, my personal view is that the Dungannon, Omagh, Strabane route and on to Letterkenny has real potential in terms of what it would do to what are not insignificant towns. As the Deputy said, they have suffered from that lack of connectivity west of the Bann as much as Letterkenny has. My instinct, following the discussions I had with ARUP, is that it would be very expensive because it would be a new line but it would be transformative for the north west.

My question relates to the defence budget. Specifically, I would like to know if any unspent money was returned to the Exchequer by the Department of Defence at the end of last year. If so, where did that money come from? Was it from so-called pay savings, whereby the underspend in defence was as a result of the Defence Forces being under strength? Such savings are normally used for alternative purposes like capital expenditure or equipment.
#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	138	As the Deputy will be aware, the annual defence sector budget, comprising Vote 35, Army pensions, and Vote 36, defence, is determined within the overarching budgetary framework and approved by Dáil Eireann, having regard to the level of resources available and defence policy requirements, with multi-annual capital envelopes determined as part of the overarching national development plan, NDP. It should be noted that 2022 expenditure figures are not yet definitive. Provisional outturn figures for last year are due next month and the appropriation accounts are due for publication in September. My response to the Deputy's question is given with that caveat. The expenditure returns for December indicate a total gross underspend of €1.58 million in 2022 on the Army pensions Vote. The expenditure returns for the defence Vote indicate a total gross underspend of €497,000 in 2022. The underspend is mainly attributable to pay savings which arose due to the actual strength numbers being significantly below the target establishment strength of 9,500 personnel. In previous years, a long-standing arrangement existed by which pay funding was allocated for establishment Permanent Defence Force, PDF, numbers of 9,500. However, this funding model was changed for Estimates 2023 in the circumstances where actual numbers were considerably lower than the establishment number and stood at 8,049 at the end of November 2022.  Estimates 2023 allocated an additional €93 million towards the defence Vote group. Pay is now allocated for actual numbers and expected recruitment intake in 2023. For 2023, a net additional 400 recruits is projected for the Defence Forces. Pay savings of approximately €26 million arose in 2022 in respect of the PDF. With appropriate consents, the majority of these pay savings were reallocated to address spending pressures elsewhere, including Defence Forces capability development for the purchase of defensive equipment, aircraft, naval vessels and consumables. The Department of Defence has advised that there were over 7,000 applications to join the Defence Forces in 2022. The Commission on the Defence Forces published its report in February 2022. The Government published its response and associated high-level action plan in July last year. My Department has now sanctioned all three early action pay measures, with some further actions under analysis. I am committed to supporting a modern and effective Defence Force. My Department is represented on a high-level steering board and implementation oversight group which will provide additional support for the implementation of the action plan.

There are a lot of figures there. I will try to get my head around it. I tabled the question arising from an article by Ken Foxe, published in the Irish Independent on 1 January, in which he outlined correspondence between Jacqui McCrum, Secretary General of the Department of Defence, and presumably the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. I am looking for clarity on whether the recoupment of those pay savings apply to 2022 or 2023. My understanding from the Minister's reply is that they will be applied prospectively in dealing with 2023 only, and not 2022. I emphasise that it is obvious the Defence Forces are in desperate need of funding. If approximately €30 million is taken out of the budget for 2023, perhaps we might be able to allocate that somewhere else from the outset. I will read the Minister's detailed response and may follow up with him afterwards.

The aim of the decision that has been made here, which I believe is the right one, is to put in place a more realistic assumption regarding what recruitment will be in the time ahead so that it is a better foundation on which to build the Estimate for the Defence Forces and the Department of Defence. As the Deputy is aware, there is a commission in place with regard to how we can strengthen the Defence Forces. I thank him for his involvement in that. It has led to a number of commitments being made regarding spending in the time ahead. In that context, it appears appropriate, therefore, to have a more realistic recruitment number in place, off which we can better plan this Estimate.

This funding is desperately needed. The Minister referred to the modernisation and reform programme announced only six months ago that has to be funded. The war in Ukraine is likely to intensify significantly in March, with spring offensives. We have no idea where that will end up. We desperately need this money. I will read the Minister's written response and follow up afterwards.

As I stated, it appears to me that good practice is being asserted here in ensuring there is a feasible figure in place regarding recruitment. In the context of the other commitments that have now been made to the Defence Forces, this appears to be a very appropriate and realistic decision to make. I look forward to engaging with the Deputy on the matter in the time ahead.

I will read out some of the questions so that if the Minister is not doing questions and answers, he can at least include them in his statement. He should be taking part in a questions and answers session, however. For example, a question he was asked four times yesterday is whether Michael Stone paid people to put up posters for him.

My written response lays out the work that is under way to increase capacity within the construction sector. It looks at the work that is being led by the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, through his Department. It makes reference to the construction sector group and the work that is under way to build investment there, and notes the work that is under way in the capital works management framework, looking at how we can better strengthen the role of the Office of Government Procurement to further increase the capacity of the construction sector in the time ahead.
Additional information not given on the floor of the House.
 Developing construction sector capacity is a key priority of the Government to deliver on the projects outlined in the NDP, as published by my Department in 2021. This is achieved through increasing the number of apprenticeships and upskilling and reskilling opportunities in order to boost construction sector capacity. The Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science has set out its vision in the Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021–2025, which has an overall target of 10,000 apprenticeships per annum across all disciplines. In addition, comprehensive changes have already been made to the employment permit system, open to non-European Economic Area workers, which ensures that almost all occupations in the construction sector are now eligible for a general employment permit. The promotion of careers in the construction sector amongst Leaving Cert students and college graduates is currently being actioned. This is delivered through actions in the Building Innovation Report set out by the Construction Sector Group, CSG, and is a joint effort with the key players of the construction sector and Government Departments. In addition, under Housing for All, an action plan to promote careers in construction will also be developed by Q2 this year and is being led by the Department for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science. As I have indicated, we recognise the importance of apprenticeship as a key supply of talent into the construction sector and have continued to invest in training and apprenticeships, delivering supports to employers and making it easier for employers and apprentices to engage with the system. In 2022, almost 5,000 apprentices working across skills in the construction sector were registered. The growing need for green skills in the construction sector is supported with a number of collaborative industry-focused educational and training opportunities now available. In total, over 4,500 retrofit and near zero energy building standard, NZEB, places and 60,000 green skills places are being provided with centres of excellence in Laois-Offaly, Waterford-Wexford and Limerick-Clare Education and Training Boards now in place. Centres of excellence will be opened shortly in Cork and Mayo-Sligo-Leitrim ETBs. Driving productivity is also imperative to increasing construction capacity. The Construction Sector Group is working on seven actions to increase innovation and productivity of the sector. As part of this, my department has awarded a grant of €2.5 million to the establishment of the Build Digital Project led by TU Dublin and partners. The aim of the project will be to transform the Irish construction and built environment sectors by enabling all stakeholders, particularly SMEs, clients and suppliers, to develop, maintain and improve continuously their digital capabilities. Another action has been the establishment of a Construction Technology Centre, known as Construct Innovate, which will be led by the University of Galway. The centre has been received funding of €5 million over five years from Enterprise Ireland. The centre will be a R&D centre of excellence for the construction industry. Finally, I want to add that a Capital Works Management Framework review is ongoing by the Office of Government Procurement. This will look at setting minimum standards for the information necessary for each stage of a project's development and also looking at means to measure the performance of a project and its key actors during the course of its delivery and beyond into its operation and maintenance. Taken together, these initiatives will increase construction sector capacity in the period ahead.

What systems are in place to ensure there is no resultant diminution in the output of the Civil Service? What systems are in place to monitor the impact of the right to work from home on civil servants individually and collectively, but also on the output of the Civil Service?

In this context, my Department, in collaboration with Civil Service employers, trade unions and staff associations, developed a blended working policy framework for Civil Service organisations which was published in March. The framework focused on the longer term approach to remote working in the Civil Service and has been shared with public service employers with a view to providing a consistent approach across the wider public service. This is a key step taken by my Department in this important area to support the long-term implementation of blended working options for civil servants. The framework provides broad strategic direction to individual Departments and offices in the Civil Service to develop tailored policies on blended working that are appropriate to their business needs. In developing their own blended working policies Civil Service Departments and offices have the flexibility to determine matters such as the roles that are suitable for blended working and the proportion of time individual employees work remotely compared with on site. Remote working will not be available to employees on a 100% basis as some physical attendance at workplaces will be required to facilitate face-to-face meetings, training and other key events deemed necessary by the employer.

Inevitably, a certain discretion has to be allowed to every employer, Department and section within Departments right across the Civil Service and, indeed, the public service. On the other hand, the right to work from home poses a significant challenge to management in the Civil Service in particular. Obviously, it is important to ensure there is no diminution of service to the public as well as making sure the workforce is facilitated in working from home where possible. That will require management systems, however. I could be wrong but I do not think management is an Irish forte, particularly in the civil and public service, or, at least, if it is, we have failed to demonstrate it of late. This is not just an issue raised by the Opposition; it has also been recognised by those on the Government back benches. There is a perception that it is now much more difficult to get through to public services and the Civil Service on the telephone, for example.That is not blaming individual civil servants, but if what is perceived is the reality, management systems have to be put in place to ensure it is not.

It is the case that, within our public service, we have so many roles available, as the Deputy will know better than I do. We are trying to have a framework in place that allows a minimum amount of discretion to work from home but also guarantees that public services are maintained while working arrangements change. I am aware of some of the feedback on the quality of public services and the ability to gain access to public servants. The Government will introduce a public service and public sector reform strategy. As part of that, it will address the issue of how we can maintain a service for citizens at a time when work practices are changing.

I have given a certain amount of feedback, as have other Deputies, but it is inevitably anecdotal. I accept it is difficult to monitor the output of the Civil Service, including sections and Departments, but it is crucial that it be monitored nevertheless. It is also crucial to monitor and get feedback on the impact, be it positive or negative, on individual civil servants in addition to the Civil Service collectively from a workforce point of view. I would expect it to be positive but do not know. Is there a system in place to monitor the output, the length of telephone calls, the proportion of telephone calls and emails being answered and the time in which they are being answered, not just at switchboard level but substantively, since the move to remote working? Is there any change in the output?

It is captured for organisations such as the Revenue Commissioners when they examine how they respond to communications. I do not have the detail on the various parts of our civil and public services. To deal with the Deputy's question on the framework in place, it is, as I referred to in the early part of my answer, the Blended Working Policy Framework for Civil Service Organisations. Appendix B of that framework, which concerns the role of the people manager, lays out expectations regarding how blended working can be delivered while also ensuring those individuals who change their work practices adhere to the expectations in place. A matter I will consider in the time ahead is how we can better capture and measure the output of our public services when work practices are changing all over the country, including in our public services.

However, the amounts allocated to the Department of Rural and Community Development are themselves but a fraction of what we invest in our regions and local communities. For example, the figures the Deputy referred to do not include how much we spend in schools located in rural communities, nor do they include rural bus networks, primary care centres or health facilities located outside our larger cities. I differ from the Deputy regarding the inference I think he is making, which is that the key way in which money is spent in rural communities is through the Department of Rural and Community Development. In reality, it is only a very small part of overall Government expenditure. It is the priority of every Department to focus on communities, both rural and urban.

Tax revenue in 2022 stood at €83 billion, which was €15 billion, or 21.5%, ahead of the figure for the same period in the preceding year. This should have a good news story. Why does it not transfer to everyone? Where did the money go? Who has suffered? We have a strong income tax receipt, up to 40% over that of the previous year. Surely, delivering rural infrastructure and critical services across the region should be a priority. I am talking about sewerage and water facilities, which are being upgraded only, not added to. That means we cannot build houses in our rural towns and villages. That means people cannot locate in them or support business and the school and transport networks.

I believe it is €2.2 billion. It goes without saying that all of that supports our rural communities and agriculture sector. The amounts pertaining to the Department of Rural and Community Development, which is an important Department, add to the large amounts already spent by other Departments in supporting rural Ireland. That said, the amount of money allocated for rural development programmes under the Department of Rural and Community Development began at €80 million in 2017 and now stands at €202 million. Therefore, there has been a huge increase in the funding streams that go to that Department, but, as I said, it forms only a very small share of the overall expenditure on rural Ireland.

I have highlighted so many times that there is a need for investment in basic services, such as water and sewerage plants. Let our people have houses and progress the building plan in the areas affected. Builders cannot provide homes where there are no basic services. It is not that hard to understand. Askeaton has been waiting 33 years for a sewerage system to be upgraded. Foynes and Glin are in the same category. In Dromcollogher, there is sewage going into the river. This is not what I want. I want infrastructure. In Oola, houses cannot be built. Hospital got 26 houses but six have their own sewerage facilities on site because there was no capacity. This is what I am talking about. If we build sewerage and water infrastructure in these places, we can build houses, which in turn support all businesses and schools across the network. That is the investment I am talking about. Askeaton has been waiting for 33 years and there is sewage flowing straight into the Shannon. That is not the only place. The River Deel has also been polluted. That is where I want investment.

I have no doubt that, in the time ahead, he will continue to make the case for the priorities the Deputy has referred to. I will certainly do my best to help. I am well aware of the difficulty of making a case for not spending money when there is so much within our society and rural Ireland that needs support and further progress. I understand that point entirely, but what we are doing is increasing, year by year, the amount the Government is spending. In doing so, we are making every effort to prioritise rural Ireland and respond to the needs of the citizens to which the Deputy is referring. Colleagues such as the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, and Deputy Ring are always making the case for that investment. We have made big differences and have made big increases in expenditure. I will do my bit to maintain that progress and continue to make progress on the priorities the Deputy has referred to.

My Department is also responsible for maintaining the national frameworks within which Departments operate to ensure appropriate accounting for, and value for money in, public expenditure. Because of its vital importance for our country, "NDP delivery” is to be added to my Department’s title and mandate. My Department is currently examining the support structures and levers available across government in order to maximise delivery of vital infrastructure such as housing, schools, hospitals, roads and public transport. As Deputy Durkan will be aware, we have made massive increases in public expenditure on capital projects in recent years. In 2023 it now stands at more than €12 billion, both from the Exchequer and from our semi-State sector. I want to look at the additional steps we need to translate that higher level of expenditure into real output for our society, which needs investment so badly. I am looking at how the change in the name of my Department can be turned into a changed mandate. I will be working on this. I am very interested in feedback from Oireachtas Members like Deputy Durkan with regard to those areas that need further change, and how we can have the right processes in place to ensure a higher level of Government expenditure leads into more housing, more skills and better public infrastructure.

My first port of call will be to engage with the NDP management board to hear the views of different Government Departments and outside experts regarding what we can do differently and better. I aim to do this across the coming weeks. I am very much aware that if we want to turn the higher level of spending of the State for this year into even better outputs, the sooner we can make some changes the better.

Changing the capital ceilings inside the budgetary year rarely leads to that money being spent in its entirety, and sometimes it can lead to other challenges regarding good value for the taxpayer. That being said, I aim to be in a position to give some guidance and instruction for how the delivery of our overall NDP can be implemented. I am aware of the frustration many people feel when we keep increasing spending that does not quite give the output everywhere that we want. I can see many good pieces of work under way, such as the school building programme with the Department of Education, the primary care centres and the new extension to the Mater Hospital in Eccles Street. I can see that kind of good work happening. I want to see how we can spread that practice more and more across the NDP.

In 2023, almost €12 billion will fund vital infrastructure in areas such as housing, transport, education, enterprise, sport and climate action. Achieving value for money and reducing cost and schedule overruns is a vital part of delivering the NDP. My Department is responsible for the public spending code. I was the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform when the last set of changes were made to that code. I hope the Deputy is aware that the majority of public investment projects are delivered on budget and on time. There is a high level of professionalism across sectors. However, noting the higher risk profile of larger projects, new procedures were required in order to improve project out-turns, to avoid cost overruns and to avoid delays to project delivery. Responding to this need, my Department put in place the external assurance process, EAP, to provide independent scrutiny for major public capital projects. This involves independent expert reviews at two key stages in the project life cycle under the public spending code. The purpose of the EAP is to improve value for money and to support funding Departments with expert insight relating to project risks. The major projects advisory group, MPAG, was also established by my Department. The MPAG allows us to better understand the outputs from the external reviews, and help with the decisions around major capital projects. For example, MPAG has now completed reviews of four major project proposals; BusConnects; MetroLink; Clonburris urban regeneration development fund spending; and elective care centres proposed for Cork and Galway.

He said that we need to know why so many projects end up costing taxpayers far more than planned. The Minister knows that when it comes to cost overruns on capital projects, we are largely in the dark. We are aware the cost overruns can arise a result of poor planning on the part of the contracting authority or the contractor, litigation arising from contractual disputes, poor performance in the management of risks, and so on. We do not know how such things impact on individual projects or in the aggregate. Will the Minister commit to begin the process of collecting this kind of data so we have a better overview?

I will certainly look at the point being made by the Deputy on how this can be better tracked in an overall fashion. I am aware, for example from challenges with the national children's hospital number of years ago, of the need for a refined public spending procedure for very large projects. I understand the need for that. I am very much aware that for some of our larger projects, a very high level of scrutiny is needed regarding how the country's money is spent. I will have a look at the role of the public spending code to ensure it continues to deliver the scrutiny we need for value for money. I will look at the Deputy's point on how we can aggregate information to see if we can gain any insight regarding common factors that could be slowing down the delivery of projects in the NDP.

I hope we can work constructively on that.That legislation is designed to bring greater transparency and social value to public procurement. The Government's own recent White Paper on industrial policy stated that it wants to use public procurement in a strategic way. We will not be able to use the system in a strategic way unless we are gathering the data which would put us in a position to strategise. I would hope that we can work on that. If we are not using our public procurement in a strategic way for the benefit of everybody, we are not making the most of that money or that return. I want to ask the Minister one last time about the controversies of the last week as it is my last opportunity. Did Michael Stone pay people to put up posters for the Minister in the 2020 general election?

During the catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, process there was no economically viable project. The Office of Public Works, OPW, was looking at a review of risk then, a scheme viability review, SVR. I am just wondering where that is. If possible, I would also like to get an update on the overall CFRAM situation as regards County Louth.

I am delighted to be back as Minister of State with responsibility for the OPW. The Deputy has previously raised the issues at Annagassan and Termonfeckin. The CFRAM programme was the largest ever flood risk study carried out in the State and covered 300 areas believed to be at significant flood risk. The programme culminated with the launch on 3 May 2018 of 29 flood risk management plans which proposed 118 different projects. A small number of additional schemes were found to be technically feasible but not economically viable at the time, with a benefit-cost ratio of less than one, based on the strategic level of assessment of the CFRAM studies. To better inform a decision on progressing schemes in these communities, measures were included in the flood risk management plans to undertake a review of the schemes' viability, called the scheme viability review, SVR. The OPW has put in place a process for undertaking these SVRs to determine whether a potential scheme should be taken forward to the full flood project stage. It should be noted it is neither the purpose nor the objective of the SVR to develop and design a scheme in preparation for planning. That is a separate process. Annagassan and Termonfeckin were two such areas that fell into this category and a review of the flood risk in these communities and the likely associated costs and benefits is currently being undertaken. I can confirm that the Termonfeckin SVR was commenced by the OPW last year and technical assessment of the area is ongoing. The scheme viability report for this area is expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2023. Annagassan forms part of a group of SVRs being undertaken by consultants Arup, following a competitive tendering process late last year. The project commencement meeting was held on 9 January 2023 and site visits are scheduled for early February. A scheme viability report for Annagassan is expected by the end of the year. The scheme viability process for these communities involves ongoing liaison with Louth County Council. Once the outcome of the SVRs is known, the OPW will discuss the results with Louth County Council. I would like assure the Deputy and indeed all the Deputies from County Louth that every effort is being made to progress the SVRs in County Louth and indeed across the country in the quickest possible timeframe.

What we are looking at in respect of Termonfeckin is that the report is due at the end of quarter 1 of this year, and we are talking about the end of the year for the report on Annagassan. We all accept the issues that have been brought about by climate change in the last while. We all know the dangers we face in respect of flood risk. It is an absolute necessity that we can protect our communities. I also accept that once the viability review report is done, there is another process in respect of the design of the project. We just need it all to happen as soon as possible given the circumstances we are in. If possible, could we get an overall update on CFRAM in County Louth, accepting the absolute necessity of those works that are planned for Dundalk, Blackrock, Drogheda, Carlingford, Greenore, Baltray and Ardee, securing all those communities in County Louth?

If there is any information I cannot provide today, I will certainly come back to the Deputy in writing. He raises an important issue. We had statements yesterday on climate change. I listened to most of it in my own office. In fairness, some Deputies are very supportive of the work we are trying to do in the OPW around raising the issue of climate adaptation. As I have constantly said, if we all reduce our emissions to zero tomorrow morning, the issue of water levels rising in counties Louth, Galway, Limerick and Cork is going to continue. The single biggest physical threat to communities' viability and our ability to sustain communities in this country is from the sea. We need to address it with a greater sense of urgency and I would say we need to address it with a greater sense of political urgency. All parties and groups here have an obligation to support what we are trying to do and raise this to a different level. At the moment, talking about all of the electric cars and all the emissions in the world will not protect the communities the Deputy has referred to nor those Deputy Mairéad Farrell has referred to further down the questions list.

We are in an incredibly precarious situation and we need to make sure all is done in respect of protecting our communities from flood risk and many other risks that are ahead of us in a changing world. As regards Annagassan and Termonfeckin, we need those processes to conclude within the timeline the Minister of State has spoken about and we must then ensure the other processes are in play. The Minister of State has been quite vociferous in public on planning issues that have impacted on projects like this. We are all aware of the AG review and other pieces of work that are being proposed by Government. Could the Minister of State give an update on the state of play and how he sees things progressing as regards being able to deliver these projects in a timely fashion, which is absolutely necessary to protect these communities?

Following on from that question on planning challenges, there is a blockage at the moment in respect of carrying out climate adaptation measures that impact on communities and on our environment. The blockage is Lough Funshinagh in County Roscommon which the Minister of State has visited. Has he engaged or spoken with the Minister with responsibility for the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, about visiting and seeing the situation in Lough Funshinagh and trying to undo this blockage for all communities across the country that are dependent on these works?

We have engaged with the NPWS. We cannot talk about Lough Funshinagh without talking about the special area of conservation. The first of the climate migrants in County Roscommon have left their homes. People talked about climate migration in this Dáil yesterday like something that was just happening in the northern Sahara. It is happening in our own country. To go back to Deputy Ó Murchú's point, I would prefer if the language could change around this issue, moving away from flood risk to talk about climate adaptation. The processes we are facing at the moment are incredibly tortuous. We will need all Deputies' help when the planning Bill comes before the Dáil. That Bill is not my responsibility but I certainly will be throwing my eye over it in the hope that it will address some of the stuff we have had to deal with in the last number of years where a person in County Donegal can object to something in County Wexford; all this erroneous sort of stuff needs to be done away with. The strategic infrastructure that Deputy Mairéad Farrell questioned the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, about a while ago will just become pie in the sky if we do not address the fundamentals around this. We all have an obligation in that.

We are a year and a half out from the commencement of that review and we have yet to see a draft Bill.

I thank the Deputies for giving me the opportunity to address the review of the Act. I want to acknowledge the work that has been put into this project by the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath. Under his guidance, an update setting out the current position in the review was brought to Government and subsequently issued to stakeholders and published late last year. Given the breadth and complexity of the issues involved, it is envisaged that the review will be completed and the report brought to Government for approval in the first quarter of the year. My Department is continuing its engagement with key stakeholders in the public sector on draft preliminary recommendations. I expect shortly to be presented with final findings and recommendations in the form of a draft review report. In turn, I expect to present the review report to Government for approval and publication before the end of the first quarter of this year. At that point, subject to Government approval, amending legislation will be tabled if required and an implementation plan will commence. As Deputy Nash is aware, we have received 1,200 submissions in the consultation phases and we received a further 1,100 returns to a customer satisfaction survey. I thank all who gave their time in this process.

That is an indication of the public interest in freedom of information, FOI, legislation and greater moves towards transparency. The Minister will accept that the FOI system needs to be modernised. Would he agree as well that the default position of Government Departments and agencies should be to publish online and make available to the public as much information as possible, outside of personal information? That has been the cornerstone of the campaign run by organisations like Right to Know and I would advocate that the default position should be to publish as much information as possible. As part of that review and any new legislation that might be introduced, is the Minister considering, for example, reducing or abolishing the fees for retrieval of information? The fees can act as a deterrent for citizens who are seeking to access important information.

Can the Minister explain that process to me? Can the Minister explain to me where the line is drawn between professional and private records from a ministerial perspective under the FOI legislation? For example, could I ask the Minister for copies of emails, texts and WhatsApp messages relating to his non-disclosure of a donation that was made to him by Michael Stone and the communications he has had with the Taoiseach on this issue under the Freedom of Information Act 2014? The Minister might discuss that. I ask him also to consider this to be a verbal FOI request to him and his Department on all of that information. Freedom of information is a tool of transparency that is used to make sure politicians do their jobs according to their citizens' needs and not according to the needs of big business etc. We have a history in this country of business buying influence in terms of politicians and we need to make sure we have a transparent system so that does not happen again.

As the Deputy will know, Ministers do not play a role in determining what information goes out. On the access that FOI legislation has to the records of a Minister, there should be nothing in your private communication that refers to Government business. My phone and any electronic device I have are subject to FOI legislation and I am careful to use official communication channels for Government business and only for Government business. On the points that were made by Deputy Nash, I am aware of the importance of this legislation and what a fundamental role it plays in providing openness to our society. On the Deputy's point on what information should be made available, in a default way and publicly there is a balance between allowing Government Departments to do their work in a deliberative process while recognising private security and data privacy, and also making an appropriate amount of information available publicly and digitally on a regular basis. For example, the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform get that balance right.

It depends on the particular request made but there is far too liberal use of the black marker and there are some extraordinary circumstances that are not justified. I hope the review will be conscious of that. There are many additional bodies that are heavily funded by the State but that are not under the remit of FOI and I urge the Minister to consider that in the context of his review of the development of legislation. In the middle of this year it will have been two years since the review started. It is quite likely now that it will be 2024 or late this year before we will see draft heads of a Bill. We need to move with greater pace to reform the FOI system. Information is key and it is a fast-moving world we are living in. We need to modernise our system and we need to do that urgently.

A Minister who is in charge of standards in public ethics should be the engine of transparency in terms of ethics in the public sphere. Everybody knows that too often we see that procedure and the FOI system itself can be used to hide things. For example, my office has put in FOI requests to the Department of Health and the HSE. The Department of Health will come back to me and say it does not have any correspondence on that subject in the given timeframe and then the HSE will come back to me and give me the correspondence with the Department of Health on that subject in the given timeframe. What recourse do I or any other citizen in this country have to chase up when we have the public system not being open with citizens?

To go back to the FOI request that is at the heart of this parliamentary question, as I have said, this is an Act that works well. I heard Deputy Nash refer to the black marker and I want to reaffirm to the House that the black marker is not wielded by Ministers when it comes to FOI requests that come in about them. That is decided by others. However, what we will be doing is continuing to assess the FOI legislation. As I said, we have received a variety of different submissions. I will be giving that consideration and seeing if amendments, improvements or changes to the scheme are needed.

I wish to ask the Minister if he will consider developing a scheme, separate to grants provided by SEAI, to support home help, home care and domiciliary carers who are car-dependent due to their work, to purchase electric vehicles in order to support this sector and contribute to the Government's climate goals; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

As the Deputy will appreciate, consideration of targeted supports for specific categories of workers is a matter for the Department with the relevant policy responsibility. In the first instance I can confirm that no scheme of this kind is being developed within my Department, nor are there plans to do so.Responsibility for the kind of issue to which the Deputy has referred would sit within the parent Department. However, his question does illustrate the challenges and opportunities that exist in an era when policymaking increasingly needs to satisfy the twin objectives of improving public services and helping to achieve our climate goals. This will demand greater collaboration and co-operation between relevant Departments and Government agencies to generate the evidence to underpin these types of cross-cutting policies, including robust estimation of the incremental costs and incremental impact of any new measures, both in terms of public service delivery and climate outcomes, such as the transport emission reductions referred to in the Deputy’s question.

When I was seeking to direct the question I struggled somewhat, because certainly, on the face of it it does appear to be a question that would fall perhaps primarily within the remit of the Department of Transport, but as the Minister has acknowledged, it is a cross-cutting matter. Indeed, it is an all-of-government matter. Were the Government to devise such a scheme that would help this sector, it would influence the social and economic health of this country as much as the environmental well-being of the country and the planet as well. I put the question to the Minister as a starting point. I think it is important to put the issue on his radar. I will seek to pursue it with other Departments as well. I must say that this is a sector that is particularly deserving of Government support to purchase EVs. The workers in the sector are car-dependent and through no fault of their own, they are responsible for high mileage and high emissions. Of course, they are also a low-paid sector as well.

Through my membership of the Cabinet committee on environment and climate change and in my role as Minister for Public Expenditure, NDP Delivery and Reform, I want to support a lot of the work that the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has on the way. As Deputy Leddin is aware, there are some very positive signs. We know that electric car sales rose 81% year on year in 2022, accounting for 15% of all new car registrations last year. We can see many examples now across our economy and society of the kind of change that we need to accelerate our ability to decarbonise our economy. The specific matter that the Deputy has raised regarding home help, home care and domiciliary carers who are car-dependent is, as I hope the Deputy will appreciate, a very specific matter for the Department of Health. However, I will continue to look at the work it is doing in that area. If there is anything at all relevant to the theme that the Deputy is raising, I will ensure that I share it with him.

There is a huge challenge in the recruitment of healthcare workers, particularly at this end of the sector. The scheme might be something that the Government could consider to attract people into the sector. Many of these workers are rurally-based, and that is why they are car-dependent. It certainly would help a cohort of Irish society that does not have an alternative to driving. I would not expect these workers to be using public transport or active travel. They are utterly car-dependent. There is precedent, of course, in policy in that we support taxi drivers to the tune of €36,000 to purchase EVs. I think as strong a case can be made for this particular sector.

I know how hugely important these workers are to our society. However, as I said, it is an area that is fundamental to the work that the Department of Health does. If any proposals are shared with me that look at the matter that the Deputy has raised, I will certainly keep in mind his observations. I look forward to updating him on any progress that is made on it.

Have concerns been raised before, perhaps by trade unions or staff themselves, with the Minister's Department around the lack of interdepartmental staff that are given promotional opportunities? It is an issue that has been raised with me by a number of constituents who are concerned about it. Perhaps it is something that could be looked at by the Department.

It provided for the establishment of the Commission for Public Service Appointments, CPSA, as the independent regulator for appointments made under the Act; the Public Appointments Service, PAS, as the centralised recruitment, assessment and selection body for the Civil Service; and for other public service bodies, where requested. In line with its statutory remit, the CPSA has published codes of practice on its website to ensure that standards of probity, merit, equity and fairness apply to recruitment selection processes undertaken by employers for appointments to the civil and public service made under the Act. In relation to the specific issue of promotional opportunities for existing civil servants, they may be eligible to compete in internal competitions, which are confined to their own Civil Service Department or office, as well as interdepartmental competitions, which are open to existing eligible civil servants across all Departments and offices. There are a number of general criteria that apply to interdepartmental competitions for promotion in the Civil Service in relation to grading, number of years' service, the rating of the employee and suitability in terms of work performance and general conduct. No concerns around interdepartmental staff promotions within the Civil Service have been brought to the attention of officials in my Department. More generally, the CPSA accepts complaints from candidates where there are concerns that competitions were not conducted according to the Public Service Management Act 2004 and the relevant CPSA codes of practice. I am not aware of the issue being raised with the CPSA. More generally, the Deputy's concerns have not been raised with my Department at official level. I am sure if the Deputy has specific concerns, he will raise them here with me.

I appreciate and understand that due to the very sensitive nature of the matter, such a response was going to be issued in reply to my question. However, I have to give my own perspective from what I have heard from people who have brought the issue to my attention. Upon looking at the individual cases without naming or going into facet of the Civil Service, I did find it a bit peculiar in relation to the issues that were raised with me. I think it would be a prudent move for the Minister, in his new Department, to take a look at the issue. I believe it has been raised in the past be Deputy Shortall in the Dáil in a parliamentary question. From my perspective, it is about bringing a degree of clarity to the situation. Obviously, people in jobs do not like to make complaints. The Minister and I both know that. It creates a culture that may disadvantage an employee in terms of their relationship with their superiors. That must be said in reply. If the Minister could commit to checking it out, I would deeply appreciate it. I wish him well in his new role.

I have seen so many good examples of mobility within the Civil Service in recent years and I know of the positive role that it can play. I would certainly be interested in understanding any limitations or issues regarding its operation. As I said to the Deputy in answering his question, I am not aware of any concerns at the moment, nor have they been raised with me. As ever, if he has any specific matters that he wants to raise after this, I ask him to let me know so that I can follow up on them generally, because this is an important part of how our Civil Service operates and I am very eager to see it continue to function well in the time ahead.

As the Minister of State is aware, it went out for tender over 12 months ago and tenders were submitted. Unfortunately, the contractor who was awarded the contract was not able to do the work on the basis of the price quoted and the timescale set out in the tender that was submitted. Where are we now in relation to that? It was re-advertised and new tenders were submitted.Has a contractor been appointed? When is the work likely to commence?

I thank the Deputy for raising this issue and for his continued interest in alleviating the problems in the Glanmire area. I am advised that the Glashaboy river flood relief scheme is being progressed by Cork City Council. The OPW, in partnership with Cork City Council, is engaging proactively to progress the flood relief scheme for Glanmire. The scheme was confirmed in January 2021 by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform under the Arterial Drainage Acts, 1945 to 1995, and is being funded from the OPW's €1.3 billion allocation under flood relief measures in the NDP and as part of Project Ireland 2040.  Tender documentation for the procurement and appointment of a contractor was issued in September 2021 with a return date of 24 January 2022 but, unfortunately, Cork City Council, which is the contracting authority in this case, was not in a position to appoint a contractor for the works on foot of this procurement process due to the inflationary market that arose during the evaluation and assessment period. The council was hoping that the tender for the contractor would issue before the end of last year. A review of the commercial risks associated with the tender documentation involved some additional technical assessment prior to issuing the tender documentation. I have now been informed that the council is proceeding towards issuing tender documents by the end of this month. Following the appointment of a civil works contractor, works are scheduled to commence in quarter 2 of this year. The key project partners are working to minimise the overall delay in the completion of these works recognising the significance of the issue for the people in the Glanmire area and the associated housing developments and businesses.

People have been living in fear in that area since then. I am a little concerned that the tender documentation has still not been finalised. The question is about the time period for submissions to be made once that becomes available and then the important issue of the contractor being contacted and awarded the contract. There was too much of a delay the last time around. Tenders were submitted and acceptance was acknowledged. The contractor that was awarded the contract was written to. Can there be clear guidelines that once the tender documents are agreed and made available and advertised and the tenders are received, a decision is taken within a short period in order that we can get on with this contract and remove the fear that currently exists in the Glanmire area? This is important. It is a residential area. The flooding affects the entire population of Glanmire with people not being able to access schools and work. I ask that the scheme be prioritised and that time periods be clearly set out.

In any engagement I have had with the CEO of Cork City Council, this has been to the fore in our discussions. I am due to visit Cork again shortly. I recognise that this is not an insignificant scheme. A total of 103 properties are being defended, which are a mixture of personal and business. It will take up to 24 months to finish the construction but in the period since the previous tendering process stopped and this one was initiated, it has not been that Cork City Council and the OPW have been doing nothing. We have used that period to make sure any potential issues that arise during the construction phase will be minimised. It is regrettable, though, that some people have used what was an unprecedented inflationary environment during which tenders had to be withdrawn for political purposes. Some people, for instance, started a postcard campaign and tried to create the impression that this was not a priority or, indeed, was not being progressed by Cork City Council or the OPW. That is erroneous. It is not fair to the people who are doing it. It is not fair to our engineers, the outdoor staff of the council, the OPW or anybody who wants to get this done. It is particularly unfair to the communities of Glanmire, Glashaboy, Meadowlands and all those areas who want this built to see somebody come in and try to politically capture and make hay out of this issue, which is grossly unfair.

It needs to be ensured timelines are clearly set out in order that we can get on with it. I appreciate the work that has been done to date. It is unfortunate that inflation caught up with the council when the first round of the project was first advertised for tenders to be submitted. It needs to be given priority now, as it has been two years. It should be awarded hopefully within the next two to three months so that the council can get on with the project.

While it was a huge disappointment that the contractor withdrew from the contract, was it a surprise given that construction inflation was probably running of the order of 20% or 30% or whatever percentage it was at the time? It has eased considerably and at least we are now in a stable environment. This is not an issue about money. Some people are trying to portray that politically but it is not. If we did not follow the procurement rules that are laid out by the Office of Government Procurement, and if Cork City Council, as the tendering authority, did not follow those, I would have an entirely different set of questions to be answerable to the House on today. We are committed to this scheme and the money is in place. It will take approximately 24 months to build it. It is one of the priorities for the OPW because we recognise the risk. It also a key priority for Cork City Council. I thank the Deputy for his interest in it because I am aware of the suffering of the people in that area. Some of them are from my own part of the world. They have been constantly engaged with me and they recognise the efforts that have been made by local representatives. Again, however, I reiterate my appeal to politicians not to play politics with something so sensitive as people's fears around water coming through their front doors. It is grossly unfair.

I want included in the figure capital allocations deferred to 2023. It is important once money is provided that it is spent. If it is not spent, it means that houses, transport infrastructure and roads, hospitals and whatever are not built. The Minister might give me the details of it and tell me which Departments are the worst offenders.

Those allocations are laid out in the NDP. To answer the Deputy's questions, the Fiscal Monitor for December 2022 recorded gross capital expenditure of more than €10.9 billion, which was €569 million behind the full 2022 capital expenditure allocation of almost €11.5 billion, including Supplementary Estimates. The answer to the Deputy's question overall is that it was €569 million below planned spending.  The expenditure figure of €10.9 billion includes a capital carryover into 2023 of €687 million, which was the second part of the Deputy’s question. If we were to exclude that and include the carryover of €789 million from 2021 that was spent in 2022, the gross total spend in 2022 was just over €11 billion. I will check when the Deputy responds with his next question whether I have the figures by Department as well.

He is telling me, in fact, if I understand correctly, that the total is approximately €1.2 billion between carryovers and underspend at the Department. I keep thinking of all the services urgently needed in this country that have not happened. This is my question. From the global perspective of the Minister's Department, what is he going to do to make sure this does not happen repeatedly? It seems crazy to allocate money and not spend it. That suggests three possibilities. The first is to allow more projects into the pipeline because they take longer now than they used to, the second is to examine the public procurement process and the third is to examine the public spending guidelines to see if the Minister could apply the same due diligence with less time, fewer steps and more parallel steps.

We have capital carryovers in place every year. I take the Deputy's point that when the need for new homes and Garda stations to be built and more investment is so great, it is frustrating for Deputies to see significant capital underspends in Departments. The Deputy has asked for the overall figures. The vast majority of Departments have capital spend drawdown for the year of between 95% and 100%. There are a number of Departments in which that is not the case. The reasons for that is well known. It is because of challenges that are there. Housing is at 93% and social protection is at 93%. Those figures are the drawdown of the total capital budget. The finance group is at 90% and foreign affairs is at 69%. The reason for much of that is the difficulties with delivery of capital projects in an inflationary environment and the changes and difficulties we have had in the aftermath of Covid. I will look at the options the Deputy raised because, given the level of social need, I want to see every cent of capital budgets being spent in any given year.

I had serious reservations because I felt they would become endemic in the system. In the public sector system, once a thing like that is opened up, they think that is part of what you do. You only spend a certain amount and carry over up to 20% or whatever you are allowed to carry over. One of my colleagues is smiling because the older heads around here know that is the sort of thing that happens in the system. I accept the difficulties with planning and delays. My attitude has always been to put more projects on the conveyor belt, put them on earlier, anticipate these things and make sure at the end. The Minister knows it is easy to control capital - it is not like current - and ensure a full spend without overspending or bursting the budget. Will the Minister look at allowing more into the pipeline, reforming public procurement and reforming the public spending code, which has too many linear steps in it, rather than parallel steps?

I am not yet confident that our capital ceilings for the year will allow that to happen but I will look at it in relation to the other two issues the Deputy raised. There are issues with public procurement and the public spending code related to the underspends we have. I know the Deputy will be aware, given his huge experience, that the absence of carryovers meant Departments unable to spend their capital projects for good reasons sometimes lost all their funding and were not in a position to carry over and continue with projects year by year. Capital carryovers play a valuable role but I accept the general point that we need to look at why underspends are happening and see what we can do to minimise them.

Will the Minister of State give an update on the additional cost of that and if the framework will be reviewed in 2023?

The framework facilitates both parties to a public works contract to engage with one another to address the impacts of exceptional inflation and supply chain disruption and operates on an ex gratia basis. The framework sets down the approaches and parameters within which parties to the contract may calculate additional costs attributable to material and fuel price fluctuations on an ongoing basis using price indices published by the Central Statistics Office. The measures available under the framework strike an important balance between the additional costs incurred by the State to support contractors engaged on public projects and the State’s ability to deliver the NDP, including housing delivery, while providing value for money for the taxpayer. The feedback received by my Department suggests that the parties are engaging and that agreements have been entered into for a substantial number of projects. While payments covering the cost of inflation are made monthly, once formal agreement is reached, the total additional cost attributed to inflation for each project will not be known until it is completed. The measures introduced are intended to operate until completion or until they are no longer required. Any increase attributed to inflation may be shared between the parties with the State bearing up to 70% of the additional cost. Any additional costs identified are to be met from within the capital ceiling allocations for each approving authority. Information on costs is not collated centrally. Management and delivery of capital projects and programmes are a matter for the sponsoring agency and approving authority in each case. Similar to any process of Vote management, it will be the responsibility of sectors and accounting officers to assess whether existing timelines for the implementation of key projects will need to be adjusted on account of the framework implementation or if there will be a need for prioritisation within their existing five-year departmental ceilings.

What is the additional cost, outside of what was agreed? The responsibility lies 70:30 in favour of the State. It is important to put on the record the additional cost involved. There is no doubt this was an important innovation. The difficulties contractors found themselves in last year were extraordinary. I looked at the figures earlier for construction price inflation. The cost of structural steel increased by 64.1% early last year and that maintained throughout the year. There was a 46.3% increase in rough timber. The problem is clear.

In many cases, builders could not get the materials required. We are not centrally collating the increase in the cost of these contracts. We have said each contracting authority is responsible for paying for its own increase out of its existing allocated budget so there is not an overall increase in the budget across government. We do not have a centrally collated number for that. Risk sharing is required. We have not said the State will take on 100% of the cost but 70%. That is because there has to be risk sharing. If we had not done this, major capital projects, including social housing projects, could not have been completed. We would have had to retender and the State would have paid more the second time around for the tender to be completed.

It would be an important public policy measure that the Department would collate all the figures from the relevant agencies and spending Departments, at least to inform a review of the operation of the framework in 2023. This is about making sure the projects we depend on for the development of the economy and society are delivering but also, crucially, about value for money. The Minister of State mentioned value for money in his response and I cannot say with certainty that such value is being prioritised if the Department is not prioritising the collation of the relevant information to inform any review that might take place this year and to ensure the State is not being taken for granted by some rogue contractors.

The Accounting Officer in each case is responsible for monitoring its own expenditure. The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform does not operate as a monitoring agency at a micro-management level to make sure that each contracting authority operates within its own budget. Each has a set budget on which there are ceilings and they have to operate within them. However, they are delegated the power to spend the money that has been allocated. Overall, this has been a successful and practical implementation of public procurement and has resulted in projects that would otherwise have been cancelled and would not have been completed within budget.

Níl dabht ar bith faoi sin agus tá sé tuillte ag an bpobal go bhfreagróidh sé na ceisteanna sin. On 14 July 2020, the Tánaiste and then Taoiseach, Deputy Micheál Martin, came to this House and spoke in respect of a Government Minister who was in the middle of a controversy refusing to answer questions in the Dáil. This was after the Minister had given a statement to the House. He stated:... he has decided that he is not prepared to address this allegation publicly and will not make any further statement or answer any questions on this issue in this House.This decision has created a situation where legitimate doubts and additional questions are being raised. Government colleagues are expected to address these. This is simply untenable. It is my view that Deputy Cowen had an obligation to come before the House. It is also my view that this issue is damaging to the ongoing work of the Government.This was just hours before the then Taoiseach sacked Teachta Cowen as a Cabinet Minister. Fast forward to the situation we had last night. A Minister who has been embroiled in controversy is refusing to answer questions in the Dáil and making a virtue of the fact that he will not say anything else on the matter and nothing is being done. What happened in this Chamber last night was farcical and completely unacceptable. On this issue, the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, has made not just one statement before the House, but two statements. Yet, he answered none of the questions that were put to him. Today, as his concocted story lies in tatters, he announced that he wants to make another statement - statement number three - before the Dáil. I, along with other Deputies in the Opposition, put dozens of detailed questions to the Minister last night and he refused point blank to answer those questions. What is needed is what other Ministers have undertaken to ensure that they are accountable to this House, namely, questions and answers before the Dáil in real time. When the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, leaked a confidential document to his friend and was subject to a SIPO investigation - not only a SIPO complaint but a Garda inquiry - he came before this House and answered questions in real time, over and back, for well over an hour and a half. When the Minister, Deputy McEntee, appointed a Fine Gael activist as a judge to the Supreme Court she did likewise, answering questions over and back and being accountable to this House. The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, does not need 24 hours to make his statement fit with the concocted narrative he has given on a number of different occasions. Does the Tánaiste believe the Minister's story? If so, which version of it does he believe? Has the Tánaiste asked the Minister if Michael Stone, a personal friend and political supporter, paid for posters to be erected for him in the 2020 campaign, having done so in the previous general election? That question was put to the Minister four times last night and he refused to answer it. Has the Tánaiste asked the Minister anything about this controversy in which he is embroiled or is it one rule for the Tánaiste’s Government Ministers and another rule for Fine Gael Government Ministers? Will the Tánaiste ensure that the Government Whip brings an amendment to the Order of Business so that proper questions and answers can be posed to this Minister who point blank refused to make any other comment on this matter but has been forced to make a U-turn and wants to make a third statement? A statement does not cut it. We demand accountability. We demand questions and answers with the Minister and that he come clean.

It is essential that Members across the House adhere to the regulations and rules governing political donations, electoral spending and the various rules the House has created through legislation to ensure the proper conduct of elections and political affairs in this country. That is important but in the consideration of that we need to have balance and perspective with regard to the issues at hand. Third, the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, has come before the House in relation to this issue and it is my understanding that he will do so again at the earliest opportunity. We in this House took the decision to establish a body via legislation, the Standards in Public Office Commission, or SIPO, to investigate complaints that are lodged with SIPO in respect of any individual or Member of the House where the complaint alleges there has been a breach of the rules or guidelines. The Minister has come before the House. A legitimate question that we all must ask ourselves in respect of electoral laws and the political donation regulations is whether it is the view that we should have a process for detailed investigations that operates parallel with SIPO. There is a genuine issue there. To be fair, Deputy Doherty’s party acknowledged that it did not fully include all expenditure in a recent election in its statement. I think some €7,000 paid to a political polling company was not included. If I am correct, and Deputy Doherty may correct me, his party received a major donation from, I think, William Hampton of €4 million or €5 million. Sinn Féin has always said it is a 32-county party but in respect of any complaints or accountability to SIPO in regard to that legacy of €4 million to €5 million, which was extraordinary in itself, Sinn Féin opted to say that there is a six-county Sinn Féin party to which that money has gone and it has not gone to the party in the Republic. Some would say that is a circumvention of the SIPO rules and regulations, although Deputy Doherty may disagree with that.

There is a bit of a pattern here. Let us be clear about this. Deputy Donohoe is the Minister who oversees the SIPO legislation. SIPO has been begging for additional powers and the Minister has refused those on a number of occasions. The matter is serious. There was a donation. In fairness, the Fianna Fáil candidate disclosed how much it cost to put up election posters in the same constituency in the same election. It was €4,920. A businessman offered that service to the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, who did not declare any donation above €600. Whether the donation is in hard cash or a donation in kind, it has to be declared. It is unlawful to accept a donation above €1,000.That is what the core allegations here are. The problem the Minister has is that, when it was pointed out that at least the van was used in 2017, he did not do anything about it. He was overseeing this legislation, yet did not do anything about it. Last year, when a number of journalists put these questions to him, he stated he had carried out a review and everything was in order. What we need is accountability, the same accountability the Taoiseach had when he was subject to a Garda investigation and a SIPO investigation. The Minister needs to come before the House and answer questions. Will the Tánaiste facilitate that and facilitate the Opposition in putting questions to the Minister and getting answers? Has he asked the Minister about any of these matters, such as whether Michael Stone paid for the erection of posters for the Minister during his campaign in 2020?

He gave an account and apologised to me for the omission and the mistake he had made in respect of this. He did raise those issues with me. He has also offered to come before the House again at the earliest opportunity in respect of the issues the Deputy raised. I am struck by the language the Deputy used in questioning me. He used the term "concocted". That is a very partisan comment. He is entitled to make that comment but it is a very partisan one. It strikes me that the reason the House established SIPO in the first instance by legislation was to ensure an independent, rigorous and procedurally correct approach to investigating any alleged breaches of the regulations we have created within this House. The very language the Deputy uses in his subjective assessment, which he is entitled to have, underpins the reason SIPO was established in the first place.

Last November, the Government announced €1.3 billion in new forestry supports. I welcomed the announcement and thought it was a good news story for farmers, who would be encouraged to diversify and begin planting trees in greater numbers. Conveniently, the Government forgot to mention that large swathes of this much-needed State investment would be diverted from farmers and rural communities to international investment funds. Earlier this month, Coillte announced it had done a deal with the British investment fund, Gresham House. The Irish Strategic Forestry Fund will acquire tens of thousands of acres of forestry ground using a €200 million war chest, most of which is coming from the investment fund. As part of the deal, Coillte does all the work and private investors reap all the rewards. Coillte sourced tens of thousands of acres in rural Ireland for the fund. It will plant the trees and manage the forests. Meanwhile, of course, the fund will be entitled to grants and premium revenues of up to €60 million from the Government's €1.3 billion forestry supports, and this will be just the start. Similar partnerships with other funds are surely on the cards. The news of this scheme has sent shockwaves around rural Ireland. There are fears land prices are going to shoot up as a result of this land grab by private investments, and those fears are well placed. We have seen what happened with housing costs when vulture funds entered that market. Why should the impact on agricultural land be any different? Environmental groups are also deeply concerned. The Irish Wildlife Trust has labelled this a scandal. It will be devastating for our biodiversity. Yesterday, the Taoiseach tried to distance the Government from this grubby deal. He said it had not been signed off by Cabinet and that there had been no memorandum to Cabinet at any point. There may have been no memorandum, but that does not mean there was no awareness at Cabinet that this was happening. According to reporting by The Irish Mail on Sunday, the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, knew about plans for Coillte to use public-private partnerships to acquire land as far back as March 2021, nearly two years ago. Last week, after public outrage boiled over about this deal, the Tánaiste said it should be reviewed and alternatives explored. What did he mean by that? Will the Tánaiste clarify when the Government found out about this deal, why the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, who is meeting Coillte today, has developed an interest in it only in the past week and why alternatives were not explored before this deal was entered into? Finally, if the agreement is going to be reviewed, does this mean the Government is going to reverse it?

The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, and the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, are meeting Coillte today, and they will discuss Coillte's role in the Irish Strategic Forestry Fund and how Coillte should work closely with farmers and local contractors to achieve positive outcomes for the Irish forestry sector and for Irish farm families. They will also discuss other models, and I think other models need to be pursued, to help Coillte meet its overall target of planting 100,000 ha of new forests. This has to be seen in the context of the overall challenge, which is enormous, in terms of where we are coming from and where we want to get to in forestry. As the Deputy knows, about two thirds of our land is farmland, so in order to meet that bigger target we have set ourselves nationally, farmers will have to be the biggest drivers of our afforestation effort. Our farmers will also be the primary beneficiaries of the new €1.3 billion Forestry Programme 2023-2027, the largest ever investment by a Government in tree planting. The premiums for planting trees will be increased by between 46% and 66% and extended to 20 years for farmers, so there are strong incentives for farmers to become involved in this new endeavour and agenda. New forests on public lands will primarily be native woodlands, focused on biodiversity benefits, because we really have to get that balance of 50% of all new forests being broadleaf and native to respond to the biodiversity challenge and crisis. From Coillte's perspective, we need efforts from both the State and private investors, as well as from farmers, to get to a very different scale of afforestation from that which we have experienced over the past decade. In respect of its partnership with the Irish Strategic Investment Fund and Gresham House, Coillte is saying it equates to about 1% of the current Government target of 450,000 acres of new forests by 2050. Ultimately, the fund aims to own about 12,000 ha of forests. About 3,500 ha of that will be new forests, with the remainder being the purchase of existing forests that the fund will concentrate on. Coillte will not sell out any existing publicly owned forests to the fund, nor will any other public body sell land to the fund. Any land purchased by the fund will already be in private ownership and no private landowner will be forced to sell land to the fund. The strategy we have outlined is still before Europe, relating to state aid and so on. We want to explore alternative models but we are going to need an awful lot more on board to get to the targets we have set ourselves.

We do not have a Sláintecare for agriculture or the kinds of closely monitored targets such as those in housing to see how much progress the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine is making, but exactly the same playbook is playing out in agriculture as that which has done in those other Departments, and that is allowing the privatisation of a public good. In the future, we will have exactly the same conversations about forestry that we have today about health and housing, with always the private interests being protected. The Tánaiste said the Government is introducing these premiums for farmers and that is great and I welcome it, but now a private investment company is going to reap all those funds it has introduced, or a huge part of them. It is really good that this is being highlighted because we do not have as in-depth discussions about agriculture. We have seen this play out over decades of policy, and how the supermarkets are doing quite well while farmers are price takers not price makers. Larry Goodman is doing fine and beef farmers are struggling to make ends meet. This is the latest example of prioritising those private interests over the interests of farmers. The Tánaiste did not answer any of my questions, so I will reiterate them quickly. When did the Government find out about the deal? Why is the Minister showing interest in it only now? Why were the alternatives not explored before the deal was entered into? Will the Government review this decision and try to stop it?

I have made that clear in my original statement. There will be no privatisation of public land. That is the point. In fact, I would favour more State acquisition of land for forestry. That is the position the leaders of the Government have discussed with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine. Again, we have to be careful of State aid compliance in how we do all of that and that is the issue in terms of whatever we do. The more fundamental point, however, is that we are not planting enough trees at the moment at all. We really have to grow exponentially the amount of trees, particularly native woodlands, and I want more purchase of land for native woodlands in this country. We should really embark on that programme.

To that end, I want to make him aware that up to 40% of hotel and guest house accommodation, 2,404 rooms I believe, or more, are taken up with refugees and asylum seekers. Some 400 men, asylum seekers, have been in one centre in Killarney since 12 October. I ask the Tánaiste two separate questions. First, what alternative accommodation will he provide for the 4,500 Ukrainian refugees in Kerry and Killarney? What alternative accommodation will he provide for these, many of whom have children who are now in schools and in the middle of the school year? Second, the 400 asylum seekers in Hotel Killarney who I believe are all men, should be removed from Killarney. They should never have been placed there in the first place, all together in one hotel on one side of town. These come from at least 12 different nationalities. Since they came there on 12 October last, there have been many reported incidents of friction between themselves on a daily basis with Garda vehicles outside the place day after day, culminating on new year's night at 8 o'clock with five people being stabbed and one fellow's finger being cut off. Five ambulances were outside the place and at least that many Garda cars were on the Park Road which is the main access to Killarney town. The placing of 400 asylum seekers on Park Road has caused a deterrent to many women, girls and even young boys locally who are afraid to walk the footpaths for leisure or necessity as they feel intimidated by large groups of asylum seekers. Ye landed these people and did not provide one extra doctor or any extra social welfare worker to the welfare staff. What vetting takes place with these asylum seekers when they come to this country? The people of Killarney and Kerry want to know. People are coming here without any documents. Surely they could provide documents after a few weeks or whenever. Are they just left to their own devices after they come in and they say they have no documents? I ask also about asylum seekers from Georgia and Algeria. Are they entitled to come here? Should they be deported? They-----

The first point I make is that we have international obligations under international law. What has distinguished Ireland on the global stage is the fact that we are a rules-based country that believes in the international rule of law and that we adhere to that. One aspect of that is the Geneva Convention and European laws in respect of the treatment of those who seek asylum. Therefore, there is a legal obligation on us in respect of people fleeing war, starvation, or political oppression to hear their cases through the asylum process. When someone arrives into the country, in many cases without documentation or with no documentation on them when they present, they seek asylum. Then the legislative process this House has provided, or legislated for, kicks in and that application is then assessed. The number of people seeking asylum this year has dramatically increased over previous years. I think there are close to 14,000 to 15,000 people who have sought asylum. That is separate from those from Ukraine who are fleeing war. Approximately 75,000 people fleeing war have come into the country from Ukraine and we can all see the devastation in Ukraine that has caused this massive migration of millions and millions of people from Ukraine, namely, the bombing of civilian infrastructure and the terrible murders of the innocents. In terms of the asylum seeking process, we are legally obliged under international law to give people a fair hearing when seeking asylum. That is creating a lot of pressure on accommodation. The combination of the war in Ukraine, allied to climate change and conflict in other parts of the world, is causing enormous pressures on our asylum process which is unprecedented in terms of scale. If you take 15,000 seeking asylum under the asylum legislation combined with 75,000 Ukrainians, one can see already the pressures on our accommodation system are going to be immense. Our public servants have worked extremely hard to try and absorb and accommodate the very significant increase in migration that has occurred. It is not easy and it is now challenging but there are no easy solutions either and I am not going to pretend that there are. Unfortunately, we are in a wartime situation in Europe and the worst war since the Second World War on the Continent and it is having very negative repercussions across the board. We have conflict elsewhere as well in the neighbourhood of Europe, all of which is creating this movement and migration. Every single other country in Europe is also experiencing this.

Is he going to free up the 2,404 hotel rooms in Killarney and Kerry and ensure the livelihood of all these people with craft shops, pubs, coach tours, jarveys, boatmen, cycle tours, heritage centres? Is he going to jeopardise all these people if we do not find other accommodation? I asked the Tánaiste about this last November. What has the Government done since? What accommodation has been found? It is fine to say there is a legal obligation to the people outside but if the thing is not being done properly, and if the Government is compromising our own operators here in Kerry in this instance, it is not fair and it is not fair on those people. It is also not fair to land 400 asylum seeker men into one end of Killarney town and make the women, girls and young boys in Killarney afraid to walk the town. The Tánaiste has an obligation to those people too in case he is forgetting and it is very important that he does see after them.

I am not clear whether he is in favour of a review of this arrangement, but it was reported that he is. I would welcome some clarity on the issue, what form it might take and the timeline. One of the arguments the Tánaiste and others have used to support the Coillte arrangement is that we cannot get to 18% afforestation without significant investment from investment funds, vulture funds or whatever other source. The Tánaiste said he might look at alternatives. We could reach our forestry targets if every farmer in Ireland with a holding of 50 acres was properly incentivised to plant 1,000 trees, which would be 1 acre, and every farmer with 100 acres was incentivised to plant 2,000 trees, which would be 2 acres, and so on, on a pro rata basis. We could do it by proactively engaging with farmers, local communities, and public authorities on certain State-owned lands. Instead, we are doing what we have done time and time again: we are engaging with large investment funds, Irish and foreign, because it is easier. We tick the box, and we get it done, but we are ignoring the impact on communities and the negative impact on farmers. We are also ignoring the fact that the kind of policy being pursued will fundamentally change settlement patterns in the west, the north west, the south west, parts of the midlands and other parts of the country. While it is a subject for another day – I know the Tánaiste is aware of it – the cumulative effects of this type of forestry policy, as well as the rewetting targets, both our own and those of the EU, will fundamentally affect settlement patterns in Ireland. Will the Tánaiste say if it is Government policy to do that, and let the people know? When certain events occur, whether it is land clearance, abandonment or otherwise, because they are driven by other policies that the Government pursues in forestry or other areas, it is the worst and most dishonest policy for the Government to wash its hands and say "it is not us; it is Europe or climate change". However, it is the Government that makes the decisions and is responsible for the outcome. Another major concern is how this plan will drive up the price of land and make it unprofitable for any local farmer to purchase land for any type of agricultural activity. If the Tánaiste wants to see the reality of this, he should go to County Leitrim where the price being paid for land for afforestation already means no local farmer can compete to buy the land for agricultural use or for agroforestry, which is what I propose. We might as well put up a sign and say no locals need apply.

The Government's policy, as the Deputy states, is to increase afforestation from the current level of 11%, or 808,848 ha, to 18% by 2050. This will require an additional 450,000 ha of new forests by 2050. Coillte, in its strategic vision, has committed to enabling 100,000 ha of new forests by 2050, to create a carbon sink of approximately 18 million tonnes of CO2. Half of these forests will be native woodlands. The other half will be forests for quality timber production, which will be used in large part to displace emissions-intensive building materials such as steel and cement. My view, which the Minister will be communicating to Coillte today, is that Coillte did not need the legal approval of the Government in respect of its decision. However, I take the Deputy's point that overall public policy must be clear also. My view is that subject to state aid rules, in terms of forestry, I would want the land to be in State ownership. Farmers are individual private operators as well. We want farmers to drive the bulk of the afforestation, so we must be careful about the utilisation of the terms "private" and "public". There can be no selling off of any State forests or anything like that. I think the State itself should be more actively involved in purchasing land too. That will create tensions in terms of pricing and other such issues, but we must purchase land for native woodlands and for simple rewilding at its most basic because the biodiversity challenge is so crucial. We are not at the races in respect of meeting the biodiversity challenge just yet. The Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, and others have made great progress in the past two and a half years by doubling the budget of the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, and it now becoming a Government agency. For the first time in a long time, the NPWS has found its feet and has got great underpinning. I am very passionately committed to the biodiversity agenda. I have been asking agencies to buy land for rewilding and native woodlands. We need commercial forestry as well. The construction industry must develop more carbon-efficient mechanisms to build houses in the future. Timber-frame construction is pitifully low in this country in comparison to Scotland, for example. The real issue for us is to get from the low level we are currently at. Significant progress was made in the 1980s and 1990s but that has stalled in more recent times.

I support the Government's forestry policy in terms of getting to 18%, but I do not support how it is going about part of it because the implications of that, as I have outlined, are significant. The Tánaiste says he wants land to be in State ownership; I fully agree with him, but is the policy that is being currently pursued going to ensure that? Last July, 1,000 acres in County Tipperary were bought by Gresham House. It is already under way. It is happening. That is standing forest. The Tánaiste says one thing, with which I agree, but what is happening on the ground is different. The Tánaiste says the real issue is to get it done. Yes, it is. I have given him an example of one of the ways we could do it, by engaging proactively with farmers and communities right across the country. We could go a long way doing that-----

The fund aims ultimately to own a total of 12,000 ha of forest. This is what I have been informed. This equates to roughly 1.5% of our total existing forest estate. Of those 12,000 ha of forests, roughly 3,500 ha will be new forests, which the fund hopes to plant over the next five years. That is an average of 700 ha of new forests per annum for each of the next five years, out of an existing annual target of 8,000 ha per annum.The remainder of the 12,000 ha purchased by the fund will be existing forest. The percentage impact of this particular initiative by Coillte is relatively low. We want other models to be developed to drive the overall forestry agenda. In particular, we want exponential growth in the number of trees we plant every year.

The Minister is nowhere near achieving that. In fact, the Government reached just 30% of the target last year. The crisis in the sector has become worse since the Government came into office. As we have learned, Coillte now intends to join a joint venture with a British investment fund, with the first step being a massive sell-off of thousands of hectares of land across rural communities. The Tánaiste has said he wants to explore alternatives, something he repeated today. As he knows, Coillte is State owned and the Ministers for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Public Expenditure and Reform hold shares in trust for the Irish people. Will he ensure that his Ministers instruct Coillte to halt the sale while the alternatives he suggested are explored?

My understanding is that the bulk will be existing forest. There will be no sale of any Coillte-owned forests or publicly owned land. Any other agency will not be selling any publicly owned land to this fund.

It is also vitally important that we provide wraparound supports for those who stand for election. In the last number of weeks we have seen multiple instances of intimidation and violence against Deputies, Senators and councillors. Jennifer Bray’s startling article in The Irish Times showed the gendered nature of that intimidation. We have heard the harrowing experiences of many colleagues in this House, some of whom are present today, and elsewhere who have had similar experiences. We know others are not prepared to speak publicly. Most members of my party, and those across other parties, have been targeted in recent weeks and years. The Government owes it to representatives today and potential future candidates to act on this.

They are allowed to do so due to the High Court overturning the policy directive in October 2020. We know this type of fishing is highly inappropriate. It not only damages the marine environment, but it also directly impacts on inshore fishers' livelihoods and tourism activities due to the reduction in stocks. Over two years later, this matter remains with the court. I have previously called on the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to restart the process and establish another policy directive which, at this stage, would have taken less time than the legal route. I ask the Tánaiste to initiate that policy directive in order to address the matter urgently. In the meantime, I encourage the Tánaiste and Minister to look at existing instruments which could be used to restrict these harmful practices. It has come to my attention that the port of Bantry Bay bylaws prohibit trawling in the bay. If that law was enforced, it could make a significant impact in that particular bay in west Cork. Perhaps we could look at other things in the interim. Over the past week there has been damaging trawling in our waters in west Cork.

As we know, hundreds of people have been left on trolleys in public hospitals. This is a perpetual crisis that happens every year and it is completely unacceptable in a country that is quite wealthy. This is obviously a legacy issue related to capacity, given that 40 years ago there were more beds in the public health system than there are now. This is why the crisis has been brewing. Emergency department consultants have said that people will die because of the trolley crisis. People will continue to die because of the lack of a plan. The winter plan is out the door; it is crisis management in relation to the HSE. Where does this lead us? It is not acceptable that those who have paid taxes throughout their lives and who rely on the public health system are left for days on trolleys. It is just not acceptable.

The first point I would make is that 40 years ago the world of health was vastly different from today. We have had far more productivity in the health service in the intervening years, particularly in terms of the revolution in day-case activity, day-case procedures, length of stay in hospitals and so forth. All of this has radically changed the capacity issue. One cannot compare the number of beds we had 15 or 20 years ago to the number of beds we have today and draw simplistic conclusions. That does not stand up to any scrutiny at all. We are treating far more people today than we ever would have and are doing so far faster, in terms of time spent in hospital. The massive, exponential growth over the last two decades in day-case diagnostics and surgical procedures has revolutionised health productivity. That has to be said. The Deputy is correct regarding trolleys but it is a combination of capacity and human resource management, which is key. Governance is also key in terms of the health service, in respect of dealing with the huge increase in disease this year.

When I raised the issue of capacity and resources in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda last year, the Minister for Health agreed that the required resources have not been in place for a long time. He sanctioned a doubling of the number of emergency medical consultants in Drogheda and launched phase 2 of the safe staffing framework. Regarding capacity, the Minister spoke of the use of step-down facilities so that there would be more capacity in the hospital for emergency medicine. However, Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital is currently dealing with a deficit in medical staffing and is bursting to capacity. On top of this, the decision to close the accident and emergency department in Navan will have a significant knock-on effect on Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, which is of huge concern. The plan to downgrade and close Navan accident and emergency department needs to be abandoned and funding needs to be allocated to the acute services in counties Louth and Meath. The reopening of Louth County Hospital in Dundalk should be seriously considered. There is infrastructure and capacity available immediately there, and this would alleviate pressure at a time of a capacity crisis. I always come to the House with solutions and now is the right time to reopen services at Louth County Hospital.

In some cases, they are returning home to elderly parents who are finding it very challenging to care for them every weekend. In a growing number of cases, these people have no family to care for them at weekends and they have to go to another Cope Foundation house for the weekend. The simple and very obvious solution is for the house at Carrigbeg to remain open seven days a week for these residents. Mr. Denis Mulcahy, a manager at the Cope Foundation, has said that the HSE needs to sign off on a decision to open the house at Carrigbeg in Bandon on a full-time basis. I urge the Tánaiste to work with the Minister for Health, who is already considering this issue, to speed up the signing-off on this decision to open the centre at Carrigbeg seven days a week.

There is a lot of monoculture rather than broadleaf planting going on and that is mainly what Coillte has done to date. My question is simple. The Tánaiste seemed to support a review. Will such a review take place and will Coillte desist from any further engagement with the fund until such time as this review takes place? Is the review happening or not? Will Coillte stop its engagement with this until it the review is complete?

One can imagine what it is like to sleep in one of these caravans on nights like those we have had in recent times. After the Ombudsman raised an issue with the Department, a pilot scheme was brought in but it was totally inadequate. A total of 75 caravans were allocated for the whole country. These caravans are on local authority sites. In Galway city, the allocation was four but there was a demand, need or requirement for 24 caravans. I know that Travellers will not get media coverage or too much sympathy but they are exactly as human as the rest of us. I want to know when this scandal will end.

Drogheda is one of those centres. As a result of the long wait, the certificates of roadworthiness of motorists' vehicles will be out of date. A constituent told me she booked her test on 30 October 2022 and got an appointment on 29 May 2023. Her insurance company told her she will not be covered in every scenario because she does not have a certificate of roadworthiness. She, along with everyone else who does not have that certificate because of the waiting times, will face a €60 fine or three points on her licence. On top of that, to add insult to injury, the Road Safety Authority, RSA, has stated that no customers have received the free test in accordance with the commitment given in the NCT customer charter.

Last week, I met environmental and small farmer groups that have established a campaign using the slogans "Save our land", "Save our forests" and "Stop this deal". The Tánaiste is saying the deal that has been made is a done deal and that the Government might look at things in the future. He is saying it is all to do with Coillte. The House and the Government set, and should set, the mandate of Coillte. We have a dysfunctional forestry model that has failed on environmental and afforestation grounds, and on just about every level. Will the Tánaiste, to prevent the protests planned for next week, commit that the deal will be abandoned and that the mandate of Coillte will be changed?

What I said, of course, was that the State is investing significantly in forestry through the increased premiums, which will largely benefit farmers who wish to use existing farmland for forestry. The premiums have been increased dramatically by 46%, and by 66% in certain cases. That is a State allocation that is funding forestry. We badly need new forestry. We are incentivising farmers, in particular, and others who have land to utilise the new incentives to increase the plantation of new forests dramatically. The fund the Deputy talked about, with which Coillte did a deal, represents approximately 1% of the existing forest estate. Everything has to have a context and perspective attached to it as well. I favour the State buying more land for native woodland and rewilding. Coillte is clear that 50% of all new forests will be native woodland.

Members will be aware of the continued importance of security of oil supplies. While we continue to transition to the increased use of renewable fuels and electrification in both the transport and heating sectors it is vital that we maintain our oil supplies. It is worth highlighting that the main purpose of the Bill is to strengthen the Government’s ability to manage stocks in the unlikely event of a curtailment of oil supplies. There is no such concern or risk at present. International oil supplies and prices have been steady over recent months. Motorists have seen a fall in prices for petrol and diesel at retail forecourts of late. From the onset of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the resulting impact on global energy markets, the Government has sought to address the negative impacts of higher energy prices on consumers, society and the economy. In budget 2023, the Government announced a suite of measures to help people with high energy prices, while the energy poverty action plan, published last month, provides further support for people at risk of energy poverty this winter. While higher energy pricing overall remains a key concern, there is also an onus on the Government to provide confidence to households and businesses with respect to the security of Ireland’s energy supply. Energy security is enhanced by having in place a multitude of robust emergency plans that seek to mitigate, offset, or prevent supply issues emerging. The Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications has been testing emergency plans in recent months with relevant Departments and agencies. Work is ongoing to ensure plans can be operationalised at speed, if required, however unlikely any such scenario may be. Part of that work highlighted the need for an oil emergency plan to have a statutory basis, hence its inclusion in the Bill. Likewise, emergency exercises run by the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, in conjunction with other key Departments and agencies, highlighted the importance of robust and reliable data as a key aid to decision makers in choosing how to respond to an oil emergency. Precise data on oil movements within the State are maintained by the Revenue Commissioners. This data is helpful in the context of an oil emergency where Government would be trying to ensure that fuel can be assigned quickly to the most critical services and sectors of society and the economy. The provision in the Bill with respect to Revenue data is tailored for that purpose. The Government’s approach is in keeping with that of other EU member states, where emergency preparedness plans have been sharpened in response to the ongoing energy implications of the war in Ukraine. I am confident that the legislation will strengthen the statutory provisions available to Government to respond to a severe or prolonged oil emergency, thereby ensuring adequate supplies for the emergency and critical services, including for the use of oil to generate electricity, if necessary, in the event of a major gas shortage. I note the particular welcome from Deputies for measures in the Bill that establish a register of oil suppliers to ensure fast communication to retailers, and the measures that allow Revenue to share data on oil movements to enhance the responsiveness of the State in an emergency. These provisions will really sharpen up the capacity for the Government to respond very quickly in an oil emergency. While a suite of initiatives, including this legislation, are being developed by the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications to ensure the security of Ireland’s energy supply in the near future, our long-term priority, and the best approach for Ireland, is to insulate consumers from volatility on international wholesale energy markets by investing in energy efficiency and renewable energy, expanding interconnection with European markets and deepening internal market integration. In that regard, the Climate Action Plan 2023, published before Christmas, sets out how Ireland will accelerate the transition to renewable energy sources. This shift brings with it many rewards, not least greater energy security and stable prices. At the same time, the Department continues to closely monitor the security of energy supplies to Ireland, particularly since Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine. In that regard, latest updates from industry are confident about the supply position in the months ahead. The Bill also effectively transfers the statutory functions relating to renewable transport fuels, from the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications to the Minister for Transport, in line with the change in policy responsibility that took place in 2021. In addition, provision has been made for the Minister for Transport to make regulations to effect an increase in the use of renewable transport fuels, in line with the renewable energy directive and with climate policy. These provisions will further drive the use of renewable transport fuels, including the introduction of the E10 petrol standard and will contribute to the State’s climate goals. I will respond to issues raised by Deputies in respect of section 31. They expressed the views that the section grants wide new powers to the Minister under section 3 of the Act of 1971 to provide for the “acquisition, supply, distribution or marketing” in an emergency, of fuels.However, these powers are already available to the Minister under the Act of 1971, and have been used by Ministers from time to time from the 1970s onwards in response to oil shortages in the domestic market. What is new in the Bill is that the Minister will also, on foot of a Government order under section 1 of the Act of 1971, be able to control the use of fuel in an emergency. The new power is provided to ensure, as far as is possible, that fuel prioritised in an emergency for critical services or to a critical worker is in fact used to provide critical services. The amendments to section 3 of the Act of 1971 contained in the Bill also allow the Minister to have the power to issue directions to oil companies or to relevant other persons to control the supply of fuel, or to compel them to provide fuel on a priority basis to emergency or critical services or for power generation. These powers of direction are required now, as oil supply chains have evolved in recent years to be very much "just in time" by nature, and Government intervention could be required quickly to prioritise supply for the emergency or critical services in response to what could be a dynamic supply situation. These powers of direction also provide for the Minister to quickly prioritise fuel for power generation and to protect the stability of the grid if there is a major gas emergency, requiring fuel switching at power generation plants from gas to oil. I thank Deputies for their interest, and I look forward to discussing the Bill in further detail on Committee Stage. I commend the Bill to the House.

As Deputies will be aware, the programme for Government included a commitment to ensure fairness, equity and transparency in the food chain by establishing a new authority to enforce the unfair trading practices directive. The commitment was also that the new office would have a specific role in analysing and reporting on price and market data in Ireland. I am pleased to present the legislation that delivers on that commitment. I thank the stakeholders who contributed to the public consultation on the Bill held by my Department in 2021 and those who made helpful contributions to the pre-legislative scrutiny process in 2022. I also thank the members of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine for their valuable work on the pre-legislative scrutiny report. I believe the report’s recommendations that have been incorporated into the Bill have helped to strengthen the Bill to achieve its objectives. The Government fully supports the need to enhance fairness, equity and transparency in the agricultural and food supply chain, particularly in strengthening the position of our farmers, growers, fishers and small food producers. The agrifood sector is our largest indigenous sector, playing a vital role in the economy and in our rural and coastal communities. The sector accounts for almost 7% of gross national income and more than 9% of exports in value terms.It employs over 170,000 people, representing over 7% of total employment. Total exports of agrifood products last year were estimated by my Department at €18.7 billion. The economic viability of our farmers, growers, fishers and small food producers who contribute to our largest indigenous sector is essential for the continued success of the sector and our rural communities. It is, therefore, important that they can be assured that there are adequate protections in place to ensure they are treated fairly in their business dealings along the agrifood supply chain. This Bill provides that protection. For the first time, we are establishing, on a statutory basis, an independent office which will promote fairness and transparency in the agricultural and food supply chain and must have regard to the circumstances and needs of the agricultural and food sector. This new office, an rialálaí agraibhia, or the agri food regulator, will have two key functions. First, it will deliver a price and market analysis and reporting function. In doing so, the new body will facilitate timely access to information about price and market trends, which should help bring greater transparency to the agrifood supply chain. This function should help food businesses, including primary producers, to compete effectively and take well-informed production and marketing decisions. Second, the agri food regulator will also become the designated national enforcement authority for the unfair trading practices, UTPs, directive and any additional unfair trading regulations introduced under this Bill. Deputies will be aware of the deadline of 1 May 2021 for the transposition of the EU directive on unfair trading practices. At that time, I transposed the directive by statutory instrument and, at the same time, as an interim measure, I established the unfair trading practices enforcement authority in my Department. The Bill provides that all powers of enforcement of unfair trading practices will transfer to the new authority. On governance matters, the Bill provides that the regulator will be led by a board, will have a chief executive officer and will operate as a separate State body funded by my Department. Turning to the structure of the Bill and the related provisions, I refer to the name of the new authority. It became clear, following the public consultation that the inclusion of the term "Ombudsman" in the name was not appropriate. A recommendation of the pre-legislative scrutiny report recommended that the name should include the term "regulator" and I have taken this on board. The new body will be known as an rialálaí agraibhia or the agri food regulator. This name adequately reflects the purpose of the new office. Part 1, sections 1 to 6, inclusive, sets out the preliminary and general provisions, including definitions of terms used in the Bill. Part 2, which encompasses sections 7 to 54, inclusive, deals with many of the operational arrangements of the regulator, including establishment provisions; key functions to be delivered by the regulator; governance and related proceedings; appointment and functions of the chief executive officer; attendance before Oireachtas committees; staffing, planning and reporting; finance; and standard provisions for prohibited disclosures and membership of other bodies. The key functions are covered in sections 11 to 16, inclusive, and these include promoting fairness and transparency in the agricultural and food supply chain, which is section 11; and providing information on price and market data, including publishing such information. Taking account of one of the pre-legislative scrutiny report recommendations, recommendation No. 3 from the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the reference to the term “publicly available” information, which was included in the general scheme of the Bill, has been deleted. Also in line with another pre-legislative scrutiny recommendation from the committee, No. 5, the text has been clarified to ensure that the regulator may consider matters outside the State, as required, under section 12. Another function is enhancing the understanding of and compliance with agrifood unfair trading law. I am pleased that the pre-legislative scrutiny report recommendation No. 6 welcomed that the regulator will promote awareness and conduct public information campaigns. Another key function will be the important role of the enforcement of unfair trading law, which includes investigating and initiating legal proceedings for offences where the regulator believes an offence has been committed. Another key role is that the regulator will issue guidelines and review codes of practice. This should help to increase awareness of the need to enhance fairness and transparency in the agrifood supply chain, as well as consistency across the business dealings, which are covered in sections 15 and 16. The Bill provides that the regulator shall provide advice and information to the Minister about matters relating to the agricultural and food sector. I will refer to one of the pre-legislative scrutiny report recommendations, No. 18, that the regulator should be obliged to examine, with a view to proposing, mechanisms by which the purchase of foodstuffs below the cost of production can be introduced. I am satisfied that there are appropriate mechanisms in the Bill to allow the regulator to examine and report on any relevant matters impacting the agrifood supply chain. On the governance arrangements, taking into account the pre-legislative scrutiny recommendation No. 7 to increase the number of board members, the number has been increased from six to eight, including the chairperson. In order to reflect the importance of the primary producer in the agrifood supply chain, the Bill also provides that the board members must include at least two primary producers. An objective to have an equal number of men and women on the board is also included in section 21. There are standard requirements provided in the Bill for proceedings and meetings of the board, including the quorum for meetings. Following on from recommendation No. 7 in the pre-legislative scrutiny report, the quorum has been increased from three to five. To advise and assist it, there is provision in the Bill for the regulator to establish committees, if required, under section 28. On the appointment, functions and status of the CEO, the CEO will manage the office and report to the board. A competition for the CEO has been held recently and the recruitment process is currently being finalised by my Department. The Bill provides that both the CEO and chairperson of the board will appear before Oireachtas committees. One of the pre-legislative scrutiny report recommendations, No. 8, was that, before commencing the role, the CEO-designate should appear before the relevant sectoral committee to discuss their strategic priorities for the role. However, this would not be appropriate as it is the board that is responsible for the strategic direction of the office, not the CEO, who will report to the board. The CEO will be required to appear before relevant Oireachtas committees once he or she has commenced the role, which is provided for under section 36(1). Another pre-legislative scrutiny report recommendation, No. 9, was that there should be specific reference to the Oireachtas Select Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine. This is now mentioned in Section 36(11), following on from acceptance of that recommendation. The Bill provides that the agri food regulator will prepare a strategy statement, an annual work programme, an annual report and reports on complaints and investigations and decisions. Concerning the annual report, I have implemented two separate recommendations of the pre-legislative scrutiny report. First, recommendation No. 10 is that the remuneration of the CEO will be published. I have provided that this will be included in the annual report. Second, recommendation No. 15 is that any recommendations to the Minister in respect of legislation will also be published in the annual report. I move to Part 3, which is covered under sections 55 to 70, inclusive. This Part deals with unfair trading practices, including the scope of enforcement; the powers to make regulations; the prohibition of unfair trading practices; offences of unfair trading practices; complaints; fees; investigations; and alternative dispute resolution. The scope of the unfair trading practices concerns business-to-business relationships. The pre-legislative scrutiny report recommendation No. 1 recommended that the scope be broadened to business-to-consumer relationships and that the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, competency for all functions relating to the sale of foodstuffs be transferred to the regulator. The pre-legislative scrutiny report also recommended in recommendation No. 19 that the regulator have full enforcement powers, including confiscation of any evidence in a case where it believes or suspects a processor or processors are collaborating in price. I gave these recommendations much consideration and I have concluded that it would not be appropriate to transfer competition-related powers from the CCPC as this approach would result in two competition and consumer protection authorities, with the potential for duplication and overlap. As it stands, the Bill provides for strong powers of enforcement regarding unfair trading practices and will allow for additional UTPs to be introduced. In addition, while the CCPC was previously responsible for the enforcement of the grocery goods regulations 2016, which included foodstuffs, this is no longer the case since April 2022, when those regulations were revoked. The regulator will liaise with the CCPC and other authorities on relevant issues, and the regulator may bring to the attention of the CCPC any matters it considers to be relevant to competition law that arise in the course of its investigations or analysis. This would be considered normal practice between enforcement bodies.The Bill provides the Minister with the power to make regulations about business-to-business relationships. It details items the Minister must take under consideration and have due regard for before issuing such regulations, which will be known as the agrifood unfair trading regulations. The unfair trading practices included in SI 198 of 2021 have been provided for in the regulation-making powers in section 57.  The Bill provides for types of unfair trading practices specifically relating to payments, including late payments; payments not related to the sale of the agricultural and food products; payment for deterioration or loss of products; charges for stocking, displaying or listing products, or fitting out; charges for making products available on the market; the cost of any discounts sold by the buyer as part of a promotion; a charge for advertising or marketing by the buyer; and payment of compensation for the cost of examining customer complaints. The Bill also provides for the regulation of changes of supply terms, including short-notice cancellations of orders of perishable products. It also provides that regulations may prohibit a unilateral change to certain terms of a supply agreement in section 59. The regulation of contract arrangements are also provided for in the Bill in section 60, while in section 61 the Bill also provides for the regulation of supply conditions. Section 62 deals with rules on malpractice concerning misuse of trade secrets, and acts of commercial retaliation against the supplier are also included. In section 65 there is provision for new regulations to be made to supplement the current UTPs. Recommendation No. 20 of the pre-legislative scrutiny report was that the new body should have powers "to see all documentation of processor and retailer of prices achieved for product so as to ascertain the margins in all parts of market". I am satisfied that the price and market analysis and reporting function in the Bill will provide information on the market from which costs and margins should be capable of being estimated, for example, following analysis of seller and buyer prices. In the context of an investigation of suspected or alleged unfair trading practice, the regulator will have access to all papers and documentation relating to the suspected or alleged UTP, including contract arrangements with suppliers. With regard to the enforcement of UTPs, I consider that a number of the pre-legislative scrutiny report’s recommendations are provided for, including the following. The fines for indictable offences have been increased to not exceeding the greater of €10 million or 10% of the aggregate turnover of the operator in the financial year in which the offence was committed. The Bill now clearly provides for farming organisations to make complaints to the office of their own volition under section 67(2). I have also removed the requirement for complainants to request that their information be kept confidential. It is now specifically required that the regulator must respond to complainants in writing under section 67(5). I have clarified that where alternative dispute resolution mechanisms fail, the regulator shall resume the investigation or consideration of the complaint, as suggested in recommendation No. 14 of the pre-legislative scrutiny report. While I have no intention to introduce a charge for complaints in the short term, I considered that, based on the experience of other complaints and appeal procedures, it was prudent to provide for this under section 68. Turning to Part 4, which covers sections 71 to 86, inclusive, this deals mainly with the enforcement powers assigned to the regulator and criminal proceedings. I consider that the Bill provides significant investigative powers to the regulator including to enter premises and seize evidence where it believes a breach of the UTPs has occurred. The regulator is also empowered to carry out inspections where a complaint has not been received. This takes account of a recommendation No. 4 of the Oireachtas committee's pre-legislative scrutiny report. The Bill provides a time period for the institution of summary proceedings for an offence from the date on which the offence was alleged to have been committed. The deadline that was set out in the general scheme has been extended from two years to three years to take account of recommendation of the pre-legislative scrutiny report. While the Bill provides for significant penalties for indictable offences, there is also a provision for a fixed payment notice. This is an option that can be used depending on the gravity of the alleged or suspected offence in certain circumstances. It is envisaged that this provision would be used only in very limited circumstances. In conclusion, the events of last year have shown that it is now more important than ever to have a resilient and sustainable agrifood sector which produces the best food in the world. The Bill aims to ensure there is protection for all farmers, fishers, growers and small business operating in the agrifood sector against unfair trading practices and that the availability of market and price information brings greater market transparency. It is my sincerest hope that we can progress the enactment of this Bill without undue delay and establish this much-needed agrifood regulator. I commend the Bill to the House. I look forward to the Second Stage debate, as well as Committee and further Stages. As has been the case previously, I look forward to hearing Members' views and perspectives on it. My sole objective here, having campaigned and pushed for an agrifood regulator for many years, is to ensure we introduce an office which brings real transparency to the food supply chain and serves our primary producers effectively in the years ahead. I look forward to the debate and the other Stages of the Bill as it progresses through both the Dáil and the Seanad. I thank my team, Angela Robinson and assistant secretary Sinéad McPhillips, who have done a huge amount of work in driving this on and leading on it. It is a significant change in our agrifood legislative environment. It is a most important step and one which has taken a lot of time in the Department. I recognise the work of the Department in getting the legislation this far and that of the wider team which supported Ms McPhllips and Ms Robinson in that process.

The establishment of a food regulator has been a long-standing demand of Sinn Féin and many farm organisations. I have regularly stated that an enforcement authority that protects farmers and communities against the stranglehold of dominant processors, particularly meat factories and multinational retailers, must be a central plank in delivering a fair price to Irish farmers for their quality product. Farmers have been at the mercy of processors and retailers for too long. They are price-takers in every sense. Farmers do not get, and traditionally have not got, a fair share of the profits from their produce. A big part of the problem is the lack of transparency in the sector. We know how much farmers receive for their product either at the factory or in the mart and how much consumers pay for the end product. The problem is that in between, we do not know what margins are made. What I have described as the greatest secret of Irish agriculture still holds true. There are huge profits in beef, for example. The problem persists that those profits are not going to the people who are doing the bulk of the work, namely, our primary producers and family farmers. We need a regulator with real teeth to ensure fairness and transparency. The EU unfair trading practices, UTP, directive did not go far enough to rebalance the scales for primary producers in the market chain. That is why I voted against it while I was a Member of the European Parliament. I was particularly disappointed that we were not able to secure EU-wide agreement at that level to ban below-cost purchase of agricultural goods. While the directive allows for member states, on an individual basis, to strengthen provisions as well as to add new UTPs, I expressed a fear in the European Parliament that some governments, particularly an Irish Government made up of Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael, would fail to utilise this flexibility ambitiously enough. This fear was based on the historical legacy of these parties protecting the interests of meat factories above those of farmers. I was concerned that an Irish Government would suggest that if we were to act unilaterally to protect farmers' interests, it would place processors here at a disadvantage. Too often, my fears have been compounded. To date, the Government has taken a minimalist approach to the implementation of the UTP directive, transposing it virtually at the last minute, unedited, as a statutory instrument. The resulting unit in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine did not actually hear a single case for nearly two years after it came into operation, expending none of its budget on anything other than the salaries of officials in the first year. When we were later promised legislation on the establishment of the office of the regulator by the end of 2021, we were faced with repeated delays. The original heads of Bill were widely acknowledged to be incredibly weak, so much so that the committee on agriculture described them as not fit for purpose. All of that said, on behalf of Sinn Féin, I welcome that we are finally having the opportunity to debate this crucial legislation in the Chamber. I also welcome the Minister's decision to accept a number of the recommendations of the pre-legislative scrutiny report of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, including amendments that were tabled by Sinn Féin. I acknowledge that in some areas at least, the Minister has listened. While farmers have long demanded a sectoral regulator, they were initially offered a food ombudsman, which then that became an office for fairness and transparency in the agrifood chain. I am glad the Minister has finally landed where farmers and Sinn Féin started by titling the new body as the food regulator, an rialálaí agraibhia. The Minister has accepted Sinn Féin's assertion that the proposed sanction of a maximum fine for breach of the unfair trading practices regulations was insufficient. It was rather bizarre that the Department proposed a simple fine of €500,000 rather than a percentage of global turnover, as modern best practice dictates and as has been brought forward by Cabinet colleagues in recent times with regard to other regulators and required under the ECN+ directive. While all of that is welcome, Sinn Féin remains concerned with fundamental aspects of the Bill. Put simply, I do not believe the regulator has been given either the necessary legislative basis to discover if our primary producers are being treated unfairly or the appropriate powers to take action when they are found to have been unfairly treated. Sinn Féin stands ready to work with the Minister to address the Bill's remaining deficiencies and ensure we deliver to farmers a truly independent sectoral regulator with the teeth to tackle unfair trading practices and, crucially, cartel-like behaviour in the sector. We will bring forward amendments on Committee Stage to do just that. Two of our primary concerns are that what the Minister has effectively done in the Bill can amount to hamstringing the regulator before it has even been formed, first, through limiting its remit to business-to-business relationships and, second, by clearly stating to the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine that he does not see a role for the regulator in terms of competition concerns or investigating cartel-like behaviour, an assertion he repeated today. Sinn Féin believes that to be effective, the regulator must have a view of the full breadth of the agrifood supply chain. That means it must include business-to-consumer relationships and, in the same vein, it must have a role regarding competition complaints and, especially, regarding cartel-like behaviour. Based on engagement with the Minister and all stakeholders, it is also a significant concern that the regulator's activity in the area of price reporting and enhancing transparency effectively amounts to the collation of all existing reporting within its office. That will deliver a net total of zero additional transparency. Common sense dictates that a sectoral regulator of this nature must be empowered to gather non-publicly available data related to the agrifood supply chain and also to regularly contrast such prices with relevant international counterparts. There are also a number of more administrative aspects of the Bill that require further consideration, engagement and amendment. It is welcome that the Minister accepted the recommendation of the agriculture committee to increase the board's size. However, increasing the number of ordinary members from five to seven without increasing the farmer representation goes against the spirit of the committee's recommendation to the Minister and our engagement with him. I invite him to review that. Equally, while I welcome that the language in the Bill in regard to ensuring the confidentiality of complainants' identities has been improved, I am aware that this is a particular area of concern for farmers. I believe it would benefit from further engagement with farm organisations in advance of Committee Stage. It is important to note that farmers have virtually no confidence in the CCPC given its failure to investigate ongoing allegations of cartel-like behaviour, particularly in the meat sector. In creating a new regulator, we want to avoid such a relationship and we need to provide guarantees regarding confidentiality as an absolute prerequisite. On the commissioning of reports, the Minister will recall that I have been requesting, since he assumed office, that he commission a report on the social and environmental impact of factory-controlled feedlots. In 2022, there was a throughput of 400,000 cattle in the controlled finishing units the Department uses as a proxy for these feedlots. That represents a 52% increase on 2017 figures during a period in which tuberculosis reactor rates were largely stagnant. While the Bill empowers the regulator to make recommendations regarding proposals for legislation relating to any aspect of fairness and transparency in the agrifood supply chain, it is important that we explicitly state that such proposals be disclosed and published in the regulator's annual reports. I have noted on a number of occasions that the Minister and Government have taken a minimalist approach to implementing the UTP directive. An evaluation of that directive at an EU level is due at the end of 2025 and I also expect there will be further interim analysis of implementation on a member state level. If the Minister is willing to work with the Opposition on Committee Stage and address some of the deficiencies I have mentioned, there is real potential for this to be an area in which Ireland leads across the European Union, and even globally. That would be no more than our farmers deserve as they rally to face down the challenges of climate change and to feed this nation and many beyond, all the while being the bedrock upon which our local rural economies are based. I remind the House that in 2019, beef farmers across the State gathered together outside factory gates, often in inclement weather, to demand action in delivering fairness and transparency in their sector. They were legally threatened for their efforts and vilified in some circles. Among their chief demands was the establishment of a food regulator. We now have that in name. Those farmers who took a stand deserve to be commended and recognised during this debate. Now, though, we must deliver a regulator that has the teeth necessary to mark a real sea change that rebalances the power towards our family farmers and away from the factories and large retailers. I pledge that I and my party will work with the Minister to achieve just that. I hope and trust that he will agree to work with us and all Members of the Opposition, in particular, members of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, in that vein.

The general scheme was discussed in some detail at the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine. As such, the needs of the various organisations have been expressed and discussed. For too long, our farmers have had to navigate a market in which they have been expected to accept the prices they receive and the conditions to which they are subject. The purpose of the Bill is to address that and give producers of agricultural products the certainty they need that they are protected in the marketplace. I welcome the changes made since the joint committee discussed the general scheme and that the Minister took on board some of the proposals made by Sinn Féin, the committee and the farming bodies. While some of these changes, such as larger fines and an increased time limit for prosecution for an offence, are welcome, much more needs to be done to make the regulator as effective as possible. I ask the Minister to give due consideration to these concerns as the Bill progresses, and I trust he will do so. I will first address the issue of transparency and the power of the regulator to publish analysis of information about price and market data in the agriculture and food supply chain. The general scheme referred to "publicly available" data. It was pointed out to the Minister at the committee that this was far too limiting to be effective in any way in tackling cartel-like behaviour or similar abuses. The Minister has since dropped the term "publicly available". What is that meant to achieve? The words may have been dropped but the intent remains unchanged. There is no explicit reference to allowing the regulator a mechanism to require market data that is not publicly available. Therefore, any hopes that this will give agricultural producers the confidence that cartel-like behaviour is being pursued, as they would like to see, have been shelved. This is a fundamental issue, not a small matter, as the Minister has heard time and again. The stranglehold over our farmers needs to be addressed through a regulator that is effective. The Minister has seen intricate corporate structures that have been designed to conceal. If we cannot have a regulator with the basic powers of investigation, that is, the power to request information that may not be in the public domain, we are in a very sorry place and little will change for producers. I ask the Minister to comment on whether he supports the notion of the regulator being able to access information needed to clearly identify cartel-like behaviour. This Bill does not read like he does. On the issue of the effectiveness of the regulator, another stumbling block is that the Bill does not span the full supply chain. In Sinn Féin’s submission to the consultation on the legislation, we stated that the regulator must be empowered to address issues across the supply chain, from producers through to consumers, with a particular emphasis on addressing the dominance of large processors and retailers. However, the Minister has chosen to confine the scope of the regulator to business-to-business relationships. For the regulator to be more effective and, ultimately, to be able to analyse market data precisely in the interests of producers and ensure they get a fair price, its remit must include business-to-consumer relationships.Without this ability, coupled with being able to do little more than collect public market data, the office will not be taken seriously. Let us talk about confidence. Consider the work of the office as it is right now: not a single case has been examined by it in almost two years. First, it is because the Minister transposed an EU directive with as little input as possible, so it was not tailored to Irish needs. The Minister will get no confidence from the agriculture sector with that kind of approach. Second, the Minister's vision of a regulator is what the farming organisations had feared. He is stopping short of giving it real powers that matter, powers that would benefit the producer, which would in turn benefit their communities and the customers who support them. Another factor is trust. Individuals or groups need to know that when they make a complaint to the regulator, they will be afforded the confidentiality they need. I note the Minister has made some effort to address this, but I believe he needs to look at this Bill again and make it more convincing. This has been pointed out to him, and I fail to understand why it has not been addressed.  I urge the Minister not to be rigid in his approach to the Bill as it makes its way through the Oireachtas. It has great potential, but only if it is designed to address the key obstacles the sector unfortunately encounters all too frequently. There are other elements that need to be addressed. The Minister increased the board and the quorum, which was called for, but sectoral representation has not increased. The wording of parts of this Bill are too vague. No detail is given on what constitutes "too long ago to justify investigation", for example. As I mentioned earlier, removing words rather than making changes will come back to bite the regulator and ultimately the Minister who has given it its terms of reference. A Bill like this cannot be left open to interpretation, especially regarding the regulator’s remit and power. We need specifics, real enforcement capabilities and a regulator that will inspire the faith and trust of the sector. We are not there yet. While Sinn Féin will support this Bill, we will table amendments to various aspects that have been left unaddressed, are watered-down interpretations of recommendations from the committee or are too vague to inspire the confidence needed.

This was an issue then and we once made a visit to north county Dublin with the IFA in regard to it. One of the primary demands made was for a food regulator. We all recognise the production of food in this and many countries is a highly profitable enterprise, but the market model does not work for the primary producer. The primary producer is always squeezed, and, having made the greatest effort, put in all the work and taken all the risk, he or she gets the least from it. Everyone else in the middle seems to get most of the profit. That has been long recognised. I welcome what is proposed here. The Minister said this was a legislative change that could make a huge difference. It has the potential to be that and we need to ensure we can deliver that. Adam Smith, one of the heroes of capitalism, in his book The Wealth of Nations famously said two or more merchants never come together for the most casual conversation but it quickly turns to how they can fix the market in their favour. He was making a strong argument for the strong hand of regulation and for Government to come in, regulate the market and ensure there is a fair and balanced playing field for everyone. We need to ensure this does that. Up to now, there has been much talk about what could happen. We have a long history in this country of large corporate interests being able to dominate the markets, particularly in our beef sector, but also in dairy and other sectors. The beef sector is probably the biggest one where we have had these problems in the past. The efforts of many farm organisations to shine a spotlight on this over the years have been worthy but have not produced results. This is an opportunity, hopefully, to produce them. While I recognise the Minister has taken on some of the recommendations of the committee, I hope he will work with the committee and everyone inside and outside the Chamber, including the farm bodies who have serious issues in regard to ensuring this regulator will have the teeth required to make a difference. That is the big problem. I understand the Minister is meeting with Coillte today, if he has not already done so. One of the primary things farmers need to produce food is land. Now we see corporate interests are reaching in there to take hold of that and create an uneven playing field where many farmers, particularly in marginal land, would not be able to compete and it would be bought out from under them. That is a serious problem that much of the farming community is seeing as one of the signals of this Government’s intentions. It is an alarming situation if the Government is going down the road of allowing major corporate interests to interfere in the land market to the detriment of the farm community.  The advantage Ireland has globally as an international food producer is not often recognised. We have family farms, free-roaming animals and farm-to-fork traceability. We have all the components consumers want yet we do not produce the level of quality marketing required to get the best price for the farmer. That needs to change. We need the strong hand of the regulator to ensure the small farmer and the farm family that the consumer wants to work with and buy their produce from get a fair price, enabling them to be not just viable, but prosperous. When the farmer is prosperous, rural Ireland is vibrant. That is what we need to see happen.

I did not think I would get in so early in the debate. I welcome the Minister’s initiative in this area. A supply chain that is fair to primary producers is essential. This has dogged the sector for a long period with the sense of unfairness, rapid changes and an imbalance of power out there. The Minister is taking the necessary powers and setting up an agency with teeth, which is welcome and will be welcomed across the farming community. However, a robust supply chain requires much more than this element. While I understand the Minister is looking at different pieces of the supply chain separately, we should be taking a broader view of what a robust supply chain will mean for the future.  Among the issues I thought the Minister would have regard to in the Bill is what is often called circular economy practices, in other words looking at the damage done anywhere along the supply chain. That should be taken into account in any regulatory powers in the future. We should look to a time when price premiums will be paid to farmers for sustainable production. That should be considered in this Bill. Traceability of production will be an important element in the relationship between suppliers and primary producers. I expected more reference to and understanding of the importance of that. Optimal use of food surpluses is a key element in the supply chain. If we want to be robust we need to see the 1.1 million tonnes of food waste we put into landfill used more productively. That does not count the food waste that occurs before the farm gate. All of these are important elements of a long-term robust supply chain. The profitability of the family farm depends on all these elements being in place so Ireland can, along with our Origin Green ambitions, be shown to be sustainable throughout the supply chain. Unfortunately, as the Minister knows, that is not the case at the moment. We are not rewarding carbon farming. The Minister needs to address how we can reward primary producers for making the sort of changes we all know have to happen around land use, fertiliser use and so on. I know it is on the Minister’s radar to see such changes but we do not yet have payment for carbon farming activities. We should and I believe will in the future see earnings coming not only from the food cheque but also from environmental service management in its widest sense.  We should address waste minimisation at every point along the chain. Levels of waste, running at 30% to 40% worldwide and not dramatically lower here, are a blot on how we manage an important resource. We need to think how that can be done. On optimum use, we have seen fantastic innovation by organisations like FoodCloud in developing that. Another area where the food sector needs to improve is in its excessive dependence on non-recyclable plastic. Two thirds of plastic comes from the food sector. In looking at the food supply chain, while this piece of the jigsaw that the Minister is looking at is important, so are many others. We need to see a broad-based approach. I know the Minister has committed, along with other sectors, to have a circular economy strategy developed. We are awaiting the annex of the climate plan to see exactly what that will mean in the food sector. If we want to secure the future profitability of the family farm, not just in five years’ time but in ten, 15, 20, 30, 40 and 50 years’ time, we have to address much more robustly the sorts of changes that have to happen to ensure that profitability in the long term. I strongly urge the Minister to do this. If we lose our reputation for being a highly sustainable producer and if we do not become early movers in some of these changes that need to be made all along the supply chain, we will miss the boat. I feel badly for farmers for how they tend to be singled out in the debate about climate change as though they are like data centres. We typically hear of farmers being fingered as if they are responsible for this. We need to take a different view of sectors. All of us along the supply chain, including shoppers looking for food products with zero packaging, or whatever it is we are looking for, have a shared responsibility. There could be much more momentum for change if we start to develop a circular strategy for the food sector from the farm right through to the retailer. I urge the Minister to embrace this with two hands. It will mean changes in the types of policies he promotes, and he will be paying for different things that happen on the farm. He will be disincentivising different things right along the food chain. It will be a changed environment, but I strongly believe that if Ireland moves early, we will be doing an immense service to the long-term future of the family farm in Ireland. It is an objective that I feel remains a high priority even among nominally urban representatives like myself. I come from a farming background, as the Minister probably knows. I understand that change is needed to build momentum not just in the farming community but right along the supply chain. Processors need to reward the sort of quality farming that will be a mark of Ireland if we want to have a long-term high reputation.

We must ensure that farmers and consumers are protected against the stranglehold of dominant players such as multinational retailers and meat processing plants. Our farmers must be rewarded with a fair price for what is recognised around the world as a top-quality product. In 2019, I stood with farmers on picket lines which were organised by the Beef Plan Movement. I remember some of the slogans on the placards, such as “Stop farmer exploitation” and “No handouts, just fair trade”. Farmers have been at the mercy of processors and retailers for far too long. They do not get a fair share of the profits from their produce, and this must change. In 2019, when someone spent €10 on beef, the retailer was getting €5.10 for three days’ work; the processor was getting €2.90 for three days’ work; and the farmer was getting €2 for two years’ work. There do not seem to be more up-to-date figures because of the lack of transparency in this sector. We know how much farmers receive at the factory and at the mart and we know how much beef costs in a local butcher, but we do not know the margins that are made in between. We need a regulator with strong powers to ensure there is transparency. The Government directly transposed the EU directive on unfair trading practices, which did not go far enough to ensure farmers, as the primary producer, get a fair share. The directive allowed for member states to strengthen provisions as well as to add new unfair trading practices. With proper legislative scrutiny, we could have constructed a Bill that was fit for purpose. Instead, the Minister took the lazy way out. The unit that has been created in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on foot of the directive did not hear a single case in nearly its first two years. Its only expenditure in the first year was on the salaries of Department officials: more waste from this Government. Thankfully, we have this new Bill, which will establish the long-awaited unfair trading practices enforcement authority. I am glad the Minister has accepted some of the recommendations that Sinn Féin proposed in the report by the Oireachtas agriculture committee. We all saw the importance of food supply security during the pandemic. We need to ensure farmers are rewarded so they can reduce food miles and the resulting carbon footprint. Suckler farmers want support, not an exit scheme. It makes more sense than importing South American food under the Mercosur deal. Our farming, horticultural and local food producers are up for the challenge, and we must ensure they are protected by getting their fair share.

Without them, we would have no food. Basically, everything begins with their vital work. Despite their significance, the primary producers and workers in this area, namely, the people who grow crops, rear animals, catch fish and make food, are often treated extremely poorly. While the Government pays lip service to them, the reality is that successive Governments have allowed and facilitated a massively inequitable system for decades that has seen a few big players become incredibly rich off the backs of family farmers, inshore fishers, meat factory workers and small producers. The most common feature across all production in this country is inequality. There is a startling asymmetry of power. In the meat sector, we all know about the cartel-like practices that leave farmers completely vulnerable to the industry, while factory workers do extremely dangerous work in poor and underpaid conditions. Similarly, small-scale producers are exposed to the tendering process set by large wholesalers and retailers. Inshore fishers are only permitted to avail of a tiny proportion of some fishing quotas by the Government. The primary workers in all these areas face the same challenges. This status quo has been maintained for years by lobbying from the industry and retailers. The only reason there is some change is because of EU law. This Bill brings EU Directive 2019/633 into Irish law and that has been the impetus for this change. This legislation contains many long overdue changes and transparencies. However, it falls short of the much-needed reforms that would see a properly resourced, independent regulator with the powers to implement genuinely fair practices. The Government parties’ predisposition to light-touch regulation in the finance and construction sectors, which has spelt disaster for ordinary people, is now being applied to the food sector. This is a half-done job that still favours the big players at the expense of small farmers, food producers and inshore fishers. The fundamental flaw at the centre of this Bill is the failure to establish an independent regulator. The Bill claims that it is what it is doing, but it clearly is not. It lacks the powers of a genuine regulator. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine has too much influence on this body, and it will be too closely linked to the sector. Crucially, this new body will be a regulator in name only. Regulators must have the capacity to develop and implement regulations without restriction, as well as commensurate powers to investigate potential violations and implement the law. The new office needs to have - in the words of Pat McCormack, president of the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association, ICMSA - “the ability and power to go in and examine exactly what is happening along the food chain”. That is currently not the case. The new office proposed by the Government will only be able to access publicly available information, rather than crucial information on practices in these areas, on costs and margins in the supply chain and on unpublished market data. The agriculture committee’s pre-legislative scrutiny report draws attention to this issue and recommends that the office "should also have the power to require market data that isn’t publicly published”, with due regard to the sensitivity of such data. Without this capacity, all the office can do is collate existing information, basically for glossy reports and nice graphs on social media, but none of this will make any difference to farmers struggling to get by in west Cork, Donegal or anywhere else in rural Ireland.  There needs to be access to information from the whole supply chain. Anything else will fail primary producers and we all know that. Another matter which needs to be developed is the conducting of inspections. The agriculture committee rightly called for “random inspections on suppliers and buyers to ensure continued compliance with the rules on unfair trading practices”. The power to conduct unannounced inspections is absolutely essential to any form of credible regulation. While the Bill will confer powers to examine records and seize evidence, explicit recognition of the capability to carry out unannounced inspections is necessary. This would both clarify this point and strengthen the office’s role in monitoring the entire food chain. Under section 4, the Minister will retain the powers to make and change regulations. This means many of the key decisions will remain political, not independent. During pre-legislative scrutiny, concerns were raised about this area of the Bill and the ongoing lack of transparency. This new office needs to have the capacity to create regulations. This point relates to the larger lack of independence. When I think of a regulator, I think of an individual officeholder with expertise and staff to support his or her work in upholding the law and acting in the public interest. Instead, there will be a board of eight people, all appointed by the Minister, with at least two being primary producers. This is not a regulator; it is another quango. The only other criterion outlined in section 21 is for board members to "have experience of, and to have shown capacity in, matters relevant to the regulator’s functions." From what I know about how these things work, it is very likely people who have worked for or closely with the food processing industry and larger retailers will be appointed. For this to be a real regulator that will fulfil its mandate and have the confidence of food producers, it needs to be fully unbiased and disconnected from the big players in the agri-food sector. That is just common sense. The Bill does not have those safeguards. It does not propose an insulated system. Instead, the board could be populated by people associated with the same companies they are supposed to be monitoring. The Bill has learned nothing from previous and current scandals when cosy relationships and jobs for the boys have facilitated all manner of failures. Section 9 claims that this new office will be independent but that is blatantly untrue. The Bill will continue to give the Minister too much influence and will not create barriers between the sector and those appointed to oversee it. On paper, many of the aspects of the Bill are impressive and it technically fulfils many of the functions of a regulator, but when we look at it in detail, core principles and the practice of independence and regulation are breached. One of the most glaringly unfair trading practices that has to be addressed is the below-cost procurement of food. It is simply wrong, not to mention unsustainable, that farmers and small-scale producers end up receiving less than the cost of their livestock or produce from retailers and food processors. This is the definition of an unfair practice. Farmers spend months rearing animals, and it is not just about the material costs of feeding and caring but the hours of work that go into bringing up an animal. Then, when it comes to selling, with the price and all the additional costs combined, they make a loss. No wonder there are fewer and fewer family farms. The same thing happens with small-scale producers that in good faith enter into contracts with larger retailers and for which business becomes their main source of income. Then, the retailers change the conditions, demanding they do more for less. The small-scale producers have no choice but to comply, regardless of how it affects their bottom line. We all know examples of this and similar cases. Those who do the hardest and most specialised work often end up receiving the least. The horticulture sector has been hit particularly hard by these unfair trading practices, leading to many farmers leaving that subsector. These farmers are vulnerable to the price variations and asymmetrical tendering process of large retailers and wholesalers. The national field vegetable census shows that between 1999 and 2014, the number of field vegetable growers fell from 377 to 165. No wonder it is increasingly hard to find Irish-grown fruit and vegetables on the shelves. Even though we have an ideal climate to grow many species, market practices mean this is simply unviable. This is worrying for our food sovereignty. It has been allowed to happen under the current and previous Governments. The only thing that will address this major issue is a proper regulator that can examine the food supply chain and set minimum procurement costs. The current system is simply bad economics. It is pushing farmers and producers out of the market and forcing those who remain into more intensive models, which leaves them dependent on other factors such as imported fertiliser. We saw the impact of that this time last year, with sky-rocketing production costs. Farmers are being squeezed by two contradictory forces. On the one hand, the Government and society are, rightly, looking for greater environmental sustainability, but on the other, the Government is facilitating processes that force farmers into unsustainable practices just to get by. Farmers cannot win; the system is rigged. The only reason many farmers are still in business relates to the State payments they receive. Public money is being used to subsidise retailers and food processors, not the people. This system has slowly emerged and developed and is now so ingrained that it is difficult to see a way out. All farmers, fishers and producers want is a fair and reliable price to know they can make a livelihood and support their families. The public wants decent food at a reasonable price and there is still plenty of room for retailers, wholesalers and processors to make a profit. All this can be achieved with proper regulation. Not only is that a win-win situation but it is a more ethical and sustainable system that will provide a viable future for rural Ireland and Ireland’s food security. If the Bill is about valuing and protecting farmers, fishers and small producers, it needs to address the below-cost procurement of food. This point was heavily emphasised by representatives of the Irish Farming Association, IFA, at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, who highlighted the need to "prohibit the buying of food below the cost of production by food procurement managers in dominant positions." This would be a game changer for the food sector that would enable farmers and other producers to receive fair prices. It would not only help to keep people farming but also encourage others to enter this area. This should be a key function of the new body. It will support and protect ordinary farmers and producers and go some way to confronting the systemic inequities in our food chain supplies. Transparency is the key to this function. This new office needs to be able to examine, and independently publish information on, the cost of production and the prices producers receive. This can then be aggregated to set minimum sums buyers can pay producers and suppliers of food. Many segments of the food chain remain worryingly obscure. At one end, farmers, fishers and producers can tell us their production costs per unit and we know the prices on the shop shelves, but the pricing between these points remains unclear and is damaging to the viability of this sector. Various stakeholders have suggested approaches and models the Government should examine. Macra na Feirme, for example, discussed the importance of creating an index of the costs of production for the farm systems in each sector, which could be used to outline the definition of "farm economic viability". With this evidence-based overview, fair pricing in food procurement could be established transparently. The absence of a cost of production price for farmers and producers is simply wrong. It is bad economics and it is eroding rural communities, not to mention the environment. Without proper provisions to examine these practices and enforce minimum procurement levels, this legislation will maintain the status quo and, regrettably, it seems as though that is precisely what it was designed to do. It looks good on paper but falls so far short of what is needed and of what farming organisations are seeking. The Bill will make little difference to farmers, fishers and small-scale producers that are barely getting by. There has been insufficient discussion of fisheries in the Bill. The inshore sector, in particular, is subject to limitations that restrict livelihoods and the viability of our coastal and island communities. I was disappointed at the lack of reference to fisheries in the pre-legislative process and the committee’s report. Inshore fishers have continually drawn attention to the inequitable distribution of our national quotas. In this case, it is the Government that is to blame. It is always pointing the finger at the EU, but it has given vastly disproportionate quotas to a small few large players at the expense of thousands of inshore fishers. I reiterate that our fishing quota is a public resource. It has to be distributed equally among fishers. The example of the mackerel quota illustrates the appalling disparity in the Government’s allocations.Currently, only 2% of this quota is assigned to all vessels under 15 m, while 98% is given to a small few, much larger boats. Inshore fishers make up the majority of the fishing sector and represent the most sustainable type of fishing which has been practised in our island and coastal communities for centuries, yet they are receiving a tiny portion of this resource, at 2%. This amounts to a breach of fairness in the food supply chain, the very thing this Bill is meant to address. Given that the Government has refused to change its position on this matter, will the new office have the powers to hold the Minister and Department to account for this blatantly unfair practice? Inshore fishers have been seeking a more even-handed approach. I have raised this matter repeatedly. The only way I can see any change is if an independent regulator were to force it but as this Bill does not allow for that type of regulator, this looks like another case of maintaining the status quo. There are a number of particular matters raised by stakeholders which the Bill needs to fully incorporate. The Irish Grain Growers group has asked for the specific inclusion of feed alongside food products to reflect growers' role in the food supply chain. The Irish Natura and Hill Farmers Association, INHFA, rightly highlights that the new office should have the capacity to look at all input costs for primary producers, including insurance. The IFA raised important points around supporting branded food products, regulating the use of logos to guarantee the Irish origin of produce and prohibiting the creation of fake farms for retailers to sell their own-brand foodstuffs. These are just some of the practical and extremely significant issues raised, which the Minister needs to ensure are addressed in the Bill. This Bill proposes a light-touch regulation model with an office that will not be able to carry out the necessary monitoring and enforcement work to reform the sector. Our food supply chains have systematic inequalities with a small number of processors, wholesalers and retailers in significantly stronger positions than the average farmer or fisher. The only way this will change is with robust legislation designed to establish a full independent regulator who is a single officeholder with expert staff focused on holding all actors to account. This Bill falls so far short of this standard it will make no real difference to the unfair operating practices our food producers face every day. At least the Government had the honesty not to refer to the new quango as a regulator in the Bill Title. This is just a box-ticking exercise, providing for a new office that will supposedly oversee trading practices while the ingrained structural problems will continue to put farmers and fishers out of business. This Bill is a wasted opportunity to reform our agrifood sector to ensure the sustainable future of all our rural and coastal communities. Farmers, fishers and food producers will continue to face the same issues and unfair practices unless the legislation is changed now.

She has put a lot of detailed work into the Bill, which I commend. Like any Bill, I have no doubt it can be improved. I hope that as the Bill goes through the House, the Minister will be open to suggestions for building on the basis of the Bill to see how it can be improved. On the other hand, it is time we moved ahead and brought in the Bill. The House must be more adaptive generally. If there are flaws in a Bill, and issues arise fairly rapidly with all new legislation, it should not take ten years to bring in the necessary amendments. I have seen that occur with a number of Bills over the years. It is a bad habit. I always have a conflicted view on the word "independent", or not so much a conflicted view but a view that there needs to be a balance. We want everything to be independent. I know where people are coming from but when they get what they ask for, they are often frustrated. When one says "independent", that often means independent of the Oireachtas, the Minister and the people. The relationship between a Department and any agency is a delicate one. We must recognise that no matter what structures are put in place, humans will always find a way of doing it very well, not so well or sometimes very badly. It is very important that we do not wind up in the farcical situation, which I seem to hit against every week, where those asking questions of a Minister are told the matter is one for the National Transport Authority, NTA, Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, or the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, and has nothing to do with the Minister. I asked a simple question today about whether it was intended, as was done with rural broadband, to put piped water into every house, rather than people having to depend on wells. About 10% of houses need piped water. I was told that was a matter for the CRU. It is not; it is a matter for the Oireachtas. It is important that the right balance is struck between the Minister and the powers and right of the regulator to get on with the job and do so efficiently. As I said, it must be debated in detail and that debate must be balanced. While the situation is not analogous because it did not involve a regulator, with regard to the Údarás na Gaeltachta Bill, although I could not tell Údarás na Gaeltachta to put a factory in a particular spot, I could say I wanted certain industrial policies pursued in the Gaeltacht. I did that, for example, with regard to the most indigenous resource in the Gaeltacht, the language, when I instructed that 30% of funding was to go to language-based industries. I could not say where or set out the details. I had it written into the Act that I could give any general instruction I wanted. I would be answerable to the House at the time if I abused that. The issue of not putting it so far away from the Oireachtas that the people no longer have a say is something we need to get right. I welcome this Bill. I first suggested this in 2014 when I was the Fianna Fáil spokesperson on agriculture. I looked at this vexed question and the agriculture committee at the time did a lot of work on it. I had raised in the committee the question of where the villains were. There are major issues in the supply chain in terms of pricing, cartels and all sorts of arrangements. I asked whether the big multiples were really dictating the price or if it was the processors. I visited the European Union a number of times. We did a lot of research and I received good help at the time. It became clear, for example, that the French were well ahead of us in at least analysing where the problem was. One cannot solve any problem if one does not know where to get the information. It became obvious that they were well ahead in legislative terms in getting and forcing the information. It can have a chastening effect on people if they know they are being watched. It is like CCTV cameras - if people know they are being watched, it can have quite a good effect. For this reason, I welcome the Bill. Más mall is mithid.It is very late coming, but I hope it has an effect. I concur with what Deputy Cairns said about the big boats. It is a scandal the way the fishing industry is organised. What we are doing in our society generally across the board is corporatising everything: the ownership of houses, the ownership of the boats and now ownership of the land for forestry. We are corporatising our society very fast. I do not know where the influence is coming from and whether it is the European influence or whatever else. I am still old-fashioned enough to believe that if we want a stable society, we must have diffuse ownership so that as many people as possible own something. It is the way to economic and social stability in society. It might not give the exponential growth, but it will give what is much more important in any human society, which is stability. Therefore, it is important that there would be a clear philosophy as part of this. What we want to do is keep the basic structures of Irish farming viable and to have a diffuse ownership of land rather than a few corporates slowly but surely holding more and more large tracts of land. As I stated in the Dáil yesterday, we took a long time to break that down and we do not want to go back to where we started.

Beyond that, in the context of the wider agricultural industry, we are talking about the sustainability of family farms. From the point of view of rebalancing, we all welcome the prospect of a food regulator. We have all spoken many times previously about the big processors, in particular the meat factories and the cartel-like behaviour, and the power differential. It is necessary that a rebalancing is done. We all accept that the EU unfair trading practices directive did not go far enough. We did not follow it up in this State with a sufficient number of teeth. I welcome the food regulator, but let us be clear: this will only work if the regulator has sufficient power and resources to do the business. Otherwise, it is another farce. I welcome that the Minister has indicated that he is open to discussion and to hearing the ideas many Members will put forward to strengthen the regulator. The scope of the regulator is too limited. It can deal with business to business relationships, but that is not the entire agrifood supply chain. We must be able to deal with issues between businesses and consumers to ensure fairness and transparency. That is the idea behind the initiative. In the investigation of complaints, the regulator must have the ability to look at breaches of competition law or cartel-like behaviour. We need those type of teeth. The regulator must be able to draw on information beyond what is already available in the public domain and, therefore, it needs to be able to examine all the ins and outs in the agrifood supply chain. We must also be able to compare prices and price differentials and take an international perspective. As has been stated, at times there will be a need to update legislation. We must ensure that any proposals put forward by the regulator on changes that are necessary would be published alongside the reports. My colleagues have spoken about many other issues that require to be addressed. That is a necessity. As this is the only opportunity I will get, we must examine sustainability regarding Coillte. We must have a strong conversation with the European Commission. We cannot have a sell-out to a British investment fund. That is not acceptable to anybody.

I have listened attentively to the speeches made by colleagues. It is a timely intervention by the Minister to introduce this legislation. I am not sure it will do the job that we expect it to do. This is an indigenous industry that is self-sufficient. It kept this country going at times when there was nothing else going for it. There is a tendency in recent times to believe that there are alternatives. There are alternatives, but we do not like them. Like other speakers, I am deeply suspicious of the use of vulture funds to intervene. I cite the case of the sugar beet industry, which was a vibrant entity. All of a sudden, we were told that we are not going to produce sugar in the future. Who told us that? We were told that the rest of Europe was doing the same. The rest of Europe did not do the same. Our nearest neighbours continued to successfully produce sugar beet for the manufacture of sugar. Other countries throughout Europe did the same time. I do not know why we should have gone down that road, but it was a mistake because it was a rotational crop that was beneficial to the soil and to regenerating the fertility of the soil and it was very important. The Bill is necessary, but I am worried as to whether it is sufficiently strong to do the job that is required, such as protecting the producers and ensuring that consumers have a fair deal by having a supply. The carrot was held out to the producers in regard to the sugar beet industry - €177 million. One could not beat that. One could call it a sell-out or a buy-out, whichever way one wants to look at it. Of course they did not get it; it went to the processors, who took it gratefully and walked away. I fully support the proposal that we must engage and meet climate change requirements. That is important. The rural and farming community has been doing that for years, but nobody identified it. They kept the necessary balance. I am worried that we could find ourselves in conflict between agriculture and the necessity to reduce carbon emissions. Both are necessary. Both must proceed in balance, along with each other, not one at the cost of the other. I hear talk of rewilding, but enough of this country is wild already. Enough of it is forlorn, desolate and wild. There are many thousands of acres of such land across the country. Those of us who come from rural Ireland know that full well. Much of it is not productive or arable and people trying to eke out an existence on it find themselves challenged on a regular basis. What I suggest in regard to rewilding, which is an important issue that must be addressed now, is that no arable land would be used where that is possible. We must maintain the food chain; we must live; and we must eat. We may well be required to produce more food in the future because I believe the next crisis will be a food crisis. We should know about that from the difficulties experienced in transporting food from different parts of the world. There are those who will say that we can get our food from elsewhere. The answer to that is we cannot. We would arrive at the end of the queue and like everybody else, we would have to wait. I am not opposed to people making a profit. That is their entitlement. Everybody wants to make a profit. If one goes to work, one needs to make a profit. Otherwise, there is not much sense in going to work. I resent being told by multinational corporations such as vulture funds that they have the answer to our problems. Coillte has a bit of a history in this area. It is not so many years ago since it proposed to develop some of the forests for different reasons, sell off large tracts of them and build large houses for select people. We may have forgotten that, but it is still a fact of life.It was at that, and was proceeding down that road. It was ridiculous and daft in the extreme. I support the Bill. It is necessary. The Minister has achieved a balance between the environment and doing whatever can be done in that respect and the necessity to ensure that we do not close down the food producing sector. It would be taken up by competitors from all over the world who, very soon, would tell us that we should pay for our food because the sources have changed. While we have resources and the ability to produce at home, we need to nurture that and give guarantees insofar as we can. We need to give context, wherever possible, to achieve some degree of continuity and security and encourage the food producing sector to continue to produce food. If we do not continue to produce food, we may be left waiting. Like other speakers, I would love to speak for a lot longer but this is the way it is.

Whatever else happens, there will be offers made to the food producing sector to do X, Y or Z and be different. We cannot live on or eat that. We cannot eat timber. We would love to eat timber, but we cannot. I want to finish by saying that there are a variety of timbers and I have taken an interest in that all of my life. We can be productive from the point of view of the construction industry and contribute to that at home. There are many more areas we could contribute to it. I would like an opportunity to talk about the general issue in the not too distant future.

The closure of the sugar factory in Carlow was a huge and devastating loss not just to the Carlow but to the wider constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny and the south-east. We have not recovered from that loss. I want to support his comments on that. Various groups are trying to revamp the industry and it is to be hoped we can count on Government support for that. The constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny has a mix of an urban and a large rural section. I am delighted to get the chance to speak on this Bill. As colleagues have said, the establishment of a food regulator has been a long-standing demand by Sinn Féin and will be widely welcomed throughout the farming community of Carlow and Kilkenny. I am often contacted by various beef and sheep farmers who feel the large processors and, by extension, retailers, that they sell to, through factories or local marts, are reaping huge profits at their expense. Pricing per head has fallen and those I have spoken to are angry. They are losing money on their livestock sales while supermarket prices have never been higher. A regulatory authority with the power to take action against the long-standing stranglehold of dominant processors, in particular meat factories and multinational retailers, is crucial in delivering a fair price to Irish farmers. Carlow and Kilkenny have some of the finest food producers anywhere in the country. Many would say we are very blessed with top quality land and the best of top quality produce is grown throughout the counties. However, for too long smaller farmers, who do not have the same resources to take on factories or marts to get better prices, have been at the mercy of larger meat factories. Our animals are predominantly on smaller family-owned farms and are free roaming with first-class traceability practices which all ensures we are producing exceptional and sustainable foods that many other countries cannot compete with. My colleague, Deputy Carthy, has spoken on many occasions about the significant delays in getting the Bill to this stage. However, I welcome that we are at this stage and it is positive. It is important that it is seen as a first step as a lot of amendments are needed. Recently, I was shocked to hear what farmers actually get for their produce. A sheep farmer gets, on average, €70 per animal. The same animal has the potential to earn a retailer well over €400. People who are not involved in agriculture on a day-to-day basis will be shocked because we all know the price of meat in supermarkets or butchers and obviously farmers are not getting their fair share of that in any way, shape or form. A lot of the factories are a law unto themselves. They control everything and dictate prices. I have heard anecdotally that farmers do not get paid for the whole animal and could get another €10 per head for an animal. Another issue is the increase in cost in tags, which are now €1 each. That all adds to costs for farmers, but they not do not seem to be getting their fair share.

I do not say that lightly. Every year a large number of farmers are leaving the sector. The number of farmers has reduced significantly throughout the State over the past decade. According to Teagasc, which analysed the income of farmers, a full third of farmers were making a loss from their business. They were either going into debt or poverty. That is an incredible situation. The current average salary of a beef farmer is around €16,000, a fraction of the average industrial wage. One third of farmers are only making a living because somebody is working off the farm as a teacher, nurse or some other enterprise off the farm. A full two thirds of the agricultural sector do not make a living wage from their farms, which is an incredible situation. One of the most important sectors in society, which creates food for the country and is the backbone of the rural community is, in truth, dysfunctional, not viable as currently structures and is collapsing in many parts of the country. If the family farm dies, the whole of rural Ireland dies with it. That is an important point. We can have food lots and industrial sized farms to keep production up and make the figures look okay on a national basis, but they will not send children to local schools, play football for local teams or buy at local shops. As a result, the emptiness Deputy Durkan mentioned will increase in sectors of society. Truth be told, that emptiness is increasing due to Government policies. I was in Castlepollard at the start of the week. People there are up in arms because the Government has closed the social welfare office. One of the key stakeholding enterprises or community organisations in the town which brought people into the town is gone. People are suffering as a result and have to travel further. Fewer people are coming into the town, which is hitting other enterprises. I do not think this change in farming is happening by accident. The Government has driven it in many ways. There is a close relationship between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael and many of the stakeholders in the sector. That is an important thing to say. I was a member of the Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine in the last Dáil. I made the case for an Aontú Bill, namely the Equitable Beef Pricing Bill. If implemented, it would put a floor under the price beef so that factories could not buy beef from farmers at below the cost of production. I made the case for the Bill before the committee. The Fine Gael Chair of the committee at the time said it was unreasonable for farmers to expect a price above the cost of production for beef. That was an incredible statement. The current Minister, who is on his phone, was also at the meeting of the committee on that day. He agreed with the Fine Gael Chair of the committee that it was unreasonable to expect a price above the cost of production for beef. There is a difficulty straightaway in terms of how the two political parties are treating this issue.The second issue is that Ireland is becoming a city state. There is no doubt about that at the moment. The spatial planning in this country is heavily focused on Dublin to the detriment of that city. Dublin is overheating. People cannot get homes, they cannot travel around, they cannot get their children into schools and so on. A third of the country is a sprawling commuter belt where young people are spending three hours a day commuting back and forth, in commuter hell, to Dublin to work. At the same time we have rural and regional Ireland emptying of its young people. It is incredible. The average age in Mayo is ten years older than the average age in Balbriggan. If young people want a job, they have to go to the commuter belt to get one. Again, that has not happened by accident. If one looks at the centre of political gravity in Fine Gael in particular, it is very clearly in Dublin. Just in the last week, Fine Gael nominated all of its Deputies from the Dublin Rathdown constituency as Ministers of State. It was kind of like "The Late Late Show". I wanted one for Deputy Durkan too but unfortunately the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, was not listening to me at that moment in time. It was like "The Late Late Show" for ministerial positions, with one for every Deputy in the constituency. We now have 12 Ministers or Ministers of State in Dublin. Put another way, 40% of those holding ministerial positions are in Dublin but County Dublin only makes up 26% of the population which means that there is a serious discrepancy in relation to representation and population. At the same time, 60% of counties in Connacht have no ministerial cover whatsoever. Human nature is human nature and people make decisions on the basis of the place that they know and they typically make decisions in favour of the places they know. That is one of the reasons we have a farming sector that is absolutely stuffed. Bad and all as Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil are with regard to rural and regional Ireland, it is wrong that the Labour Party and People Before Profit have not shown up for this debate. A national party should want to represent everybody living in the country but members of regional parties will not turn up for debates such as this one.  Farmers have fought hard to get this Bill to this stage. There is no doubt that they have had to pull the Government, kicking and screaming, to this point. I stood at a dozen factory gates during the protests back in 2019 when farmers were simply seeking a decent price for their beef. I went to the High Court on behalf of particular farmers who were suffering at the time. I was asked by farmers supplying the Dawn Meats factory in Slane to be their representative in talks with the Government. That was a very difficult protest for them but I am glad that there was some result from it. That said, poultry farmers in Cavan and Monaghan were forced recently to protest outside certain supermarkets and pig farmers were also forced to protest.  At the heart of this crisis is the supply chain for farming products, which is very profitable. The three elements of that supply chain are farmers, factories and supermarkets. Typically, all of the profits go to the factories and the supermarkets, with the people who are producing the goods getting very little. That is at the heart of this crisis. We have a dysfunctional market that favours the two end elements of the supply chain. In a normal economy, those factories and supermarkets would not be allowed to get to the critical mass that they have reached because it affords them enormous buyer power. There are so few of them and so many farmers that the factories and supermarkets can dictate the price and all of the other conditions of supply. That imbalance is the heart of this and that is what needs to be tackled through this Bill.  It is not unusual that the agricultural market is broken. The State's housing, banking and insurance markets are also dysfunctional. Unless we rebalance the agricultural producer element of the supply chain, we are not going to fix the market. How do we do that? Aontú's Bill would have put a floor under the price of beef. Teagasc would have been tasked with setting the cost of production every year and the factories would have had to purchase beef at a price above the cost of production.

I am delighted the Minister is engaged now because it is important that he engages with this debate. The Government must make sure that the body created by this Bill has teeth. That is really important because we have many State agencies with particular roles in overseeing the implementation of legislation that do not have teeth. The truth of the matter is that the first key element is resources. We can have all of the good laws on the planet but if we do not have the resources necessary to implement them on the ground, then they are not worth a hill of beans. The other important element is independence. The overseeing body must be able to do its job independently of any stakeholders and any pressure they may exert within society. It also must have access to all details and records relating to the functioning of the supply chain. If it does not have access to those records, it will not have full knowledge of what is happening within the sector. It also needs to be able to make unannounced visits to various locations to obtain that information. If we announce visits, then human nature means that those visits will be prepared for. That will stop information being clear and concise in terms of feeding into the system. It is really important that we have clear information in relation to this. We also need to have confidentiality, as mentioned by other Deputies because there is a lack of trust and confidence among farmers in the processes that exist today. When a farmer or a group engages with the system, we need to ensure that there is full confidentiality. There must be full inclusion of all of the input costs for farmers in the sector.  I want to mention a number of issues that have also been mentioned by other Deputies today. The first is the major crisis that is looming in the land market in Ireland. I refer to the potential for vulture funds to come in and acquire large swathes of land in this State. Vulture funds have already completely distorted many markets in Ireland. It is the nature of such funds that they tend to compete in an unbalanced fashion with others in a given market. In the housing sector, we had vulture funds that enjoyed really low interest rates and had access to massive amounts of capital competing on a daily basis with young couples who wanted to buy houses. They have completely changed the nature of that market. They have also been buying up rental properties and they own so much now that they have a had systemic influence on rents payable in the market. All of the alarm bells should be going off now vis-à-vis the Government's plans in this area.  I have heard people say that we must adhere to the EU rules. If this country has made any mistake over the last 20 years, it has been to try to be the best boy in the class when it comes to the EU. Deputy Durkan mentioned that we have gone way beyond what other countries have done in terms of meeting understood EU requirements. The EU is obviously a positive element in the development of this country, particularly in terms of enterprise and trade, but there are costs attached to the EU too. We need to stand up to the EU in terms of those costs sometimes. On the issue of land, Coillte and forestry, we need to tell the EU to back off. We also need to tell the EU to back off in relation to investing in State housing bodies so that we can build houses for our people. We should have told it to back off the sugar beet sector. Now we need to tell it to back off in respect of the fishing sector. This is an incredible issue. I have been speaking to Patrick Murphy of the Irish South & West Fish Producers Organisation Limited recently. He has met the Department and been negotiating on behalf of Ireland and fishermen at the EU. What is happening to fishermen and fisherwomen right now is incredible. The EU is seeking to decommission up to half of the boats in the fishing fleet. The loss of those boats, especially in the south west, would devastate those communities. Many of their enterprises and jobs still come from fishing. It is difficult to believe sometimes. The State is going to pay €1.5 million to trash a brand new fishing boat. What is wrong with a society that gets a boat and trashes it for €1.5 million? Why can that boat not at least go into some other enterprise such as tourism or transport in those community areas? I am opposed to the whole process. We should be fighting to keep the quotas and the industry we have at the moment. It is interesting that the EU is currently negotiating with Norway, a non-EU state, to give Norway greater access to Irish waters for a bigger catch of blue whiting quota in exchange for EU access to Norwegian waters. The idea that a non-EU country would have 18% of the quota for blue whiting in our waters when we only have 3% of the quota in that area is absolutely wrong. It is happening in large part because we have had successive weak Ministers for agriculture who have gone to the European Union but not stood up for our rights in respect of the massive resources that exist in our seas. We have lost tens of billions of euro of our resources as a result of the deals they have made in the context of fishing. As regards the Bill, I welcome that there is a level of change and oversight, and potentially a regulator, but what I am saying to the Minister is that the regulator must have teeth. It must be able to stand up for farmers. It must be able to equalise the unequal relationship that exists between farmers and two other elements of the supply chain, namely, factories and supermarkets. Those two elements of the supply chain are massively profitable. Supermarkets have a responsibility here too. Supermarkets get off lightly in terms of blame being apportioned in this regard. It is often the case that beside the cash register in supermarkets there is a wonderful big picture of a farmer standing in front of field of crops but the reality is that supermarkets are squeezing the prices being paid to farmers by pushing them down again and again. I say to citizens that we need to use our spending euro to incentivise good behaviour from supermarkets when it comes to the production of food in this country.

The objective of the new office will be to promote the principles of fairness and transparency in the agriculture and marine food supply chain. According to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the office will principally do this in the following ways. It will perform a price and market analysis and reporting function. The regulator will bring greater transparency to the agriculture and food supply chain by carrying out analysis and regularly publishing reports on price and market data, enhancing understanding and enforcement of agrifood unfair trading law, including being designated as the national enforcement authority for the unfair trading practices directive, EU Directive No. 2019/633. The regulator will have the powers to investigate suspected breaches, promote alternative dispute resolution procedures between suppliers and buyers, bring proceedings for offences under the Bill and refer cases to the Director of Public Prosecutions where it believes an indictable offence has been committed. The Bill provides for the imposition of fines of up a maximum of €10 million or 10% of aggregate turnover, whichever is the greater, for indictable offences concerning non-compliance. The Bill also provide for the promotion of public awareness on agrifood, unfair trading law and related matters, including through public information campaigns. The agrifood sector is a significant part of the economy through its exports and employment. In 2021, there were €15.2 billion total agrifood sector exports and it is estimated that the sector accounted for more than 6% of Ireland's modified gross national income in 2020. This office must ensure that a fair share of the consumer euro goes to the farmer and the fisherman. In the context of regulating unfair trading practice, if it does not ensure a viable price for farmers for their work and investment, more farmers in the horticulture, potatoes, pig and poultry sectors will go out of business. Large retailers are using their dominant position to drive down prices to farmers to unviable levels, often below the cost of production, and this has to stop. Can the Minister provide the House with a guarantee that the Bill will end that practice? Meat factories have consistently been cutting prices while farmers are struggling with rising input costs. Confirmation of this is provided in the agricultural price index released by the Central Statistics Office, CSO, which shows how much input costs for farmers have increased in the past year. It is profoundly disturbing to see the meat processors doing their utmost to push down the prices while farmers are grappling with costs of production that are completely out of control. For example, the CSO agricultural price indices show the cost of feedstuffs increased by 34.2% in the 12 months to July last year. The input price index for fertiliser is up by 133.8% and energy prices are 51.3% higher than 12 months ago according to CSO figures. Increases can also be seen in output price in some industries. The price of milk rose by 51.1% in the year and the cattle price increased 16% annually. Right now, primary producers, particularly those in the low-income sheep, suckler and beef sectors, are facing a perfect storm, with costs continuing to rise while factories appear even more determined to pay producers as little as possible. It is a mistake to believe that farmers can shoulder these additional costs and stay in business. It is time for meat processors to show solidarity with their suppliers. It is also time for retailers and consumers and the Government to get to grips with the reality that food cannot be produced out of thin air. We remain sceptical as to whether this new regulatory authority will have sufficient powers to take on the vested interests in the beef cartel in Ireland. The Minister might be able to clarify whether it will be able to do so, but other questions remain open for answers. There is no doubt this is a very difficult time for farmers and fishermen. The livelihoods of inshore fishermen are in serious danger and that is why the Rural Independent Group is putting forward a motion next week to at least raise awareness of the crisis facing inshore fishermen at this time. Larger fishermen are now being forced to decommission in huge numbers, so the supply of Irish fish from Irish waters is under massive threat. Extra quotas have eluded us through the years, which is astonishing. Even the bluefin tuna quota, although it has not been applied for this year, has eluded us through the years due to total inactivity by the Department, which has been failing in its duty to fight on behalf of fishermen in this case. There are fishermen whose lives are in danger. I contacted the Taoiseach regarding the near ramming of an Irish fishing vessel off the south-west coast just before Christmas. He failed to come back to me on the matter, and the previous one did no better . The boat was continually surrounded by a foreign vessel for a number of days. This was all reported to the relevant authorities but nobody did anything about it. I hope the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine will be able to deal with this going forward because we have to find answers. Who is protecting Irish fishing vessels on our seas? There is also a massive threat to food supply. We heard the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, stating yesterday that there will be a cut in the national herd. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have continuously told us that will never happen. I do not know whether they are in conflict with one other or talking to one other or if there is just a little bit of a nod and a wink going on. To me, it is a nod and a wink because Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have decided to call it a fancy name. They will not call it a cut but it will mean that one cannot grow further. Progressive farmers are going to be in dire trouble. This is obviously the green tail wagging the dog. The only winners in all this will be the Brazilians. We will have plenty of Brazilian beef on shelves in Ireland but we will not be able to produce our own product. The next thing is that there will be little or no funding for TAMS. I know farmers. I was talking to two in west Cork recently. Their circumstances, which are slightly different, are interesting. One has a growing farm in which he wanted to invest. He asked me what was going to happen and I said that, to be honest, the Greens are wagging the tail of Fianna Fáil and that Fine Gael has gone off the pitch. He has approval from the bank but pulled the plug on investing in his farm. He said that if I could not guarantee that he would be able to progress after investing in his farm and have more cattle, he would not do so. The other farmer was asked to spread slurry differently and has to buy equipment, but he does not have the funding for it. He owes money for works he has done on the farm and is now in a dire situation. These people will not be able to produce food in the future in our country.
#CarolNolan	unknown-#CarolNolan-party	unknown-#CarolNolan-dob	unknown-#CarolNolan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	443	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill. It is long overdue. My colleagues and I in the Rural Independent Group introduced a motion as far back as 2020 calling for more transparency in the beef sector and fairness for our family farms to protect them and ensure their survival. We know the family farm got us through the bleakest times in this country. We know it certainly kept the lights on in rural Ireland. It remains the backbone of rural Ireland, but the way farmers have been treated for decades has been nothing other than shameful. It is high time, therefore, that robust legislation was introduced to ensure reasonable objectives, namely that farmers will achieve a fair price for high-quality purchase and that they will not be left in circumstances in which they cannot plan or go forward on their farms. Farms are businesses and involve planning, so it is only right that they get fair play. This is long overdue. The farming organisations and people who protested to achieve fairness deserve great credit today. I acknowledge all their efforts. The farming organisations raised these matters with all Deputies from time to time. I acknowledge the constructive and positive engagement I have had with the head of the unfair trading practices enforcement authority within the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Mr. Noel Collins, and his staff. They have always responded to my inquiries promptly and comprehensively. In June last year, the enforcement authority informed me that although the number of complaints it had received to that date was relatively low, it was not surprising given the perceived fear factor that comes with making a complaint. Unfortunately, this is very real. We have all heard it from farmers. What I wanted to clarify with Mr. Collins and his team was why so few farmers and producers were engaging with the new trading protections regime. I also wanted to clarify the kind of response received from the five major multiples. At that point, the authority had received just six complaints, but four of these were outside the scope of the unfair trading practices regulations and two were still at scoping assessment stage. That is an issue I would like addressed to make clear to farmers and producers the exact remit of the new agency. There are many questions still to be answered. I hope the Minister will clear them all up. This is a new regime. As such, a process of education around rights is vital to ensure widespread engagement. I say that because it was also made clear to me in June that there was still significant concern and even fear among farmers and producers when it came to having their rights vindicated or protected by the authority. I accept that the unfair trading practices enforcement authority engaged with farmers actively and constructively to try to address their concerns. I warmly welcome that. It is a step forward. Indeed, in the authority's response to my queries on this matter, it stated clearly it would use every power available to it to ensure any threat or act of retaliation by a buyer arising from a supplier exercising its legal rights would result in the strongest sanctions against the buyer. That is the key message we need to get out. We need to instil confidence in farmers that this will be a robust regime they can welcome. I also welcome the fact that there is now at least an attempt to address certain issues concerning payments made later than 60 days for agricultural and food products, short-notice cancellations of perishable agricultural and food products and unilateral contract changes by the buyer. This may be of value to horticultural operators, in particular. They continue to struggle with the many crises affecting their sector due to the lack of effective peat alternatives. We hope to see some movement in addressing and preventing the risk of loss and deterioration being transferred to the supplier and the refusal of written confirmation of a supply agreement by the buyer despite the request of the supplier. On a related issue, I am aware that the enforcement authority required major multiples to submit implementation reports, which should provide evidence of how they are ensuring compliance with the new regulations. However, I want that aspect of oversight strengthened, and I am sure farmers also want that. I am aware that buyers had to nominate a compliance officer to deal with the enforcement authority. I can only assume this will continue under the new regime. In talking about agricultural products, I condemn the disgraceful attack on Irish agriculture. Dublin Bus is parading misleading advertisements on its buses. I ask Deputy McConalogue, as Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, to stand up for Irish farmers and the agriculture sector. He is in government with Deputy Eamon Ryan, the Minister for Transport. I implore the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to ensure the Government intervenes urgently and condemns what is happening, because it is just not right. Farmers continue to struggle. They continue to struggle for a fair price, and now they are facing more attacks. It has to stop.

It was promised back in 2004 by the then Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Mary Coughlan, who was followed by Ministers Smith, Creed and Coveney. I am sure that if Deputy Cowen had been in office long enough, he would have pursued this, as would the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Dara Calleary, when he was Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine. It is now with the current Minister, Deputy McConalogue, so it is not before time. The regulator must have the teeth to represent the farmers and producers or else it is a waste of time. We are facing the death of agriculture, with those in forestry, pig farming, beef and horticulture, including the wonderful growers of our fruit and vegetables, exposed to the giants in their industries around the world. As in other food industries, there are suppliers of products who are allowed to monopolise by exercising control over supply and exerting pressure. I call on the new regulator to ignore external pressures and work with the producers such as the meat and dairy producers and our fruit and vegetable growers. These are the growers who are forced to tender blind six months in advance, regardless of environmental factors such as the energy crisis in 2022. The steps the growers and producers must take to have products placed on the supermarket shelves are extraordinary. Every country is getting premiums for growing produce while the producers of vegetables and meat in this country are getting only a pittance. I say again to the Minister that the regulator, as with the grocery regulator in the UK, must have the powers to access all information, for example, primary documents of sale, purchase invoices and contracts. The devil is in the detail. The regulator must be able to access all information. Did the Minister know that Grant Thornton was commissioned in June 2021 to conduct a report for the Department on the beef task force? It reported that it was curtailed in making its findings by the absence of data in the market transparency reports. Did the Minister know that? The regulator needs to have the powers to access all information. It must be able to investigate.I will say it again: the regulator needs the powers to investigate. Grant Thornton has told us this in a report on the beef task force. It is evident they were not getting the proper information. They were commissioned by the Minister's Department to do that inquiry. For example, with the supermarkets' promotions, who pays for the promotion? What are the long-term discounts? Are they entirely paid for by the supplier while the larger retailers cream the profits? There must be transparency between the producer and the processor and, equally, between the producer and the retailer. The regulator must have the teeth. This is an opportunity to just do that. Before Christmas, the Government directed the National Oil Reserves Agency, NORA, to release stock for the purposes of electricity generation. This is also important to the agriculture industry. Did the power generation sector make any contribution towards NORA or did they get away with it? After all, it is the ordinary punters such as the farmer and the producers who end up paying, and these multinationals get away with it. I appeal to the Minister to ensure the proposed reversal of this excise duty in February does not happen. If he is committed to the farming industry, he will lobby his Government, as we will lobby the Government, to make sure that this excise duty is not reversed, and that there will not be further taxation, not only on the farmers but on everybody in this country who are depending on producers and farming in the State. The excise duty is up to be reversed in February. I ask the Minister, on the record of the Dáil, to make sure he goes to his Government and the Government partners, to make sure this is not reversed and that we make sure this stays as it is, at a minimum to keep down the fuel costs. The excessive taxes the Government is already taking are enough. Everything in this country is transferred. Everything that produces food in this country uses fossil fuels. The Government already has it on the taxes. This excise duty is only a minor concession that was given. We cannot have it reversed. We need to make sure that it is not reversed for the future of farming going forward. I met the Minister in County Limerick when he was in Kilmallock last year. We were in the mart. At the time I said to him that when we looked around the mart there were only four people at that meeting under the age of 30, two of whom were female and two male. The rest of the people in the sector there were aged between 50 and 70. They want to see that the rest of their families would take on the business of farming, which is in our blood. The younger generation look at farming and see that it is not a viable option for them to farm. They say they would have to work 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to make a farm viable. Any farmer now wants to be able to grow the farm and have the time to make sure the profits are there. This would mean that the younger people of today can take on farming. I believe the Minister would like to see this happening. I ask that he would please make sure his Government does not reverse back on the excise duty in February.

It is certainly long overdue that this issue would be addressed. Along with many in this House, and many farmers - I wish to declare that I am a beef farmer - I took part in some of the protests outside. It originated with the Beef Plan Movement in 2018 or 2019. Contrary to what previous speakers said, in a way this Bill has its genesis in that. I heard Deputy Ó Cuív's contribution. He spoke about his efforts back in 2014. I was a member of the agriculture committee then when he raised the issue. Indeed, he proposed former Deputy, Andrew Doyle as the Chair of that committee. Quite an interesting report was done by the committee at the time. A number of interesting experts from across Europe were brought in, in particular from the French Observatory of Food Quality. Deputy Ó Cuív mentioned the fact that they seemed at that time to have one of the better systems in Europe for looking at who exactly is getting the profits in the sector. At the time it was increasingly apparent that it was not farmers. That trend worsened certainly in the beef sector, leading to the Beef Plan Movement and the protests. Like many, I was quite disappointed with the lack of any tangible outcome to those protests. There was a little bit of movement on the bonus issue, but essentially the difference between in-spec cattle under 30 months and cattle over 30 months remained the same. I would have to say that realistically very little was achieved by those protests. Unfortunately, I am of the view that very little will be achieved by this Bill as it stands. I very much welcome the intention behind the Bill, and I also welcome that the Minister has said he is willing to look at suggestions from across the House as it progresses through the House. One of the big problems is that in Ireland it is hard to ascertain who, if anyone, is making money out of agriculture. I find it hard to believe that nobody is making money. People will say that farmers are always complaining. However, I am beef farmer and 2022 was quite a good year for prices for beef farmers, at least up to last summer or the earlier part of it. Prices were cut quite severely as the year progressed. It made up for the fact that the beef factorises had to pay quite handsomely for beef in the earlier part of the year. They more than compensated for that towards the end of the year. Weather conditions meant that farmers were under pressure to get cattle off the land and sell them into the factories. They become once again price takers. They were not in much of a position to negotiate the price they were going to obtain for those cattle. While farmers' margins are being squeezed throughout, especially within the beef sector, big processors have done very well. I am not one to criticise a successful businessman but Larry Goodman's success as a businessman has been remarkable. He has done sufficiently well to be able to own the building, along with others, that the Department of Health is located in - I am not suggesting there is anything untoward in the fact that he owns it - but this is not indicative of a sector where nobody is making money. Certainly he has managed to make quite a lot of money out of that sector. The big problem we have is that we do know where the money is being made in the sector. We know what farmers are being paid for their beef. We know what their input costs are, so we have a rough idea of the cost of production. We know what beef is being sold for. One can go into any butchers to find out what they charge for a kilo of various cuts. One can go down any supermarket aisle to see what the supermarkets are charging, but we know nothing in between. That came to the fore during those protests. We do not know what the various outlets are paying the processors for the various cuts of meat. We do not know what their conditions are around age, for example. This was one of the issues that featured in those protests. If I am not mistaken, Aldi said they did not care whether the beef was under 30 months. This announcement was very much welcomed at the time. The others, including Supermacs, said the same thing. While Supermacs is not a retailer of raw beef, it sells a large volume of Irish beef, which is welcome. The processors always hid behind, "Well, that is what the retailers are looking for and they want beef under 30 months". Nobody was in a position to independently verify that.If the retailers were looking for beef under 30 months, what was the reasoning behind that? Was there any reasoning behind it other than that it was something they were able to use to push down prices? There was quite a scarcity of beef in the first part of last year, such that prices were okay for farmers. We could not complain about what the prices were. Nobody cared whether they were under or over 30 months. It did not really feature in the discussions. When beef was plentiful again towards the latter end of the year, the weather was bad and farmers were under pressure to sell, suddenly there was a world of a difference between cattle that were in-spec under 30 months and cattle that were over. That leads farmers to be very cynical about this grading system and the 30-months requirement. I appreciate the Minister is from the west and from a farming background, as are many Deputies. It is difficult, if not impossible, to finish cattle on grass under 30 months unless they are fed meal or nuts. We had a discussion once and the Minister said it was very possible. I still disagree with him and believe it is very difficult to finish cattle under 30 months in Ireland unless they are given supplements. Of course, supplements are expensive and becoming increasingly so. Many of the ingredients that go into those rations are imported from across the world, many of them from the southern hemisphere. That brings with it its own carbon footprint. One of the Department's responses has been to suggest that we are going to reduce emissions in the agriculture sector, particularly the beef sector, by reducing the age at which cattle are finished. It will simply not be possible to finish cattle at 24 or 26 months without giving them large amounts of rations. If we are going to count in the carbon footprint of those rations, it will be highly counter-productive. While the beef retailers and processors are forcing cattle to finish earlier, I am not convinced it is particularly environmentally beneficial to do so. The majority of cattle in Ireland are born in the spring. If they are not being fed supplements, they are ready to be killed towards the latter half of their third summer when they are 30 months if the farmer is lucky, or up to 36 months. That is the cheapest way to produce cattle in Ireland. This 30-months requirement is forcing farmers into a more expensive production model. Whom does that benefit and what is its purpose? Can we have a little bit of transparency around this? Unfortunately, the Bill relies on information that is already in the public domain. The price that retailers pay processors is not in the public domain. There is a Bill in America that was introduced in response to the power-----

It was Lidl that said it was going to buy cattle at over 30 months. It is very important because Lidl was willing to go against cartel-like behaviour by all the other retailers. It was quite an important development at the time. Going back to the 30 months, the price the processors are paid by the retailers is important. They are not going to give that out unless they are forced to do so. Section 58(5) states: Agri-Food Unfair Trading Regulations may prohibit a requirement for the supplier to bear all or part of the cost of any discounts on agricultural and food products that are sold by the buyer as part of a promotion unless the buyer, prior to a promotion that is initiated by the buyer, specifies the period of the promotion and the expected quantity of the agricultural and food products to be ordered at the discounted price.Even that will still enable buyers to force producers to pay for the cost of the promotion in the supermarkets. They will not have any choice around that if they want an outlet for their product. I look forward to discussing the Bill in greater detail. Those are two of the flaws I see at the moment. I welcome the fact that the Minister is moving it forward at last.

One thing that needs to be recognised, and I am not going to refer to "my amendment" or whatever like some do, is that everyone in the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine put in amendments. We discussed it and worked together. One good part of being up here is that at least in the committees we are not badgering and going at each other. In fairness to the agriculture committee and its Chair, Deputy Cahill, members from all parties and none worked very constructively. Everyone put an effort into it and went through it at the private meetings and heard different points of view from everyone. We agreed unanimously on all the different amendments we wanted made to the heads of Bill. While every amendment might not be in it, the Minister has taken on a lot of them, which is a good thing. This is going to be a fair test over the next year or two. Farmers do not know where to go. They have lost faith in the CCPC. Every time we write to it, it is nearly coming back attacking the farmers and asking are they in a cartel. There was a feeling that the price of cattle was the one price everywhere and people were asking how come. Those in the CCPC would tell us it was the person eating the meat they were worried about. People would not know what road they were going down with the CCPC and I think a lot of people have lost faith in it. There has to be faith in a system. This new regulator has to have teeth. It has to be able to go in, if there is an anomaly, and check where the money is got or lost. The other thing we have to attack for the sake of farmers - I see these people kicking the daylights out of agriculture but they all have to eat a bit of grub in the morning, the middle of the day and the evening. They think they can live on fresh air and keep writing about the farmers and giving out about them. That does not add up. We have a situation in the agricultural sector, not alone in cattle, sheep, dairy or pigs. There is horticulture, with lettuce and onions and everything coming in from different parts of the world. North County Dublin is a long way from where I live but those people who are growing different types of vegetables are very important as well. If we have learned anything from the war that went on, it is that the more we can encourage people to become self-sufficient, the better. One time long ago when we were little gougers, the technical schools had a competition for the best garden in the country. Every youngster went to horrid trouble with their garden to try to win this thing. Every type of vegetable and everything was in it. The EU has a fair bit to answer for in all of this. Then we were told we were better getting the head of lettuce or cabbage flown in a plane. If we had a head of lettuce or cabbage here in Ireland for a few days, we would say it was going off and throw it to the cattle. Damn me, but the heads that come in from the other countries can stay looking good for about three weeks, which is rather unusual. We should be making sure that we encourage our own people. It happened in milk, it is happening in beef and it is happening in the vegetable sector that the big multinationals that buy all this gear are dictating to the farmer. That day has to stop. There is this business of 90 days' credit and they say next month they will put on offer so many pounds of vegetables or whatever for basically damn all money, to get people into the store.Who is paying the price for that only the farmer who is supplying it? We have seen in the milk market that some people got out of the bottling plant. There was a lot of distress over that. When places close down no one wants to see job losses. We also see farmers being dictated to. We have been told anecdotally by fairly senior people that some of the big multinationals have threatened the co-operatives that they might put out to tender the whole milk market, the amount of milk they take for tender on a Sunday evening. They have threatened that whichever co-operative makes the cheapest bid can have the contract. That is no way to treat people or have a forward contract. There were more people than me in the room when this was being said. If we keep going down that road, it will be a race to the bottom. What happens then? People will get sick of it, farmers will decide not to keep getting kicked and we will end up in a scenario where we are bringing in beef from Brazil, while they are blowing down the Amazon rainforest, and we are getting milk from America or somewhere else. We need to cop on about the way we are treating people. Farmers are fairly enduring people but sooner or later they will get sick of producing something if it is not providing adequate rewards. The Bill makes provision to tighten up regulation. The regulator needs teeth, as has been pointed out by previous Deputies, to be able to go in with enforcement power and to take computers or whatever it needs to see if something is going on. I am not saying this practice is happening in the meat industry but the likes of HIQA will announce it will be doing inspections the following day or the next day. If someone is told they will be inspected tomorrow or the next day, they will have the floor washed and everything looking good. That crack needs to stop. There has to be on-the-spot inspections, like what farmers unfortunately get. Farmers get on-the-spot inspections like that but seemingly everyone else will get the call a day or two ahead of time and be told the inspection is coming so they can be sure to have the Daz out and have everything looking well. This is the last bite at the cherry. Confidence must be brought into the industry that there is somebody there who can investigate, make decisions, regulate, bring out a report and issue fines if someone is doing something that is not legitimate or is making a big amount of money out of it. In certain industries, if there are cartels, we need to make sure we have that covered. I know the Bill will be coming to the committee and I presume there will be amendments. In fairness to everyone on the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, they made an honest effort and I will not be opposing the Bill.

We have been waiting over a year for it and there have been multiple promised delivery dates that were later than what farmers would have wished for, particularly in light of the current inflationary pressures and input costs. An appropriate and empowered sectoral regulator has the potential to finally deliver a level playing field for our farming families. This has been demanded by and is especially important to our beef and sheep farmers who simply do not receive a fair price for their produce. It is welcome that the Minister has accepted a number of the recommendations that came out of the pre-legislative scrutiny report of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, which has questioned if the Minister’s draft Bill is even fit for purpose. Despite delays, the draft Bill appeared to be rushed and was not in keeping with the best regulatory practice we see. It lacked the teeth to tackle unfair trading practices, which farmers had been demanding and which in recent years have been granted to other regulatory authorities in the State. There remains, however, some way to go if this new office is to deliver the fairness and transparency in the agrifood supply chain that the Minister has said he wants to deliver. As it stands, the new office will provide little in additional data on agrifood supply chains, which is a problem. It is a matter of public knowledge what farmers get paid and we also know what food costs. This regulator cannot simply be responsible for collating that information and then putting it in the public domain. It must be empowered to examine the margins throughout the length of the agrifood supply chain. That is vital. In the same vein, if full transparency is to be provided, the scope of the office cannot be limited to business-to-business relationships and needs to be extended to business-to-consumer relationships. My Sinn Féin colleagues on the Select Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine will bring forward amendments to strengthen and empower the regulator further. We stand ready to work with the Minister and we look forward to bringing forward proposals to deliver a regulator that can have a real impact on the lives and livelihoods of farming families, which is so desperately needed.

Farmers in Mayo desperately need this legislation but we need it to mean something. A number of things need to be done on Committee Stage in order to get this right. I ask the Minister to work with us, including my colleague, Deputy Carthy, to make sure we get it right because it is a one-off opportunity. The reason this legislation is before us is the reporting of the cartel-like behaviour that farmers have experienced until now. We have heard that from the farming organisations, farmers themselves and many others over the years. The regulator must have real teeth and the pricing data must be available. There is no point in giving people data that are already available. The evidence has to be gathered and we cannot gather the evidence of bad behaviour if we do not have these data. It is vital that these data are gathered and made publicly available so that the contrast can be drawn. We have an opportunity to get this right and we must do so. We owe that to the farmers in Mayo and across this country who have waited for this legislation for so long.

This has been a good start to the legislative journey through the Dáil and Seanad. I will take on board the various contributions Deputies made. The Bill has been a while in gestation. I acknowledge the pioneering role of my colleague, Deputy Ó Cuív, as the previous Fianna Fáil spokesperson on agriculture, in driving this issue and putting it on the agenda of the then agriculture committee. I mention the work that was put in by all on that committee in putting its report together. When I took over from Deputy Ó Cuív as Fianna Fáil spokesperson on agriculture in 2016, I made sure this was a key priority and was delighted to work with the three parties in government to make sure it was part of the programme for Government commitments. In the past two years, I have brought this issue through the consultation process, working with stakeholders and farming representatives and, subsequently, the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine on pre-legislative scrutiny. I recognise the work that was done by all of the committee's members, including the Chair, Deputy Cahill. Many of them spoke today in great detail on the proposals in this legislation and they brought their various understandings, perspectives, backgrounds and knowledge to the table. The committee put a comprehensive pre-legislative scrutiny report to me, which made a significant contribution to the process that preceded my presenting this Bill to the House. Of the 20 proposals and recommendations made by the committee, I have accepted 18, either fully or along the lines of what was proposed. I will engage further before proceeding to Committee Stage. I have given the various proposals a lot of thought and I know all parties worked together at the committee to come to a clear consensus on how the legislation could be enhanced. I have taken those on board because the objective is to ensure the regulator's office does the job we are setting it up to do and that it works effectively.Undoubtedly, there is a gap in the overall infrastructure of the agrifood supply chain and in the sector. This office will fill that gap and meet that need. There needs to be the capacity to have transparency across the food supply chain. We need an independent arbiter operating on a statutory basis with the heft and credibility to be able to assess and dissect an issue, get the key information and explain it without fear or favour in a way that brings transparency to what is happening. I engaged with Deputy Tóibín earlier because he was making out that it is simply a matter of setting the price and not selling the product for any less than that price. He implied that it is as straightforward and as simple as that and if we just had the will to set a price, it would all be grand. Of course, we are very fortunate that we are a great food producing country, but 90% of what we produce and leaves our farms goes abroad and is sold in markets from Senegal to Singapore to China. It is the markets abroad and the prices that we get abroad which very much determine the price. We are working off international prices. We are trying to get the best possible value for the great product we have, maximising its value and marketing it and continuing to improve and enhance it. Of course, its sustainability, as well as its nutrition and safety, are central to that. In comparison with any part of the world, we are leading in food production and in terms of the quality of what we do. That enables us to maximise our capacity and the price we get. In 90% of cases, the end price is set outside the country. We need transparency on how that price we get outside the country translates throughout the different layers of the supply chain, particularly coming back to the layers within our own country and bringing transparency to that. Deputy Ó Cuív compared regulation to the use of CCTV cameras. The fact that there are eyes on the sector, it is being watched, we are alert to it and we are making every effort possible to bring transparency will be very effective, I hope, in ensuring farmers get the best deal and a fair crack of the whip in terms of the income they get for the hard work they do. There is no doubt about the early hours, long weekends and late nights that go in at farm level, and the amount of time that is put in from when the lamb or calf is born and the cow starts to milk to the point where that produce leaves the farm. Massive work goes in there. While important work undoubtedly goes in after that too, less time is spent on it. Too often, when there is a squeeze on the system it is the primary producers, such as farmers, fishers and horticulturists, that have to absorb all the pain because the margins can be maintained at other levels of the supply chain as they have capacity to manage it. Farmers ultimately get squeezed. The year we have just had, coming out of unprecedented changes in cost inputs and inflation and emerging from the illegal invasion of Ukraine, has spoken to and very much brought to the fore the need to have responsive supply chains. We need a supply chain that moves with the reality of life and that reflects and understands the challenges for the primary producer and does not leave them carrying the can in terms of the cost and losing money, while others can adjust to maintain their margins. The key objective here is putting in place a statutory office that will be an actor in that space and will ensure it as healthy as it possibly can be. It must be an advocate, a pusher and an enabler to ensure that farmers get a fair deal and that family and primary producer incomes are very much at the centre of all of our thoughts. I thank the Ceann Comhairle and Members for their engagement today. I thank my team, Angela Robinson and Sinéad McPhillips. We have a journey to go on over the next short few weeks to bring this legislation to a conclusion. I look forward to engaging further to ensure we have an office that will work very effectively. As I said, the recruitment process for the CEO has been significantly advanced. We are continuing with the work we are doing. I also want to recognise the work the staff in the unfair trading practices office have done in the interim period on the enforcement and oversight of unfair trading practices and will continue to do until such time as we have a new statutory office in place.

I could have raised this issue at any stage in recent months or years but the situation in the Oliver Bond flats in the historic Liberties area, in particular, has gone absolutely buck mad. It is not the only flat complex in the area where there is open drug dealing at a level that has never been seen before. The queues of people outside certain blocks and flats show that this is organised. There are characters running up and down taking orders and delivering cash to different flats as they distribute various drugs such as crack cocaine, cocaine, heroin and e-tabs. You name it, it is available. I, members of Dublin City Council and An Garda Síochána can point to any one of the flats where there has been dealing, yet there does not seem to be any work being done or action being taken. It is like a siege in Dolphin House. The Dolphin House community is a brilliant one. Great work is being done by the Robert Emmet Community Development Project and others, including local soccer clubs. In fairness, some supports have been provided but we are not addressing the elephant in the room, which is that children are passing these queues of people morning, noon and night. There are people queuing up in suits and high-vis jackets for their fixes. There is footage of this; I am not dreaming it up or creating the illusion that there is a problem in one block of flats. There are other blocks of flats which are very similar but the cry from the residents in the Oliver Bond flats in particular has not been heard thus far. The drug dealing is on a scale that I have not seen before, and I have been around in Dublin for many a year. I was there when Concerned Parents Against Drugs, CPAD, was at its height in the 1980s and the Coalition of Communities Against Drugs, COCAD, thereafter, when communities stood up to the drug dealers in their flat complexes and communities. That era is at an end. There is a cry from the residents, given the nature of these drug dealers and the nature of control that they are now asserting over certain areas. It is for the State to stand up to them and give the opportunities to those communities to live. What is happening is that the children's lives, in particular, are being corrupted when they start seeing this day in and day out. When they go to school in their uniforms, they are passing people who are comatose on the stairs because they have injected, they see sexual favours being given on the same stairs, and they see shite and piss and other products of the drug dealing. They pass a queue of 20 or 30 people on their way to school and they come back and the exact same queue is there again. When they are trying to sleep at night, there is tooting of horns demanding delivery. That is happening day in and day out. The good people in that community and other communities and flat complexes where the same problem exists are leaving. They want out. They are the ones who are transferring. Questions were being asked about why people do not move into some Dublin City Council flats. That is the very reason. Why would someone move in when the next-door neighbour is strung out morning, noon and night and allows his or her flat to be used as a drug den or crack house?That is what it is. It is exactly the way it is portrayed in those dramas we see on television. It is at that scale in certain blocks of the Oliver Bond complex at the moment. In other blocks, thankfully, it is not at that scale but there are certain blocks in which people move around when the gardaí once in a while take action.

At the outset, let me say that the Minister, Deputy Harris, and the Government are very conscious of the distressing impact this criminal activity is having on the residents and community around the Oliver Bond complex, which the Deputy just described. Everybody has the right to feel and be safe in their homes and communities. The Government is acutely aware of the substantial and ongoing damage that drug dealing has on communities across the country. Organised criminal activity, including drug dealing, represents a serious threat to community safety. The Minister is assured by the Garda authorities that the Oliver Bond flat complex receives a high concentration of Garda policing on a continual basis from Kevin St. Garda station, as well as several additional policing units within the Dublin metropolitan region south central division. The Minister is further advised that there are designated beats assigned to the Oliver Bond complex, which has ensured further high visibility policing in the area. There were in excess of 321 proactive patrols recorded for the Oliver Bond complex in 2022. This figure does not include additional special operations that were carried out. The policing response ranges from large-scale saturation policing operations involving many different units to smaller-scale operations and daily patrolling. Most recently, I understand that in the last quarter of 2022, a number of concentrated policing operations took place in the Oliver Bond complex. The operations were a collaborative approach between the Dublin metropolitan region south central division's drugs unit, the drug task force, community response team, community policing and regular units. In addition, An Garda Síochána has advised that a large number of seizures of both drugs and cash have been recorded in recent weeks, which has aided in reducing the open sale and supply of controlled drugs and anti-social behaviour within the Oliver Bond complex. More than one quarter of all drug seizures in the Kevin St. subdistrict during 2022 were from the Oliver Bond complex. This has been achieved through the targeting of repeat offenders and the use of CCTV within the complex. Alleged offenders have been pursued on foot by gardaí and safe houses have been identified for follow-up search operations. The Minister is further advised by the Garda authorities that these actions, in conjunction with the application of bail conditions to stay out of the Oliver Bond complex and follow-up applications to DublinCity Council for the issuing of tenancy warnings, have made a significant impact on crime in the area. The superintendent at Kevin St. station has held a number of meetings with representatives from local groups in the community regarding the Oliver Bond complex rejuvenation. I am informed that a very productive meeting with representatives from local groups took place most recently on 13 January at Kevin St. Garda station, with gratitude expressed for the responses and operations carried out by gardaí at Kevin St.. Finally, the Deputy will be reassured to know that Kevin St. Garda station continues to work with ongoing overt policing operations, designated beats and intelligence gathering processes within the Oliver Bond complex. Additional gardaí will shortly be allocated to the community policing unit in Kevin St. Garda station and the number of personnel attached to the drugs unit and the crime task force unit will also increase. There is already a community Garda member assigned responsibility for the Oliver Bond complex. An Garda Síochána has advised that there is regular engagement with residents on initiatives and programmes relating to the complex. Additionally, new members have also been recently assigned to the community response team and the warrants unit, with a focus on Oliver Bond complex.

I did not say that gardaí are not working. In fairness, they are. There have been undercover operations. They act on the information they receive. I can tell them that if they go into H-block now, they will find a queue on the stairs waiting for delivery. When they come in, if they come in in uniform, that queue will just stand to one side and do nothing. When they leave, the operations will continue. They only need to visit a number of flats and they will find those involved in drugs shooting up, selling or whatever. It is like a drug dispensary but they are illegal drugs. Anything you want, you will find. That is the message from the drug dealers. It continues day in, day out. It was even happening on Christmas Day. There are people who have to queue up so that they can get to their own flats because they do not want to be seen to be jumping the queue and attracting the wrong attention from those who are seeking out various different drugs. The gardaí must take action. It is only on Monday that the extra community gardaí are coming in. It is only in the last couple of weeks that the drug squad, which has been obliterated by cuts over the last number of years, has been brought up to some standard, although not even to the standard it was before. The action needs to happen and it must happen quickly. It must also then follow the drug dealers to whatever other complex they go in order that this chain is broken and no other community has to suffer, and no other child has to suffer the sights seen by the children in the Oliver Bond complex.

I will ensure the transcript of this debate is forwarded to the Superintendent in Kevin St. Garda station. The Deputy will also appreciate that the Garda Commissioner is by law responsible for the management and administration of Garda business. The Minister, Deputy Harris, is assured, however, that An Garda Síochána is fully committed and determined to effectively tackle individuals involved in the illegal drugs trade in the Dublin Metropolitan region and, indeed, across the country. More broadly, of course, An Garda Síochána continues to target those involved in the sale and supply of illegal drugs through Operation Tara, which has a strong focus on tackling street-level dealing across the country. Operation Tara is a national priority for An Garda Síochána with a specific focus to disrupt and dismantle the drug-trafficking networks that impact on communities such as those in the Oliver Bond complex and to prosecute those involved at every level. As the Deputy may also be aware, Operation Fógra, which was established in the Dublin metropolitan region to target suspects involved in drug related intimidation, is ongoing. Drug-related intimidation has a harmful impact on family members of persons who engage in drug-related activity. The objectives of Operation Fógra have increased front-line awareness of drug-related intimidation and enhanced collaboration among An Garda Síochána and support organisations. I welcome the significant convictions secured by the gardaí, which have led to the incarceration of key individuals involved in illegal drug dealing. Garda combatting of this serious criminality is making our communities safer.

I recognise the huge efforts and work she is doing in this area. I am sincere about that. I know what is going on. I know the work the Minister of State is doing and I commend her on it. I was contacted on 20 December last by a family in my area. It is best to give an example here. This family has two children, twin boys, who will be three years of age next week. The parents noticed an issue with one of them in November 2021. He started stimming, which involves repetitive body movements and hands flapping. They did not know what the behaviour was at the time. When they brought the children to see the public health nurse in April 2022, however, the nurse told them that from her observation, she was concerned about their development and strongly advised the parents to have them assessed by the area assessment GP, which they did. That happened at the end of May last year. That GP was quite concerned and she sent referrals for both boys to Cope Foundation as their needs were complex. The situation is that one of the boys nudges the parents to the fridge when he wants something. They are almost three years old. The other child does not do that at all; he just bites them. They believe that is due to frustration through not being able to communicate. Both boys are non-verbal. Their parents hope they will be able to talk one day and want to give them the gift of speech. They do not react to their names being called. They are both attending a crèche to help them improve their communication and social skills but they cannot do any really simple things like feed themselves or brush their teeth.This family has another child who is nine months old and is ahead of them at this stage. This is causing a lot of anxiety. This can have other serious consequences because the children cannot tell the parents if there is a problem or they are in pain. One of them had a medical problem recently, could not communicate with the parents, was screaming in pain and ended up in a serious situation. It was almost life-threatening. Luckily enough, they got to the hospital and he went through CT scans, was diagnosed with a serious infection and had an operation to treat it. If untreated, he could have lost his sight. I wrote to Cope Foundation and received a response quickly. This is no criticism of Cope. The chief executive and team are, as the Minister of State will be aware, dedicated and hard-working. When I asked if they could do anything, Cope replied, "Unfortunately, not." It continued:Given the wait times for assessment and intervention I would expect that this family will be waiting for a considerable length of time before they are seen, possibly up to two years. [The children will then be five.] Children’s disability services are experiencing numerous challenges that are causing such delays including but not confined to - the numbers of children that have and continue to be referred (these were significantly underestimated by the HSE at the time of transfer to the Network Teams) [which is a problem]; difficulties in recruiting and training staff.Cope acknowledges the considerable work the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, is doing to try to move things on but the challenges remain. Early intervention is crucial, as the Minister of State realises and we all know, in cases like this. These children need intervention now. If the public sector cannot intervene, will the Minister of State make funds available so the parents can access services for assessment, treatment and support in the private sector? That is the only way we can go in this area. I understand that in some instances if parents pay for assessments in the private sector, the public sector does not recognise those and insists on getting them done publicly. If the Minister of State has the funding, will she make it available to families such as this to get essential early intervention in place?

Regarding the case of the two boys, I take on board everything he said and will talk to the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, regarding the issues he raised but I cannot comment on the case because I was not aware of it before I came in here. The Minister of State apologises for not being here. The Deputy is right that early intervention is key and one of the most important things we have for children who need those supports. With regard to the twin boys, the Deputy spoke of repetitive body movement and other issues and stated that they have been told it will be up to two years before they get support. I will bring all that back to the Minister of State. She is committed to the development and enhancement of children's disability services through the implementation of the progressing disabilities services programme. She acknowledges this change in the programme has been challenging for many stakeholders, particularly children and young people using the service and their families. These challenges have resulted in unacceptably long delays, such as those the Deputy outlined, for families to access much-needed therapies for their children. The Minister of State reiterates her sincere regret at this situation.  At present there are huge challenges in recruiting and retaining staff in the healthcare sector, particularly with regard to the therapy professions required in children’s disability services. This is leading to vacant posts in children's disability network teams, CDNTs, across the country. There are 14 CDNTs in Cork-Kerry community healthcare. The location of each aligns with the 14 community healthcare networks. Vacant posts in Cork, excluding special schools, stand at 38 whole-time equivalents. Local HSE officials are actively working with national HSE in recruitment for these posts. Lead agencies have ongoing recruitment campaigns and panels are in place for vacancies. The measures to enhance recruitment and retention of staff across CDNTs include: target national and international recruitment to include an agreed relocation allowance where appropriate; apprentice and sponsorship programmes for therapy grades; employment of graduates as therapy assistants as they await CORU registration; and the expansion of therapy assistants into the system with HSE supporting individuals to return to education to qualify as therapists. While recruitment efforts proceed, the HSE is also driving a number of initiatives to reduce waiting times for children and families and provide the support they urgently need, such as sourcing therapy assessments and interventions externally via private service providers, to which the Deputy referred. CDNTs have prioritisation systems and caseload management systems, including assessment and intervention pathways in place, ensuring children with the highest priority of needs can access services. Notwithstanding these challenges, it is important to acknowledge the significant work involved in establishing the CDNTs and the services that are being delivered. Approximately 35,000 children are currently receiving supports and services from these teams across the State. However, there is much more work to do. Funding has been provided to the HSE for additional posts in recent years to strengthen the capacity of CDNTs to ensure services can be provided. This funding provides for more than 600 additional whole-time equivalent posts for children’s teams throughout the country. Vacancies are arising not because of a lack of resources but because of supply issues in the health and social care sector for specialist therapy professionals.

A number of issues arise. The externally provided private services, as far as I am aware, in this and other cases were not made known to the parents. If the Minister of State could organise a pathway to be made available and known to parents in such cases, it might resolve issues pretty quickly. If these two boys are not seen for two years, they will be five. Now is the time. Early intervention is vital in these cases. The Minister of State referred to retention and it may be time to consider a retention bonus for critical staff to hold them in position in the HSE and other services. I know of a number of people leaving these services for all kinds of reasons. It is not always pay; sometimes it is morale, burnout, overwork and so forth. The Minister of State and Department should consider carrying out an assessment, consisting of an interview, questionnaire or whatever, with some of these critical staff to see why they are leaving and what is going on. Pay is a factor, but not always; sometimes it is the way they are being treated and the culture in that organisation.  What can I say to the parents of these two boys, who need assistance and support now? Maybe the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, or one of her team can contact me next week to let me know how we can assist them. There are many others. If it is not a matter of resources, let us divert resources to an area through which services such as assessment, supports and therapies can be provided. That is the way to go. I acknowledge the Minister of State said that but it does not seem to be something the parents are being made aware of, and they probably should be.

The allocation for special schools located in Cork is 22 whole-time equivalents and the HSE is actively allocating posts here. Cork-Kerry community healthcare - and this might be important in respect of what the Deputy said about organising a pathway - will establish family forums in each CDNT from March 2023 in line with the CDNT national governance policy. Cork-Kerry community healthcare is committed to ensuring parents' voices are at the centre of CDNT delivery of service and I welcome this approach. The Deputy used the word "urgent" in raising this issue and he is correct. I assure him and the House that the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, will continue to work tirelessly with the HSE, as will I, to find immediate and lasting solutions to staffing issues, which, when resolved, will ensure children and young people can access the services that are vital for their development. I will ask the Minister of State’s office to contact the Deputy. He might provide the details and we will see if there is anything we can do to expedite the vital supports these two young boys need. I thank him for the manner in which he raised the matter.

It is great to see her, I wish her well and I know she will do her best. I am delighted to be speaking to the Minister of State during her first Topical Issue and I know that she will sort it for me. The most common benefit-in-kind tax is on a company car. Changes to tax came in this month and I have huge concerns about the increase in benefit-in-kind tax. It is being touted as a green initiative, but I have my doubts. This week I spoke with one of my constituents who is a sales representative for a Carlow business and who was on a 6% rate that increased to 12% in January. However, the annual mileage is also increasing by 4,000 km. That is hardly great for the environment and that is another issue that he felt strongly about. He spoke to his company about getting an electric vehicle, EV, but anything that would be close to suitable for doing the job costs approximately €80,000. Therefore, the original market value would increase the benefit-in-kind and that would cost the representative €1,610 net yearly during a time of huge inflation. He tells me this is just another bill that he cannot afford. He needs the vehicle to do his job. If this really was a green initiative, I wonder why we are seeking an increase in the mileage bracket and why electric cars are being dragged into it at all. Surely, we should be encouraging people to use electric cars.  While we are talking about electric cars, what is the status of the 2022 electric SPSV grant scheme, eSPSV22? It was paused for applications in April and was reopened in November. There was huge interest in it from taxi drivers and I spoke to many taxi drivers about it. Can the Minister of State tell me if this scheme is successful, given the high cost of electric cars? I have received many queries since then and many people are telling me that this will affect their jobs. It will particularly affect people who live in rural Ireland, such as in Carlow-Kilkenny, which is a rural constituency. In addition, considering the cost of living, every job is now crucial. This seems to have affected many more people than I had realised. I was not really aware of the scale of this scheme, but it is a huge scheme, and it has a huge effect on people. I ask that something is done and that we look at it. It needs to be addressed, considering that it is affecting so many people. Another man said to me, "I have a mortgage, I have small kids, my expenses are going up and up and at this rate with all of these extra taxes, I do not know how I am going to survive". I said that I would bring the issue before the Dáil as a Topical Issue. As this is the Minister of State’s first Topical Issue, I ask her to do the best she can.
#JenniferCarrollMacNeill	unknown-#JenniferCarrollMacNeill-party	unknown-#JenniferCarrollMacNeill-dob	unknown-#JenniferCarrollMacNeill-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	466	I thank Deputy Murnane O'Connor for her comments. I will do everything I can to address all the points she has raised. Where I do not have the information, I will get it and come back to her with more detail. The important point to set out is that Government policy has focused on strengthening the environmental rationale behind all company car taxation. In the 2021 Climate Action Plan - and I am conscious that the Dáil was debating the 2023 plan the other day - the Government committed to introducing an emission-based taxation regime for company cars across the board. Until the changes that were originally brought in as part of the Finance Act 2019, Ireland's vehicle benefit-in-kind regime was unusual in that there was no overall carbon dioxide basis in the regime. I know Deputy Murnane O’Connor is aware of the environmental reasons that underpin the other vehicle taxes that are in place, such as vehicle registration tax and motor tax, as well as their structure. In those taxes, higher-emission vehicles are subject to higher rates of tax. The measure coming into effect this month regarding vehicle benefit-in-kind extends that rationale, bringing it into step with other vehicle taxes, which are emission based.  In the Finance Act 2019, a CO2-based benefit-in-kind regime for company cars was introduced to commence on 1 January 2023. From the beginning of this year, the amount taxable as benefit-in-kind is still determined by the car's original market value and the annual business kilometres driven. Now, however, new CO2 emissions-based bands determine whether a standard, discounted or surcharged rate is also taxable. In certain instances, the new regime will provide for higher benefit-in-kind rates, for example, for above average emissions and higher-mileage cars. It should be noted that the taxable rates remain largely the same in the lower- to mid-mileage ranges for the average lower-emission car. Of course, EVs benefit from a preferential rate of benefit-in-kind, ranging from 9% to 22.5% depending on mileage, whereas fossil-fuel vehicles are subject to much higher benefit-in-kind rates, up to 37.5%. This new structure with CO2-based discounts and surcharges is designed to incentivise lower-emission cars. In the new regime, the number of mileage bands has been reduced from five to four, and indeed the Deputy has raised that. I am aware that there are discussions around the mileage bands in the new benefit-in-kind structure, as they can be perceived as incentivising higher mileage to avail of the lower rates, leading to higher levels of emissions. The rationale behind the mileage bands is that the greater the business mileage, the more the car is a benefit to the company, rather than to its employee, and the more the car depreciates in value, the less of a benefit it is to the employee.  I believe that better value for money for the taxpayer is achieved by curtailing the number of subsidies available and building an environmental rationale directly into the benefit-in-kind regime. It was therefore determined that reforming the benefit-in-kind system to include emission bands provides for a more sustainable environmental rationale, rather than continuing the current system with exemptions for EVs. That brings the taxation system around company cars into step with other CO2-based motor taxes in Ireland as well as the long-established CO2-based vehicle benefit-in-kind regimes in other member states in the EU. In addition to that and in light of the crucial Government commitments on climate change, budget 2022 extended the preferential benefit-in-kind treatment to EVs to end 2025 with a tapering mechanism on the vehicle value threshold. That means that the quantum of the relief is phased down from €50,000 in 2022, to €35,000 in 2023, €20,000 in 2024 and €10,000 in 2025. This exemption forms part of a broader series of generous measures to support the faster uptake of EVs by companies and facilitate their fleet planning. I can come back to this in my closing remarks, but it is important to say that this is an important part of our collective climate transition. The benefit-in-kind charging mechanism was introduced in legislation in 2019 and we have deliberately given that three-year lead-in time to allow for fleet planning as well as to allow for companies to transition to this measure.

I welcome this, and I am very climate aware, as we all are. We all want climate action, which is so important and is part of our duty going forward. However, the biggest issue in this particular case that I am dealing with is the closest car that he can get that will do the mileage. We live in rural Ireland, so when we talk about mileage we are talking about a lot of mileage. An EV that would sustain the mileage he needs would cost up to €80,000. As he said to me, he could not afford it. I do not think his company can afford it. We need to get a balance. We know we have to have climate action and we are all promoting EVs. We also have to make them within the range of people who depend on a car for their living every day and who drive around the country, and for that car to be sustainable and climate friendly. This man is telling me that he is a young man with a young family and he cannot afford an EV. With this extra 12% tax from 1 January, he does not know where he stands at the moment. While I welcome this measure and, as I said, I am all for climate action, we need to find the balance. We do not want people in a predicament where they are losing money and have a lot of bills to pay when they are trying to play their part in climate action, like we all are. I think this needs to be looked at again and the price of EVs needs to be looked at. In years to come things will have changed because we will have a lot more of them. It is like years ago when the mobile phone came out first. Everybody was trying to get used to them and now everybody is able to have a mobile phone.In years to come, there will be many more electric cars. We all welcome the money the Minister for Transport announced earlier this week for all these new stations where people will be able to plug in and charge their electric cars. I ask that the Minister of State examine this issue further. It is a concern. I have had many phone calls about it. We need to find a balance here.

This is about a transition model. Ireland is fully committed to meeting our climate goals and a key part of that involves the decarbonisation of transport and the large-scale transition to electric vehicles. The Deputy was quite right to highlight the announcement by the Government this week relating to the electric vehicle charging infrastructure strategy and the additional work being done in that regard. There are challenges in this transition for people living in rural areas but also for people in urban areas, many of whom travel from Dublin to locations throughout Ireland to do various work as part of their company obligations. The Deputy was correct to highlight the EV charging network in that context. What is being attempted here is a transition away from the electric vehicle exemption, introduced in the Finance Act 2017. That has been extended to 2025, recognising the changes introduced in last year's budget. Significant discounts are available through that scheme and I can provide the Deputy with a note on that. This matter was legislated for in 2019 and there was a signalling of the lead-in time. We have taken additional steps to extend other benefits to try to find that balance and transition that she mentioned. We must collectively make the necessary changes to move to a decarbonised transport system and this is a big part of that, bringing one of the vehicle taxation measures into line with our other vehicle taxation measures. It has had a significant lead-in time and I appreciate the practical difficulties it raises for the Deputy's constructions and those of other Deputies during the transition. If she would like me to look in more detail at a specific case, I will be more than happy to do so.

I appreciate this is not his area, so I hope he has been well briefed. It is a pity the Minister for Education is not here to take this issue because it is important for many students and parents in north Wicklow. Greystones Community College is a secondary school in Greystones. For many years, there was great pressure and demand for school places in our locality and we were delighted when the school was sanctioned, given it met a significant need in the area. Since its sanctioning, it has been in temporary accommodation at three different sites, including a tennis club, where the principal's office was situated in a bathroom. It has also been accommodated at a rugby club and it is now shared between there and a GAA club. The students are being taught in old prefabricated buildings rather than a dedicated facility or building and they have no PE facilities or sports hall. They have a reduced curriculum because the school is not able to provide all the subjects to the students. Land in the area has been allocated and planning permission provided for the new school. It is costing enormous sums to provide this temporary accommodation. The Department is paying hundreds of thousands of euro while the full build is being completed, and land is sitting idle. I wanted to raise this issue with the Minister for Education because in June of last year, I was told the school was on track to be completed for September 2024, which was welcome news. Since then, however, I received notification that the Minister for Health, who is sitting in the Chamber, was provided with an update indicating that the construction of the school would be completed in mid-2025, which would have a considerable impact on the school given its demand is continuing to grow. It is a very popular school and it will not have the facilities to provide enough places for students who need them. It will need to put a cap in place. In November last, I wrote to the Minister for Education's office to try to find out what was happening with regard to the school because parents, students and the school community were very worried about the issue, although I did not receive a response. I again wrote earlier this year and have not received a response to that either. I hope the Minister of State has been given a comprehensive prepared response from the Department of Education on this issue. My understanding is the Department told the parent body that lot 6, which includes Greystones Community College, was to go to tender in 2022-23 but that, in fact, it did not go to tender in 2022. Did the tender issue in 2022, and if not, why not? Will it happen in 2023? The initial response I received from the Minister in the middle of last year suggested construction would begin in early 2023, but that deadline has passed. There are significant concerns about this and I hope the Minister of State will have a comprehensive response for me.

She has assured me she is working with the Minister for Health to try to progress the issue the Deputy raised. In April 2018, the then Government announced plans for the establishment of 47 new schools between 2019 and 2022, including a new regional solution at post-primary level for the Kilcoole and Greystones school planning area, and the school in question opened in Greystones for the 2021-22 school year. The permanent building project for Greystones Community College, raised by the Deputy, is being delivered under the Department’s design and build programme, which uses a professional external project manager to progress projects through the stages of architectural planning, tender and construction. As part of the conditions of sale of the permanent site for the school at Glenheron, Greystones, the lodgment of the application for planning permission for the project was under the remit of the vendor, and the Department worked closely with the vendor on the planning application for the new school. Planning permission was submitted to the local authority on 21 February 2022 for the development of a new 1,000-pupil post-primary school and four classrooms for children with special educational needs, a PE hall, an associated staff car park, ball courts and ancillary accommodation at Glenheron. The final grant of planning permission, which was subject to 11 conditions, was received on 19 May 2022. The Department has a large pipeline of projects for delivery under the schools building programme. The main elements of the pipeline currently involve more than 1,300 schools building projects for delivery under the Department’s large-scale and additional accommodation scheme. These projects are in progress at the various stages of planning, design, tender and construction. The Department has a strong record in the delivery of school buildings. During the period 2018 to 2021, 691 schools building projects were completed under the large-scale capital programme, LSCP, and the additional school accommodation scheme, ASA. These projects delivered more than 64,000 school places. While the numbers have yet to be finalised, it is estimated that more than 150 schools building projects were delivered in 2022. This month, the Department will assess the overall requirements for 2023 and the associated work programme and will update the patron body for Greystones Community College in due course. As the Deputy outlined, the school is currently located in interim accommodation on the Greystones Éire Óg GAA site and the Greystones Rugby Football Club site. The Minister assures the Deputy that she and the Minister for Health are working closely to try to bring this matter to a speedy conclusion.

He said the Department has a strong record of building schools and I absolutely disagree, not least in respect of Wicklow. In that county, there have been years of instances where demand has built up and students cannot get into a school within their locality, where they have to fight for a place and where their parents or the school community have to campaign. When a school is finally sanctioned for the community, that school takes years to get under way. In Wicklow, there have been cases where, because of building issues, those schools have been held up.When it comes to Wicklow, the record of school building is not something on which the Department should be selling itself. I am glad to hear the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, is working closely with the Minister of State and perhaps the Minister of State might have further information on this. I acknowledge he pledged to keep this school on track for 2024. It is now clear that deadline will not be met. The building on the site and the construction was meant to start now and there is still no news about whether a tender has been put in place. It is unacceptable and it appears this is the case in a lot of schools. A bloc of schools have gone to tender but for some reason, the Department has decided not to tender for this school. As the Minister of State is in contact with the school body, I would appreciate it if he got in touch with it to tell it what is going on because it is not fair that it must deal with these temporary accommodations and that the promises made to it have been broken. This is not the first time it has happened but these promises have been broken. Those students deserve to know where they are going to be attending school in two years' time and where they will be sitting their leaving certificate exams. They deserve the full curriculum, not a limited one, and deserve to have proper facilities, such as a PE hall. It is not much to ask. Considering that the Department has made repeated promises in this regard, I am not sure whether the Minister of State can give me an update but I would appreciate it if he could do so, if he had further information, because it appears as though that he and the Minister, Deputy Foley, are working closely on it. It would be really great if he could give me an update on this.

It seems that 150 school building projects were delivered in 2022. The Minister, Deputy Foley, in particular has prioritised ample investment in securing record capital budgets. I will ask her office to reach out to the Deputy on the outstanding correspondence and I have no doubt but that she and the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, are working closely to try to deliver this project for Greystones. As I said, work is ongoing during the month of January to finalise the 2023 programme and hopefully, that should be brought to a head soon. I will bring the Deputy's concerns about the lack of response to the Minister's attention.

I am delighted to be able to present this motion today and I thank my colleagues in the Regional Group and Cáit Nic Amhlaoibh, in particular, for all her hard work.  It seems not a day goes by when our attention is not drawn to some area of the health service which is in crisis. Today it is the turn of the dental services. It is not just to highlight the problems but to try to encourage and persuade the Government to bring about action that will move to solve the problems. In June 2021, I brought forward and presented a Topical Issue matter related to the dental treatment services scheme, otherwise known as DTSS. This was brought about on foot of many constituent patients and dentists coming to me and highlighting the issues they were facing with the scheme. For the benefit of those who are not aware, the DTSS means that medical card holders are entitled to a free dental examination in each calendar year, as well as any extraction required along with a number of other limited services. In November 2020, it was reported that the number of private dentists participating in this scheme had dropped by 16%, from 16,054 to 13,093, in the ten months between January and October 2020. It was estimated at the time that approximately 200,000 medical card holders were facing delays for treatment as a result. To give an example of the practical implications of this, at the time I put forward that Topical Issue, the number of dentists in the scheme from Wexford and New Ross districts had reduced from 14 to four. I also questioned the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, on the dental treatment scheme on 12 July 2022, and highlighted a constituent named Sean Hayes who resorted to pulling his own teeth due to a failure to be seen by the dentist; he had tried seven. In response, the Minister stated:I have allocated a very significant amount of extra money. The forecast spend for this year would have been about €40 million for this scheme. We have increased that from €40 million to €66 million. Unfortunately, thanks to an email I received from the dentist, I later was to discover that in 2009 or 14 years ago, the spend on adult medical card dental services was €86.8 million. That is some €20 million more than the increased budget for 2022. I wish the Minister had mentioned that in his response. The dentist also remarked that the costs in dentistry have increased exponentially since Covid-19 and this increase, will not even cover that. The dentist went on to tell me that they had resigned their DTSS contract in 2020 and was fully booked for the rest of this year and noted this story was similar with many of their colleagues. The dentist noted the DTSS is outdated in its scope and so burdened with bureaucracy that most dentists like my correspondent will never accept another DTSS contract, regardless of what increases in fees are offered. This motion calls on the Government to review, reform and implement a renewed DTSS, to increase tax incentives for private patients receiving treatment and much more, as well as the engagement of all stakeholders. Dentists first and foremost need to be consulted about why so many are leaving the scheme. Those people have a greater level of knowledge as to what is happening on the ground than do the Department's administrators. Once those issues have been identified, we can go some way towards developing a realistic scheme that is attractive to dentists and will improve outcomes for patients.  We also recognise in the Regional Group, as stated in the motion, that the lack of primary school and early dental check-ups leads to problems further down the line. Some children are not receiving their first check-ups until secondary school age, which, coming after many essential developmental milestones such as the arrival of adult teeth, causes problems that are unnecessary and could have been prevented. We are all familiar with the phrase, "a stitch in time saves nine". Unfortunately, when it comes to dental services there are not enough stitches being sewn.  Looking at the HSE orthodontic services in County Wexford, we currently have only one of two consultant orthodontists in place, while HSE figures show that 524 children are awaiting orthodontic treatment while 93 over-18s, who were identified as needing treatment before the age of 18, are waiting for treatment. During a speech on dental services in April 2021, I referenced a letter from a parent which stated their child was assessed by a HSE orthodontist in Enniscorthy on 8 June 2018. The parent was informed the child would definitely qualify for dental treatment through the HSE as he is an extreme case but there was a four-year waiting list. The parent was extremely shocked by this but was reassured by the orthodontist as she explained this would be the optimal time for the child. The parent rang the orthodontist's department during the first lockdown but the phone was not answered and no one responded to the parent's voicemail. The parent finally managed to get through in April 2021 and was told by the secretary that the child would have to wait for another three years. That meant the waiting list had gone from four years to six years. A couple of weeks prior to that speech of April 2021, I wrote to the Minister's Department and received confirmation that the waiting list was approximately 72 months in duration. This is the reality for many parents and patients.  Oral health care is extremely important and fundamental to our overall health and well-being. Oral diseases are among the most prevalent diseases globally and have serious health and economic burdens, greatly reducing quality of life for those affected and sharing risk factors with chronic disease such as heart disease, obesity and diabetes. Our dental services are in disarray and need to be tackled head-on with sustained and meaningful action to bring about better and swifter results. This must include a top-to-bottom review and a long-term strategy for improvement, including providing additional training to allow paediatric dental services to operate where a lack of paediatric nursing staff is currently preventing dental surgery under general anaesthetic; providing additional undergraduate places for dental graduates in Irish universities; providing extra training places for auxiliary workers and a renewed vocational training scheme; improving career paths for auxiliary dental staff; reforming the work permit scheme for dentists and dental nurses; and immediately addressing the uncertainty over the public dental service. These are all necessary actions to bring about improvements.I hope that Deputies from all parties and none will support the motion.

The connection between periodontal disease and a myriad of serious health conditions has long been medically proven. Without proper preventative dental care, people can become more susceptible to cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, cancer, respiratory infections and even dementia due to the circulation of various bacteria in the body. Yet, despite this knowledge and the constant emphasis on preventative healthcare, we continue to risk the health of 37% of people in Ireland. We risk their health because they receive their dental care through the medical card system. We threaten their health because of the dismal level of dental care that a medical card allows them to receive. Medical cardholders are entitled to one free dental examination in each calendar year. They can have as many extractions as they require, but only two dental fillings are free in a 12-month period. Just one first-stage root canal treatment is available annually for teeth, but only if that is at the front of the mouth. As medical cardholders, people are entitled to an upper and lower denture every five years. In fact, in some cases, dentures will not be approved by the HSE if it deems there is no clinical necessity. This is the full extent of the entitlements of medical cardholders. It is the barest of minimums. If a dentist determines that a medical cardholder needs further fillings to save his or her teeth, the medical cardholder is prevented from having this work unless he or she can fund it independently. Dental care is expensive. Therefore, many, if not all, choose to have their teeth extracted when fillings would be appropriate, as they cannot afford costly dental work. They choose that option because extractions are free. We threaten the health of people even further because up to 80% of those who have a medical card have enormous difficulties when trying to access dental care. There are currently fewer than 650 dentists remaining in the medical card scheme in Ireland to serve 37% of the population. The number has hit a ten-year low. These figures show that the current situation is untenable, and it becomes more untenable with every passing year. Countrywide, private dental practices that were contracted to provide services have turned their backs on the dental treatment services scheme. This is not because they do not want to treat medical cardholders. The reality is that it is not viable for them as business people to do so. Modern dental practices employ nurses, hygienists and office staff and have substantial overhead costs. They must be fairly reimbursed for their work. They must protect their businesses. In almost all cases, community healthcare dentists are at full capacity. They are simply unable to take on new patients and have no choice but to turn people away. In my constituency of Tipperary, hundreds of patients, young and old, are denied access to dental treatment. It goes against the ethos of medical practitioners to deny people with a medical card, including children, disabled people and elderly patients the proper care they need, yet this is what is happening every day in Tipperary and across the country. As is the case with almost all health professionals in this country, there is a serious shortage of dentists at the present time. Those who are practising cannot run and staff a business by working for the reduced rate of pay they receive for treating people in the medical card scheme. Despite their best efforts, community dentists are overwhelmed. The availability of licensed dentists per capita in this country has not increased since 2005. The number of new Irish-trained dentists entering the Dental Council of Ireland has not changed in 25 years. Therefore, Ireland has become reliant on overseas-trained dentists with almost half of our current dentists receiving their training in other countries. Ironically, dentistry remains among the top choices on CAO applications every year. However, because there is such a limited number of training places available, even those who achieved the highest possible number of points in their leaving certificate fail to secure admission. The Irish Dental Association has been calling for significant investment in the UCC and TCD dental schools to enable Ireland to train more dentists, dental nurses and dental hygienists. The call goes unheard, despite the dental crisis we have been witnessing in recent years. A dental school at UCC was due to commence development in 2019 but, as yet, nothing has happened. Many students who wished to study dentistry left Ireland to study abroad and have not returned once qualified. Emigration of our healthcare workers and, indeed, our potential medical professionals is a significant part of the crisis in our health system. Unless constructive action is taken, the slippery slope will continue to get steeper. The dental service is falling apart. Thousands of patients are neglected. The system is broken. We need radical action to rescue dental services.

I thank my colleagues in the Regional Group for tabling the motion before the House. In recent years, I have lost count of the number of times I have heard of people going up to the North to Newry, or even abroad, for dental treatment due to the cost and availability of dental services in my constituency of Louth and East Meath. In tabling this motion, we in the Regional Group want to highlight the problem while also offering real solutions to the Government. The bottom line is that dental services should be affordable and available. Unfortunately, it is neither. We must improve access to dental care in an equitable and sustainable manner for all, across all income groups. With an almost 25% fall in the number of dentists claiming reimbursement through the dental treatment services scheme since December 2020, the Minister for Health approved new measures to provide expanded dental healthcare for medical cardholders in the DTSS in April 2022. However, according to the Irish Dental Association, many dentists have withdrawn from the scheme, as it is not fit for purpose, which means that assess to dental care, despite having a medical card, is scarce. The number of dentists providing treatment to medical cardholders has more than halved. For this reason, the motion calls for the provision of additional undergraduate places for dental graduates in Irish universities, as well as extra training places for auxiliary workers and a renewed vocational training scheme. The lack of dental services is having a knock-on effect on children, whereby some children who should have been seen by the HSE dental service three times before the age of 12 are only seeing a dentist for the first time when they are well into secondary school. To put this in context, children are between 15 and 16 years old before they receive the first of their three dental checks. There is a backlog of almost ten years in parts of the country to access the HSE school dental screening service. For this reason, we wish to push for reform of the dental tax relief scheme, the Med 2 form, to increase the tax relief to a minimum of 30%, and to expand access to treatments and the reliefs available. We are also calling on the Government to provide additional training to allow paediatric dental services to operate where a lack of paediatric nursing staff is currently preventing dental surgery under general aesthetic. I have recently been contacted by numerous concerned constituents who have been refused dental care at their regular practice due to their medical card status. Additionally, constituents who are on the adult oral surgery list or who have a child on the paediatric special care waiting list for patients have also come to my clinics having been waiting an extraordinary amount of time for essential medical treatment. In tabling this motion, we in the Regional Group want to highlight the potential dangers that can result from delayed dental care. Due to the effective collapse of the dental treatment services scheme, oral diseases are becoming more common and share common risk factors with chronic disease, such as heart disease, obesity and diabetes. Modifiable risk factors, such as the overconsumption of sugar, tobacco use, alcohol use, poor hygiene, and underlying social factors are often the primary cause of oral disease. This should indicate that oral health conditions are largely preventable and can be treated in their early stages. However, the Government must step in. Out-of-pocket costs for oral healthcare can be major barriers to accessing care. Therefore, an integrated approach for the prevention and treatment of oral and general healthcare is required. When the oral health of the nation suffers, the people who suffer most are usually the people who have the greatest oral health needs and the least amount of income to afford dental care. That is what dentists report to us all the time.In 2021, Dr. Joseph Green warned that unless the provision of basic dental services for adult medical card holders is addressed urgently at the highest level, the HSE Louth and Meath dental service may be forced to confine dental services to emergency treatment only, to the detriment of the oral health of children and adults and, in particular, those with special care needs. I am shocked that, two years later, the scale of the problem in terms of waiting times for dental treatment and the impact of withdrawal of care for medical card patients have not been addressed. This flies in the face of the Government's promises under the national oral health policy to develop a model of care that will improve access and enable preventative approaches. The Minister for Health and the HSE urgently need to engage with providers and the representative body and put an effective plan and resourcing in place to ensure the people of Louth and east Meath have timely and full access to essential dental treatment. Our motion highlights the urgent requirement of reform of the current DTSS contract model, in particular as it applies to medical card holders and children who urgently require dental care or orthodontic treatment. We call for the reform of the working permit scheme for dentists and dental nurses, a commitment to the training and recruitment of dentists and the immediate addressing of the uncertainty the public dental service has caused. My colleagues in the Regional Group and I are looking for cross-party support for this motion. I look forward to working with everyone to find a solution. We feel the review, reform and implementation of the DTSS, through the engagement of all stakeholders, is required immediately. I meet a lot of children who come in with their parents and the condition of their teeth is dreadful. A child who is 15 or 16 years of age has been waiting nearly ten years to get their teeth seen. As Deputy Murphy said, 20 years ago the budget was perhaps €20 million more than it is today. That is wrong. I am a firm believer that prevention is the best cure. Older people in my constituency give up when they sit in a dentist's chair and tell the dentist to pull all of their teeth out because they cannot afford to come back again. We cannot afford that in this day and age.  Children who are six, seven or eight years of age come to my clinic with their parents and their teeth are all over the place. Having an examination or a brace could help them. They sit beside children in school and children say there is a smell off someone's breath. It is wrong. All organisations need to get together. Communication is the best way forward. Everybody wants the best for children, families and everyone else. I ask the Minister to renegotiate the contract and get the system up and running again.

I have taken on board the points that have been made. I acknowledge that many Deputies in the House have raised this issue. It is one of which I am very aware and one on which were taking a lot of action. We all want to see more happen as quickly as possible. I want to lay out some of the actions we are taking. I acknowledge that for too many people this has become very urgent. We know many dentists have left the treatment scheme. I will cover the various aspects of oral healthcare covered by the HSE. A lot of money and services are provided and many adults and children are helped every year. However, there are some significant pinch points, and for those adult and child patients, this is an urgent issue. I will come back to the DTSS in a moment. I would like to lay out for colleagues the level of increase in investment and some of the things that are happening. We are discussing what else needs to be done. Last year, post Covid, the allocation to oral health care was more than €200 million, a sizeable investment in oral health care from Government. It shows a commitment to the best possible oral healthcare. We want this and know we are not there yet, but we are committed to improving the service year-on-year. Some €200 million is allocated to HSE public dental services, HSE orthodontic services, the DTSS, which colleagues have discussed, and the dental treatment benefit scheme for insured, self-employed and retired workers, that is, those who have the necessary PRSI contributions. Last year, more than half a million people benefited from those services. While we in politics focus on the parts that are not working, which is where we spend the vast majority of our attention, it is important to acknowledge the work done by healthcare workers. More than half a million men, women and children received world-class dental care and oral healthcare last year, provided through Government funding and largely implemented through the HSE. Everyone needs to have timely access to healthcare for appointments to see healthcare professionals for diagnostics and treatment, but there are challenges. It is a priority for the Government to address this in the short term, and we are taking short-term actions, as Deputies have referenced, through much-needed reform to oral healthcare in Ireland. Important structural changes are required and are being implemented. I want to talk about the HSE public dental service. The salaried public dental service last year provided care to 143,000 adults and children. Those with additional needs who cannot receive care in a general dental practice may receive special services provided by HSE public dental services. These patients are given oral health examinations, where necessary, and treatment is provided using additional supports. The scheme also provides a targeted programme that includes screening and necessary treatment for children at important stages of development, that is, children aged six to eight years of age, those aged between 11 and 16 years and, subject to capacity, those aged between nine and 11 years. They are the three development stages addressed. Emergency care is also provided to children up the age of 16 and those with complex and additional needs. The service provides care to many children and adults who would not otherwise have access to oral health care services. As we are all aware, coming out of the pandemic, there are backlogs in the targeted screening programme in particular. This is leading to delays in children receiving their first appointment. It is something none of us want. We know early intervention is essential in oral and many other parts of healthcare. What are we doing about this? In the budget for this year, the Government has allocated €15 million, an unprecedented allocation, for a range of measures to protect access to services through once-off funding. A total of €5 million is being invested on a once-off basis to support the provision of care to eligible children and adults, including addressing the backlogs in targeted primary school class programmes. On orthodontic services, the public oral healthcare service provided by the State includes orthodontic treatment. It is provided by HSE orthodontists to patients referred before their 16th birthday who have a significant need. In excess of 10,000 people are currently in active orthodontic treatment funded by the State. Given the nature of treatment, it takes several years to complete. More than 2,000 of these patients are receiving treatment with a private provider through a procurement initiative. We have allocated €4 million in additional funding for that programme for this year. It will allow us to target those who have been waiting the longest to make sure they get access to treatment and, in some cases, more complex surgical care. Last year, through the DTSS, which is the subject of a lot of debate in the Chamber, the State provided care to more than 360,000 medical card holders. I fully acknowledge that more needs to be done and dentists have been leaving the scheme for a variety of reasons. Nonetheless, 360,000 men, women and children received oral healthcare through the scheme last year. It is important we acknowledge the work that was done to that effect. The scheme provides basic and more complex care such as dentures and a broad range of treatments for patients with additional needs. To address contractor concerns regarding the DTSS, interim measures came into effect from 1 May last year. We also increased the fees paid to dentists for most treatments by 40% to 60%. Dentists have said they want more and are clearly making more money from private than public patients. They are choosing to spend their time treating private patients over public patients. Deputies have raised concerns around the administrative burden faced by dentists, something which has to be looked at.One of the things we are not good at is having streamlined processes and easy access for providers. That is something I will take on board and bring back to the Department. On the DTSS payments, we looked at November of last year, which is the most recent month for which we have information, versus the previous year. What we found is that the level of activity on the scheme is increasing, which is positive. We found that 3,000 more patients received care, year on year, and over 15,000 additional scale and polish treatments were done. That treatment is now available, as colleagues will be aware, to adult medical card holders. It was taken out of the scheme some years ago but we put it back in. I allocated €10 million to the budget for last year to put that back in, which was important. It brought medical card holders in line with people who have PRSI eligibility and it is good to know that 15,000 extra scale and polish procedures were done on foot of that. Nearly 2,000 more oral health examinations were also carried out. I fully acknowledge there are difficulties in some parts of the country where many dentists have left the scheme. That is a real concern for me and for everyone else in this House. That said, it is positive that a lot more money is being allocated. It is important that the fees to dentists have gone up by almost 50% in one year, which is a very big increase. It is also positive that the volume of care being provided and the number of patients being seen has gone up but there is more that we need to do. We are engaging with the representative body and we need to see how we can bring a lot more dentists back into the scheme. A sum of €5 million has been allocated on a one-off basis to support the HSE's safety net service for adult medical card holders. These are people who need emergency care but who cannot get it through the DTSS. I have allocated €5 million for a safety net fund specifically for those patients. Deputy Verona Murphy and others have raised issues affecting their constituents in this regard previously. We need reform. The national oral healthcare policy, called Smile agus Sláinte, was approved in 2019 but it is fair to say that due to Covid-19, it was not implemented between 2019 and 2022 at anything like the level needed. One of the things that was needed was a significant increase in funding. Through last year's budget I allocated a lot of extra money to oral healthcare and then in the budget for this year, I allocated a lot more again, in order to increase services, engage with the representative bodies and reform the DTSS. We are also going to start hiring some senior clinical leadership roles into the HSE. The feedback I got from the chief dentist who works in my Department is that while the national strategy is excellent and the money that was put in place last year and this year to apply the necessary reforms is welcome, we need to have serious senior clinicians within the HSE driving the reform. On that basis, I funded those posts through the budget as well. There is a provision of an additional €15 million this year to progress implementation of the policy. I thank Deputies for continuing to raise this issue with me. It is a priority. There has been a big backlog and we know there are challenges. I have allocated a lot of additional funding and we are now getting on with implementing the national strategy, Smile agus Sláinte. The call for a significant overhaul of the DTSS has been heard and that is something we are undertaking now. I acknowledge that this is urgent and needs to be progressed quickly.

I am very grateful for the opportunity to contribute to this debate. I thank Deputy Naughten and Ms Cáit Nic Amhlaoibh, our group administrator, who have done most of the legwork in preparing this motion. I would also like to acknowledge two dental colleagues in the Public Gallery, who are very welcome to this debate. I very much like the motion because, like any good motion, it is simple and straightforward. I endorse and support every single word in it. I support the motion for a number of reasons. First, we all acknowledge that dentistry is generally regarded as the poor relation from a healthcare point of view. It does not have the same status as other medical professions. A lot of the public discourse around health is dominated by the acute hospitals and GPs, and for good reason, but dentistry is also super-important. This motion will go some way towards providing a more level playing field and parity of esteem for the dental profession. Second, we know that dental disease disproportionately affects the poor, the disadvantaged, the people on the margins and these are precisely the people that this Parliament should be reaching out to and assisting. We know that most healthcare problems affect the middle-aged and the elderly, but dental issues primarily affect the youth, the future of the country, and we should be targeting them for that reason. We know that good dental practice can reduce the risk of obesity, cancer, heart disease, and diabetes so it is worth investing in it. Third, and most importantly, as my colleagues have already mentioned, prevention is better than cure. I do not think there is any profession for which that phrase is more appropriate than the dental profession. From the point of view of a bang for our buck, dentistry is where it is at from an investment perspective. The word "crisis" is thrown around a lot. Every place seems to be in crisis these days but dentistry genuinely is, and we know what the problems are. The first is access and the second is staffing. On access, the main problem is cost. We know that it is really expensive to get private dental care. We also know that medical card holders are finding it hard to get access to a dentist. They are the two big issues from a cost perspective. On staffing, every sector is screaming for staff at the moment but the dental sector is different because we actually control the levers. The State has a monopoly on the amount of dentists in the country because we decide how many people we train. Undergraduate training is an area that we must focus on. As the Minister is aware, the Regional Group comprises very solution-focused people. We know what the problems are and we try to offer, in good faith, constructive solutions. The solutions we would see from an access perspective are all about cost. The costs of private dental care are astronomical but there is a solution. People can get a tax rebate on dental care of about 20% and we would be of the view that this should be increased to 30%. The next budget is less than nine months away and we would be supportive of any proposal that would increase the tax rebate for dental care to 30%. People are still willing to pay 70% of the cost so it would be a very good investment from the State's perspective. On the DTSS, I acknowledge what the Minister said with regard to the additional supports that have been provided, but the bottom line is that our colleagues in the dental profession are not being reimbursed sufficiently for extractions and fillings. It is unfair to expect private dentists to be out of pocket for providing a service that the State should be providing directly. If additional resources were made available to dentists, that would be hugely appreciated. On staffing, we are not just talking about dentists but dental hygienists, dental nurses and all of the auxiliary staff. As I said, we do have capacity in our universities to push more people through those training pathways. The CAO points for dentistry are massive, as Deputy Lowry said, which proves that the demand is there, but we need to increase the capacity. My final point relates to a public awareness campaign. I have not heard or seen advertisements on traditional or social media reminding people of the importance of dental hygiene in a long time. Many people put off looking after their dental hygiene because of Covid-19. We should keep the public informed of its importance and remind them that it is something they need to keep an eye on, for themselves and their children. As Deputy Verona Murphy said earlier, a stitch in time does save nine. I am hugely supportive of the motion. It makes perfect sense. In the past we could not invest in our dental services because we did not have the money but we had a €5.2 billion surplus last year. Obviously, we should not spend everything and should bank some of that for a rainy day but we do have the means now to invest in our dental services. The only question that remains is whether we have the political will to do so.

Every time we have a debate on healthcare, the word "crisis" crops up. Normally a crisis is seen as something that is short term and refers to some impending or looming danger. The word should not be used to describe a situation that has been in evidence for a number of years. What we are suffering in dentistry is not, in fact, a crisis but a failure to address known and increasing deficits and problems. When it comes to dental care in Ireland, we have two streams - similar to our national healthcare -namely, public and private. We do not worry about people in the private stream because we assume that they have the financial resources to pay for services. However, we do not take account of the people in the public system who are waiting so long that they are forced into the private system and must pay for services that they find very difficult to afford. Beyond that, the Minister mentioned three schemes. The DTSS is supposed to provide dental treatment to adult medical card holders. The treatment benefit scheme, previously known as the PRSI scheme, covers adults who have sufficient PRSI contributions.Finally, there is the public dental health service, which is largely community-based, as well as being based in some hospitals. It is supposed to treat children and adults requiring specialised and complex care. It is also supposed to support children in national schools by giving them their first access to a dentist and a dental assessment, often resulting in the diagnosis of a need for fissure seals, which are a great way of preventing future tooth decay. In addition, the HSE has a statutory requirement to provide emergency treatment, and even free orthodontic treatment, for children who have the most severe orthodontic problems. As the Minister will be aware, the waiting lists for that service are extending to ridiculous lengths. It is not even feasible for some people to consider orthodontic treatments three or four years away. Despite the lofty ambitions of those three schemes, the departmental information and published data show a significant decline in the number of treatments being provided under the scheme. The Minister provided updated figures in his statement but, between 2019 and 2021, there was a decline of 280,000 in the number of overall treatments in the public system and a decline of 110,000 in the number of patients treated. We have seen the difficulties coming down the line. The Minister has engaged with dentists in the private sector to try to understand the problems. The problems largely relate to adequate compensation for the work dentists are doing. As Deputy Berry stated, the stakeholders have been telling the Minister that the payment they are receiving does not make economic sense in the context of the work they are doing, and that is why they are leaving the scheme. It is not difficult to understand. The Government, in its wisdom, decided to reduce the PRSI scheme to a scale and polish. What good is that to a person who is in pain or requires an extraction? Who should pay for that? Medical card holders are finding it difficult to access dentists in their towns and regions who are participating in the public payment schemes. These include patients with other significant health issues, as the Minister will be aware, which is all adding to the overall care burden. I will highlight an anomaly that needs to be addressed, which is the issue of autistic children in mainstream schools who do not get the same access to dental services as children in disabled schools. That needs to be addressed. We cannot have a situation like that. The parents of these kids are already facing the challenges of trying to access other disability services, such as speech and language therapy or occupational therapy, and now they have to try to figure out their route to oral supports as well. As the Minister will be aware, oral diseases are becoming more common and they share risk factors relating to obesity, diabetes and heart disease. Our motion calls for a number of things but, in essence, we need to address the fact that more than 13,000 children are currently awaiting orthodontic treatment, we need to get dental checks done earlier and we need more adults, especially those with disabilities, who are facing delays to be able to access services, particularly under GI. Beyond that, we need to up the numbers in the service. I am sure the Minister has heard that from the professionals. They have been telling him that more nurses and hygienists are needed and more access to work permits. They need more people in the system and they need to know what is the policy for the future. As has been stated, the private sector is largely carrying the public dental quota at the moment. That is a fact. One cannot expect professionals to go in and support the public component at their own cost. The Minister recently stated in the House that he is committed to finding a resolution. We recently received a briefing from members of the Irish Dental Association. I am not sure they share his position at the moment. I hope we will hear there has been some kind of re-grounding to all that.

I have been raising similar issues with the Minister for some time, as have many other Deputies in the House, which he acknowledged. The starting point is the waiting lists, which paint their own picture. There are 13,000 children and adults on waiting lists for dental and oral surgery in the public system and a further 13,000 on orthodontic waiting lists. Of those, more than 1,000 special care patients and 3,000 children are on waiting lists for dental surgery under general anaesthetic. We know the waiting lists are chronic. Children with special needs, other children and adults, many of whom are in pain, are waiting long numbers of years for access to basic dental treatment. We also have what can be described as a perfect storm in oral and dental health. On top of that, the dental treatment scheme has collapsed, with the vast majority of dentists having left it. I have engaged with the Irish Dental Association on its role in encouraging dentists to be part of the scheme. At my first meeting with the association, its representatives told me they had been dealing with this issue for years, not just with this Minister for Health, but also with several of his predecessors, and they had lost trust. Their members have lost trust. The Minister stated that he has allocated more money to this issue but that has not worked and is not attracting more dentists back into the scheme. There is need for negotiation on a new contract. If that is what he wants to do, there must be genuine negotiation with the association. Its representatives told me that they want more money for screening and to provide more preventative care. Some of that was done in the most recent budget in providing for additional services, but more needs to be done. If we are going to get dentists back into the scheme, more will have to be done and the Minister will have to engage with them. In parallel with that, more dentists need to be hired to work directly in the public system. There simply are not enough of them. The same is true in the context of general practice. We need to start looking at directly hired GPs to do public work as well. That is all part of what needs to be done. This all comes back to the core issue that is preventing us doing lots of things in healthcare, namely, workforce planning. We need to train more dentists in the first instance. We need to have more graduates coming through and we need to encourage more of those newly qualified dentists to be part of the DTSS. We also need to put in place opportunities for more of those people to work directly for the State within the public system. That is what needs to be done. I acknowledge what the Minister has done in this area. Some of it has been of benefit. He needs to genuinely commit to finding a resolution to the DTSS, however, because it is not tolerable. It is not just that people are not able to pay for treatment; even if they can pay, they are finding it difficult to access a dentist who will take them. As the Minister said, it is an urgent issue and it needs an urgent response. A direct intervention from him with the Irish Dental Association is the only way this will be moved on.

I am supposed to be in Mayo at the moment but I stayed on because this issue is such a problem in the county. No dentists are taking on new clients. This is not just coming to the fore now; it has been going on for months and it must be addressed. I wish to follow on from the point made by Deputy Cullinane that it takes direct intervention with the dentists to get this sorted. I am aware of teenagers who are suffering mental health and physical health difficulties because they cannot get something as basic as their teeth done. The integrity of any essential health service that precludes dentists from providing vital treatment must be questioned. Such an approach cannot be condoned. Forcing people to have their teeth extracted in 2023 is inhumane. It is the wrong thing to do. Even just saying it sounds wrong. I appreciate that money has been allocated but I read the Minister's statement and there are references to millions of euro here, there and everywhere. Why, then, can people in Mayo not access the basic dental services they need? With regard to training, there are students doing their leaving certificate this year who will get maximum points but will not be able to get a place to study dentistry. That is wrong. The issue is not only that there are not enough places on dentistry courses - the current number needs to be doubled - it also relates to the chronic underfunding of the third level sector. There is a need for joined-up thinking in this regard. The Minister knows that a college will get €9,630 to train an Irish person to become a dentist but it will get up to €46,000 to provide the same training to a wealthy international student.That also has to be examined in terms of the overall funding of our higher education institutions. They cannot be forced to do these things, which are impacting women, children and elderly people in Mayo.

Constituents of mine, from Balbriggan to Swords, cannot get a dentist. There actually is not a dentist in my constituency who will take a medical card at present. We have tried and tried. The result is that we have an unusually high level of extractions. That is really not good. It is a major sign of a failure within the system and of Government policy. Those affected are not just figures on a page; they are real men, women and children. I want to share with the Minister some examples from my office. I have changed people's names. Bronagh is a medical card holder. She recently needed to have a tooth extracted. She tried for weeks to secure a dentist who would accept her medical card but was unable to do so. As a result, she had to attend a dentist privately. It cost her €196 to have the tooth removed. This is a 71-year-old pensioner. She had to fork out the money in the run-up to Christmas, money she has not got for a procedure she should not have had to pay for but absolutely needed. As with all of us, she did not go to the dentist because she wanted to but because she was in chronic pain. She had to find the money. Abigail lives in Mosney. I say "lives" but "exists" would probably be closer to it. She had a fractured tooth and could not get a dentist. Her tooth was injured in intensive care after the birth of her child. She had to be put under for a placenta removal. She cracked her tooth. She found herself back in Mosney with two children – a two-year-old and a newborn baby – in a tiny, cramped space. Her tooth was cracked but she could not get a dentist to take a medical card. The Minister said he is spending a lot of money on this, and I have no doubt it is being spent, but if it is not reaching the people who need dental services, there should be a rethink. I echo the calls made by my colleague Teachta Cullinane on the Minister's personal intervention in this matter. His direct intervention is required.

Anyone depending on the medical card scheme is back to Dickensian times. For a supposedly modern state to leave somebody in this situation is degrading and perverse. With dental health affecting heart and brain health, we are storing up problems for the future for our young schoolchildren and others who are facing delays in the dental health crisis. It is impossible for anybody with a medical card to find a dentist in north Kildare. It is worse than ever with so many dentists retiring. I had a constituent in north Kildare last year who had the points to do dentistry but who could not get a place. I would like the Minister to consider what my colleague Deputy Conway-Walsh said because we have a growing population and need more Irish dentists trained. Therefore, we support the broad thrust of the motion. I thank the Regional Group for raising this important matter. In the broader context of the motion and the effective collapse of the dental treatment service scheme, I want to raise with the Minister the circumstances of a vulnerable group of people, namely the men and women who cannot communicate verbally or who have cognitive impairment. It chills me to the bone that there are men and women who are not being examined regularly by dentists in nursing homes. They could be in agony with their teeth but unable to tell anybody, by speech or otherwise. Last year, I asked the Minister to give me a list of all the dental examinations carried out in State-run nursing homes in each of the preceding five years, well before Covid. The reply from the HSE was that it does not keep the data. The service provided by the dental treatment service scheme collapsed. I also asked whether antibiotics were being relied on and repeated as opposed to giving dental care per se, with all the implications for antibiotic resistance. The reply was that there was a lack of dentists and that dentists were having difficulties accessing nursing homes during Covid. We know that. It was also stated that oral and dental infections need to be managed by accessing a dentist to have the required procedure undertaken. What dentist? It was stated the repeated use of antibiotics without accessing appropriate dental treatment contributes to antimicrobial resistance and is not the optimum management. This is something we all know. Beyond the broader context of this motion and its concerns, we need to examine what is happening, or not happening, as seems to be case, with dental care in our nursing homes. I ask the Minister to consider this urgently.

Along with others, I have raised this issue many times through parliamentary questions, the Minister's Department and local media since 2021. On the ground, dentists are not taking on any new clients, particularly those in the medical card scheme. In 2017, there were 1,700 dentists registered with the dental treatment service scheme. In 2022, there were only 650 left. In Wexford in 2020, 70 dentists were operating under the scheme. In 2021, there were only 29, and this number was declining. The majority of students who graduate as general dental practitioners leave as soon as they qualify. Approximately 200 dentists, a minute number, register every year and come from two dental schools. In my constituency, Wexford, there are children with special needs and disabilities who need immediate dental treatment, particularly under general anaesthetic. They have to wait months for an appointment. Some have to wait a year, and some even more. We have a well-documented case concerning an old-age pensioner from New Ross who had to resort to pulling out his own teeth. Is this the level of care we have reached in the country? This is one of the wealthiest countries in the OECD. In fact, a top representative of the Irish Dental Association, from south-west Wexford, described the impact of dental shortages as "unacceptable for a first-world country". There are only two practising dentists in the dental treatment scheme in New Ross, causing people to travel up to 30 km or more to try to obtain a dentist who will take them on. Each town across my county has the same tale to tell. We need to reform the dental treatment service scheme. Dental contracts need to be reviewed and related to best practice based on international standards. The national oral healthcare plan needs a proactive workforce plan, as was covered in Sinn Féin's alternative budget. We need to provide additional undergraduate places for dental undergraduates in Irish universities immediately. We need to expand training places and examine vocational training schemes. The work permit scheme must be addressed immediately because it could be one of the instruments that could help in addressing the current crisis or current failures in our dental healthcare. This needs to be prioritised and acted upon. Over 11,000 people have been left in pain for months on end waiting for orthodontic treatment. No longer should this be tolerated or accepted. Over 5,000 are waiting for more than three years. I support this motion and thank the Regional Group for introducing it. I hope the Minister will act upon this very serious situation.

I have previously spoken about the fact that there is just one dentist and one dental technician accepting medical cards in County Laois. I asked a question on this recently and the answer, which I received this morning, was that only one dentist and no technician accepts medical cards in Laois. I called the surgery only to be told it is not taking on new patients. There is no medical card dentist in the whole county, with its population of 90,000. I do not know how this Government sleeps at night. The Minister referred in his presentation to a town with no dentist but I am talking about a whole county. I asked a parliamentary question recently to receive a list of dentists accepting medical cards in Kildare. The list looked hopeful but when we started calling to see whether the practices were accepting new patients, we found 95% were not. People in extreme pain are popping pills waiting for appointments in other counties. There are children missing the chance to have dental problems discovered and dealt with because the schools programme is in disarray. Early intervention is key to dental health, and the public is being failed by a broken system. I had a man in my office recently who could not get an appointment locally. He ended up in hospital with sepsis, which was life-threatening. I spoke to a lady last month who had not done food shopping because she was saving up to have a sore tooth dealt with. She is yet another medical card holder who cannot find a dentist. She had been surviving on cereal and tinned food that she got from a local food bank, in which, ironically, the local Fine Gael counsellor is involved. Talk about rubbing salt in somebody's wounds. The best time to start dealing with this crisis was ten years ago. The second-best time is today. In Sinn Féin's alternative budget for 2023, it proposed an expansion of public dentistry, starting with school screening and an oral health scheme for children, and the negotiation of a fix to the dental treatment service scheme.In any other country this scandal would be a resigning issue. Shame on you.

Nearly every Deputy in this Chamber, including Deputy Munster and me, have raised the DTSS and received many answers over a long period. We all know that the inability of people on medical cards to get dental care is having a major impact. We all know people are putting off dental care and we know the long-term impact this has. The Minister must actively address this issue as quickly as possible. The situation is not getting any better. Since 2017, dentists have been leaving the scheme and there are now 1,000 fewer dentists operating it. In 2016-17, there were 35 dentists in Louth operating the scheme. At the end of 2022 there were only 13. On the basis of those figures, the Minister can work out what the impact has been. I will read out a message that was sent to me by a constituent. This will get across the impact, especially of one pressure point within the health system and how it impacts others.My son was in a bad way with a dental issue two or three months ago. His dentist would not take his medical card, so he went, as suggested, to the doctor on call. The doctor on call said that if he could not get a dentist within 24 hours to go to A and E. [People can see where this is going]. We had to borrow money to get him an emergency dentist in Dublin. Two weeks before Christmas I had a dental issue. I had registered with a new dentist in Dundalk as mine also had stopped taking medical cards. When I went to the new dentist, even though I was in agony and I had the €40 deposit they required, they told me that as I was a new client I was not a priority, which I do understand. They advised that I go to a GP and if I could not get an appointment [wait for it] to go to A and E. I did go to my original dentists, who were excellent. It cost me €35 for the appointment and €95 for an extraction or filling. If you are on social welfare while looking for work, it is devastating. It meant no heat in the house over the past week. I am happy and grateful to have home and food and electricity but the Government need to fix the issues with the dentists also. So, the GPs are out the door, the dentists won't take the medical card and everyone is suggesting to us A and E. This debacle means the DTSS is putting further pressure on the accident and emergency department in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda. We also have the possible impending closure of the Navan accident and emergency department, which would lump even more pressure onto this particular problem. We can see that all of these crises are coming together. It is an absolute necessity, even if it is all we do, for the Minister to engage with the Irish Dental Association and bring this one part of the problem to a closure. We would then have dealt with at least one of the many issues that exist in the health service. There are 1,000 special care patients and 3,000 children on waiting lists for dental surgery under general anaesthetic. There are 13,000 children and adults on waiting lists for dental and oral surgery in the public system and a further 13,000 on orthodontic waiting lists. As was said previously, we need more dentists and better workforce planning, we need work permits dealt with and we need to consider the possibility of directly employing dentists to deal with the issue we have. This is an ongoing disaster and we need delivery, not positive words from the Minister.

I held a very good briefing with the Irish Dental Association before Christmas attended by Deputies Verona Murphy and Matt Shanahan from the Regional Group. It was great to have so many people from different groupings and parties present. It is no shock to any of us that the dental services are in crisis. They are in deep crisis as we speak. My constituency of Laois-Offaly is one of the worst affected in the State. A couple of weeks ago, I was contacted by the parent of a ten-year-old boy. The parent pleaded with me for help to access dental treatment for the child who would end up having an operation on his jaw if he did not have urgent treatment. That shows the seriousness of the issue. The Government, the Department of Health and the HSE do not treat this issue with sufficient urgency. I thank the Irish Dental Association and welcome its representatives to the Chamber. The association has been highlighting the challenges dentists are facing with a medical card scheme that is not fit for purpose. The scheme does not focus on prevention strategies. It does not do anything to deliver for people in the long term. Urgent intervention by the Minister for Health is required. This cannot continue and should not be allowed to continue any longer. I understand there have been some calls for meetings with the Department and the HSE. There needs to be meaningful and constructive engagement and the Minister for Health should be central to that process. It is my understanding that the Irish Dental Association has written twice to the Minister for Health and has yet to receive a response. I believe the association wrote on 10 January 2023 and before that on 6 December 2022. I again ask for the Minister for Health to intervene on this issue. He is central to making things happen. With constructive engagement, we can certainly progress this issue and bring in the necessary and meaningful reforms to a medical card scheme that is currently not fit for purpose. I urge the Minister to take on board what I am saying. I have raised this issue in the Dáil a number of times. I have asked parliamentary questions. In November 2021, during Leaders' Questions, I expressed concern that my constituency was becoming one of the worst affected constituencies in this regard. I specifically asked the Taoiseach if the Department of Health would respond positively in the near future to the Irish Dental Association's request for the appointment of an independent chair and to confirm a framework for negotiations, equivalent to that agreed with the Irish Medical Organisation seven years ago. That is not a big ask. It is very constructive and it could certainly bring a resolution to this issue if the political will was there. I will end on that note. Again, I ask for urgent intervention.

In the period from 2002 to 2005, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children expressed its total dissatisfaction with the delivery of orthodontic services. It considered the position adopted by the Dental Council of Ireland on the issue of training in orthodontics to be unsustainable. In 2002, concerns were raised that quality orthodontic care was not available through the Irish system. The Dental Council of Ireland controlled the dental schools and these were in competition with the regional services. Therein lies the problem. One was in competition with the other when they should have been working together and having the same funding to sort out the problem. The committee agreed that a very good service was being offered by the regional service in the mid-west region and commended it on its excellence. The Joint Committee on Health was on board to support the regional service. It made recommendations, which were sent to the health board at the time. Subsequently, the HSE set up a review body, ignoring the recommendations made by the health board.Needless to say, they went nowhere and the follow-up died a death. Hundreds of children have been damaged, there are restrictions of education by the Dental Council of Ireland, there is restricted training. Again this goes back to funding whereby both systems could have worked together. The recommendations went nowhere. The aim was to stop regional services. The bottom line is that children being hidden behind improper systems for 21 years. There is no consultant professor overseeing what is required within the dental schools. There is no academic consultant professor in the dental schools. We are talking about 21 years; we are not talking about yesterday or a week ago. This has been going on for 21 years as a result of politics. The services on both sides could have been invested in rather than setting one against the other and causing the problem that we have 21 years later. Why did the Dental Council of Ireland stop qualified orthodontists coming in from the UK? Public orthodontic services are now even worse than they were when the health committee expressed its concerns in respect of the period from 2002 to 2005. A report compiled by Bearn and Richmond in 2015 was never published despite several calls on the Minister, who left the House two minutes ago, to publish it. The then Minister, Deputy Harris, got the report and has it. The Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, and the Tánaiste, Deputy Micheál Martin, all have this report. Why was it never published? It would have highlighted the problems that the Government created. Who is going to suffer for this? Children and adults have suffered for 21 years because of bad policymaking and funding. The Government could have funded both services and there would be no backlog. If it is serious about fixing this problem, the first thing it needs to do is accept the blame for its part in what has happened. The Minister should publish the report, if he is not scared to do so, and show the people what actually happened, rather than pitting the regional service against the Dental Council of Ireland, with one blaming the other. That is not the problem; the problem lies with Government.

I thank the Deputies involved for putting it forward. The debate is badly needed in this Chamber. There is quite rightly deep anger at the moment over the trolley crisis in the HSE. However, the health crisis extends much further than what is taking place in our accident and emergency departments. The DTSS for people on medical cards is in a total state of collapse. The Irish Dental Association has called it unfit for purpose. Dentists are leaving the scheme in their droves. The Government slashed funding for the DTSS after the recession hit in 2008. The Irish Dental Association called these cuts savage. The Government has continued to cut funding since then. It cut funding by 36% between 2017 and 2020 alone. All of this has left many of those who need help the most with a severe lack of access to dental care. Many people simply cannot find a dentist who accepts medical cards. The Minister has acknowledged that the scheme is not fit for purpose, but he still failed to meet his own deadline for a review last year. The Irish Dental Association states the scheme has remained largely unchanged since it was implemented in 1994 at the same time as privatisation of dental care for medical card holders. We have seen the number of dentists enrolled in the scheme fall from 1,600 in 2019 to just 600 last year. That leaves more than 2,500 medical card holders for every dentist in the scheme. The Government has failed to lift a finger while a vital service for some of the most vulnerable people in this country has completely fallen apart. As was said by previous speakers, we know that gum disease increases the risk of heart attack, stroke and other cardiovascular events by two to three times the average. In the middle of a cost-of-living and inflation crisis, retired, low-paid and unemployed people cannot always afford a healthy diet. They cannot afford the cost of private dental care and they certainly cannot afford the time and money it takes to actually find a dentist who accepts medical cards. To make things worse, in June last year I received a letter from a constituent whose son has a disability and who had been that told they could no longer attend the public clinic at Old County Road because it would only be serving those who could not physically attend a community dentist, sit to wait for the appointment or sit still in school. That was the reply I received. This was confirmed to me as being in line with HSE policy by the Minister when I raised the matter by means of a parliamentary question. This is a massive change for many with disabilities who have been attending public dental clinics their whole lives. It pushes more and more people into a rapidly shrinking system that cannot provide for them. The failure of the scheme leaves people who are largely struggling in serious physical pain. It puts the burden of dental care on those who can least afford it and the burden of a lack of preventative care on a health service that is already bursting at the seams. Another matter was raised with me by families of autistic children. They were told that only autistic children who are in special needs schools or classes can access the special care programme. Children in mainstream schools who have autism are not entitled to access the special care programme. This is a failure for those people in our communities. It is yet another result of failing to implement the recommendations laid out in the Sláintecare report. Sláintecare lays out the need to return to pre-austerity levels of funding and highlighted the shocking situation where we have seen massive reductions in access to regular dental care and massive increases in emergency extractions. This situation is just not good enough. We need to look after people on medical cards. We need an emergency return to pre-recession funding for the DTSS. We need investment in and expansion of our dental schools. We need to implement the reforms of Sláintecare that were promised five years ago. We need to end the privatisation of the 1990s and ensure proper, public dental care for everyone in this country. I support the motion. We need immediate intervention by the Government to implement the plan to help those on medical cards.

It is an important motion that highlights the necessity for greater investment in dental services, particularly for greater investment in human resources and training of people to work in that area. It is neither today nor yesterday, but in the early 1980s, a time of great austerity in Ireland, when I was in primary school and I and all my schoolmates had two dental check-ups. I still remember them. Notwithstanding the difficulties the State was in at the time, we were able to provide dental care to children. Maybe it was not anything like the same level of care as is provided now in the event of somebody having a serious difficulty, but, nevertheless, relative to the times that were in it, it was quite a level of dental care. Unfortunately that is no longer the case to the same extent. In theory children are entitled to two dental check-ups, but those are not possible because of lack of resources. I asked a parliamentary question of the Minister for Health last year and received a reply from the HSE in respect of the number of whole-time equivalent, WTE, posts in dental care in Clare. Those persons are employed to provide the dental check-ups to primary school children and also to persons with disabilities in Clare. In 2006 there were 10.2 WTE posts; five years later, in 2011, the number was down to 9.2; in 2016, notwithstanding the period of austerity, it was down to 8.2; and in 2021, when things were supposed to be picking up, it was down to 6.8. It had risen very slightly by October of last year to 7.4. We are still less than what we had in 2006. I appreciate that it is very difficult to recruit health professionals right across our healthcare system for a variety of reasons. They are in high demand not just in Ireland but across the world. Those who are educated in Ireland are in demand across the world and we have to compete with the rest of the world to hire them. It is a failing that needs to be addressed as a matter of some urgency. On the matter of accident and emergency departments, County Clare is served by the HSE mid-west, which was in the news for unfortunate reasons over the past couple of months.This is something that also needs to be addressed. I am not suggesting for a moment that there are easy answers and nobody in the House is doing so. Nevertheless, there are answers and we need to move forward. Part of that is investment and part of it is training up hygienists and dental nurses so they can provide a greater level of service. It is also about investing more in our dental schools and training. Ultimately we must ensure that children get the early intervention they deserve and need. It is a truism but it is nevertheless true that a stitch in time saves nine and we want to avoid children having to have more traumatic interventions due to them not being seen at an early age. I support the motion.

I thank every Deputy, on behalf of the team at the Department of Health. The Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, was here until just a few minutes ago and I assure the House that the Minister appreciates the serious difficulties that are being outlined this evening. I thank the Regional Group for bringing this issue forward. The Minister has noted that the Government is committed to addressing the issue by easing current access issues through a range of interim measures, which still include a 40% to 60% increase in payment for treatments under the dental treatment service scheme, DTSS, last year, but ultimately through substantive service reform. In saying that I also want to acknowledge the truth of many Deputies’ feedback, including my own, on the inaccuracy on HSE lists on those participating in the DTSS. That needs to be improved. An additional allocation of €15 million has been invested in budget 2023 to support the work. The national oral health policy, Smile agus Sláinte, sets out the vision for the future of oral healthcare services in Ireland. This is a body of wide-ranging and transformative reforms. While it will take a number of years to bring to complete fruition, there will be an early and continued emphasis on addressing the issues described this evening. The policy will support the provision of all levels of care by appropriate healthcare professionals and in the most suitable settings. It will support patient choice and access across the life course. The fundamental aspiration is that all Irish people will have their own dental home where they will build a lifelong relationship with a local dental practice or with practices of their choosing, for continuity of care from birth to old age. It will replace the current service approach, which is based on the dental health action plan 1994, which was informed by data from the 1980s. The policy has two goals, the first of which is to provide the supports to enable every individual to achieve his or her personal best oral health; the second goal is to improve access to dental care in an equitable and sustainable manner, therefore enabling vulnerable groups to improve their oral health. The policy reflects the WHO approach, grounded in primary healthcare, which is being informed by and aligned with other relevant Government and health policies, including the primary healthcare approach, Sláintecare and Healthy Ireland. We know that oral health is linked with general health. Alcohol, tobacco use and poor diet are common risk factors that not only lead to poor oral health but to heart disease, stroke, diabetes, cancer and other non-communicable diseases. We know from Healthy Ireland surveys that the population highly rates the advice they receive from their dentists and from other oral healthcare professionals regarding these risk factors. Oral health promotion, based on a holistic approach, that acknowledges lifestyle-based risk factors common to oral and non-oral diseases, will be made available to all age groups under the policy. The Government has already taken the first steps towards this preventative approach in the measures introduced to the DTSS last May, which included the requirement for dentists to provide advice on diet, tobacco, alcohol and other lifestyle impacts as part of the oral health exam, and the reintroduction of the scale and polish treatment for all adult medical card holders. More than 93,000 additional people received scale and polish treatments under the scheme in 2022, versus 2021. For children, the best evidence shows they should have access to oral healthcare services as young as possible to establish their dental home with their local dentist or oral healthcare professional of their choice. This ensures they can access support before they have problems. The Government is committed to starting the process of developing these new and more comprehensive services for children this year, starting with the zero to two years old age group and then moving to seven years. This change will increase the capacity of the HSE public dental service to reorient and develop oral health promotion programmes. There will also be greater capacity to provide care to those more vulnerable groups in our community, including adults and children with additional needs and adults living in residential settings. All of this requires a sufficient number of appropriately trained dentists and oral healthcare professionals, including dental nurses and other grades. The Minister has said many times that we need a radical approach to increase the number of healthcare professionals available. At the end of December there were 3,442 dentists on the dental counter register. As Deputy McNamara has referred to, we need many more. The Department of Health is collaborating with the Higher Education Authority, HEA, to identify opportunities to build capacity in the higher education system for dentistry and for more oral healthcare graduates. Potential new and innovative models of dental education are also being considered, with a focus on primary care. The HEA initiative is aligned with a Department commitment in the national oral health policy to improve access to care. The Department of Health is committed to the development of an oral healthcare workforce plan, as set out in the national oral health policy. Dedicated resources have been set aside to advance this work. This work and workforce plan will consider how other dental professionals, such as expanded roles for dental hygienists, can express support for the new model of oral healthcare services, and how they in turn can be supported with career pathways that support staff retention and development. The Department has asked the Health Research Board to review the type of work placements used in dental undergraduate education in other EU countries. All of this should help to ensure our higher education system provides enough oral healthcare professionals with the relevant skills to meet our population’s needs. I want to assure the House that the Minister will continue the ongoing work to address the access issues, which are affecting current healthcare services and which have been described throughout this debate. He will also progress work on the implementation of the national oral health policy, which sets out the body of transformational response. I thank the Deputies who participated again and I thank the Regional Group again for bringing forward this motion. I assure them of the Government’s complete commitment to improving our oral healthcare services and the access issues raised this evening.

It is frustrating to hear the response of the Government to what has been put forward by the Opposition. For years the dental sector in this country has been on the brink of collapse. We know it is at breaking point across the country, which is staggering, given the importance of dental care to so many people. The heart of this problem is administrative. The problem with the administration in so many sectors in this country is that it does not listen to the sector. The sector itself is the group of people who are best tooled to be able to come up with solutions and design the system going forward in the future. They are frustrated that they are not being listened to. I know the Minister of State is new in his role but if I could give him any advice it would be to allow those people a position to steer the direction of the sector in the future. We need proper systems that wrap around communities, not narrow and restrictive schemes. Firing money at those narrow and restrictive schemes will not fix the problem. One of the difficulties I have with the Minister of State's speech is that much of it is in the future tense and if you take away the future tense there is very little left in it. Given the difficulties that have been created in recent years, we should have been able to point to actions that have been carried out and delivered upon. It is clear that the lack of dental staff in the system is a difficulty. The emigration of so many healthcare workers is a problem that the Government is not grappling with. A key to grappling with that problem is to provide proper terms, conditions and pay. Anybody who is employing a person in any business anywhere in the world has to create a proper recruitment package to be competitive, and that simply is not the case for so many people at the moment. We need far more dentists in the system. The public dental system is a particular gripe I have.It is the poor relation of this Government in terms of the delivery of the service. It has massive outcomes for people right across the system. In my own county of Meath, our public dental clinic is being closed. It is going to reopen in Dunshaughlin, but the four dental clinic surgeries in Navan will not be replaced. Only two will be built in Dunshaughlin. Will the Minister look at this specific issue for us, if he can? That one of the fastest growing towns in the country does not have a dental clinic for children is a major problem. First, fourth and sixth class children are not being called to dentists anymore in County Meath. It is incredible. These children are only receiving their first appointments in secondary school. That means far more damage being caused, far more invasive treatment being necessary and it being far more costly to the State in the long run. There is no logic there. There are 13,000 children awaiting orthodontic treatment for grade 4 and grade 5 eligibility criteria. There are 100,000 children on the waiting list for public dental appointments, and there is a six-year waiting list for orthodontic treatment. It is scandalous that we would allow that to happen. That people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds are more at risk in these terms is incredible. I was looking at the figures and the funding actually decreased from 2017 to 2020. Spending on dental care for medical card patients nationwide fell from €63 million in 2017 to €40 million in 2020. There is no excuse and no logic for that whatsoever. In some places the fall was recorded as being as high as 48%. As a result of the dental treatment services scheme haemorrhaging dentists, many cannot participate at the moment. There are 700 dentists State-wide participating in the scheme, and in counties like Meath there are now fewer than 20 dentists participating in it. It is almost creating what I would call a Victorian dystopia, where people from well-heeled leafy suburbs have good teeth and do not suffer pain, and people from working-class backgrounds have the opposite. Are we really talking about 2023 being reflective of what was happening in the 19th century? The Government needs to do far better.

I met him last night and he said I could speak for a couple of minutes. It is good to see the season of goodwill continuing right into the middle of January. A lot has been said here today and I think the tone of the debate has been very constructive. It is nice to see a motion being tabled where the Minister accepts the spirit in which the motion has been moved and many good suggestions have been made. That is very important. There are a number of points I wish to highlight. It is impossible to compare the situation with 2010. There were so many more services available through the medical card and the PRSI scheme before 2010. We cannot compare the situation with 2010 for many things in the economy and the country. It was a different period. However, I acknowledge that additional measures were introduced in the PRSI scheme and the medical card scheme last summer. It is interesting the Irish Dental Association has noted that 70% of people did not avail of the cleaning service available under the PRSI scheme last year. I will use this as an opportunity to appeal perhaps to men in particular. I know that on a gender front we are quite poor at presenting ourselves on health grounds. Maybe that includes dental care. I met one of our work colleagues outside the door and he told me he has not been to the dentist in a long time. There is a cleaning service included under the PRSI scheme for certain bands. I encourage people to take up that service. There is also an onus on the dentists as well. I have a very good relationship with my own dentist. He keeps the pressure on me to continue to present myself for treatment. That is important as well. We all agree that preventative care and gum health is critical at an early stage to prevent further problems down the line. The Minister mentioned €200 million in funding. That is a lot of money, but he did acknowledge that structural change is needed. There are plenty of issues, including supply issues in the provision of orthodontic and dental services. A lot of structural change is needed. It is about getting to the root cause of where the issues are, if Members will pardon the pun. Orthodontic care is a massive issue in terms of affordability. It is also an issue in terms of orthodontic service provision. Indeed an orthodontic vacuum provides a very visible example of poverty, where people who cannot access and afford orthodontic care. It is a very visible reflection of poverty. That is something we need to continue to monitor. My experience recently with dentists and dental hygienists through the HSE scheme in both Creeslough and Letterkenny has been nothing but positive, not just at a courtesy level but also at a professional level. It is essential that if there are any logjams within the primary school system, we continue to monitor them. The Minister may not be aware, but the children in the Finn Valley area have to travel to Letterkenny due to the closure of the dental service in St. Joseph's in Stranorlar. Perhaps the Minister would look at that to see if there is an opportunity to reopen that service. I was speaking earlier to my colleagues, Deputies Ring and Durkan. Deputy Durkan was keen to point out that the very issues we are raising here today were presenting themselves in a similar way back in 1981. Similarly, Deputy Ring referenced his own experience over the past number of decades in this profession. The issues continue to be the same. I thank the Regional Group for raising the issue. I thank Deputy Naughten for affording me the time to speak on this important item. I certainly hope the spirit that has been taken on the part of the Minister for Health, and he did come across as being very sincere on this issue, means that whatever proposals coming from the Irish Dental Association are taken seriously and listened to.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-19 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	493	I thank my colleagues in the Regional Group for tabling this motion and the newest member of the Regional Group, Deputy McHugh. He is very welcome on board. I also thank Cáit Nic Amhlaoibh for her assistance in this. I thank every Member in the House who spoke, both Government and Opposition, in support of this motion, and the fact it is being unanimously adopted by the House is a clear message. It is to be hoped we will see the proposals in this motion adopted. I was contacted during the week by Mary. She has been trying to get an appointment with a dentist. She rang every dentist in County Roscommon, County Mayo and County Leitrim, and not one of them was taking medical card patients. Mary is a single parent with two adult children for whom she is the primary carer. She put it to me that it is not easy to survive on her welfare payments. She is someone who worked all her life. She was forced out of employment back in 2015. She paid all of her taxes like everyone else. She said she felt like she was begging to get the help she needed. For people like Mary, it is just not good enough. Under section 67 of the Health Act 1970, the HSE is obliged to provide dental treatment and dental appliances to persons under the medical card scheme. It is obliged to provide that. Instead of that, it has turned its back on those struggling to cope. The Minister spoke about engagement with the Irish Dental Association. It is my understanding the last engagement that took place with the Irish Dental Association was last March. That is the engagement that is taking place. Surely, for the sake of Mary and every other Mary in this country, we should resolve this issue and ensure people can get access to treatment.In my area in counties Galway, Mayo and Roscommon, 36% of the dentists who were in the dental services scheme have left in the last two years. We are now down to just 36 dentists across our region, not one of whom is taking on additional patients. Prevention with regard to our dental services is far better than cure. If we look at the oral health checks that have taken place over the last few years for children in first, second, fourth and sixth class and compare the figures for 2019 with the figures for the middle of this year, across counties Galway, Mayo and Roscommon in 2019, 11,632 children got access to that dental assessment. Up to the middle of this year, that figure was just 3,429. The bulk of those at 53% were in County Roscommon, 29% were in County Mayo and 11% were in County Galway. There has been an appalling fall-off in the number of dental assessments taking place for children within our primary school system and this is only storing up trouble for the future. With regard to our orthodontic services, again, in counties Galway, Mayo and Roscommon, we have 1,343 children waiting on orthodontic services in our region. The final issue I wish to bring up with the Minister of State is with regard to people with a disability. As the Minister of State knows, people with a disability do have not the same ability to communicate. They do not have the same ability to express where the pain is exactly in their mouths or what is causing the pain and discomfort. Backs have been turned on those people in terms of the provision of dental services. I have one constituent named Francis who is an adult individual with an intellectual disability. He was added to the urgent inpatient waiting list on 11 November of last year. Francis ended up in University Hospital Galway accident and emergency department on 28 November of last year with swelling to his face, hallucinations and confusion. No-one wants to be going into that accident and emergency department any day of the year; not someone with an intellectual disability with swelling to his face, hallucinations and confusion. He spent seven hours along with 151 other people in that emergency department on that particular day. He is still waiting today for his emergency treatment. This is not just in about adults. It is the same situation for children with a disability who are required to go under an anaesthetic. Children on the autism spectrum who need to go under an anaesthetic are being excluded from the provision of dental care today because of that. There are children who should be in the mainstream system. We have encouraged children with a disability and those on the autism spectrum with a disability to be in the mainstream education system. They are being shut out of access to these services today, however. It is not good enough that this is happening. In fairness, the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, contacted me before the debate today. She has committed to working with Deputies from the Regional Group to try to address the disability issues regarding this matter. However, we all know that if we actually neglect oral hygiene, it leads to emergency dental issues, advanced oral lesions, chronic ill health and sepsis that all add, like the case of Francis, to pressure on our emergency departments, which just cannot cope. My one final ask is for the Minister of State to sit down with the Irish Dental Association to resolve these issues and provide a basic level of service to every single citizen, regardless of his or her income. Regardless of whether people have money in their pocket, they deserve access to a basic dental service.
