I will call on the Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	1	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to discuss the following matter, namely, the necessity for the Minister for Education and Science to address the critical situation of Scoil Uí Mhuirí, Dunleer, County Louth, the unacceptable situation whereby children are suffering unnecessarily as a result of the atrocious conditions at the school which was promised a replacement building 20 years ago, the fact that children and teachers continue to get drenched as they move between classes and are permanently cold because of rotting windows falling out of classrooms and permanent accommodation of just six classrooms, and the necessity for the Minister to intervene as a matter of urgency to ensure that students at Scoil Uí Mhuirí are provided with a new school building which would allow them to fully access their right to education.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	2	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to address the seriously misguided burn and bury policies of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government following his assertion that the building of incinerators is to be fast tracked and in place before 2007, and to hear the workable alternatives based on zero waste strategies which he already has the power to enforce under the Waste Management Act 1996.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	4	The Order of Business today shall be No. 21a, motion re Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Powers and Functions) Bill 2003; No. 5, Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill 2003 – Order for Second Stage and Second Stage; No. 27, statements on European Council meeting in Brussels, to be taken not later than 2.10 p.m. and the order shall not resume thereafter.It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that: (1) No. 21a shall be decided without debate; (2) the proceedings on No. 27 shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion after 80 minutes and the following arrangements shall apply: (i) the statements shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion after 60 minutes, and the statements of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and of the main spokespersons for the Fine Gael Party, the Labour Party and the Technical Group, who shall be called upon in that order, shall not exceed 15 minutes in each case; (ii) Members may share time; (iii) immediately following the statements, the Minister for Foreign Affairs shall take questions for a period not exceeding 20 minutes; (3) the Dáil on its rising today shall adjourn until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 4 November 2003.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18484	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	6	What exactly is the Tánaiste proposing here? Is it in some way curtailing the rights of the House to assess the Bill? It appears we are discharging an obligation that would be on the Minister to come before the House. Perhaps the Tánaiste will clarify why this is being done.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	7	What we are doing is referring the Bill to the committee.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18484	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	8	My reading of it appears to be a little bit stronger. The Tánaiste is actually saying an obligation to come before a committee of the whole Dáil is being discharged. Presumably that obligation was included for some reason. Perhaps the Tánaiste will clarify the reason and why we are now discharging the reason.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	9	I understand it was an error which is being corrected.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	10	Is the proposal agreed? Agreed. Is the proposal for dealing with No. 27 agreed? Agreed. Is the proposal for dealing with the adjournment of the Dáil today agreed?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18484	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	11	We cannot agree to this. To be frank, it is inexplicable that we should seek so soon after our return to the Dáil to take a week's break. I believe all Deputies will be here next week. There is a perfect opportunity for the Dáil  to sit. There are many pressing issues, not least the issues in Northern Ireland, which we hope will come to a resolution.So far the Government has published only two Bills out of its promised list while some 20 Bills are awaiting Second Stage debate. There are many pressing issues that we hope to see from Government in regard to upcoming Bills, not least in the Minister's area of responsibility, covering Garda reform, disability and road traffic reform which appears to be stuck in a siding. It is impossible to understand why we would take a recess at this time. Yesterday the Tánaiste launched an initiative on corporate responsibility to stakeholders. However, the Minister and the Government are not willing to be accountable to their stakeholders, namely, the elected representatives and the public at large. I heard her colleague say how benchmarking must deliver real reform in the Dáil as everywhere else. Where is the real reform if at the first drop of the hat we are going into a week's recess? Nobody among the wider public will understand this. It is damaging to the credibility of politics and should be abandoned.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	12	I too oppose this measure on behalf of the Labour Party. I raised this matter during Question Time on Tuesday last, in terms of the damage being done to the standing of the Dáil by the proposition from the Government that the House would go into recess yet again. There was no justification coming forward on Question Time and there is no justification that the Tánaiste can advance now. It does not really matter whether the Tánaiste proffers the explanation that the House will be sitting in committee. The promotion of the business of the Dáil outside of these gates will be that, whether the committees are sitting or not, if the House is not in session the Dáil is in recess, that Deputies are in their constituencies, in Spain or wherever else occurs to whoever is doing the promoting.At a time when the Northern Ireland peace process is in such a fragile condition, when the Ulster Unionist Council is scheduled to meet on Wednesday and in a context where the Government is happy to accept the support of the Opposition on the Northern Ireland project, to exclude the House from any involvement when there are such momentous developments that may or may not come to fruition in Northern Ireland, is irresponsible. The only objective of the Cabinet, including the Tánaiste, is to spend as little time as is feasible making itself amenable to this House. The last place it would choose to make an announcement about any initiative or major policy is inside the portals of the House. That is not acceptable. It damages the standing of Parliament, standards in politics and our democracy. I ask the Tánaiste to permit the House to sit as normal next week?
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	13	We are only getting back into our  stride, some 12 sitting days after the summer recess. It is unacceptable for us to contemplate a week in which there will be no Dáil sittings. The reality is that while the country gets a bank holiday the Dáil gets a "bank holiweek". It is not in tune with the real world. We need to deal not only with Dáil reform but to have this type of issue dealt with without any major song and dance. This is a straightforward matter. There should not be a recess next week. I can understand that the Government, given its hard times and not wishing to be criticised, does not want to be accountable to this House. Its job is to be democratically accountable. It is not good enough for the House to take a break and put the country on automatic pilot without the Government being accountable to the people through the Parliament. Effectively, that is what is happening. While the country is experiencing political thunderstorms and lightening of one type or another, the Government decides it is okay to go on automatic pilot. It is not. Northern Ireland is in a fragile state. We need to be here and to be able to respond. We need to have a collective input into dealing with the issues. It is irresponsible of the Government to contemplate next week as a holiday. We should be here and the Opposition is prepared to be here.

When we look at the legislative record I do not believe a single Bill has completed its passage since we resumed after the summer recess.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	17	The Deputy is wrong. I had a Bill passed here yesterday.

When will all this work be addressed? Will it be another situation where all that will be rushed through in advance of the Christmas recess and that there will be guillotine after guillotine, inadequate debate after inadequate debate? What we are doing next week is losing important and critical time to carry out our roles, functions and responsibilities.I join with other colleagues in the Opposition parties in urging the Tánaiste to reconsider the proposition and to allow the work of the House to proceed in the coming week.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	19	As anticipated by Deputy Rabbitte, the committees of the House will meet next week. The Government will meet regularly and there is no question of people going off on holidays.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	20	The Taoiseach is opening a swimming pool today.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	31	As a matter of interest, the Taoiseach is attending the Forum on Europe this morning.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	32	He is down at Breaffy House opening a swimming pool while Dublin is floating away.

#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	39	Four Members from the Opposition were allowed make their contribution without interruption. The Tánaiste is entitled to the same courtesy and the Chair will insist that is afforded to her. If the Deputy continues to interrupt he will leave the House.
#PaulConnaughton	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-party	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-dob	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	40	Wherever he goes there will be a welcome for him.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	41	We would all like to think that the time we spend in this House could be used more productively. We all have much to do to make that a reality. As the House is aware, the Minister for Education and Science has standardised the school year. All schools will be off next week. There are some Deputies who are looking forward to spending some time with their children next week. For a whole host of reasons I cannot agree to the request of the Deputies opposite. I should say to Deputy Bruton that I did not launch an initiative on corporate social responsibility. I presented certificates or charters to those on behalf of another organisation that has excelled in this regard. I understand also that Deputies Sargent and Kenny want to go to the North next week. They indicated that yesterday and if the Dáil was to meet we would not facilitate that visit.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18484	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	42	It is disappointing that we are going into recess now with so little Government legislation for this session. I ask specifically about the legislation, which I know is close to her heart, to drive a programme of regulatory reform to make this country more competitive. What has happened to the transport regulation Bill? We had a discussion paper published in August 2000, which was to have been followed by consultation, but not one step has been taken in the direction of transport reform.The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste launched a programme of regulatory reform in April 2001, following the OECD report two and half years ago. We have not seen any legislative reforms emerge from this. Will the Tánaiste say if she and her Government are serious about an agenda of regulatory reform to make services more efficent?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	43	The transport reform Bill is not expected until next year.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18484	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	44	Four years on.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	45	The Minister for Transport has been in office only a year.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18484	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	46	What went on before?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	47	It is the Tánaiste's Department.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	48	Will the Tánaiste inform the House about promised legislation? I overheard the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, claim on national radio some weeks ago, around the time the Tánaiste left him swinging on the religious deal and he was under pressure, that he had brought forward the Garda Síochána Bill. Of course he has not done anything of the kind. He published heads of a Bill with great fanfare last August, but  there is still no sign of the Garda Síochána Bill, notwithstanding its urgency. Will the Tánaiste say, assuming that relations have been repaired between her and the Minister, whether we can see the Bill in the House this session?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	49	The heads of the Bill were approved and published by the Minister some time ago. I understand it is expected to have the Bill this session.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	50	As the Tánaiste may know, 40% of the farm gate value of field vegetables grown in my constituency means that I am going to raise a question on agriculture, about the Bord Bia Bill in particular, but I am not sure if that is the right Bill. Will the Tánaiste say if there is legislation promised in the Department of Agriculture and Food to deal with the enforcing of the regulations that have been around for about 12 years concerning the labelling of food as organic? Apparently, in the reports in the Irish Examiner today—
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	51	The Deputy has made his point.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	52	—the Department has done nothing for 12 years on this matter. Is there any legislation she can point to that would indicate there is some plan for the requirement of the labelling of food as organic?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	53	I presume the labelling of food is dealt with under the regulations currently in place. The Bord Bia Bill is to amalgamate An Bord Glas and An Bord Bia.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	54	Will the Tánaiste indicate when the regulations on safety in the workplace will be put before the House? Second, there is some indication that there is a delay in the publication of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Bill. Will she give an indication as to when the PIAB will be up and running?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	55	On the smoking ban, if that is what the Deputy is talking about, those regulations have been cleared by the Cabinet. I understand the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, will be publicising the regulations later today or this week.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	56	They are not in the House.

I expect to have the PIAB Bill within the next fortnight and we are on target to have it in place at the beginning of January next year, hopefully with the support of the Deputies opposite.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	58	In relation to the proposed reforms in the health service and the Brennan report, will the Tánaiste say how it is that a state of the art  accident and emergency unit in Blanchardstown can be left locked and closed—
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	59	That does not arise. I suggest the Deputy should submit a question to the Minister for Health and Children.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	60	It is a question. In her time off next week, could the Tánaiste visit? The Brennan report promised that the health service was to be managed respectably and we have a closed state of the art A & E suite—

Will the Tánaiste indicate the stage at which the public service management, recruitment and appointments Bill is currently at and if it will be before the House before Christmas? On a related matter, does she expect that a programme of decentralisation will soon be announced by her Government colleagues?
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	63	The second question is not in order.

As the Tánaiste knows, those discos are held without alcohol being served. This is a bank holiday weekend—

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	135	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."I will begin with a quotation:Let us think of education as the means of developing our greatest abilities, because in each of us there is a private hope and dream which, fulfilled, can be translated into benefit for everyone and greater strength for our nation.These words are as true today as when spoken by President John F. Kennedy over 40 years ago. While they apply to each of us, they have particular resonance for children with disabilities, who are at risk of being marginalised and suffering disadvantage because of their special educational needs. In the past, our education system focused primarily on the majority of children who do not have these needs. While resources were provided for those with disabilities, sufficient attention was not given to special education. Lack of resources, poor planning and a disconnection in the provision of services all combined to act to the detriment of the child with special educational needs.That position has changed utterly since 1997. This Government has brought about a quantum  leap in the level and method of response to children with special educational needs. In 1998, the Government embarked on a programme of funding designed to provide a more responsive environment to children with special needs and their parents. In October of that year, the Government decided that all primary school children with disabilities would have an automatic entitlement to a response to their needs. This led directly to the number of special resource teachers catering for children in ordinary schools increasing from 104 to more than 2,300. In the same time, the number of special needs assistants in the system has grown from less than 300 to almost 5,500 full and part-time positions.In September 1999, the learning support teacher service was extended to every primary and post-primary school in the country. As a result, the number of learning support teachers in primary schools has grown from 1,242 in September 1997 to 1,531 today. Since then, pupil-teacher ratios in special schools and classes have been reduced to meet the recommendations of the special education review committee.The nature and level of the educational response is based on the professionally assessed needs of each individual child. While my policy is to promote the inclusion of pupils with special needs in ordinary mainstream schools, those who have been assessed as having special educational needs have access to a variety of special support services. Those services range from special schools dedicated to particular disability groups, through special classes and units attached to ordinary schools, to placement on an inclusive basis in ordinary schools with special back-up supports. The response will normally take the form of resource teacher or special needs assistant support or both, depending on the level of need involved.In some cases, the level of special need involved may be such as to require placement in a special class attached to a mainstream school. The number of special classes has grown from 350 in 1998 to more than 500 currently. Each class is dedicated to a particular disability category and operates at a significantly reduced pupil-teacher ratio. Pupils attending these classes also attract specially increased rates of capitation funding. To take one example, since October 1998 over 120 dedicated special classes have been established to meet the needs of children with autism. With a maximum class size of six and the support of a teacher and two special needs assistants, these classes recognise the emotional needs of autistic children. A nationwide pre-school service and education programmes to extend the school year for children with autism have been developed in the past year.Children with special needs attending mainstream schools may also require access to special equipment to assist them in their education. The funding allocation in this area has grown from €671,000 in 1998 to a current annual figure of €3.2 million. In addition, in the last four years, funding  has been made available to allow for the appointment of escorts on every school transport service for special schools and classes.It is essential that we offer equal educational opportunities to all. We must ensure that all children are given the opportunity to give expression to their private hopes and dreams. It is for this reason I wish to bring this Bill before the House. The right of people with special needs to equal treatment is already provided for in legislation such as the Equal Status Act and the Education Act. This Bill goes further by providing for a structure which will guarantee the rights of children to the greatest possible extent and ensure that parents are central to their child's development at every step of the process. It sets out a range of services which must be provided, including assessments, individual education plans and support services and provides for a process of mediation and appeals where these needs are not met. The Bill establishes the National Council for Special Education, through which the Bill, as enacted, will be given effect.One of the primary features of my proposals is the principle of inclusive education for as many children with educational disabilities as practicable. The education of children with special educational needs alongside those who do not have such needs has long been Government policy. This Bill gives voice to that policy. Section 2 provides that a child with special needs will be educated in an inclusive setting, unless this would not be in the best interests of the child or the effective provision of education for other children in the mainstream environment. In doing so, the Bill protects the best interests of the children concerned, who can best grow and develop in the company of their peer group.The drawing up of education plans tailored to meet the educational needs of children with special educational needs is a key provision of this Bill. Through that planning process, disabilities can be identified, needs assessed, goals decided upon and progress monitored. I am deeply aware of the enormous efforts made by educational professionals in schools up and down the country, every day, in meeting a huge range of diverse needs. I am also conscious that, where possible, the best person to co-ordinate an education plan for children is their school principal. Under section 3 of the Bill, where a school principal believes that a child is not benefiting from the regular education programme he or she must take measures to meet the child's educational needs. If these measures do not meet the child's needs, the principal must consult with the parents and arrange for an assessment of the child. The National Council for Special Education will assist by putting in place guidelines as to how this assessment should be carried out.Importantly, the Bill provides for strict time limits in relation to assessments and education plans. An assessment arranged by a principal must be carried out as soon as possible, but no later than three months from the time the princi pal formed his or her opinion about the child. Where an assessment establishes that a child has an educational disability, the principal must ensure an individual education plan is prepared within one month. In preparing the plan, the parents, special educational needs organiser and any other relevant person must be consulted.It is intended that a school should draw up the plan where the child's needs are relatively uncomplicated, but section 7 of the Bill provides for a more formal planning process to be undertaken by the National Council for Special Education for children whose needs are more complex. In the case of a plan prepared by the council, a special educational needs organiser will convene a team of people which must include the child's parents and may also involve the child, school principal and a psychologist. While the plan focuses on educational needs, it also must have regard to any other needs identified in the child's assessment and must be consistent with those needs.Section 10 requires education plans to be reviewed at regular intervals. Schools will have the primary responsibility for this and will report on it to the child's parents and the council. If the special educational needs organiser takes the view that the child is significantly failing to achieve the goals in the plan, the team may be reconvened to review and, where necessary, amend the plan.In preparing or reviewing a plan, the school or special educational needs organiser must have regard to the educational provision which will be required for the child on his or her becoming an adult and must take steps to enable the child to progress to further education and training. Where this occurs in relation to a child who will turn 18 in the following year, an assessment must be made of how he or she has achieved his or her goals. If those goals have not been met, the effect of this on the child's development will be assessed and, where appropriate, measures will be included in the plan to address those effects. Parents may also seek a review of the plan in certain circumstances. If this request is denied, they can appeal that decision to the council.The implementation of education plans will require considerable resources to be invested in special education. Section 12 of the Bill creates a statutory duty on the Ministers for Education and Science and Health and Children to make those resources available. All spending is subject to the availability of resources and the agreement of the Minister for Finance – that is a political reality. However, in section 12 I have quite deliberately placed emphasis on the fundamental constitutional duty on the State to ensure the equal and fair treatment of all children so that children with special educational needs have the same opportunities as children without disabilities.The Bill provides for a range of duties for schools in respect of children with special educational needs. Under section 13, a school must respect the principle of inclusive education,  ensure that parents are consulted regarding their child's needs and co-operate with the council. Each school must ensure that teachers are aware of the special educational needs of the students and the importance of identifying children with those needs. They must also inculcate in students an awareness of the needs of people with disabilities.Section 9 confers on the council the power to designate a school which a child with special educational needs is to attend and the school will be obliged to enrol the child. This is aimed at the practice of some schools of seeking to avoid admission of children with educational disabilities. There are appeal mechanisms in this process.Parents lie at the heart of the assessment and planning process and a vital part of ensuring their rights is the appeals mechanism provided for in the Bill. The Bill gives parents the power to appeal to an independent appeals board against any statement or description of their child's special educational needs or any other statement or description appearing in the education plan which they consider incorrect or inadequate to meet the child's special educational needs. They may also appeal where they believe that there has been a failure to implement an education plan.Many parents, however, will wish to pursue a less formal approach to a review of decisions. For that reason the Bill provides that the appeals board must ensure that the parties to an appeal are assisted to reach agreement. On hearing an appeal, the appeals board may give directions to the council or a school which it must implement, or it may dismiss the appeal.The Bill establishes the national council for special education as the body charged with ensuring that the Bill as enacted will be given full effect. Its specific duties include the dissemination to schools and parents of information relating to best practice for the education of children with disabilities and the co-ordination of special education in conjunction with schools and health boards. The council will monitor progress of students with special educational needs and review the resources needed in this area. The council will also review the provision made for adults with disabilities to avail of higher, adult and continuing education. It will have responsibility to conduct research in the area of special education and provide relevant advice and information to me, as Minister. In carrying out its duties, the council will be advised by a consultative forum which will be drawn from the education partners, the National Disability Authority and others who have a special interest or expertise in the education of children with disabilities.Work on the establishment of the council is already well under way. As Members will be aware, an order under the Education Act has been approved by these Houses to establish the national council on an interim basis until the commencement of the relevant provisions of this Bill. A chief executive officer and a number of staff  have already been appointed. The direct service work of the council will be performed by up to 80 special education needs organisers. These posts were recently advertised in the national press. I hope to make a further announcement about the establishment of the council and its first members in the near future.Clearly it will take time for the council to be in a position to ensure that services are being delivered to those who need them. Section 21 provides for a road map to the implementation this Bill. The council itself will advise me on when and how each part of the jigsaw should be put in place. I am certain that the target time limit of five years from the date of the establishment of the council, while ambitious, is realistic and achievable.The provision of appropriate education services to children with special educational needs crucially involves close co-operation and co-ordination of activities between education and health authorities. The health boards play a key role in providing support services such as the various therapies which children with disabilities need and also because children and others with disabilities often reside in health board facilities or attend day care services. The Bill is intended to resolve current difficulties regarding co-ordination.In the case of a school-going child, the council must provide him or her with the services identified in the education plan as being necessary for the child to participate in, and benefit from, education. If the council or health board believe that the other body can provide the services more effectively, it must inform the other body of this and that body must then ensure that provision. If a dispute arises between the council and the health board, this will be resolved by the appeals board.In addition, section 36 empowers the council to request a health board to take specified actions where it considers this to be necessary for the preparation or implementation of an adequate education plan or, more generally, to assist the council in carrying out its functions. Prior consultation with a health board is required before a request is made to it. A health board must comply with a request unless, in its view, the assistance requested is not necessary, taking the action would not be consistent with its functions or it would not be reasonable to comply having regard to its resources. If the health board decides that it cannot comply with a request of the council then it must state its reasons and the council may appeal the refusal to comply. On hearing an appeal, the appeals board may direct the health board to comply with the request or it may dismiss the appeal.These provisions bring clarity to the role of the health boards, provide a formal process through which the boards, following consultation with them, can be informed of what is required, and provide a structure for resolving disputes. The beneficiaries of these provisions will be those who  rely on the services of the boards to access appropriate education and training services.This Bill has been some time in the making and is the culmination of a carefully considered policy process. During its preparation we have had the benefit of being able to review the law applying in other jurisdictions and to consult widely over the last 12 months to ensure that this Bill is tailored to address the issues of greatest concern to health and education professionals dealing with disabilities. Parents and voluntary groups have been especially informative in the drafting of this Bill and have been particularly constructive in their approach to it.The consultation process is ongoing and I will bring forward amendments on Committee Stage to reflect what is being said to me. In particular, I have received a number of representations concerning the position of children with dyslexia and whether that condition comes within the scope of the Bill. I intend to discuss this matter with the Parliamentary Counsel and, if necessary, to bring forward an amendment.The Bill also reflects the invaluable advice we received from a number of important committees and groups, including the task force on autism and the special education review committee. In its November 2001 report, the task force made a number of recommendations for reform which have a vital bearing on autism, in particular, and on special education in general. Their key proposals are reflected in the Bill.I look forward to the debate on this legislation in the Houses, which will raise issues of fundamental importance to our society. The purpose is to introduce clear and applicable legislation to ensure educational rights for children with disabilities are respected. I will remain open to constructive criticism and listen carefully to suggestions for improvements as the Bill progresses through this House. All sides of the House are anxious that we get this Bill as right as we possibly can. I will approach this debate in an open and constructive manner. From the discussions at the special education councils, I know the other side of the House will approach this debate in a similar manner.As I began this speech by quoting one famous American, I will finish by quoting another, the philosopher and educator, John Dewey: "Education is a social process. Education is growth. Education is not a preparation for life; Education is life itself."  I commend the Bill to the House.
#OlwynEnrightFG	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-party	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-dob	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	136	I welcome the publication of the Education for Persons with Disabilities 2003 Bill.The Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities, established on 29 November 1993, made a number of key recommendations and findings on the subject of education for those with disabilities in its report, A Strategy for Equality. Rightly, the commission stated clearly that every child is educable. The commission reaffirmed the right of all children, including those with disabilities, to a free and appropriate education in the  least restrictive environment. In Ireland, every individual must have an equal right to educational provision. We must consider how equal is that right today. One of the key recommendations of the commission stated:It is the responsibility of the State to provide sufficient resources to ensure that pre-school children, children of school going age and adults with disabilities have an education appropriate to their needs in the best possible environment.The commission recognised that education was a process of sharing, developing, building, strengthening, encouraging and recognising the abilities of all people. Its aim was clear – to enhance and enable a person to achieve his or her goals. However, the commission found that if it was to measure the status of people with disabilities according to their rate of participation and success in education, then equality was clearly a long way off.Ten years on, this is still the case. Unless the resources are put in place, the best legislation will not ensure that those with disabilities can fully participate in our education system. It is difficult not to be sceptical that this legislation will provide the type of appropriate and resourced services that are so badly needed. Only last Saturday, it was reported that the State secondary schools do not have the resources to teach the vast majority of their special needs students or to implement this Bill's provisions if and when it is enacted. In Galway, the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals annual conference warned that schools still do not have the resources they need to teach incoming students with special needs. One principal stated that even though the number of students with special needs had increased in his school year on year, no additional resources had been allocated since the late 1990s. The outgoing president of the association stated:It would be little short of cynical on the part of the Government to enact the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill when schools quite obviously do not have the resources to implement it.How are people to react when, on the one hand, the Government presents legislation designed to improve the education of persons with disabilities and, on the other, fails to adequately resource the same people?Earlier this month a national representative body for people with intellectual disability, NAMHI, said it feared that a recent audit of special needs resources undertaken by the Department of Education and Science, would result in cuts in the number of special needs assistants to children in primary and secondary schools. The Department of Education and Science appears to think that the current number of special needs assistants can be cut by 30%. NAMHI reasonably pointed out that this  approach is at variance with the proposals in the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill 2003 to entitle all children with a disability to an assessment of their educational needs and the allocation of resources to meet these.While access to the appropriate education resources is one problem, access to proper assessment is another. I understand this will be addressed in the Bill. However, the Department of Education and Science recently confirmed that it would not hire any more psychologists for this year, even though huge numbers of schools and students are not covered by the service. Some parents have been waiting for up to two years for an assessment for their child. Access to the right psychological services at the right time can make a huge difference to a child experiencing difficulties at school. The appropriate psychological intervention can have a positive effect on the child for the rest of their education and life thereafter. Even in parts of the State where the highest numbers of Department psychologists are deployed, more than one school in ten is not covered by NEPS. The figures for the mid-west, north-west and midlands regions are truly appalling. In the mid-west region, 71% of schools are not covered by the NEPS; in the north-west region, 57% of schools are not covered; and, in the midlands region, 44% of schools are not covered. These figures are among the worst nationally, but the figures for many other parts of the country are also worrying. The NEPS structures are in place but need to be expanded quickly and efficiently. This has been clear for years. However, the waiting lists for children waiting to see an educational psychologist are as long as ever. The worry for parents of children who require this service continues.In an attempt to bring waiting lists for this service under control, the Department in the past 18 months has spent more than €2 million funding private psychological assessments. This is solely due to the fact that their own service has not been rolled out as efficiently and comprehensively as it should have been. Neither NEPS as it stands nor the provision of private assessments is reaching all the children who need these services. I know of a number of families which have spent almost €1,200 in the past few weeks to have children assessed due to the inadequacies of the service provided by the Department of Education and Science. These assessments show clearly that the special needs provision being made to their children is totally inadequate.There are huge funding difficulties in the current education system. Those with special needs are not receiving the type of assistance or resources they require. The representative groups, the parents of students with special needs and the students themselves will need a lot of convincing that the introduction of legislation will be matched with adequate resources. The Minister for Education and Science said in his speech that lack of resources, poor planning and a dis connection in the provision of services all combined to act to the detriment of the child with special educational needs. What will actually change as a result of this Bill? The issue of resources is clearly paramount. However, the Minister must also realise that we still have insufficient numbers of the necessary speech and language therapists, play therapists, occupational therapists and physiotherapists.Some steps were taken following Dr. Peter Bacon's report with some additional places provided in NUI Cork, NUI Galway and NUI Limerick. The first intake was to happen in the academic year 2002 to 2003. However, only one course commenced that year and the others only came on stream this academic year. I am concerned that there is a degree of inconsistency in the approach of the Departments of Health and Children and Education and Science in this area. This would not be the first time. Parents are constantly expressing their concerns that they feel their children fall between two Departments, which pass responsibility from one to the other.The Minister for Education and Science hopes to fully implement this Bill in five years. This can only be achieved if the relevant qualified personnel exist. Without speech and language therapists, play therapists, occupational therapists and physiotherapists, little can be done. The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, in response to a parliamentary question I tabled recently, referred to a timeframe of at least a decade, if not until 2015, before the required number of therapists are in place. By then, an entire generation of children with special needs will have passed the magic age of 18 years and will have missed out on the vital services needed to give them their right to an education. This issue will have to be addressed by both the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey, and the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, if we are to make real progress in an acceptable timeframe. Without qualified people we will not be in a position to implement the Bill, as the Minister would wish.One of the most unusual provisions in this Bill is the changing of the definition of educational disability by defining it as "a restriction in the capacity of the child to participate in and benefit from education on account of an enduring physical, sensory, mental health or intellectual impairment". I am concerned at the departure from the previous definition of educational disability as used in both Education Act 1998 and the Employment Equality and Equal Status Acts. Surely a more consistent and coherent definition would be preferable. A person's disability does not change depending on the Act that is read, nor should the definition of it change.One group particularly outraged at the current definition is the Dyslexia Association of Ireland. This is a countrywide group made up of families, teachers and adults with dyslexia. Dyslexia is not a physical, sensory, mental health or intellectual impairment. It is a specific learning disability,  independent of intellectual or physical ability. Dyslexia is not an intellectual impairment, but it can be a disabling condition for learning and children with dyslexia can and often do have special educational needs. This was recognised by the report of the task force on dyslexia, which stated "since the difficulties presented by students with dyslexia range along a continuum from mild to severe, there is a need for a continuum of interventions and other services". Their needs have also been recognised but not always provided for by the Department of Education and Science through special units, accommodation and arrangements for resource teaching as outlined in various circulars.I will be tabling amendments, which I would urge the Minister to consider and accept, to ensure dyslexia is included under this Bill. It is not a question of whether it is necessary; it is clearly necessary. To exclude the needs of those with dyslexia would be extremely unjust and unfair and will fail children affected. In the UK's task force on dyslexia children and young people who are dyslexic have been described in the code of practice as having special educational needs. I do not value our children any less.Trying to explain this away through the use of the explanatory memorandum does not provide comfort. To state: "There is a risk that legislation like this Bill could lead to over-identification of children with learning difficulty as children with educational disabilities" is to ignore the genuine needs of some but not all of these children. The memorandum goes on the say that it will ensure "that genuine needs are met". The only way to ensure and secure that is through this Bill otherwise nothing will change.The mother of a 14 year old boy spoke to me last week. He attended his local national school up to age 12 when he left to join an especially dedicated language class at another primary school. This class had eight pupils, a full-time class teacher and a speech and language therapist usually present 3.5 days per week. He began there with severe mixed receptive and expressive language disorder and severally impaired reading and spelling skills. He made significant gains, however he still presents with a mixed receptive and expressive language disorder and very impaired reading and spelling skills.This boy has made some progress, but he had to transfer to a mainstream second level school. Despite repeating sixth class, his mother tells me he is at fourth class level. He had been in an eight-pupil class doing three subjects. He now is in a ten-pupil class doing 11 subjects. Yet, the Department of Education and Science has refused to sanction resource hours for him. How can he cope in these circumstances? What are his parents supposed to do? How can we justify excluding someone like him from the provisions of this Bill? The only help he is getting at the moment is a voluntary homework programme for three hours per week on the schools own initiative. He can do it if he is helped yet no help is  being provided for him. His genuine and proven needs are being ignored.This Bill places huge emphasis on co-operation between the Department of Education and Science, the national educational psychological service, NEPS and the health boards. The parents of these children have long wished for the creation of multi-disciplinary teams, yet their experiences of this to date do not bode well. I am frequently shown instances where assessments by NEPS psychologists, health board psychologists and private psychologists make hugely varying recommendations.Siobhán is nine years of age. At the age of two her parents became concerned about her lack of interaction with others and her lack of speech. Her family doctor quickly ascertained that nothing was physically wrong with her and after a visit from a counselling nurse, she met a senior psychologist in July and November 1997. At this stage the possibility of her showing traits associated with autism was discussed. In May 1998 she was assessed again at St. Paul's Hospital and Special School and while she was showing atypical traits they could not say definitively that she was within the autistic range.In March 1999 after completion of the childhood autism rating scale, a moderate range of autism was indicated. The autism team has seen Siobhán four times since then. Each time their recommendations have been the same. She needs intensive speech and language therapy, intensive play therapy and occupational therapy, and she needs double the resource time allocated in the primary school.Her parents are extremely concerned at what now seems to be a policy of not providing services by the autism team to children with a dual disability, in other words with autism and an intellectual disability, even though so many children in the ASD range present with some form of dual diagnosis. Siobhán's parents enrolled her in her local primary school, which has been extremely helpful and supportive. Their experience of the Department of Education and Science is not so good. They had to engage a solicitor to act on their behalf to secure a special needs assistant and resource time for their daughter and this took more than a year. The special needs assistant and the teachers had to undergo training on their own time and at their own expense, a point to which I will return later.The autism team recommended the child receive 15 resource hours per week whereas the NEPS recommendation was that she receive five hours per week. It was understood that she also had a special needs assistant – and she has. However, in a reply to a parliamentary question the Minister stated: "the child has been receiving one-to-one support for the entire school week". This is strictly true, she has been receiving support, but not the recommended hours of resource teaching, which goes much farther than support.Out of frustration and a determination to ensure that their daughter receives the education  she needs Siobhán's parents arranged to have her assessed by a consultant psychologist at the forefront of her field. This cost them €1,131 and they managed it with the assistance of their support group. The psychologist has described Siobhán as "just about keeping her head above water in a raging sea". She continued by saying that "Siobhán has fought hard to hide her disability and now, in third class, her deficits are becoming glaringly obvious."  Another year of Siobhán's childhood had passed, early intervention is the key for children like her, yet relying on a system where the wheels turn so slowly, where recourse to solicitors is needed to get the help needed, means early intervention is nearly beyond Siobhán's reach.Down Syndrome Ireland is the national representative association for parents and families of persons with Down's syndrome. The organisation represents more than 2,500 families and is the largest parent representative organisations in Ireland for persons with learning disabilities and their families. Down's syndrome is a congenital condition that occurs in about one in 600 births worldwide.At the outset, Down Syndrome Ireland is concerned that the proposed Bill is seriously flawed and does not fully address the minimum requirements of those with disabilities and their families. It is concerned that the new proposed legislation contains similar provisions to the Disability Bill that was published before the end of 2001. Down Syndrome Ireland has already called upon the Government to introduce fully rights-based and not resource-constrained legislation and to hold a full consultation process.Down Syndrome Ireland has a number of serious concerns about the Bill. First, I wish to focus upon its reading of section 14 of the proposed legislation. Section 14(3) provides for a review of an educational plan when a person is within 12 months of reaching the age of 18. Typically, this plan would focus upon the extent to which educational goals were reached and the underlying reasons behind any failures to reach these goals. The legislation states explicitly: "The Council shall cause an assessment to be made of . . . . . the reasons for any failure to meet those goals and the effect any such failure has had on the development of the child and the plan shall include, where appropriate, measures to address any such effect."  What is obviously missing from the legislation is an obligation to challenge any such identified failure. The assessment may identify a number of key failures and possible ways in which they might be tackled to the benefit of the student. However, neither in this section of the Bill nor in any other section of the legislation is a statutory obligation placed on the Department of Education and Science or any health board to follow through on these recommendations.Of considerable concern to some groups are the provisions in section 9. This section states: "The Council may designate the school which a  child with special educational needs is to attend for the time being and that school shall admit the child upon being directed by the Council to do so."  Leaving aside the fact that "for the time being" is a very loose definition of time that could range from months to years, several organisations have seriously questioned this aspect of the proposed legislation. In practice, would the implementation of section 9 of this Bill lead to a two-tier system where some schools would be forced to accept pupils with special needs, leading to a lack of balance and equity between schools, and removing from parents the choice as to which school to send their child? This section requires significant clarification. One of my main concerns is how this Bill will operate in practice. The Minister alluded to this when he said he did not think it is going to be possible to implement the Bill overnight. To be fair to the Minister he also said he hoped to have it implemented in full within five years. I would prefer a shorter timeframe.I wish to deal with the role of the teacher and school principal as envisaged in this Bill. This Bill has substantial implications for teachers and school principals. The role of the principal will be significantly expanded under sections 3, 5, 8, 10, 11 and 14 of this Bill. It will add to the difficulties already being experienced by principals, particularly teaching principals because of their workload. Everyone desperately wants this legislation to achieve what it sets out to achieve; everyone wants all children to have access to the services they need to achieve an education. The role of the school principal in the Bill as published is paramount but left unresourced they cannot fulfil their obligations. Has the Minister considered at this stage how he plans to release teaching principals to allow them to carry out their newly envisaged duties? What new up-skilling and training will be given to principals to deal with their new role? They are being asked in section 3 to make a serious judgment on the needs of children and yet to make the call on the needs of a child for assessment, it must be ensured that such a power is matched by the training required. Some principals will be very experienced in this area where they have had children with special needs in their school, others will have little experience depending on the need in their individual schools. I share the concerns expressed by the INTO about the phrase, "to the extent that could be expected of the student", which appears in section 3(1) in that its use could exclude a child from the resource provision.Section 7 cites those who will be involved in preparing education plans. I have some difficulties with this section. First, everyone has believed for some time prior to the publication of the Bill that this would be done through a multidisciplinary approach. This should clearly include everyone involved with the child, from teacher, to occupational and play therapist, doctor, if necessary, speech and language therapist, special needs organiser, the child's psychologist and, of course,  the parents. Rather than clearly setting out such a multidisciplinary approach those who are to attend at the preparation of the education plans are left to the discretion of the special educational needs organiser. Will the decision on who will attend be dependent on resources? The presence of the teacher is also paramount in preparation of these plans as the teacher has far more day-to-day involvement with the child and is acutely aware of the child's classroom needs and abilities.The concerns I have expressed on the multidisciplinary approach to education plans can also be directed towards section 5 relating to assessments and it is paramount that a multidisciplinary approach is mandatory and not discretionary. The findings on assessments should also be made available automatically to parents because forcing them to make a request is creating another needless layer of bureaucracy. I very much doubt if there are any, not to mention many, parents who will not want to see the results of an assessment carried out on their child.The training of teachers in this whole area cannot be over-emphasised. At the launch of this Bill the Minister said in response to a question that, "9% of pupils within ordinary primary mainstream schools qualify for special needs, 12% if you take in special schools, that is four times the European average". He also stated, "that is extra high by European standards". In light of this the need for greater and more mandatory teacher training in this area must be seriously examined.I know that the Minister's stated policy is that all teachers working with children with special educational needs will have relevant training and continual professional development. However, the reality is that this is insufficient at present. The courses contain "elements" and "inputs" to use the Minister's own words, of the necessary training required, but in light of the figures I quoted earlier, it simply is not enough. I know the Minister agrees with me on this point because on Question Time he said that we have some catching up to do. Obviously there is a degree of urgency here, because people's expectations will be increased and indeed have increased since the publication of this Bill.I have also asked previously about making these courses available on a more mainstream basis, rather than just as an optional module. I know the Minister was in negotiation with the teacher training colleges on this issue. At what stage are these negotiations? What role has the education support service in this area? Are all education centres providing the necessary supports to teachers so they are sufficiently aware of disabilities? I know a considerable number of teachers have taken inservice training in this area. However, the profession as a whole needs to be in a position to avail of this training.No doubt one of the biggest concerns everyone has with this Bill is that it does not commit to the rights-based approach, which everyone expected and had earnestly hoped for. The Minister suggested quite clearly at the launch of this Bill that  there might not be any extra budgetary resources to fund the provisions of this legislation. Will this Bill fail because of a lack of resources? How can we progress if we cannot fund this? Let us not fool ourselves or try to fool everyone else. This is going to take money to work. The provision of the many good parts of this Bill will take a substantial amount of extra resources.Section 12 of this Bill is where it departs from the aims we all sought to achieve. Section 12(1) begins, "The Minister and the Minister for Health and Children shall each, with the consent of the Minister for Finance. . . . ". This does not bode well. Both the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for Education and Science are given a duty to fulfil but it is subject to the consent of the Minister for Finance. Where is the rights-based approach and where is the reality? Will this clause effectively lessen the rights already in existence following court judgments?The Minister must have the power and resources to implement this Bill. Rights can only be implemented if the will is there to do it. No one wants to see another stream of parents go to court to educate their children. I do not believe this Bill actually confers any extra rights on children that do not already exist under the Constitution but I will not tolerate any attempt to diminish those rights. It was outlined to the committee that the Department of Education and Science is moving from the rights-based approach it had slowly been adopting following the court judgments to a resource-based approach following the publication of this Bill. For the Minister to say he has quite deliberately emphasised the fundamental constitutional duty of the State to ensure equal and fair treatment of all children is, quite frankly, irrelevant. All legislation passed by this House is subject to the primacy of the Constitution. This supposed emphasis makes no real difference. The political reality is that rights are subject to the Minister for Finance. I contend either the rights exist or they do not.Another aspect of the Bill is the absence of any real attempt to deal with physical disability. This is a very real issue and one which must be tackled. Clearly most people with a physical disability do not have any difficulty with being educated from an intellectual point of view, but the issue for them is access to the education system in a physical sense. There is a lack of physical access, availability of personal assistants and assistive technology. There are still many children attending schools who do not have proper and sufficient access. I know of true stories of parents having to collect children in wheelchairs to bring them home to use the bathroom because the school does not have the facilities. I know that grants exist and are available but not at the speed required to deal with the situation in a compassionate and practical way.I believe that the special education council must be made accountable. This is an issue I raised with the Minister when we discussed the council at the education committee. It cannot be  tolerated that the Minister can wash his hands of all responsibility now that the council is in place. We have seen the response to the difficulties being experienced by the National Educational Welfare Board. It is finding it extremely difficult to do the job it has been directed to do because it is crippled by a lack of funding. However, when we raise the issues of truancy, school drop-out rates and young people leaving the education system before they are legally entitled to do so, the Minister responds that the NEWB has statutory responsibility. The buck for the provision to children with special needs has got to stop with the Minister for Education and Science. If he continues at this rate of setting up agencies which become solely and statutorily responsible, we will not need a Minister for Education and Science; it will just be a matter of having the Minister for Finance send over the budget to these agencies every year. The council must be accountable and not just by publishing an annual report. It must be fully politically accountable, otherwise to where do genuinely dissatisfied people turn?I have outlined many of my considerations and I look forward to tabling many amendments on Committee Stage. I ask the Minister to consider what I have said today.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	137	The Labour Party welcomes the fact that disability legislation has finally reached the floor of the Dáil after six very frustrating years for representatives of a variety of disability organisations who have tirelessly and determinedly fought to have their rights established. The shocking inadequacy of the two Bills last year was a slap in the face for these campaigners and we worked with them to force the Government to withdraw both Bills because they would have removed rights rather than progressed them. There are many things wrong with this Bill which the Labour Party will work to have amended, but it can be used as the basis for long-awaited progress. The Labour Party welcomes the Bill and will not oppose it on Second Stage.However, it will not be worth the paper it is written on if resources are not committed to implement the measures. A child may have an assessment but that will not make any positive difference if the supports necessary are not available. This crucial element is not clear in the Bill as drafted and I urge the Minister to address it at this stage. Students with disabilities must not become pawns in the struggle for resources.Emergency motions passed at the annual conference of the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals this month spell out its members' concerns in an alarming way.They are so sceptical about the allocation of resources that they have called on management bodies to draw up admission policies that give them the right to postpone the entry of special needs students into schools unless resources are first made available. It is vital that the Minister provides clarity on this matter.Our children will be the ultimate losers in the battle between the Department of Education and Science and the schools. Deputy Enright referred to specific cases in this regard. A number of individual cases have been brought to my attention where professional assessments supported the view that children had special needs and required educational supports, but these were not forthcoming. One of the delegates to the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals described the situation as being in chaos and attributed the observation to somebody within the Department of Education and Science. The Minister needs to address the issue of resources before anybody will be satisfied that the legislation will make any difference.Section 12 is the crucial section in this regard. Deputy Enright also referred to this point. It deals with the issue of resources and it must be amended if the legislation is to be rights-based. Deputy Enright pointed out that resources are entirely subject to the sanction of the Minister for Finance. Another point of concern was drawn to our attention during the committee hearings, namely that the section is weaker than the corresponding section 13 in the Bill that was withdrawn. It has an extra few words which make a great difference. It states that:The Minister and the Minister for Health and Children shall each, – [and I welcome the fact that the Minister for Health and Children is included in the Bill] – with the consent of the Minister for Finance, out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, provide to or in respect of schools and their employees such moneys and other resources – [This is the extra bit] – as are determined by him or her for the purposes of the implementation of education plans prepared in respect of children with special educational needs.The determination of the Minister for Education and Science and the Minister for Health and Children is included in this Bill although they were not in the previous draft. This is a serious flaw which gives an opt-out to the Minister with regard to the provision of the necessary resources. I urge the Minister to withdraw these words from the section. While I share the concerns of Deputy Enright in regard to other aspects of section 12, this point is crucial in terms of the provision of resources and the changes made to the corresponding section in the withdrawn Bill.The scandalously inadequate funding provided to the National Educational Welfare Board, which I raised on the Order of Business this morning, emphasises what a poisoned chalice legislation can be if those whose statutory duty it is to implement its provisions are not adequately resourced. The board has a legal obligation to ensure that children go to school but it cannot afford to employ sufficient educational welfare officers to do the job. The problems that schools are experiencing as a result of this were high lighted at our committee hearings and there is a great deal of fear in regard to the current Bill. Mr. Eddie Ward, chief executive officer of the National Educational Welfare Board, spoke on television yesterday to highlight the problems the board is having in implementing the legislation. He called for €25 million to be allocated for this purpose. I reiterate this call to the Minister. The board has a statutory duty. The Garda can no longer fulfil the function it had under previous legislation. As long as we do not have sufficient educational welfare officers to cover the country, young children – some as young as ten and 11 – will remain absent from school. Nothing is being done to address this serious issue. Although a statutory provision exists to deal with such matters, it is not being implemented on the ground. A similar difficulty could arise with this legislation in that the special needs council will have statutory duties but may not have the resources to implement them. If the legislation is enacted without the necessary resources for its full implementation, this will cause chaos, confusion and unmet expectations.A timeframe must be outlined for the implementation of the Bill's provisions. I accept that this is addressed in section 21 where a timeframe of five years is set out. It is important that this expectation is realised.The changes the Minister recently implemented in special needs support appear to be going in the opposite direction to the child-centred approach of the legislation. Hundreds of children around the country who need support are not getting it. There has been an embargo on recruitment of educational psychologists. I submitted a number of parliamentary questions last week in this regard. As Deputy Enright outlined, there are three areas of the country in particular, including my own mid-west region which is the worst off, where no educational psychologists are available under the NEPS programme to schools. Private psychologists are employed and this can give rise to difficulties as their proposals are frequently not deemed to be in accordance with the terms under the NEPS scheme. As a result, schools are not getting the resources they need.The Department sent a circular, SP ED 24/03, to the boards of management and principals of all national schools. The tenor of the circular appears to go in the opposite direction to that which is intended in the legislation. Section 10 of the circular states:The Department will be engaging in discussions with the education partners with a view to developing a weighted system of allocations for special needs teaching resources with effect from 2004/2005 school year. This would involve an annual allocation being made to schools based on predicted incidence of special educational needs within different size school populations.This appears to suggest that an estimate would be made as to the number of special needs children  that should be in a particular school, depending on its size. This is totally opposite to the child-centred approach of the legislation, which refers to the individual assessment of needs and individual education plans. Will the Minister indicate how this will work in practice? In the next school year there is a suggestion that allocations will be made on the basis of school numbers, whereas the legislation which will be in the process of being implemented at that time is going in the direction of the individual child. The latter is the proper approach and is in line with what the Minister outlined in his speech. It is also the recommended approach of the various organisations that made submissions to us.I am particularly concerned about the embargo on psychologists who are clearly crucial in terms of identifying needs under the legislation, as well as the other specialists such as speech therapists and so on that are also in short supply. People with disabilities must be given some certainty as to when their rights will become reality.The right to education is enshrined in Article 42 of the Constitution. This article has been interpreted in the courts, most notably in the Sinnott judgment and has been elaborated on in legislation, including the Equal Status Act 2000, the Education Act 1998 and the Education (Welfare) Act 2000. The State has a further obligation to fulfil its duties under international legislation, including the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, the UN International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the UN International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the European Convention on Human Rights and Article 13 of the Treaty of Amsterdam. While these measures may not be justiciable in Irish courts because they have been incorporated in a dualistic way rather than directly into domestic law, they must and should be observed. The UN Standard Rules on the Equalisation of Opportunities for Persons with Disabilities, drawn up in 1993, also form part of the backdrop to this legislation.It is worth noting that the Irish Human Rights Commission specifically stated its intention to ensure that recent developments at international level towards a rights-based approach to the issue of disability are reflected in our domestic legislation. I suggest that if the Minister has not already consulted the commission in respect of this legislation, he should do so. A great deal of attention was focused on the Disability Bill but this Bill is also a crucial part of the legislation in regard to disability and the views of the Irish Human Rights Commission should be taken into account.During the three days of hearings on the Bill at the Joint Committee on Education and Science, a member of the committee asked whether people with disabilities were asking for greater rights than other students. The answer is that they are merely looking for their equal right to an environment and facilities that will enable them to learn, just as the system provides for others  whose requirements coincide with the majority of their fellow-students. This Bill is part of the legislative framework needed to delineate rights in the Constitution and in international law. It is no more than that. The legislation includes a reference to this constitutional right, but this exists anyway. It is about equity, it is our duty and we should get on with it.Getting to this point has not been easy. Before the previous Government took office in 1997, specific legislation was promised to address the rights of people with disabilities. While the Employment Equality Act and the Equal Status Act include disability among the nine grounds under which discrimination is outlawed, the need for specific legislation was acknowledged from the time of the publication of the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities in 1996. Consultation on the proposed legislation began in the late 1990s and disability organisations worked together to reach consensus on the key points which must be addressed. A major conference, Get Your Act Together, which I attended, was held in December 2001. Ongoing discussions with officials of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Department of Education and Science, as well as with the Ministers concerned, gave rise to the understanding that there was a two-way understanding which would result in useful legislation. It was a huge disappointment, therefore, when the Disabilities Bill 2001 and the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill 2002 were published. Both Bills ignored the central issue on which the organisations had lobbied. They contained no rights. In fact, section 47 of the Disabilities Bill denied any right to take court action in respect of any aspect of the Bill. The legislation had to be ignominiously scrapped which put large quantities of egg on Government faces. It was much more serious for people with disabilities. They were back to the drawing board in the clear knowledge that what they had thought was consultation turned out to be a deaf ear.This is the background to the current Bill and its larger sister, the Disabilities Bill. The Disabilities Bill should have come first. A single assessment of need is a central recommendation of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities. That need begins from birth in many cases and in early childhood in many others. It is essential that the provisions in the Disabilities Bill are dovetailed with this one. I understand the Minister for Education and Science has had discussions with the Minister for Health and Children on this matter. It has been pointed out to members of the Joint Committee on Education and Science that joined-up government in this area is crucial. There must be joined-up Departments as well as joined-up Ministers as there are already problems where the responsibilities of the Departments of Education and Science and Health and Children overlap. It would have been better, therefore, to publish the Disabilities Bill  first as the broader assessment of need will be at birth. The education assessment must fit into what has gone before.The Taoiseach told the Dáil that the Government intends to put the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill through both Houses of the Oireachtas before publishing the Disabilities Bill. Can the Minister for Education and Science clarify whether that is still the intention? It is difficult, in that context, to be sure that arrangements to assess need will be effective for all children. Responsibility at pre-school level is with the health boards and it is not clear how needs other than those in the educational area will be addressed. In effect, we are making part of the jigsaw without having access to all the pieces, particularly those vital first framework pieces inside which the rest should be placed.At the other end of the age spectrum, the needs of those over 18 are ignored with the exception of a requirement to arrange for the transition from school to further training or other placements. What about those who, like Jamie Sinnott, have not reached their basic learning aims at age 18? What about the many third level students who have a disability? The Bill's title is misleading in its reference to "persons with disabilities" given the fact that its provisions deal only with those under the age of 18. That is a real problem. I am not sure why the title was so inclusive, when the legislation is not. Where do the concepts of life-long learning and second chance education fit in the proposed framework? In its submission to the Committee on Education and Science, the National Association for the Mentally Handicapped of Ireland requested a specific reference in section 14 to the right of a child to stay on in school if by the age of 18 he or she has not achieved basic educational goals. That must be addressed. Can the Minister explain how he intends to address third level, second chance and continuing education and literacy, particularly for people with severe and profound learning difficulties who, clearly, do not reach their potential at 18? They need ongoing facilities. The reference in section 14 as currently drafted is inadequate. Will the Minister introduce further legislation to deal with those over the age of 18?Another major flaw in this Bill which must be addressed is its failure to include all children with learning disabilities. The Minister and Deputy Enright referred to this issue. Specific learning disorders such as dyslexia, ADD, ADHD and Asperger's syndrome appear to be excluded from the definition of "disability" which has been changed since last year's Bill was withdrawn. The definition is also different from the one which appears in the Education Act 1998 and the Employment Equality and Equal Status Acts. The Minister has indicated his intention to consider making an amendment in this regard. Such an amendment is essential and in this regard the Minister should specifically commit to making it.I am concerned, as was Deputy Enright, about the Bill's explanatory memorandum. There  appears to be a clear intention to exclude certain learning difficulties from the provisions of the Bill. According to the memorandum, not all children who have difficulties learning are children with special educational needs arising from a disability. While the Minister has given us some assurances today, he needs to be much more specific about the Bill's inclusivity, particularly on the conditions to which I have just referred.It became clear to members of the Joint Committee on Education and Science during discussions with organisations in the past few weeks that they do not constitute a homogenous group. What is appropriate for one person will not work for another. The most striking example was when two organisations representing people with hearing impairment shared a session before the committee with the National Council for the Blind. It was made clear to the members of the committee that special schools in which Irish sign language is the first language are the best environments for most young deaf people. On the other hand, the National Council for the Blind argued convincingly that the local school is the place most suited to the needs of a visually impaired child. At another hearing, parents of children with severe and profound intellectual disabilities at St. Vincent's in Dublin described their children's needs as being primarily related to health rather than education. The school model did not suit them.Mainstreaming as opposed to special schooling has been a subject of debate for many years. Some countries have tried to fit almost everyone into the mainstream while others have relied on special schools but neither approach has proved successful. The available evidence suggests that both options must be available with choices being made in the interests of each individual child. Section 2 of the Bill makes provision in respect of the factors to be considered in making such decisions. The section must be amended as it does not provide for equality in respect of the needs of children with a disability. There must be balance. While I accept fully the duty to consider the needs of the other children in the school, it must be on an equal rather than a superior basis.Assessment of needs must be centred on the individual child's best interests. The system must fit the child rather than the child having to fit the system. The Bill is unclear as to the absolute right of parents to have their child assessed if they believe he or she may have special needs. The Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities recommended that this right be central to legislation. The Bill is generally weak on the centrality of parents to decisions affecting their children, a point which was brought home to members of the committee. Parents must be part of the entire process and they must be represented on the various bodies referred to in the legislation before us.Representation for people with disabilities and/or the parents of children with disabilities must be guaranteed on the council, the appeals board and the consultative forum as recom mended by the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities. I share Deputy Enright's opinion of multidisciplinary approaches to the assessment of needs and education plans. Another major omission is the absence of any reference in the Bill to an advocacy service. The disability legislation consultative group which has been meeting with the Department of Education and Science and the Department of Health and Children has identified advocacy as one of the core elements needed to ensure that rights in law can become a reality in people's lives. The group spelt that out yesterday in its meeting in Buswells Hotel. In the USA, where disability legislation has been pioneered, advocacy has helped to secure the services needed for many who would not have had the resources to pursue their rights. It is understood that this will form part of the Disabilities Bill but it is equally important that no one loses out on education because he or she or his or her family does not have the capacity to take advantage of the provisions of this legislation. I urge the Minister to address the issue of advocacy.It is essential that teachers and schools are properly prepared and that teacher training and inservice courses are geared towards the integration of children with special needs in schools. As the Minister knows, there is a particular concern with regard to school principals and the extra responsibilities they are being required to undertake in this legislation. Principals feel they are already overstretched by a variety of duties and are somewhat concerned that drawing up education plans will be their responsibility. While the special needs organisers and others will be involved, they would like the Minister to consider involving the special needs organisers in a more direct manner and removing some of the burdens from principals. I have referred to seeking the deferment of entry for special needs pupils where resources are not available.Many other specifics will be debated on Committee Stage and it is my intention to work to have the Bill considerably strengthened. For example, section 9 refers to the designation of schools. It is important that schools do not manage, through their policies, to have themselves removed from designation. There should be no good reason, if a child is to attend a mainstream school, it should not be his or her local school. The Minister has expressed strong views on this aspect, but I hope the Bill will tighten as far as possible provisions in this regard.The issue of pre-schooling is also crucial. It is linked to the need with the health boards and so on. Pre-school services are underdeveloped but obligations will be imposed on available services to work under the provisions of the legislation. Members of the Irish Pre-school Playgroups Association attended committee hearings and expressed strong support for the provisions in the Bill while emphasising the need for the necessary support and resources. That is true of the entire pre-school sector. Another forum will deal with  the need to build up this sector but it needs to be resourced under the terms of this legislation.There will be much work to do on Committee Stage and I welcome the Minister's indication that he will introduce a number of amendments. I also intend to do so on behalf of the Labour Party, particularly with a view to addressing the question of rights and resources.The Minister quoted from the views expressed by two Americans. I wish to quote from a speech made by Professor Gerard Quinn of UCG, a renowned expert on rights, especially disability rights. He has spoken on this issue a number of times, including at the conference held in Jury's Hotel in 2001. Speaking at the Human Rights Forum, Dublin Castle, in July 2001 he stated:The core question here is as old as the first city states of Greece. It implicates a moral vision of the political community – of who is "in" and who is "'out". It concerns our societies' attitude toward human difference – whether this difference is one of race, creed or ability. It follows that the modern human rights agenda in the context of disability (and more generally) is not so much about power and protecting people against power (although that is very important in institutional settings) – it is about admitting people to power over their own lives and conferring on them equal rights to belong and to participate. It is about re-engineering social support to serve the overriding goal of expanding the zone of freedom to include all and not to maintain people – whether in misery or in luxury – on the periphery; squatting anxiously forever on the edge.That is more eloquent than anything I could have said but it is what we are trying to achieve in this legislation and in the Disability Bill which we anxiously await. It is about equal rights and facilitating people to participate in the process. It is also about society and the education system making the necessary changes to facilitate people with disabilities. This is where empowerment becomes important. We need to view things differently from the past where, rather than seeing people as the problem, we create the social structures to include them. The Bill needs to be considerably strengthened to achieve that goal.

Before I address the Bill's provisions I wish to outline three cases in my constituency I have had to deal with as a backbench Deputy. The first involves a boy with autism who has been out of school since September. His parents are totally stressed but no educational ser vice has been provided. When I lobbied the Department last November the parents were offered six home teaching hours. That is unacceptable. The average child gets 25 hours of teaching per week. It is a disgrace, especially when only a couple of months has elapsed since the holding of the Special Olympics.The second case involves another child with disability who started school in September and who requires a special needs assistant. The teachers and parents contacted me but they are still waiting for one. The third case involves a child with disability who is finishing primary school. The parents do not know what school the child is to attend next year as the local school has indicated it does not have a special class facility or the necessary resource services.This is happening in the European Year for People with Disabilities and a couple of months after the holding of the Special Olympics. If this legislation does not address these issues, Deputies might as well leave the House. It is unacceptable.As a parent of a young daughter with Down's syndrome I have a special interest in this issue and I speak here as a parent, a primary school teacher and as a legislator in the Dáil. I wish to put on the record the views of a parent and also those of over 200,000 members of the Down's Syndrome Association of Ireland. I commend and thank the association and other groups, such as NAMHI, for their excellent work on behalf of children and adults with disabilities. They have made a massive contribution to Irish society and we do not thank or commend them enough. I also wish to reflect the views of other disability groups, particularly parents and those who work on the front line. The Bill has the potential to change Irish society and I urge the Minister to listen to the views of parents and the disability organisations. They matter in this debate and the represent our future.Education for persons with learning disabilities fails to meet the needs of these people and continues to try to deliver education in the academic sense while missing the overall interpretation of education as laid down in the O'Donoghue and Sinnott judgments. The proposed Bill of April 2002 sought to continue the unjust and unfair approach of previous Administrations in not conferring unconditional enforceable rights on persons with learning disability, rights enjoyed by other pupils in the same classroom. This is the key issue.For any education rights to be meaningfully implemented, I call on the Minister to ensure that the legislation provides for an automatic entitlement to a full-time special needs assistant on entry to every school. The present situation is at crisis level where many children have been refused special needs assistance. This must also be accompanied by a substantial increase in resource teaching hours for children with disabilities, children with Down's syndrome and other learning disabilities. While adequate resource teaching is offered to children with other  learning disabilities, none are more serious than children with Down's syndrome who are left short. It means some children have a good service at their disposal while others have a reduced or no service. The Minister must ensure as a priority that all special needs assistants and resource teachers are obliged to undergo structured and relevant training courses.The unequal distribution of capitation grants being made for pupils with learning disabilities in special and mainstream schools must be addressed. The Minister must give serious consideration to forming a Down's syndrome forum or task force of the kind already in existence for children with autism or dyslexia. It should examine, facilitate and provide a meaningful experience for inclusion for children. There must also be an independent and ongoing assessment of the individual needs of each child to ensure they are provided with an appropriate education, as is their constitutional right. This must not be dictated by a lack of resources.The Bill is seriously flawed. It does not fully address the minimum requirements of those with disabilities, their parents and their families. It contains similar provisions and starts from the same base as the discredited Disabilities Bill, published days before Christmas 2001 by the then Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.I call on the Minister to amend the provisions of the Education Act 1998 in so far as they impinge on the Bill. An example is the need to amend the definition of support services, a crucial concept for children with Down's syndrome or other learning disabilities. The Government should also introduce truly rights based and not resource constrained legislation following proper consultation. It should do so as a lasting testament to the Special Olympics. I ask the Minister to seriously consider this.I recognise the new economic circumstances that prevail and the need to prioritise special spending needs. However, for too long children and adults with learning disabilities have suffered from an educational system that has deliberately marginalised and discriminated against them and failed to address their needs. That is the bottom line. The only true protections that can be afforded them is through legally enforceable rights which are not so qualified or subject conditionally as to be meaningless.I would like to quote Senator Harrison Williams, principal author of the Education for all Handicapped Children Act in the USA speaking in 1974. He stated as follows:We must recognise our responsibility to provide education for all children [with disabilities] which meets their unique needs. The denial of right to education and to equal opportunity within this nation for handicapped children – whether it be outright exclusion from school, the failure to provide an education which meets the needs of a single handicapped child, or the refusal to recognise a handicapped child's right  to grow – is a travesty of justice and a denial of equal protection under the law.I have major concerns about the Bill's exclusion of people with dyslexia. The purpose of the Bill is to make detailed provisions in which the education of children with disabilities can be guaranteed as a right which is enforceable by law. While examining the Bill, I was shocked to find that the definition of "educational disability" has been worded to exclude children with dyslexia. This is not acceptable and must be changed. The definition in the Bill is an enduring physical, sensory, mental health or intellectual impairment. Dyslexia is not a physical, sensory, mental or intellectual impairment. It is a specific learning disability independent of intellectual and physical ability. The Minister must accept this reality and include these children in the Bill. The way forward is to use the definition in the Education Act 1998 which states that educational disability is a condition or malfunction which results in a person learning differently from a person without the condition or malfunction. This definition adequately covers the condition of dyslexia.We must ensure that all children with different needs are covered in the Bill. After the wonderful experience of the Special Olympics the Minister has a duty in this regard. There are approximately 17,000 children with dyslexia in primary schools and approximately 14,000 in secondary level schools. This is an issue which must be addressed.The serious failings in the Bill are the inappropriate power being given to the national council, whereby the aforementioned council may designate the school which the child with special educational needs is to attend and the lack of recognition in the Bill of children born with a recognisable disability, for example, Down's syndrome. They will still have to go through assessment and consultation procedures with other professions. My third concern relates to the failure to give unqualified fundamental, inalienable and non-conditional rights to persons with disabilities, their parents and families. My fourth concern relates to the lack of sanctions or appropriate enforcement regime. My next concern relates to the incessant emphasis on the qualifications of what limited rights are conferred in the Bill by reference to resources, and in certain cases, the explicit consent of the Minister for Finance in so far as is practicable or reasonable. This is totally unacceptable as a means whereby these rights can effectively be denied where unreasonable or impracticable.My other concern is the inappropriate role conferred in certain instances on school principals – I am a former school principal – and the consequent lack of a truly independent assessment of the educational needs of our children which takes full and meaningful account of the views of parents. Another concern relates to the unreasonable distinction between children under three years of age and those over three, particularly in relation to the assessment of needs in  respect of support services and the furnishing of these services.I welcome the debate. I hope the Minister will listen to some of the ideas and take some of the amendments on board. Choice is a key factor when dealing with children with disabilities. Children with disabilities have different needs. Choice in education is the way forward and we must respect that view.
#SeanCroweSF	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-party	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-dob	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	141	I will begin by welcoming the Bill, the first legislation brought before the House by the Minister for Education and Science and probably one of the most important he intends to bring. While broadly welcoming the Bill, or at least what the legislation is seeking to do, there are a number of serious flaws and problems in the detail, particularly in the area of definition, which need to be addressed. If it is to work the Bill must be centred around the greater good of the individual and based around the social model of disability. This is clearly not the case as the legislation stands.I wish to thank the dozens of groups and individuals who made almost 50 submissions on the legislation to the Joint Committee on Education and Science, particularly those who made oral submissions. It was certainly a worthwhile effort as everyone involved learned from the process. I note from the Minister's speech that he is prepared to take on board a number of the recommendations and proposals made by the groups concerned. I hope he will take the proposals into account when the Bill reaches Committee Stage. The manner in which the Bill passes through the House will give us an indication of the way the forthcoming disabilities Bill will be treated.One of the crucial elements of the Bill is the section on definitions. It is this section which has aroused a fair share of difficulties. While I welcome the fact that the legislation before us has changed the definition of a child by taking away that element of the legislation that excluded children under the age of three, the definition of "child" is still a long way from sufficient. The use of the term "child" in the first place is a curious one. Perhaps the title of the Bill should be the education for children with disability Bill 2003 as the entire concept of lifelong learning and adult education has been left out. Adult and third level education come under the remit of the Minister, yet they have been excluded from the legislation. What about the problems facing persons with disabilities in attending university and accessing adult literacy programmes? This legislation appears to suggest that once a student with special educational needs has done the leaving certificate, he or she is no longer in need of the assistance or supports required to get through primary and secondary school.The age limit of 18 years is a barrier, not just in terms of adult and third level education but because it does not recognise that a student with disabilities might, for whatever reason, need to  have more time to complete school than those without disabilities. They might enter the school cycle late or miss large amounts of class for medical and health reasons. Is the Minister being mindful of the 2001 Jamie Sinnott judgment in the definition he has adopted? I suggest that he refrain from making new definitions when they are not needed. The Education Act 1998 includes a definition of the term "student" as a person enrolled in a school or registered in a centre for education. I recommend that the term "child" be replaced, where appropriate, with the term "student" and that the Minister addresses the lack of measures to deal with education beyond the leaving certificate.The Minister will be aware that many disability and education groups have serious difficulties with some of the other proposed definitions in the legislation, specifically the definition of a "child with special educational needs" and "educational disability". As it stands, this definition would exclude students with learning difficulties and other disorders. There has been a great deal of anger among dyslexia support groups, for example, at the decision to stop classifying dyslexia, as the Department has normally done, as a specific learning disability and exclude it from education legislation dealing with disability.I also note from an all-Ireland perspective that special education legislation operating in the Six Counties refers to the special education needs of students with dyslexia. Disability legislation in this State should, where possible, be consistent. There is already a definition of disability in education legislation contained in the Education Act 1998. It is also used in the Employment Equality Act 1998 and the Equal Status Act 2000. The adoption of these definitions would ensure a standardised legal approach to the definition of disability that will include this broad span of learning disabilities. I ask the Minister to either amend or accept amendments on Committee Stage to change the definition of disability to one already widely accepted.The Irish Wheelchair Association made the point that, as it stands in the legislation, the definition of educational disability would describe someone like the physicist, Stephen Hawking, as suffering from an educational disability. The barriers faced by people with physical disabilities are not the product of difficulties in learning but in accessing places of education or appropriate technology.The social model of disability sees this not as a disability of the person concerned but as society disabling that person by not providing the appropriate facilities, by not allowing for their differences. A student in a wheelchair who cannot get into his or her school because it has steps is not disabled, rather the school is disabling them by not providing appropriate access. It is this social model of disability that must be embraced by the State from top to bottom and this legislation does not go far enough to address this issue.I have a number of concerns about section 2  and the provisions relating to integrated education. I welcome the clear and unambiguous statement of support for integrated education in the first part of the section. While I accept it is not always in the best interest of the child concerned, paragraph (b) is vague and ill-defined – there is no information on who would make the crucial decision that the provision of education for the student with special needs in the classroom is impacting negatively on the learning of the other children with whom he or she is to be taught. Is the decision to be made by the teacher or the principal? How can we be sure that either of those will have the experience, skills and training in special education to make that determination? Is there room for the involvement of parents in this decision-making process, or even that of the other students in the class? How is “effective provision” defined?I accept that for practical reasons some form of wording is needed to deal with the small number of cases that may arise which would be covered by this section. As it stands, it is unclear and open to widespread abuse. It could be used by staff who, struggling to cope on the few resources they have at present, might see the addition of a child with disabilities as an added burden. I do not suggest this kind of thinking would be widespread or tolerated. To protect the rights of all concerned I ask the Minister to clarify this part of the legislation to allow for consultation with parents and to expand on the detail of the decision-making process.In section 3, the notion of an education plan is an extremely good one. However, I wish to make several points. There is no mention in the section of the student's teacher who would have most contact with the pupil. In large schools especially, the teacher would have more detailed knowledge of the student. While in practice the principal will, no doubt, have regard to the opinion of the teacher concerned, including this in legislation would improve the section.Section 3(1) provides for the principal taking measures to address any "perceived failure of the standard education programme to meet the needs of the child". There is no mention of consultation with parents. If the principal has made the decision that a student of his or hers is not benefiting to the desired extent from the education programme generally applied in the school, he or she should not take measures to address this. Any such measures should be taken in consultation with the parents of the child concerned. The Explanatory Memorandum refers to the close involvement of parents in a child's education as a key element. As such, I ask the Minister to consider amending this section to provide for the principal to consult with parents.In the same vein, parents should be given copies of the education plan as soon as it is developed and not "as soon as is practicable". I note the power to decide who is consulted in the preparation plan is left entirely in the hands of the principal. While there is a clear obligation to  consult with the parents of the child and the special needs organiser, the parents have no power to request that someone with whom they may feel especially comfortable be involved in the creation of the plan. If the parents are represented and allowed reasonable access to bringing representations to the education plan creation process, they are less likely to have difficulties with it once it is created.In speaking on the education plan, I wish to highlight the burdens this will add to the workload of school principals. The Bill sets out a detailed list of obligations to be fulfilled by the principal in particular for each individual. According to the INTO, three out of every four principals are teachers as well as principals. Today, principals must also be accountants, administrators, lawyers, social workers, fund-raisers and diplomats.Principals are rightly concerned that the legislation will raise expectations and that they will be blamed if the added resources are not made available. The Minister said recently that he would provide 500 administrative posts to alleviate this burden. I would welcome more information about this in the Minister's response.Time does not allow me to go into detail on further aspects of the Bill but my party colleagues will do so when they contribute to the debate.

It is not a huge overall improvement on its predecessor. Political opportunists might say that would not be difficult but let us give credit where credit is due. It is much different from last year's pre-election entity. It is regrettable that some of the provisions of the 2002 Bill were not implemented. Overall, the 2003 Bill is an improvement. Without the allocation of resources it is nothing more than a shiny, revamped and repackaged version of the 2002 Bill. It has an explanatory memorandum to die for. It uses new age terms such as holistic, whole child, goals-driven and education partners. Its very essence speaks the language of inclusivity, but it is not inclusive. There are no guarantees and no copperfastened provisions in the text of the proposed legislation.The purpose of the Bill is to make detailed provision through which the education of children who have special educational needs as a result of disabilities can be guaranteed as a right enforceable in law. This right is already enshrined in the Constitution. I shall come to section 12 later. There are difficulties in allowing these rights to be implemented without the allocation of resources. That is the reason I say the Bill is not rights based, at least not to the extent that matters, because it is not resource guaranteed. It is more of wish list. We live in an Internet society and we are trying to get children in schools to use computers more. If one goes to Amazon, one always sees a wish list. In that context, the Bill could be described also as a wish list, because  without the money to back it up that is all it will ever be. The provisions are welcome but they need tweaking. My colleague, Green Party justice spokesperson, Deputy Cuffe, will speak more about the rights-based legislation at a later date. Other Deputies and I will examine the Bill, section by section, at the Select Committee on Education and Science. Unlike Deputy O'Sullivan, I do not need half an hour to deal with the intricacies of the Bill.

I wish to deal with some aspects of the Bill which will be debated on Committee Stage. If we are to aspire as a democratic society to equal citizenship we need to examine the education of our citizens, particularly those with special education needs. Section 1 contains the definitions of "child with special educational needs" and "educational disability". I will not repeat what other speakers have said but already we are running into difficulties because a huge range of educational disabilities are not covered under this definition. I welcome the Minister's statement about an amendment to include dyslexia. I hope it will be included in the wording of the Bill as many educational disabilities are not, such as all the autism spectrum disorders which need also to be clearly defined.Sections 3, 4, 5 and 7 which concern parent and principal involvement are of concern to me and a number of others. In section 3 there is no provision for the child and the family to have access to independent opinion. There is no provision to allow parents to be involved in consultation straight away. Groups such as the Federation for Voluntary Bodies and parents associations welcome the sections but consider they are too weak. In terms of amendments to the plan, parental involvement should be crucial at every stage of the process. Some groups propose that the wording in all of these sections be amended to ensure that parents are identified as essential members of the team.The principal, as Deputy Crowe said, is a busy person and in some cases does two jobs. Therefore it is difficult to expect the principal to have the time, let alone the knowledge or training, to carry out assessments. The key point in regard to section 5 is that a school principal does not necessarily have the qualifications or expertise to decide who needs assistance. Therefore, he or she would not be the appropriate person to determine who should make up the team. Sometimes the principal might be the primary person but that would depend on the principal's expertise and aptitude. The provisions in this context should be widened substantially.Deputy Enright raised the issue of unmet resources as things stand. She mentioned NEPS and therapists. Section 4 places an obligation on  the health board or the council to cause assessment to commence within three months. Is there any provision included in the Bill to ensure that happens? It should be written into it in order to make it a rights-based Bill. In practice, will the health boards be able to deliver on their commitments, as outlined in section 4? Someone alluded earlier to the Minister saying this Bill could be implemented within five years. However, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, has spoken of ten or 15 years depending on the specialised staffing required. If it takes that long, the Bill will not work but will remain a wish list. The only way this Bill can be made wholly rights based is to include an obligation in the Act to ensure this provision is made.Section 6 of the Bill refers to the provision of services. The National Federation of Voluntary Bodies has queries concerning the exact roles of the Departments of Health and Children, and Education and Science. It suggests the transfer of support services to the Department of Education and Science from the Department of Health and Children in order to facilitate better collaboration between staff. Speech and language therapists would therefore work as part of the education system rather than with the health boards. This would lead to a more effective, co-ordinated and team-based approach. If the services are driven by the education sector the Bill will work more effectively. If support staff in a school, or sharing schools, are employed by the Department of Education and Science, greater opportunities are created because therapy programmes can be integrated into the child's daily activities.Another concern relates to section 9. The Down's syndrome group says this would create the ghettoisation of schools. Certain groups want their children to be integrated but other groups such as representative bodies for the deaf say they need special schools, which should be facilitated. Section 9 does not create any great distinction. The same is true of section 8 with regard to education plans. There is not enough emphasis on the individual needs of the student.Section 12 was mentioned already and concerns resources and the involvement of the Minister for Finance. I ask that the wording of the Bill include measures which will allow money to be spent whether or not the budget is allocated to the Department of Education and Science. This would place an onus on the Minister for Finance to provide the funds.I agree with other speakers that there has been insufficient reference to pre-school education in the Bill. It is also shocking and incomprehensible that access to education is cut off after the age of 18. We should be providing a life-long learning system. The Department of Health and Children should not have the responsibility for persons needing educational services after the age of 18 and this should be enshrined within the legislation.
#PeterKellyFF	unknown-#PeterKellyFF-party	unknown-#PeterKellyFF-dob	unknown-#PeterKellyFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	145	In July 2003, the Minister for Edu cation and Science published the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill. This Bill will provide a statutory guarantee of education services for people with a disability by providing a statutory framework within which the education of children and people who have special educational needs because of disabilities can be guaranteed as a right enforceable in law. The Bill sets out a range of services which must be provided, including assessments, individual education plans and support services. It also provides for a process of mediation and appeals where needs are not met and provides a central role for parents in the education of their children. The Bill establishes the National Council for Special Education through which the Bill, when enacted, will be given effect.The Bill gives statutory force to a policy of integrated education. It provides that a child with special needs will be educated in an integrated setting unless this would not be in the best interests of the child or the effective provision of education for other children in the mainstream environment.The drawing up of education plans tailored to meet the educational needs of children with special educational needs is a key provision of the Bill. Through the planning process, disabilities can be identified, needs assessed, goals decided upon and progress monitored. Where a school principal believes that a child is not benefiting from the regular education programme, he or she must take steps to meet the child's educational needs. If these measures do not meet the child's needs, the principal must consult with the parents and arrange for an assessment of the child. This must be carried out as soon as possible but not later than three months from the time the principal formed his or her opinion about the child. Where an assessment establishes that a child does have an educational disability, the principal must ensure an individual education plan is prepared within one month and that, in preparing the plan, the parents, special educational needs organiser and any other relevant person is consulted.It is intended that a school would draw up the plan where the child's needs are relatively uncomplicated. The Bill provides for a formal planning process to be undertaken by the National Council for Special Education for children whose needs are more complex. In the case of a plan prepared by the council, a special educational needs organiser will convene a team of people which must include the child's parents and may also involve the child, the school principal and a psychologist. Where the plan focuses on educational needs, it must also have regard to any other needs identified in the child's assessment and must be consistent with those needs.Education plans will be reviewed at regular intervals. Schools have the primary responsibility for this and must report on it to the child's parents and the council. If the special educational needs organiser takes the view that the child is significantly failing to achieve the goals in the plan, the team may be reconvened to review, and  where necessary amend, the plan. In preparing or reviewing a plan, the school or special educational needs organiser must have regard to the educational provision which will be required for the child on becoming an adult and must take steps to enable the child to progress to further education and training. When this occurs in the context of a child who will turn 18 in the following year, an assessment must be made of how he or she has achieved his or her goals. If those goals have not been met, the effect of this on the child's development will be assessed and, where appropriate, measures will be included in the plan to address those effects. Parents may also seek a review of the plan in certain circumstances. If this request is denied they can appeal that decision to the council.The Bill provides for a range of duties for schools in respect of children with special educational needs. These duties are additional to those already imposed on schools such as the equal status legislation and the Education Act. A school must respect the principle of integrated education, ensure that parents are consulted regarding their child's needs, co-operate with the council, ensure that teachers are aware of the special educational needs of the students and the importance of identifying children with those needs – and inculcate in students an awareness of the needs of people with disabilities. The council will have power to designate a school where a child with special educational needs is to attend and the school will be obliged to enrol the child. This is aimed at the practice in some schools of seeking to avoid the admission of children with educational disabilities.The Bill provides that parents may appeal to an independent appeals board against any statement of description of their child's special educational needs or any other statement or description appearing in the education plan which they consider incorrect or inadequate to meet the child's special educational needs. It is likely, however, that many parents will wish to pursue a less formal approach to a review of decisions. For that reason the Bill provides that the appeals board must ensure that the parties to an appeal are assisted to reach agreement. On hearing an appeal, the board may give direction to the council or a school, which it must implement, or it may dismiss the appeal.The Bill establishes the National Council for Special Education as the body charged with ensuring that the legislation as enacted will be given full effect. Its specific duties include the dissemination to schools and parents of information relating to best practice for the education of children with disabilities. the co-ordination of special education in conjunction with schools and health boards and planning for the integration of children with special needs in a mainstream setting. The NCSE will monitor progress of students with special educational needs and review the resources needed in this area. It will have responsibility to conduct research in the area of  special education and provide relevant advice and information to the Minister. The council will also review the provision made by adults with disabilities to avail of higher adult and continuing education.The Bill provides for the structure of the board and for a consultative forum which will be drawn from the education partners. The forum will provide advice to the council. The provision of appropriate education services to children with special needs crucially involves close co-operation and co-ordination of activities between education and health authorities. The health boards have a key role to play in providing support services such as the various therapies which the people concerned need and also because children and others with disabilities often reside in health board facilities or attend day care centres.It is intended the Bill will resolve current difficulties regarding co-ordination. In the case of a school-going child, the council must provide him or her with the services identified in the education plan as being necessary for the child to participate in, and benefit from, education. If the child is not of school-going age this responsibility rests with the health board. If the council or health board believes that the other body can provide the services more effectively, it must inform the other body of this, and that body must then ensure that provision. If a dispute arises between the council and the health board this will be resolved by the appeals board. In addition, the council will be empowered to request a health board to take specific actions where it considers this to be necessary for the preparation or implementation on an adequate education plan, or necessarily more generally, to assist the council in carrying out its functions. Prior consultation with a health board is required before a request is made to it. A health board must comply with a request unless, in its view, the assistance requested is not necessary, taking the action would not be consistent with its functions or it would not be reasonable to comply, having regard to its resources. If the health board decides that it cannot comply with a request of the council, then it must state its reasons and the council may appeal the refusal to comply.On hearing an appeal, the appeals board may direct the health board to comply with the request or it may dismiss the appeal. The purpose of the Bill is to provide a new framework for the assessment and provision of the needs of children with educational disabilities.The Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill 2003 imposes a statutory duty on the Minister for Education and Science and the Minister for Health and Children to make resources available to schools for the provision of adequate and appropriate education to children with special educational needs. These resources are voted to the individual Departments by the Oireachtas, which is the normal procedure governing public finances and expenditure by Government  Departments. In making policy determinations, the general principle that applies is that there is equitable treatment of all children in resource decision allocations. It is the object of the Bill that it will lead to the creation of an education system which gives to children with disabilities the same opportunity for development through education as is given to children who do not have disabilities.The purpose of the Bill is to provide a statutory framework within which the education of children who have special educational needs can be guaranteed as a right enforceable in law. The definition of disability in section 1 is intentionally broad in order to be inconclusive. I welcome the fact that children with dyslexia will enjoy the protections conferred by this Bill, once it becomes law. I welcome the good work being done by the Longford dyslexia group which has lobbied me on numerous occasions and asked me to bring its views to the attention of the Minister, which I have done and will continue to do in the future.The purpose of legislating for those who are deaf is to ensure that they have access to a range of services which must be provided, including assessments, individual education plans, and support services. The Department's capacity to respond to individual children with special needs was limited until a Government decision in October 1998 gave children assessed as having special educational needs in primary schools an automatic entitlement to an appropriate response. Since then the number of resource teachers in the primary system has increased from approximately 100 to over 2,300 and the number of special needs assistants has grown from approximately 300 to almost 5,500 full-time and part-time posts.The nature and level of the educational response is based on the professionally assessed needs of each individual child. The Department's policy is to ensure the maximum possible integration of pupils with special needs into ordinary mainstream schools. Those who have been assessed as having special educational needs have access to a range of special support services, from special schools dedicated to particular disability groups, through special classes and units attached to ordinary schools, to placement on an integrated basis in ordinary schools with special back-up supports. The response will normally take the form of resource teacher or special needs assistant support, or both, depending on the level of need involved. In some cases, the level of special need involved may be such as to require placement in a special class attached to a mainstream school. The number of special classes has grown from 350 to more than 500 since 1998. Each such class is dedicated to a particular disability category and operates at a significantly reduced pupil-teacher ratio. Pupils attending these special classes also attract special increased rates of capitation funding.In exceptional cases the Department considers an educational placement outside the country as  being necessary. In general, where children have significant care needs these are met in an educational context through the special needs assistant service. The Minister is taking steps to ensure that service delivery is optimised. A key development in this regard has been the decision to establish the national council for special education, which will have a local area presence and will play a key role in the development and delivery of services for persons with special needs. It will also have a research and advisory role and will establish expert groups to address particular areas of special needs provision. It will also establish a consultative forum to facilitate inputs from the education partners and other interested parties.The council has been established, a chief executive has been appointed and arrangements for the recruitment of staff are in hand. A further step will involve the development of a weighted system of allocations for special needs teaching resources, with effect from the 2004-2005 school year. Schools will receive an annual allocation based on the predicted incidence of special educational needs within different size school populations. Such a system would obviate the need for individual applications for resources in respect of individual pupils other than in the most exceptional circumstances. I commend the Bill to this House.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	146	I am glad to see this Bill before the House today. The real test of this Bill will come in about three years time. What does it mean for people with disability and special needs? Will they be better off when it is passed through the House, or will it give the Minister's powers to the National Council for Special Education? Is that what this Bill is about? Whatever Minister is in charge is responsible to this House and to the people. I am tired of seeing powers removed from this House every day and given to special agencies such as the National Roads Authority. If I table a question about someone with special needs who has a problem, I will be told that the Minister has no responsibility and it is a matter for the National Council for Special Education.The Minister for Education and Science has total responsibility in this House and for people with disabilities. This year, particularly in September when the schools reopened, I heard one horror story after another. Many parents contacted me to express concern about what would happen to their children in the future. It was sad to see some of them genuinely upset and disturbed, wondering what would be done. Some of their children had not been assessed, others were told that there were no school places for them, and they saw no future for their children. I hope this Bill will remedy this in order that I can tell these parents that their children have a future. The biggest single challenge for this House and the country is whether we will commit ourselves to the provision of resources for services for people with disabilities? I hope that this House,  this Government, and its successor, will have the courage to put the necessary resources and commitment in place, particularly for children with disabilities. If our society cannot support children with disabilities and their families who go through difficult times, it is a very poor society.This Bill has many fine qualities but it lacks a real financial commitment. It is all about money and resources, putting resource teachers and special needs assistants in place. The Government must be committed to this. I am committed to it and I hope that every Member of this House is too because for far too long people with disabilities were treated as second class citizens. I hope that when this Bill is passed, the necessary resources will be put in place for these children and their parents, who have suffered so much. I am hoping that its provisions will be extended on Committee Stage.I compliment the parents who have shown great love and commitment and, in some cases, have tried to educate their loved ones themselves with their other family members. They have given these children loyal support when the State has failed to deal with the problem of disability. I hope the required resources will be put in place following the forthcoming budget and that there will be a major improvement in services, in school places, the teaching profession, and whatever else is needed to ensure that next year people with disabilities can confirm the Bill is working. If that happens, I will be the first to congratulate the Minister, whoever he or she may be. I welcome the provision in the Bill for an appeals mechanism. Sometimes parents become frustrated with decisions made for them. Who is in a better position than the mothers and fathers of children with special needs to know what those children are capable of doing, having been with them 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 52 weeks of the year? I am glad there will be a mechanism to enable them to make an appeal to an independent body which will listen to them. It is a fundamental requirement that these people be heard and they are entitled to have their concerns and fears taken on board.In the context of special needs, the Government gave major commitments before the last general election, many of which, I regret to say, were broken. Last September many parents were disturbed and upset to find that the personnel and resources which were to be put in place had not been provided. I hope this Bill will deal with that situation and that further cases will not have to be brought to the courts by the parents concerned. Such matters should not have to be settled in the courts. It is the responsibility of this House to provide for the necessary personnel and financial resources.It is not acceptable that parents, including those of children with autism, should have to engage in fundraising activities to enable their loved ones to be brought to America or elsewhere, in the absence of the required facilities in this country. I hope those days are over and that  the Department of Education and Science will ensure that every child in this State, particularly those with disability, will be treated equally, in accordance with the Constitution. They must be given every possible help, support and facility which can be put in place for them. Money must not be an obstacle. Money can be found for whatever crisis arises in this country. If it is necessary to raid the funds of other Departments to enable the resources to be put in place, I do not believe anybody will object to allowing a child with a disability to have an opportunity of education in a mainstream school in a similar manner to other children.There should be no repetition of past experience whereby school principals were placed in the position of being unable to provide a place for a child due to lack of staff and resources. I hope those days are over. It is most unfair that principals should have to make such decisions, perhaps in cases where children from the same family are already attending the school in question. Those decisions should be taken out of the hands of principals, who already have a difficult task without that imposition. I expect that such decisions will, in future, be a matter for the National Council for Special Education, in terms of informing schools as to the resources being put in place. I hope that happens without delay.I sincerely hope this Bill will work. Most public representatives will know of families who have children with some disability or special need and will be aware of the difficulties which such families experience in terms of the financial cost of trying to do what is best for their children. I hope the State can respond effectively, that this Bill will work and that it is not just an exercise in diverting responsibility from the Minister for Education and Science. I hope it will deal with the position of special needs children and those for whom we have neglected to make provision since the foundation of the State. I hope their time has now come. No longer should people in wheelchairs have to lobby for their rights outside the gates of these Houses, in all weathers. They should now be in a position to make their case to the new board and I hope their rights will be protected in this Bill.My party colleague, Deputy Enright, has pointed out some difficulties in the Bill, which she intends to address on Committee Stage. This is not a matter of politics as between Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, the Labour Party, or Sinn Féin. It is about a section of society which needs protection. It involves people who, in some cases, are unable to fight for their rights. As public representatives, it is our duty to take those concerns on board on Committee Stage of this Bill and do what is right for the people involved. I ask the Minister and his Department not to regard this as a money issue but, rather, to approach it on the basis of what is right for children and others with disabilities. I hope we will have the courage and commit ment to ensure that the funding and resources are put in place.This House is very good at providing legislation and giving directions, but the State is the worst provider in terms of implementing its legislation by putting the necessary personnel and financial resources in place. I wish to see this Bill working effectively so that those who stand to gain from it can say "At last, there is something there for us; the time has come when we are properly represented in the Houses of Parliament."  I hope the Bill works for these people.
#JohnDennehy	unknown-#JohnDennehy-party	unknown-#JohnDennehy-dob	unknown-#JohnDennehy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	147	I join with other speakers in welcoming this Bill. As Deputy Ring and others have said, it is crucially important legislation. I will not say it is long overdue because the Minister has been working on it for about a year and a half. That time was well used in terms of extensive consultation with many of the groups to which Deputy Ring referred. As the Minister stated in his opening address, provision for those with special needs is already established in legislation such as the Equal Status Act and the Education Act 1998. Nevertheless, this Bill was badly needed to spell out very clearly the finer points as to what will be provided in each category and facility. For instance, one of the first and most important steps is the assessment procedure to evaluate the needs of each pupil. Obviously, the evaluation process can only be effective if the necessary personnel are in place to implement it. That is an area in which we have been remiss in the past.The extent to which parents are involved almost represents a new strategy. Such involvement from the very beginning is, of course, crucially important. The requirement for schools to provide an education plan will eliminate the ad hoc approach which has applied in past years, including the discretion which was given to schools to avoid accepting pupils, even from within their own catchment area. Deputy Ring referred to a possible lack of facilities, but it often involves somewhat more than that – there may be a wish to avoid certain difficulties, as perceived by the school concerned. I am glad that option is being specifically removed.The establishment of the National Council for Special Education on a statutory basis is a very important step. Deputy Ring stated that this is about resources, although he backed off then by saying it is not about money – a contradiction. It is about the provision of resources and I am proud of the difference between the situation as it exists now compared to the situation before 1998, although a huge amount remains to be done.No one was listening to those with disabilities until they formed lobby groups, got organised and brought their campaign to the Oireachtas. The multiplicity of voices represented should be heard and the lobby groups welcomed. Anyone with a special need is entitled to come to make his or her case and to present that need at first hand.For those of us who worked for years as advocates for those requiring special training or education facilities, the major stumbling block was the lack of clarity on who would provide the service. There was an ongoing battle between the Departments of Health and Children and Education and Science about which was responsible for provision of facilities. Unfortunately, the battle seemed to be based on which Department could avoid providing the service rather than which could take a lead.The Paul O'Donoghue case brought clarity to the issue and established that the Department of Education and Science has a binding obligation to provide for the needs of each pupil and the judgment in the appeal of the case helped to establish the right fully. There have been cases since to clear up aspects of the ruling for continuing education. This Bill, when enacted, should make it crystal clear what is required of the State and Departments in all areas of special education.The Minister's comments on the breakdown of responsibility between the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Education and Science concerned me but I am glad the council will have the right to instruct them to provide a specific service in a given area and to legislate that a health board must provide a particular service. That will bring the issue back to the decision makers because health boards have had discretion in service provision until now. I was a member of a health board for 25 years and I have seen people take the easy option and those with special educational needs were often left behind because they were a minority group.I compliment the Minister for introducing this Bill. There was a wide-ranging discussion of the legislation that is reflected in its contents. It is not often that a Minister confesses in his speech on Second Stage that there may be other issues to be dealt with and that he is open to advice on them. I will point out some areas that may need attention or that might cause difficulty for my constituents or others.I also pay tribute to those who spent years working, mainly in a voluntary capacity, to highlight the specific needs of pupils in different categories. Individual requirements will vary widely and those people have helped us to focus our ideas. The question of mainstream education access will always arise and thus it is critical that parents are involved and that they are not dictated to that a child must enter mainstream education.As a member of the Southern Health Board, I have worked with groups such as the Cork Autistic Association, Cork Parents and Friends of the Mentally Handicapped and others in Cork and Kerry. The Minister's directive to have schools inform their mainstream pupils about the special needs of some pupils was anticipated by the Cork Mental Health Association, which for 30 years has run an interschool debating competition on the topic of mental health and related issues. The association has done a magnificent job and has  included every school in Cork, enlightening tens of thousands of pupils about special needs and how to avoid discriminating against those with them. I have attended many of those debates, particularly as chairman of the health board or Lord Mayor of the city, and I presented some of the awards. It was always an eye opener for me to attend the debates because the students carried out research and came up with information that was new even to those in the Cork Mental Health Association, many of whom are employees of the Southern Health Board.Those voluntary groups were often pioneers in the campaign for the rights of those with special needs. In many instances they were fighting the establishment, especially when there was ignorance about the possibilities and benefits of special education and care. People are aware of those benefits now but they were not 20 years ago. There is still, however, a degree of ignorance about some special needs and the primary reason is that in many cases the needs are only now being identified or people are only now being diagnosed. Speakers have referred to dyslexia and the Minister stated in his opening speech that he is seeking advice on the matter, but there are other conditions that must be addressed. We must ensure the council will be prepared to respond rapidly to needs that arise such as dyspraxia or DCD. I was not aware of dyspraxia until eight months ago; it was pointed out to me when I attended meetings of the Cork Mental Health Association that there is a huge need for linkage between the Departments of Health and Children and Education and Science in this area.No condition is clearer than dyspraxia. The only pilot medical unit for the treatment of dyspraxia is based in St. Finbar's Hospital in Cork and it has been a success so far. The staff are small in number but do an excellent job. The major factor in that success is the involvement of all the children and parents through the Dyspraxia association. The good work of the parents of pupils who suffer from this condition must be harnessed and put to the best possible use. These volunteers are happy to meet parents and pupils. They already have a group in Galway, but they are happy to liaise with other groups around the country. We must harness and utilise such organisations as we have in other cases.The work done at St. Finbarr's Hospital will not be of maximum benefit if the schools, and specifically the teachers involved, are not fully aware of what is involved and required to fully educate the child. With this organisation, a psychologist will go to the schools and outline to the teachers what is required. The teacher will often respond that they noted such and such happening, but put it down to the child being awkward or awake at night. When it is explained to them what is needed, most teachers respond in a positive fashion. They need to be educated, as we all do, on the needs of these pupils.I will sound a word of caution to the Minister. It is only recently that we are catching up on the  diagnosis of ADD and other conditions. A couple of years ago, we institutionalised people who suffered from those conditions. If today we examined the prison population, we would find many prisoners with such mental health conditions. In our own families, we would have described some members as "hyper" or "awkward" and never thought of it as a mental condition or even a health issue. The Americans are a few years ahead of us in the identification of these conditions. However, we now must be geared to such advances in diagnosis. The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Dempsey, is to be complimented on his anticipation of a wider variation of needs in this area and on putting structures in place.Groups representing those with special needs have a tendency to tell us what the politicians intend to do rather than what they have done already. I understand the sentiment but, in the interest of everyone involved, it should be outlined where we have come from and what we are doing to add to the existing facilities.The Minister gave details of the massive changes that have occurred since 1998. I, as a Government Deputy, am particularly proud of those figures. It is easy to talk the talk in the House, but to get the work done is a different matter. I have many years' experience at health board and Dáil level of acting as an advocate for special needs groups. I have sponsored many proposals at both levels. Invariably, the impediment to success was lack of finance and resources. It came down to the wherewithal to do the job. As late as 1996, I was involved in a campaign in Cork city for escorts on the buses in the schools transport service. The campaign commenced after an allegation of serious assault on one bus. The rainbow-hued Government of the time issued a point-blank refusal for this provision. However, the Minister has stated that there is now an escort on every such bus. The last time I inquired about the cost, it was €4.4 million.There are statistics and lies but one cannot argue with facts. At the beginning of 1998, there were 104 special resource teachers supporting primary school pupils with special needs. Currently, there are more than 2,500. That is walking the walk as well as talking the talk. We, on this side of the House, take the credit for this. There is much more to be done, as we said in our election posters and we accept—

Deputy O'Sullivan, more than others, is vocal and consistent on the matter. However, the number of full-time special needs assistants has increased from 300 to 3,800, with a further 1,000 employed part-time. That is real and essential progress. The number of remedial teachers in learning support has increased to 1,531 with part-time tuition for services with children with special needs. These are big figures with big expenditure. I agree with Deputy Ring that when it comes to funding for special needs versus funding for another project, most people will go with the former.The special schools transport system was a service about which I had concerns. When I was involved in the campaign, I got a blank refusal from the Department. I recall one Fine Gael Deputy, a Minister of State at the time, giving excuses on a radio programme on the issue when I was making an appeal for funding. We have now resolved the matter.The Minister, again in a progressive move of which I am proud, turned the sod on a school for therapies in NUI Cork only last week. Each of us is aware of the shortage of speech therapists and so on. The only way to deal with it is by producing more graduates in speech, physical and other therapies. The role of the health boards vis-à-vis the Department of Education and Science and the Department of Health and Children is of crucial importance.This Bill has my total support. I welcome it unreservedly and commend it to the House.

However, I wish to take up the point Deputy Dennehy raised on escorts on special school buses. A considerable number of the school transport fleet vehicles for those with disabilities do not have escorts. Many of the schools cannot recruit escorts for these services because the Department is paying peanuts.The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Education and Science pursued the then Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy O'Dea, until sanction and approval was given for escorts and harnesses on special school buses. As Deputy Dennehy has such influence with the Minister for Education and Science, he might ensure that the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Education and Science 1999 report on school transport be properly implemented by the Department. In the past, some pupils with physical disabilities attended schools with no facilities for the disabled. However, the school transport service would only bring them to the nearest school. This scenario effectively negated students' rights to the special schools transport service. Thanks to the report I produced on behalf of the all-party Oireachtas committee, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, implemented that measure.

Maybe Deputy Dennehy might use his good offices to ensure that report does not gather dust and is implemented before fatalities occur as a result of the current school transport fleet. Deputy Dennehy might ensure that sufficient resources are provided so that we can pay escorts to ensure the policy proposed by the Department of Education and Science is implemented and that every child being brought to a special educational school by the school transport system would have an escort, which is not the case today. Both the Minister and Deputy Dennehy have been inaccurate in what they have told the House today.For generations a set of physical and intellectual characteristics outside the norm denied countless Irish men and women their basic civil and human rights. Those characteristics established more what they could not do than what they could do. Thankfully in today's society discrimination against those who are different is reducing. This is thanks to equality legislation, the vast majority of which is derived from the EU and the huge information and rights campaign conducted by disabilities' lobbies, which resulted in publications like the 1996 report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities.People with disabilities are only demanding their basic rights to adequate health care, access to the necessary educational and other facilities and, above all, equality of treatment. The Government has equivocated on this matter for far too long. This is the European Year of People with Disabilities and earlier this year Ireland hosted the Special Olympics World Summer Games, which was a showcase of excellence, ability and extraordinary talent. We must ensure this was not a once-off flagship occasion, which made us feel good about ourselves. It must herald a new era of inclusiveness in sport, leisure and all other aspects of life involving people with disabilities.In the Taoiseach's address at the Special Olympics World Summer Games, he stated that watching the athletes compete left many of us feel personally humbled by their courage, spirit and sheer enjoyment in using skills they have learnt and developed. This is the leader of a Government that does not want to see these same children learn in equality with their peers. Despite the euphoria surrounding the Special Olympics World Summer Games, the allocation of special needs assistants in schools has been cut back. While the Minister for Education and Science was announcing €42 million for students from disadvantaged backgrounds, he was also instructing his Department to make cutbacks to the most vulnerable area of education by reinterpreting the criteria for the allocation of special needs assistants.A protest on a number of issues that affect  people with disabilities within the education system will take place next week at the special needs section of the Department of Education and Science in Athlone. One third of special needs assistants have been cut and there are plans to cut a further one third. Resource teaching hours have been cut, as have home tuition grants. Funding to special needs schools and special needs classes have been cut. Funding for special education for adults has been cut completely. The Minister for Education and Science is considering reintroducing college fees through the back door. He has taken resources from special education and reallocated them into third level education. While the Minister looks as if he is addressing the issues of disadvantage, those who are most disadvantaged in our society are footing the bill for this.This Bill gives us the opportunity to debate special educational issues. Sadly, having heard the speeches of the Minister and others, including my constituency colleague, Deputy Kelly, I have heard nothing but "ifs", "buts", "maybes" and "subject to the resources being available". This is not rights-based legislation. This is legislation on the basis of resources only being provided at the whim of the Minister for Finance. Like every other child in the State, those with disabilities should have a basic right to education, but this legislation will not provide it. Everything is solely dependent on the resources of the Minister for Finance. The Government has a track record of taking money from special needs and putting it into another area of education. It is evident what is the priority of the Government on this issue.I would like to address a number of points the Minister made in his speech. He stated that children with special needs attending mainstream schools might require access to special equipment to assist them in their education. However, they do not get that equipment at present. Children with special needs in mainstream education are being disadvantaged because the basic resources are not being made available to them. The principals of all schools with a child with special needs have to fight tooth and nail for resources for such children. We do not even have equality of treatment at present between children with disabilities going into the mainstream educational system and those going into special schools. Nothing in this legislation encourages me to believe that will change. Those children who want to go into the integrated system, which the Minister promoted during his speech, are not being given the same opportunities and access to the same resources as children in special needs schools.The Minister also said the Bill provides strict time limits on the assessments and educational plans. If this happens, it will be the first time in the history of the State that a time limit has been implemented. This has never happened in any area, including An Bord Pleanála, which is supposed to have strict time limits. In 1996 an Act concerning payments to farmers was passed, whose deadlines were not adhered to. I do not believe the strict guidelines and time limits in this  case will be adhered to. It will be used as an excuse not to commit the resources for particular children.In his speech the Minister said:An assessment arranged by a principal must be carried out as soon as possible, but no later than three months from the time the principal formed his or her opinion about the child. Where an assessment establishes that a child has an educational disability, the principal must ensure an individual education plan is prepared within one month.How long will it take a principal to form an opinion? If a child starts school in September and the principal only forms an opinion in June, it will be the following September or October before anything is put in place because everything closes down during the summer months. It could easily take a further 12 months before resources are provided for such a child, which is two years after the child first enters the school.The vast majority of principals are exceptional people and very proactive in addressing issues such as this.There is a very small minority, but a minority nonetheless, of teachers and principals who do not take this proactive approach. If one was waiting for them to form an opinion the child could go through the education system without any resources being put in place and be completely ignored. In many instances when parents of children with dyslexia have brought this to the attention of some teachers, the reaction has been that the parent is merely imagining that the child has difficulty with reading skills. The problem is being brushed under the carpet. I do not think the element of strict criteria in this legislation will ensure that the rights of children are protected.The Minister also spoke about section 12 which creates a statutory duty on the Minister for Education and Science and the Minister for Health and Children to make those resources available. However, all spending is subject to the availability of resources and the agreement of the Minister for Finance. The Minister says this is a political reality. The reality is that under the Constitution every child must be treated equally and must be given the opportunity to receive an education and have the same entitlement to that education whether he or she is an intellectually disabled child, a child with a physical disability or an able-bodied child. It should not make any difference but yet in this case it is subject to the Minister for Finance loosening the purse strings. It puts commitment on the long finger.There is a turf war between the Department of Education and Science and the Department of Health and Children. As a public representative the one query I dread is when a parent of a disabled child comes to me looking for basic resources. I know I am guaranteed at least a 12-month battle just to get something very basic for them. The Department of Education and Science  will say it is not its responsibility. The Department of Health and Children says it is the responsibility of the health board. The health board says it does not have the resources and refers the inquiry back to the Department of Health and Children who in turn passes it on again. One is sent from Billy to Jack and everyone seems to be passing the buck.Even if it is a health issue and if one happens to live in a constituency such as mine which borders on a number of health board areas, then the health boards pass the buck.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	156	The Taoiseach and I attended the European Council meeting in Brussels on 16 to 17 October 2003. We were accompanied by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs with responsibility for European Affairs, Deputy Roche. The conclusions of the European Council have been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.Our meeting last week allowed the Heads of State or Government of the European Union to: take stock of developments in the Intergovernmental Conference; review trends in the European economy and appoint a new Governor of the European Central Bank; take steps to ensure that our borders are not exploited by traffickers; and review a range of external relations issues.I thank the Italian Presidency for organising a successful meeting. I am happy to say that the ground work being laid by the Presidency will enable us to further advance the agenda of the European Union. A meeting of the Intergovernmental Conference preceded the European Council meeting proper and I will deal with that issue first.The Intergovernmental Conference flows from the work of the European Convention. On 15 October this House had a first debate on the draft constitutional treaty produced by the European Convention, therefore I will not go over that ground on this occasion. I welcome the opportunity to bring Deputies up to date on what is happening in the Intergovernmental Conference. I emphasise the Government's commitment to keeping this House and the general public informed of developments in the Intergovernmental Conference.We are at a relatively early stage in the Intergovernmental Conference deliberations. Last week's meeting at the level of Heads of State or Government was the first at that level since the opening of the Intergovernmental Conference on 4 October. In addition, there have been two meetings of the Intergovernmental Conference at Foreign Minister level. Ireland supports the ambition of the Italian Presidency to complete negotiations by the end of the year. We will of  course be prepared to take over and advance any work that may fall to us from January onwards.Last week's discussion focused on institutional issues. The topics covered included the Commission, the European Council, the Presidency, qualified majority voting and the European Parliament. Member states set out known positions on these issues. There was also an informal discussion by Heads of State or Government on the defence provisions of the draft constitutional treaty.The future composition of the Commission was a main topic of discussion. It is clear that there is a range of views on this matter. Ireland and a number of other countries indicated general satisfaction with the European Convention outcome, subject to some clarification. Ireland would welcome a move to one Commissioner per member state if this can be achieved on the basis of strict equality. Several participants, in particular the accession countries, supported one Commissioner per member state. Five of the larger member states and the Benelux countries indicated support for the Convention outcome. The retention of guaranteed equality in the appointment of the Commission remains of fundamental importance to Ireland and several other smaller states.It is now generally accepted that a post of European Council President will be created. The issue is how the role will be defined and how the individual appointed to the post will make it work in practice. Ireland believes that the current text is broadly balanced. There is also more work to be done on how a Presidency will be organised in the future in the various Council formations, with significant support for team presidencies.The definition of qualified majority voting remains a difficult issue. At the Intergovernmental Conference the known positions of those seeking to change the Convention outcome were reiterated. Ireland's point of view is that we would be happy to keep to the arrangements agreed at Nice, but we can also support the Convention outcome. The minimum number of seats allocated in the European Parliament is an issue of particular concern to the smallest members of the Intergovernmental Conference and Ireland is sympathetic to their concerns.It is generally accepted at this stage that there will be a European Union "double-hatted" Foreign Minister who will be a member of the Council and of the Commission. The details remain to be worked out. We did not expect an outcome last week that would resolve differences on these institutional issues. Institutional arrangements tend to be, understandably, the most intractable part of Intergovernmental Conference negotiations with agreement often only emerging towards the end. However, the session was useful in further clarifying positions. Consensus in favour of continuing to legislate in the Council's sectoral formats rather than in a single legislative Council, as proposed by the Convention, has been reached.The Presidency has signalled its intention to  conduct consultations across a range of issues with participants before the next meeting of the Intergovernmental Conference at Heads of State or Government level. In this regard, an additional meeting in November of the Intergovernmental Conference at this level has not been ruled out. At that stage the possible lines for agreement may begin to emerge. Further meetings at Foreign Minister level are scheduled. Perhaps of most significance from our meeting last week was the outcome of the informal discussions among Heads of State or Government on security and defence issues, an area of particular sensitivity for everyone. Together with a number of partners we made clear our view that the proposals on security and defence in the draft treaty required further consideration by the Intergovernmental Conference and this was generally accepted.As I have stated in the House previously we wish to see the Union equipped to make an effective contribution on the international stage while respecting the values and traditions of the member states. Existing arrangements in the ESDP are based on openness, inclusivity and accountability to all member states. We firmly believe that this should be the case for any new arrangements in the security and defence area. A large number of member states share these concerns as was clear from the discussions in Brussels last week. As regards common defence, our position is very clear: we cannot participate in an EU common defence unless the people decide so in a referendum. The Intergovernmental Conference will return to these important issues in detail next month and the Presidency has undertaken to redraft the defence articles in the draft constitutional treaty in light of the points made at the dinner discussion on 16 October.The European Council meeting which followed the Intergovernmental Conference concentrated on three areas – the European economy, justice and home affairs and external relations. On the economy, the European Council noted that after a period of some uncertainty, there are some positive signals emerging in Europe. An improvement in the international economic environment, low levels of inflation, stabilised oil prices and better conditions in the financial markets have been key factors behind a pick-up in economic activity. However, the situation remains fragile and in this context economic polices should continue to be aimed at job creation and sustainable growth and at enhancing economic and social cohesion. The European Council focused, in particular, on ways of stimulating growth by increasing investment in transport, energy and telecommunications networks and by underlining the need for further structural reform. I welcome its focus on re-launching the European economy. Action to boost growth will create more job opportunities and bring greater prosperity to the people of Europe. I also welcome, in this regard, the European Council's endorsement of the principles of the growth initiative which seeks to increase investment by improving the mechan isms for financing growth-related projects. This initiative aims to exploit the resources of the European Investment Bank more effectively, both to increase the funding available for growth related projects and to leverage greater private funding of infrastructure.The European Council recognises that building modern, efficient transport infrastructures is critical to boosting growth and maximising the potential of the internal market. It recommended, in this regard, that particular attention should be given to proposals on priority projects for trans-European transport networks. In this context the Council suggested that the possibility of a higher rate of Community co-financing of such networks might be explored.The European Council also considers that the completion of an integrated market for electricity and gas in an enlarged Europe would give a vital impetus to growth through ensuring security of supply and promoting competitiveness. Equally, it views the development of telecommunications networks as being of key importance in promoting growth and, in this regard, considered the availability and promotion of a broadband network to be particularly necessary for the European knowledge-based economy. Viewing innovation, research and development and investment in human capital as crucial to Europe's growth potential, it reaffirmed the importance of action to mobilise investment and put the right regulatory conditions in place.The European Council's focus on growth was complemented by its corresponding recognition of the importance of building a more competitive European economy. It reiterated the need to eliminate remaining barriers to the completion of the internal market, particularly in the area of services, which now account for 70% of the growth in the EU economy and in job opportunities. Completion of the internal market for services will also be an important issue for our Presidency. It was also recognised that further action to enhance environmental protection and sustainability will contribute to growth.The European Council reiterated that action to stimulate growth and boost competitiveness needed to be accompanied by effective social policies and a continuing focus on job creation. It made particular reference, in this regard, to the demographic challenge currently faced by the European Union and the need to secure the long-term sustainability of pension systems. While the formulation of policy on pensions remains the responsibility of member states, the European Council considered that certain benefits could accrue from reinforcing open co-ordination in this area.The issue of growth will be reviewed and concrete proposals advanced within the context of the annual review of the Lisbon strategy at the Spring European Council during our Presidency next March. The Lisbon strategy aims to make the European Union the most competitive econ omy in the world by 2010. The current challenge is to maintain the pace of sometimes deep-rooted reform across a wide ranging agenda encompassing economic, social and environmental renewal.The Irish Presidency will have the task of bringing greater coherence to this broad-based set of issues at the Spring European Council and of ensuring the smooth integration of the new member states into this process. Our key priority will be to develop an economic climate conducive to sustainable growth and to the creation of high quality employment in the interests of promoting greater social cohesion throughout Europe. Successful implementation of key aspects of the Lisbon strategy will bring concrete benefits to the people of Europe in terms of better services, more prosperity and greater opportunities for business expansion. We are conscious that the decisions we take over the next year will be fundamentally important to Europe's economic future.The European Council in Brussels last week also addressed the need to effectively manage the European Union's common borders, with a view to enhancing the fight against illegal immigration and the trafficking of human beings. The European Union is committed to the reception and integration of legal immigrants. In this regard, the European Council noted proposals for the creation of a border management agency and the development of a re-admission policy. In addition, the Commission has initiated a study on the relationship between legal and illegal immigration and member states were invited to co-operate fully with this study.In the area of external relations the European Council addressed a broad range of issues, including Iraq, the Middle East and the WTO. It welcomed the unanimous adoption of United Nations Resolution 1511 on 16 October in regard to Iraq. The conclusions set out the ingredients for a successful outcome in Iraq, which are: An adequate security environment; a strong and vital role for the United Nations; a realistic schedule for handing over political responsibility to the Iraqi people; and, the setting up of a transparent multilateral donor fund to channel support from the international community.The High Representative, Javier Solana, and the Commission have been asked to elaborate a medium-term strategy for the European Union's relations with Iraq. They will report by next March and, as we hold the Presidency, we will have the role of advancing work in this area. The Council reiterated its commitment to the road map for the Middle East. It strongly condemned suicide and terrorist attacks and called on Israel to abstain from punitive measures including extra-judicial killings.The European Council regretted the unsuccessful outcome of the World Trade Organisation talks in Cancun. However, it stressed the European Union's continuing commitment to multilat eralism and to an early resumption of the Doha Development talks.Following the European Council meeting, I accompanied the Taoiseach to a bilateral meeting with the Prime Minister of Luxembourg, Jean-Claude Juncker. Discussions covered a range of issues on the European Union agenda including Ireland's Presidency priorities.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	157	I wish to share time with Deputy Gay Mitchell. Last week's summit marked another important step towards the creation of a constitutional treaty for the European Union. While some progress was made on the treaty, several of the crunch issues have yet to be decided. A resolution of at least some of these residual issues may be possible during Ireland's upcoming Presidency of the European Union.The Fine Gael Party is broadly satisfied with the outcome of the work of the Convention on the Future of Europe. I pay tribute to the Irish representatives on the Convention for their work, in particular, the Irish member of the Praesidium, Deputy John Bruton, whom I know worked well with Deputy Roche in his capacity as Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs.Given that the Convention included representatives of the governments of all member states and the acceding countries, the draft treaty should not be the subject of fundamental changes. In terms of the outstanding international issues, our priority is that the principle of equality of representation in the European commission, first established in the Nice treaty, is maintained.On the eve of the European Council meeting, I met with several prime ministers and the various party leaders of the European Peoples Party – to which Fine Gael is associated – to discuss a number of aspects of the draft constitutional treaty. We agreed that the EPP would support an inclusion in the treaty of a reference to Europe's Christian heritage. This point was strongly supported by a number of speakers as it is evidently a matter of considerable interest to them.This summit was most notable for the progress achieved in the establishment of a stronger foreign and security policy for the European Union. If any lesson has been learned from the war on Iraq it is that a Europe without a single, cohesive voice risks being split, silenced and, therefore, sidelined in global affairs. We learned the salutary lesson that no policy meant no voice, no say and, therefore, no role in bringing a more enlightened view of the global interest. As far as the Fine Gael Party is concerned, this should never again happen. The world is changing and we, Irish and European, must change with it. A peaceful, secure changing world, demands a strong America and a strong Europe. Some may say that Europe's polyglot civilisation will, where necessary, provide a good counterweight to the American view. We cannot reduce this matter to a case of either-or. Our best hope lies in both powers working in concert when possible.Although a common policy of European secur ity and defence appears to be closer to being a reality, thanks to the Government, Ireland's voice has not been heard in this debate. The Fine Gael Party has consistently argued that Ireland should grab the opportunity to become one of the architects of this new policy rather than to settle for an architecture designed by others. This is our chance. We are a confident, modern nation, well able to take our place among the nations of the world. We have an un-missable chance to change the trajectory of power and responsibility in the new, enlarged Europe and beyond. I was disappointed not to hear the Taoiseach express an opinion on such a vital development in the history of the European Union. Ireland is no longer neutral, we are merely unaligned. In the absence of any coherent leadership from the Government parties on this matter, it is up to the Fine Gael Party to obtain clarity on the issue of neutrality. There is no need to debate neutrality, that is long gone.What we must debate now is what we do next; play someone else's game or get in there and decide the rules. We can and should take this approach. That is one of the reasons Deputy Gay Mitchell published an international peace missions Bill, which respects the role of the UN and the spirit of the UN charter. The legislation it proposes would allow Irish troops to take part in EU-sponsored, overseas peace missions which would be in keeping with the spirit of the UN charter. In this way, we could avoid a repeat performance of the recent Macedonian situation where the triple lock prevented us from doing a valuable peacekeeping job as the mission lacked a specific UN mandate.Our upcoming Presidency of the European Union will be an excellent opportunity to take a hard look at what we do next as Europeans. While ours is a small country, it is not inconsequential. Over 1,000 years ago, it was the Irish who civilised Europe and colonised the minds of the Continent to end the dark ages. In recent decades, Europe has given us many rights and responsibilities but the reductionist politics practised by this Government may prevent us fulfilling them. Regrettably, the Government's policies are preventing Ireland from properly shaping its own destiny and, by extension, the destinies of Europe and the world.Fine Gael believes passionately in Europe and Ireland's future role in it. It is time to debate and listen. While people may not always agree with what Fine Gael has to say, they can be sure that on Europe, as with everything else, we will continue to speak the truth.
#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	158	I thank Deputy Kenny for sharing his time and providing me with the opportunity to contribute a few words to this debate. When it comes to the Intergovernmental Conference and its conclusions, critics of the process will find it difficult to say every effort was not made to keep Parliament involved and informed at all times. I am grateful to the Minister of State  with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Roche, Deputy John Bruton and the other members of the Convention who came regularly to the Committee on European Affairs before and after meetings, often on Mondays and Fridays. They outlined at length the content of discussions at the Convention and listened to the views of committee members. I am grateful also to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, who attends the committee every month prior to his attendance at the General Affairs Council to provide members with an opportunity to raise important issues on an ongoing basis. Members are now being provided with the chance to raise with the Minister issues in respect of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference.The European institutions and the manner in which they function are vitally important to the success of the EU. They are particularly important in facilitating the successful fulfilment of their roles by the Union's smaller member states. We should renew our attention to institutional questions in the context of the draft constitutional treaty. Fine Gael agrees with the Government's point that any future arrangements must treat each member state in the same way. Large member states will never accept a scenario in which each does not have a Commissioner in which case the future legitimacy of the Commission demands that every member state should have one. It is certainly possible. In a short time, there will be 27 Commissioners before the new Nice treaty arrangements come into effect. To provide for 30 Commissioners would not, therefore, be so difficult. If it must be the case that there are 15 members of the college and 15 other Commissioners operating on a rotating basis, the Nice formula is fair and reasonable. One more effort should be made to examine the possibility of retaining a ratio of one full Commissioner per member state. The Commissioners could work at bridging the democratic deficit by keeping more in touch with national parliaments.The discussion of defence matters on the second day of the recent European Council makes it clear that a debate on European defence and security policy is taking place. It is not enough for the Government to state that any change will require a referendum as if that should be the end of the debate. Of course, any change will require a referendum. That is the position of Fine Gael and everyone else. The Constitution and the Nice treaty require it. The significant change between Nice 1 and Nice 2 was the elevation of the constitutional content in specific language to address what was in any event the de facto case. That is not the point. What is at issue is what we want for Ireland and Europe in the area of security and defence. Why are we not putting our ideas forward now as one of the architects designing future security structures? That is what we should be doing. A suspicion has been created in the area of security and defence and we have allowed those who wish to play on it a  great deal of leeway by failing to be up front about what Irish political parties want.While I am sure it will draw some criticism, the position put forward by Fine Gael is at least clear. The way forward is to seek to draft the protocol proposed under the constitutional treaty to allow those who wish to take on Article 5, Western European Union type, automatic responsibilities from the beginning do so. The four neutral, non-aligned states should be able to opt in on a case-by-case basis. There is an opportunity to make such arrangements. If we do not make them now and wish to join at a future date we will do so on the basis of rules which have been made by others. The consequence of standing on the sideline is that others will determine the future architecture to which we will have to say "Yes" or "No" in the end. That is not the way to conduct this aspect of the Intergovernmental Conference in the interests of Ireland or Europe.I remain concerned about the potential undermining of the Commission and, in particular, its President by the appointment of a President of the Council for at least two and a half years. The imposition of a long-term President of the Council is an attempt by some who favour intergovernmentalism to undermine the Community model. We need a very clear job description for the office of President of the Council to outline the way in which that role and the role of the President of the Commission will interact. I hold the view that the European Council as an institution is a creation of national parliaments. The national parliaments should, therefore, have some role in removing the permanent President of the European Council if that person oversteps his or her terms of reference and interferes with the other institutions of the Union. A very powerful President of the Council without any terms of reference could easily, in terms of his or her personality, overshadow the President of the Commission or the Commission itself. One need only look at recent personalities who have held the position of President of the European Commission and others who, like Giscard d'Estaing, have had roles in the Convention. Powerful personalities can influence events.We should ensure that the divisions in the roles of the various institutions are maintained and guard against opportunities to blur them further. In that regard, the European Council should not decide alone whether a person who has been its President for two and a half years has overstepped the mark. A role could be found for national parliaments whereby a vote of no confidence by one third of them would be required to force a President to stand down. It would be a reasonable check to introduce. Constitution and treaty making is about ensuring that we get checks and balances right. The general thrust of the constitutional treaty as drafted puts in place the various checks and balances which are required. While they have to be tweaked and nuances are needed, I do not envisage that there will be any major change in the provisions out lined. Therefore, it is important to give the requisite attention to the areas in which the final language has yet to be written including the terms of reference of the President of the Council and the protocol on defence. We must seek to have the language written in a way which reflects Ireland's view of Europe and our national interest.I commend the Minister and the Minister of State for making themselves available on a regular basis throughout the year. I hope that availability will continue notwithstanding the busy Presidency ahead and the Intergovernmental Conference which may continue during it.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	159	I join with Deputy Gay Mitchell in expressing the appreciation of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs for the attendance in this debate of the Minister, Deputy Cowen, and the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Roche. The joint committee cannot do the work mandated to it under legislation enacted prior to the holding of the second referendum on the Treaty of Nice with the level of resources at its disposal. It will be unable to fulfil the mandate given to it by this House and the people in the second Nice treaty referendum to ensure adequate scrutiny of European legislation. While I appreciate the constraints on the Minister and his colleague, I am sure the Chairman of the joint committee, Deputy Gay Mitchell, who is present in the House, concurs with my view that the volume of scrutiny work required, in addition to the other commitments of the committee, makes the task of scrutiny especially difficult. This will not become an issue until it is too late, when legislation has been passed without proper scrutiny. At that point all hell will break loose, which will only benefit the Eurosceptics and anti-Europeans.Before dealing with the defence issue, which was reported in the newspapers over the weekend, I will first deal with the Minister's report on the Council of Ministers meeting. I agree with the Minister that it is early days. The Intergovernmental Conference was discussed last week and as negotiations commence, positions are being restated. For example, at a meeting of the party leaders of the European Socialists Group last Wednesday, there was a restatement of known positions. It is, therefore, too early to speculate on the final outcome.The Minister diplomatically wished the Italians well in concluding their task by the end of the calendar year. I do not know if that is a wish that the chalice, poisoned or otherwise, will have been consumed by others or if it is a recognition, with most others, that the Italians will not have a diplomatic victory this side of Christmas in terms of completing the treaty. It would be in Ireland's interest if it was brought to a successful con clusion early in the first part of the Irish Presidency in the new year.While this may not be the time, sooner or later the Minister will have to come off the fence regarding his stated position that he can live with the Nice treaty or the Convention provisions on qualified majority voting. The Treaty of Nice is a bad treaty, with a complicated QMV formula. The Minister of State, Deputy Roche, was actively involved in the work of the Convention in this area and the provisions it agreed are transparent and self-explanatory. Once adopted they will never have to be altered because of the manner in which the system is constructed. While I understand the Government's current position, it will have to at some stage decide whether to support the concerns of the Spanish and Poles, which are, for ludicrous reasons, attached to the Nice treaty provisions. The Minister has more experience of this than most, but the Poles should be told that given the number of times QMV has been used on critical issues of national self-importance, they do not need to adhere to what is a much more complicated system than the one set out in the Convention.With regard to the institutions, it is necessary the Government begins to give the lead on how it would like to see the role of the proposed President of the Council of Ministers defined. I accept the necessity for the hybrid nature of this institution. The physical logistics of visiting capitals etc. entailed in a six month rotating Presidency in the context of a Union of 25 or 30 member states, means that notwithstanding the perceived benefits of a country holding the Presidency, the interests of the Union would not be best served. In view of this, I and the Labour Party support the proposal for a Council of Ministers Presidency.However, there are concerns the proposed Presidency will get into competition with the Commission. In view of this, the Government should, as soon as possible, either at the joint committee or elsewhere, take a more proactive role in articulating the kind of operational framework in which it sees the proposed Presidency developing. I do not consider – it is the general view held by most – that the Convention recommendations regarding this institution will be overturned. However, the small print of its operational framework will be critically important, especially as it will affect us all, not only the members of the joint committee and the Members of the Oireachtas, but also the wider public.The proposed Foreign Minister should be recognised as a necessary compromise in the context of the Constitution of the European Union, which is a mix of shared and equally distributed sovereignty on the one hand, with integrated sovereignty on the other. There is no other similar institutional model in the world. We are, there fore, to a certain extent pioneers in creating intergovernmental type institutions which have this hybrid mixture of pooled sovereignty in some areas and shared sovereignty in others. In view of this, it is only logical that we evolve institutions to reflect the hybrid nature of the way power is being shared and exercised. Given his proactive role, the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, will recognise that many of the smaller accession countries – with the exception of Poland and Slovakia the vast majority are smaller than Ireland in terms of population size – look to us for guidance in these areas, especially given our almost 30 years of experience of membership of the Union. The Government should not be shy about sharing that information, in public rather than in private.I strongly welcome the appointment of Jean-Claude Trichet to succeed Wim Duisenberg as President of the ECB. Perhaps the Minister will outline if there were any discussions, prior to or at the margins of the ECOFIN Council, about the role the ECB will have regarding the possible change to the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact. It is essential that the credibility of the pact is maintained. The apparent impunity exercised by France and, to a lesser extent, Germany, in their flagrant breach of the pact contrasts with the way in which this country and Portugal, among others, were sanctioned. It does no good for the institutions. There must be one law observed by all. If it is the case that the terms of the pact are too restrictive they should be changed in the light of present circumstances.The Stability and Growth Pact was constructed in a rigorous manner with an eye to the sense that the new currency would replace the hard currencies of Europe, especially the deutschmark and those currencies in the deutschmark zone. However, we have succeeded beyond our wildest dreams in creating a hard currency. All the fears expressed in the run-up to the ratification of the procedures for the euro currency have been overcome much more emphatically than was feared at the time. In view of this, there is a need to review the pact with the involvement of the ECB, which has the responsibility for it, and the Finance Ministers. If it is not on the next agenda of the Council, it would be in Ireland's interests especially that it be brought to the fore. We cannot, nor can we be seen to allow large economies like France to continue to flout the pact and its rules. I do not get a sense from the Minister's report that, other than ratifying the appointment of Jean-Claude Trichet, this matter was discussed. If it was, perhaps he will elaborate.Perhaps the Minister will also outline the kind of agency envisaged for border patrols and co-ordination. Is it a reinforcement of Fortress Europe or will it mean dealing more comprehensively with the reality that for so long as Europe increasingly becomes and remains an old, rich society, there will inevitably be a movement of  people trying to get into Europe arising from economic destitution or political impoverishment created in their home states? If this is the case, what will be the role of the EU, how will the member states play that role or will the Commission have a separate function in this regard?As the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform said, Ireland has a substantial number of people who, while utilising the asylum seeking process, are in reality economic migrants. Given the number of work permits that have been issued in recent years, our society has recognised the need for extra skilled labour. Unless the current system, which is unsatisfactory, is dealt with comprehensively and constructively it will fuel the passions of racism not just in Ireland but across Europe. Over the past century, Europeans have not had a very good track record on racism, chauvinism and antagonism towards ethnic minorities and ethnic groups. We have lessons from our past. The economic reality of the future is that we will continue to attract more and more people of different colour, backgrounds and nationalities. We can either proactively recognise this fact and attempt to deal with it constructively or we pull down the shutters, which simply will not work.I want to turn now to the brief references made to the possibility of stimulating economic growth in the European economy. I do not know if the changes in the criteria for investment which the European Investment Bank is bringing forward will enable Ireland to increase its public infrastructure programme. It appears that the Minister, Deputy Brennan, could quite happily avail of a substantial extra amount of capital to complete the major physical deficit in our road and motorway infrastructure system.Perhaps the Minister will indicate in his reply whether there will be an impact on our public capital programme over the next three to five years because we are falling behind. The evidence from the Institute of Engineers of Ireland and others is that the national development plan is seriously behind in some key sectors. The gap as a consequence means that our competitive position relative to other economies is being seriously eroded. The threat to competitiveness is not coming from wage demands or other factors. The threat to competitiveness in the Irish economy is coming from the enormous delays imposed on the delivery of services and goods as a result of infrastructural bottlenecks. What is the significance, if any, of the discussions that took place on the changes in the rules in the EIB and in other aspects of investment?I read a quote in a newspaper to the effect that the Irish Government, together with others, was more in favour of investment in research and development than it was in infrastructure. I would like to know if this is the case and, if so, what is the justification for it? There is a greater need now to deal instantly with our infrastructural physical deficit than with the no less necessary and desirable research and development budget.  The other countries in favour of research and development already have a very fine physical infrastructure, while we do not. Perhaps the Minister will reply to this question at the appropriate time.Finally, I want to refer to the debate in a number of newspapers over the weekend on the movement of Prime Minister Blair away from his current Atlanticist position. At a meeting in Germany between France, Germany and Britain it appears there was a greater signalling by Britain that it would co-operate more with these two countries in building up European defence capacity. Was this a subject for discussion at the Council meeting and, if so, what was its tenor? We have lived for years with lectures from the United States that Europeans must take more responsibility for their defence. The minute any attempt is made to do so, the Americans go ballistic behind the scenes – no pun intended – putting pressure, for example, on the Poles to buy American rather than European aircraft and putting pressure on European countries not to in any way undermine the present infrastructure of NATO, while publicly saying that Europeans must take a greater share of their strategic defence burden.The Irish position in all of this is very clear. We are committed to the principles of the United Nations and of neutrality. I do not accept the point of view expressed by the leader of the Fine Gael Party, but this is a debate in which we should participate. Irrespective of our particular point of view there is a wider issue which received a lot of public airwaves and print media coverage during last weekend. Apart from a slighting reference in the Minister's speech, there was no indication of whether it was a matter for deep discussion at the Council and, if so, what point of view was expressed by Ireland.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	160	I wish to share my time with Deputies Sargent and Ó Snodaigh.I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on the statements on the European Council meeting. I am extremely concerned about the drift by the three major political parties in this House towards a more centralised Europe and the possible creation in the future of a united states of Europe. This drift or, as many would say, sly move, without listening to people on the ground and in view of the recent so-called debate on the European Constitution, is alarming. At least 40% of Irish citizens have major concerns about the EU which recent referenda have clearly indicated.The big issue for many of us is defence and the whole question of having an independent foreign policy. We are often misrepresented as being anti-economic and anti-social co-operation. The labelling of people did not work in the past and will not work in the future. The Minister should be honest with people and tell them straight that he wants to build a new country called Europe. If that view is challenged, it is greeted with con  tempt. When the people of Sweden challenged the euro, the reaction of the EU establishment should have been studied. Why is there a major fear of openness and transparency? Why did we not have a referendum on the euro and a proper debate for our people?The euro's purpose is essentially political. One of its objectives is to make people feel members of this so-called country called Europe. This political purpose is probably more important than the economic one. In 1998, the Spanish Prime Minister, Filipé González, said "We need this united Europe. We must never forget that the euro is an instrument of this project."  The EU Commission President, Romano Prodi, said in the Financial Times that the two pillars of the nation state are the sword and the currency, and we changed that. How many Irish people are aware of these comments? How many Irish people realise that the Republic of Ireland does two-thirds of its trade outside the euro zone? The rigidity of “one size fits all” interest rates inside the euro zone does not suit Ireland or other small economies. The European Central Bank, which decides interest rates in the euro zone, is not subject to democratic controls. These are aspects about which the Irish people should be made aware.On defence and foreign policy, most Irish citizens have strong concerns about the drift towards a common foreign policy. I certainly do not want a common policy with nuclear blocs in the EU. I do not share the same foreign policy views as, for example, Tony Blair, particularly on Iraq and the undermining yesterday of General John de Chastelain. Let us also challenge the myth that the great saviours in the EU have brought peace to the world and all of a sudden prevented wars. There is no evidence for this. A common currency is no guarantee of national cohesion or peace. The USSR and Yugoslavia broke apart despite having had common currencies in the rouble and dinar. There are still conflicts in Chechnya, Kosova and Macedonia.When Czechoslovakia divided, a common currency was kept for some time. It did not work, however, and two currencies were instituted in the Czech and Slovak Republics respectively. In 1999, the year the euro was introduced, 25 wars were being waged in the world, 24 in countries with a common currency. Between 1998 and 1999, there were 108 armed conflicts in the world, 101 within states that had a common currency. Three quarters of these conflicts took place within democratic states, or states with democratic forms such as India, Algeria, Morocco, Ireland, Spain and Turkey regarding Kurdistan. The euro did not bring an end to the war in Europe. Have they even heard of civil wars? If we are interested in national peace and preventing conflicts let us reform and strengthen the United Nations. That is the way forward. Developing gun clubs in the EU is a thing of the past.We have also to challenge the nuclear powers and their possession of weapons of mass destruction. Why are we not facing up to these issues in the EU debate? Why do we ignore the economic cost of these weapons of mass destruction? This is public money that should be spent on poverty, housing, health and education. This is my vision of Europe. It is the Government's responsibility to listen to that view. If it claims to be inclusive and democratic it will allow the Irish people debate and vote on issues of national sovereignty. Failure to do so could lead to conflict. We should learn from history.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	161	I pay tribute to my colleague, Deputy Gormley, who has worked hard at the Convention and to Deputy Boyle and my MEP colleagues and fellow Deputies and councillors who attended and contributed to various meetings organised by Senator Maurice Hayes at what is often called Senator Hayes's roadshow around the country. It was beneficial to have that debate.It is important to keep the bigger picture in mind as the constitution is wide ranging. It is clearly set out and is the result of greater consultation than we have had previously. I recall a UK Government official telling me about the closing stages of the negotiations on the Treaty of Nice over a weekend where the deal was being hammered out, that were it not for the fact that he had taken his laptop with him he did not reckon there would be a deal. If things like that were hanging on a thread we can only imagine what was happening behind closed doors. It is important to bear in mind that it is not just a case of an enlargement of the EU, from 15 to 25 countries or whatever, but there is an increase in population of 28%. It is interesting that there is also an average income reduction within that enlarged Europe of 18%. That aspect of where we go in the EU will need to be seriously taken on board.Tá naoi dteanga oifigiúil nua le theacht isteach agus chuir sé ionadh orm nuair a léigh mé iFoinse an t-alt “Deis stadas san AE ligthe le sruth”. Tá díoma orm nach bhfuil an Rialtas ag iarraidh go mbeidh an Ghaeilge mar theanga oifigiúil san Aontas. It is strange that some of the new languages have a smaller population base than the number who speak Irish, yet the Irish Government appears uninterested in having the Irish language included as a teanga oifigiúil.Throughout the development of the EU the social agenda has been subservient to the economic agenda. There is a need for that to be tackled if the larger European Union is to be workable and cohesive. Sustainability has also not been taken seriously. It is acknowledged in the Amsterdam treaty but is still secondary. As transportation is set to increase enormously, with the increasing size of the European Union, it is clear we will face even greater problems. That is an issue about which the Government is aware, hav ing been taken to court so many times for failing to comply with European environmental law – the ozone layer laws being the latest in a long list which involve us facing court action. There is a serious implication for Ireland because our spend on social expenditure is the lowest in the European Union and we have the widest gap between rich and poor in the EU. The reality should inform our debate on such aspects as a charter of fundamental rights, which is welcome in so far as it goes as it includes socio-economic rights, unlike Bunreacht na hÉireann, but it does not address issues such as income adequacy. We are again left with the social agenda taking second place.It is clear this constitution represents a victory for those who want further militarisation of the European Union – the establishment of a European armaments research and military capabilities agency. With armaments policy to assist the Council of Ministers in evaluating the improvement of military capabilities, it is a victory for those who make their money out of selling weapons of mass destruction and other weapons of terror around the world. That has to be challenged by the Government if it is serious about a United Nations based common foreign policy rather than an EU common foreign policy. The solidarity clause is another issue of concern where the threat of terrorism worldwide is allowed to be a reason for going to war. That suggests another type of Iraq policy which would not be in line with the wishes of the Irish people.There is a democratic deficit in the EU. I share the concern of others that we are allowing the European Commission to further worsen that democratic deficit. If there are 30 members sitting around the table there should be 30 votes. If people can contribute to a debate I cannot understand why they should not vote in a debate, unless the large states are trying to keep out the views of the smaller states. That is a fear we have heard expressed previously.I am glad the Greens succeeded in not having the EURATOM Treaty tagged on as a protocol. We still want a sunset clause, perhaps Deputy Bruton has a role in this area in the Praesidium, and to use the environmental laws of the EU to clean up the nuclear industry rather than allow it develop under EURATOM. Ultimately the constitution on the future of Europe will be decided by the Green Party by way of a special convention of our members. I hope that level of consultation and decision making will form part of other parties' decision making process in order to improve as much as possible on the democratic voice within this country.

It is not good enough that Irish representatives agree to proposals, essentially because they are already in previous treaties. We have an opportunity to change Europe for the better. The Irish people are extremely concerned about safeguarding our neutrality but they also see the increasing militaris ation of Europe and the escalation of belligerence on an international level. They believed Ireland should have played a leadership role in negotiating the new EU treaty in stopping this madness.So far the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs have refused to be explicit about their position on a series of common defence provisions which have serious implications for Ireland and the future of international relationships. The people must be left in no doubt as to what the Government is willing to accept. It should be stated as clearly as the Government's position in regard to unanimity on taxation. The Government should fight as hard to protect Irish neutrality as Spain or Portugal fought to protect their favourable voting rights in the Council. Article 142 provides that EU defence policies shall not prejudice NATO states, and shall be compatible with NATO. However, the special rights and responsibilities of military neutral states are not explicitly acknowledged and are not specifically exempt from common defence requirements.It is the duty of the Irish Intergovernmental Conference negotiators to protect Irish independence in defence policy and specifically the traditional policies of military neutrality and UN primacy. This can be done by securing a specific article which recognises the rights and duties of neutral states within the Union and the rights of states which require a UN mandate for military operations. I urge the Government, even at this late stage, to instruct the negotiators to oppose the article as drafted and insist that the rights and duty of neutral states be given the same weight of recognition as accorded to the obligations of NATO states. That is the minimum Ireland should expect from fellow member states and it represents a reasonable compromise.Last week, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, sought to reassure the House that Irish neutrality is protected by the draft constitutional proposals as there is nothing in the draft that directly and immediately commits Irish troops to a European Union army. That is true as far as it goes. However, what has emerged from the latest Intergovernmental Conference meeting in Brussels is that the agreement will draw Ireland into participation in common defence by virtue of being a member of the European Union Council which will be vested with control over all future European Union military activity. As the State is constitutionally committed to resolution of conflicts by peaceful means this represents something which may be unconstitutional.

Does the Government intend putting to the people the case for and against joining such a defence or how does it expect the people to make such a decision without having information put before them?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	166	It may be helpful if I make some points arising from what has been stated regarding the question of the security and defence provisions in the draft treaty. I am here to give account of last week's European Union Council meeting.Defence issues were discussed by Heads of State and Government over dinner on the first evening. I will leave it to Mr. Blair to speak for the United Kingdom. During the discussions the Taoiseach made clear our view that any new security and defence arrangements should be open, inclusive and accountable to all member states. Many of the partners share that view. The Taoiseach also made clear our position on common defence. It was agreed by all that the defence articles need to be redrafted. The Government is working with partners to ensure that this is done in a way acceptable to the people. Basically, the position arising from the defence working group, on which Deputy Gormley is our representative, is that there was not a full discussion on those matters at the convention. There has been little discussion on the draft treaty at Heads of State level. The Italian Presidency, taking account of the discussion between the Heads of State over dinner, at which the Taoiseach contributed, setting out the broad principles we would wish to see in the defence and security provisions, has agreed to come back with amended proposals. The debate rests there until we see the amended proposals.With regard to Deputy Mitchell's question on the prospect of a referendum, it is clear in terms of the scope and ambition of this treaty that a referendum will be required, based on legal advice in respect of previous treaties with less scope than this one. Irish constitutional law will dictate the debate on how we put both sides of the argument. This covers the defence issues also.Some speakers have raised the issue of the growth initiative. We welcome the growth initiative under the Italian Presidency as a mechanism to assist in improving our infrastructure in the interests of growth and competitiveness. It would not be correct to state that we favour investment in research and development over infrastructure. Investment in both areas is important.The Van Miert report on the trans-European networks proposes new priority areas and includes two projects which would benefit Ireland, the Belfast-Cork road link and the motorway of the sea link which would improve sea connections between Irish waters and the Iberian peninsula. We are currently working with the Commission to include that in order that we achieve progress on these priority projects.There was no discussion on the Stability and  Growth Pact at the European Council. As the Deputy is aware, this issue is primarily a matter for ECOFIN and the Minister for Finance. However, we share the concern as to the importance of the pact being respected. The Italian Presidency communicated a draft action plan, entitled A European Action for Growth to ECOFIN, on 9 June. The plan proposes revitalising the European economy by increasing investment in the TENs, trans-European networks programme, and in research and development. It is important to point out that the amount of money under the research and development directorate is almost €15,000 million. It is greater than the social fund. Given our particular position in terms of national development it is clear from studies here and internationally that the issue of promoting innovation and enterprise is a critical factor in maintaining the progress we have made economically in the past decade. This is, therefore, an important aspect of Europe's work and one in which we are very interested.This proposal by the Italian Presidency was developed further by the Commission and the European Investment Bank. The ECOFIN council examined the proposals and submitted an interim report to the European Council. A final report will be prepared for ECOFIN in November and for the European Council in December.The European Council concluded that maintaining sound macro-economic policies, accelerating structural reform and promoting investment in infrastructure and human capital were key priorities for developing the European Union's economic potential. It also noted that building modern efficient transport infrastructures to ensure easier and better access between all member states would have a two-fold positive effect boosting growth both directly and by maximising the benefits of the internal market.In respect of the growth initiative, we would support measures that would facilitate higher levels of investment in infrastructure and research and development and are, therefore, positive about the initiative. We are also anxious to ensure that the initiative in its final form should have due regard to measures to address infrastructural deficits. Financial and legislative proposals arising from the initiative, including the TENs financing proposals, would have to be critically scrutinised by reference to identifiable concrete advantages to Ireland and the European Union generally.The European Investment Bank has confirmed the availability of €100 billion for lending to the relevant sectors within its existing resources and banking policies up to 2010. The Commission's proposals aim to boost private investment in support of the trans-European network and knowledge by setting the appropriate community regulatory framework and refocusing public and community expenditure. However, it has also  suggested improvements in community financial aid for some aspects of the TENs.Another issue raised was migration policy. This is receiving top priority as part of European Union business. The European Council emphasised the importance of the implementation of the plan for the management of the Union's external borders and welcomed the concept of a border management agency which will enhance operational co-operation for the management of external borders. We believe that to achieve the full implementation of an external border management plan the best strategy is to focus on practical co-operation which is best achieved on a multilateral basis with the assistance of the common unit of external border practitioners for planning development and co-ordination of projects.The European Council, at Seville in June 2002, endorsed the plan for the management of the external borders of member states which would help in the fight against illegal immigration. The plan envisages common operational coordination and co-operation between member states, including mutual technical assistance between member states' border control services, exchange programmes and training and pilot projects. The Seville European Council also called for the introduction of a common unit of external border practitioners which is composed of the heads of the border control services of the member states and co-ordinates the measures contained in the plan.While draft proposals have yet to be published, it is envisaged that there may be a role for an agency type structure to co-ordinate community initiatives on the external borders of the European Union. The agency would not have a direct operational remit or a policy formation role. It would instead co-ordinate the joint activities under the plan for the management of the external borders and manage the work of the various specialist project centres around the EU, for example the risk analysis centre in Finland, the land border centre in Germany, etc., and provide training and intelligence to member states and national border services.

Was the whole question of migration into Europe and the way in which such migrants are integrated into European society any part of the discussion or is that for another place and time?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	168	On the issue of migration, the Council reaffirms its commitment to a balanced approach between, on the one hand, the urgent  need to stop illegal migration and to fight against the trafficking of human beings, and on the other the reception and integration of legal migrants. We have a flexible labour market, with the demand for foreign labour being market-driven. The Council conclusions note the Commission's initiation of a study into the relationship between legal and illegal immigration. It is understood this will include an examination of the use of quota systems. In this study, Ireland would like to see a broad analysis of admission procedures and this could include a feasibility study of a European quota system. The analysis should examine the benefits and costs of quota systems generally, based on the experience of those states that operated them in the past, whether it has the potential for success on a Europe-wide level and what the requirements are for an effective quota regime.From Ireland's perspective the concept of quotas needs to be carefully evaluated before any proposals are put to the Council. We support the Community efforts to negotiate the admission agreements with countries of origin. We would like to see a focus on countries which are a significant source of illegal entrance to the European Union and we would also wish to ensure that the re-admission obligations in the Cotonou agreement are effective.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	169	Will the Minister say if in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the Government has taken a view on the issue of income adequacy throughout the European Union, given the reduction in average income, as I have mentioned, with the new member states and the likelihood of considerable hardship with the neoliberal policies in some of the eastern countries? What progress has been made in regard to maintaining representation for each country on the European Commission? I know the Government has taken a position on it, but will the Minister say how strongly it is arguing its position? There has been a statement from Dublin Castle where the Taoiseach has been vowing there will be a referendum on an EU defence pact. Will the Minister clarify that is treating the referendum on the constitution by way of a referendum on such a pact or is this to be a second referendum? I was not at Dublin Castle. Will the Minister clarify it because when one reads the constitution, it does suggest that common defence is part of the deal.

Will he also take the opportunity presented by the EU Presidency to further push this issue so that we have a safer world?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	171	Again I would point out to  Deputies that the question of respecting the specific character of the security and defence policy of certain member states is recognised in the specific provisions for implementing the common security and defence policy under the present draft articles and that will remain a common feature. Article 40, paragraph 2, states that the policy of the Union shall not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of certain member states and "shall respect the obligations" of certain member states, etc., which see their common defence realised in NATO, under the North Atlantic treaty and shall be compatible with the common security and defence policy established within that framework.In the same way, those who have obligations under NATO are expressly referred to. I think the Deputy should quote the full paragraph which confirms that the specific national character of the policy of all member states' security and defence policy is not prejudiced in terms of formulating and developing ESDP in the European Union.The EURATOM treaties are not part of this treaty's remit. That was decided at the time. We have a long history under successive Governments and a distinctive contribution made by Ireland over the years as regards non-proliferation and disarmament issues at UN and other multilateral fora. That will continue and we remain part of the new agenda coalition in that respect.Deputy Sargent's reference to the Taoiseach is simply a reiteration of what the present constitutional position is, which is that Ireland cannot adopt a common defence under the aegis of the EU without the prior approval of the people in a referendum. He is simply reiterating what emerged from the constitutional provision in the second Nice referendum.The charter relates to EU institutions. It does not bring competences into the national framework. As regards the question of income adequacy, I do not believe a policy issue like that is a matter for insertion into a constitutional treaty. One will see from the objectives and values of the Union that it makes clear we are talking about growth, prosperity, the social market, environmental protection and sustainability. The European model of growth is enshrined in the new constitutional draft and is consistent with trying to encourage and promote cohesion throughout the European Union, which has brought, as we have seen in enlargements to date, improved standards and quality of life for all members of the Union.
#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	172	Will the Minister agree that decisions taken by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in London on interest and exchange rates and those taken by the Bundesbank in Germany would not have left us the sort of sovereignty we have now, whereby we participate in the European system of central banks and the European Central Bank? Will he agree that nothing like 40% of Irish people would like to see us leaving the eurozone, that they are quite happy with the euro and see it in terms of a trans parency in pricing and a convenience in travel within the European Union which is confirmed by the research that has been done?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	173	There is absolutely no question, it is indisputable that for many reputable economists as well as the social partners and others, the integration of the European economy has brought huge benefits to the Irish economy. The continuing integration of the European economy means that we are strong supporters of the single currency, together with the sharing and pooling of sovereignty in these areas in an era of interdependence. The best way of utilising sovereignty has been pooling and sharing it with others in common values and objectives – in common institutions, working to common objectives and action. These last few months as a member of the EU troika, as we prepare for the Presidency, I have met both at the UN and other fora, many organisations throughout the world who look to the European Union as an obvious model to be adapted by them to their own circumstances.Issues that affect us in everyday life are transnational in character and require co-operation among states. In some cases, like ours, they require a unique model of intergovernmental and integrated action which allows us, through the objectives of the Lisbon agenda, to consider becoming the most competitive economy in the world by 2010. Other parts of the world, learning from the European experience, are trying to develop similar mechanisms, whether in Latin America, Africa under the African Union, NEPAD, Central America—

Everyone is trying to adopt the European approach and those who started to adopt this approach after one of the greatest conflicts mankind has known show that by co-operation and common action we can best ensure we utilise our sovereignty meaningfully for those generations we serve. Having common policies which are not uniform in all respects but whereby agreement and consensus can emerge has enabled us to make a contribution on the world stage which we could never have done on our own. Any suggestion that we can on our own make a major contribution to world affairs is living in cloud cuckoo land.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	176	Section 29(3) of the Competition Act 2002 provides that the Competition Authority shall be independent in the performance of its functions. The enforcement of competition law in the State is a day-to-day operational matter for the authority and is not one in which I have a function. I understand that the cartel immunity programme has been operating satisfactorily since its introduction. For obvious reasons, the authority does not comment publicly on individual investigations or cases that may result in legal proceedings. I am informed that the powers of arrest referred to have not been exercised in any case to date.I consider that the authority's enforcement role is central to the effectiveness of our overall national competition policy and I am confident that the implementation of the enforcement arrangements for which the Oireachtas provided in the 2002 Act will make a significant contribution to our national competitiveness.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	177	I am surprised to hear there have been no arrests in respect of the action taken by the Competition Authority since it was established in 2001 under the Competition Act 2000. How many applications for immunity from prosecution has the Competition Authority received since it launched its immunity programme in December 2001 and how many prosecutions have resulted from the granting of applications for immunity? What is the Minister's interpretation of the fact that no arrests have been made on the basis of the provisions of the Competition Act 2002? Does it mean that they are not active or are not seeking to do their job in the manner which the Competition Act intended and, if so, will the Minister make necessary changes to ensure that the Competition Act is enforced rigorously, as envisaged when it was enacted?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	178	As the Deputy knows, the authority received its new powers just over a year ago. Only the DPP can grant immunity and it is not a matter for the authority but I understand from the authority that there have been many inquiries under this programme. The intention is to seek to provide new mechanisms for bringing information to the authority's attention so that cartels and behaviour that is harmful to consumers can be identified and rooted out. These provisions work very effectively elsewhere and in the fullness of time they will be part of the measures which will help the authority to bring an end to some cartel behaviour that may exist in this economy.I am not at liberty, and it would not be good practice, to disclose the kind of information which Deputy Hogan seeks. The authority is an inde pendent body accountable to the Oireachtas and to the Committee of Public Accounts. The new Act provides for new accountability functions on its day-to-day operation. We have an authority that is extremely effective and legislation that is among the best of its kind in the world. Additional resources have been given to the authority in recent times and prosecutions are slow. There have been cases in the public domain recently in which the authority was involved in prosecutions. Difficulties arise sometimes but the authority is determined to use all the powers that can be given to it to ensure that we have a fairer and more competitive environment.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	179	I ask the question because the Competition Authority is accountable to the Oireachtas. We cannot hide behind the excuse that the Competition Authority is independent and not accountable to the Oireachtas or the Committee of Public Accounts. I inquired recently about how the immunity programme operates. It seems very ineffective. There is a mobile telephone number available for processing immunity applications, which is staffed only between 10.00 a.m. and 4.00 p.m. on Monday to Friday, as if criminal activity would relax outside those hours. That does not include bank holidays or public holidays. Does the Minister believe that the restricted hours under which this immunity programme is operated are sensible or wise, given the nature of the calls likely to be made by persons seeking immunity? Can she confirm that the number of calls made to the Competition Authority on the designated phone is adequate? This programme needs to be reviewed in order to fulfil the spirit of the Competition Act. I agree with the Minister that it is a good Act but it is not working effectively at this stage.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	181	Then why have whistleblowing?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	182	These things often come to light when people or groups fall out with one another. This is a very new regime and it took a considerable effort to have it accepted here because it was a new practice in Irish law. I understand there have been several inquiries about the immunity programme and these will bear fruit but it will take time because we are asking someone involved in this behaviour to squeal on someone else. We will not receive thousands of those cases in a year and the restricted hours will not stop people coming forward. Anyone who wants to do this is more than aware of how he or she might contact the authority with a view to assisting in the successful prosecution of someone involved in cartel behaviour.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	183	I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 4 together.Over the past 12 months officials have facilitated consideration by Ministers of options for the future of CE in the period ahead. Work in this area is not yet complete. Conclusions are expected to be reached in the context of the Estimates for 2004. The options papers have been prepared for the information of Ministers as an input into Government decisions on the Estimates, and will not be published. The average participation rate on the community employment programme is expected to be in the region of 22,500 during 2003 with a projected year-end participation rate of 20,000. This amounts to a reduction of 5,000 places on the year-end position for 2002.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	184	The Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, has acknowledged that there has been a savage reduction in the last two years of 10,000 places from a scheme that employed 39,500 people in 1998. Does the Minister of State accept that participants across the country are confused as to their future, as are the people trying to run the schemes and those they serve? Does he accept that there is an urgent need for clarity on these matters? Would he accept that many of the documents he refuses to publish have been leaked to the public domain? Would he accept further that newspapers are speculating openly that he is conducting a trade-off between an additional 5,000 CE places and the abolition of the jobs initiative scheme in which 2,200 long-term unemployed people are involved, and the social economy programme which provides 2,300 jobs in the most disadvantaged areas? I am seeking clarity on this matter in the House, to which Ministers are accountable, so that those planning the schemes, the communities depending on them and the workers who have given so readily of their time will know what their future holds.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	185	I am sure Deputy Howlin is fully aware that one does not necessarily pay a great deal of attention to everything one reads in the newspapers. I accept there has been some con fusion with regard to the reduction in CE places, but much of it has been caused by inaccurate comments from people in this House and elsewhere. The Government decided last year to reduce CE places from 25,000 to 20,000. That was the only decision taken by Government in this regard and it has now been implemented.Accepting that there has been some difficulty for schemes throughout the country as a result of that reduction, it is important to point out that the decision was taken against a background of a reduction in long-term unemployment to its current level of 1.5% and the issue of 45,000 work permits within the past 12 months. I do not agree that confusion has been caused by my Department. We have gone through a very comprehensive review process across a number of Departments, which also involved FÁS. Following completion of that process, proposals are now before Government, which will take decisions in the context of the 2004 Estimates.I reject Deputy Howlin's suggestion that there have been attempted trade-offs or anything of that nature. In our Department, the Tánaiste and I are interested in putting in place a comprehensive approach which will involve an active labour market programme to give long-term unemployed people an opportunity to get back into the labour force, through more successfully focused training opportunities than they have had until now. We are also anxious to provide for the very significant range of community services which have developed on an ad hoc basis, but which have, we acknowledge, been very useful and successful. We are trying to put those two policy objectives in place – that is the thrust of our proposal which is before the Government.
#GerardMurphy	unknown-#GerardMurphy-party	unknown-#GerardMurphy-dob	unknown-#GerardMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	186	Basically, we are trying to establish how many places will be available next year in the combination of schemes which, I understand, the Minister of State is now about to introduce. He stated in the House that at Estimates time this year there would be proposals for a scheme which would specially facilitate people over the age of 50 and those with disabilities. I wish to establish whether that will form part of the overall figure and whether it will involve a reduction in the number of places available in community employment or other schemes. I hope the Minister of State will honour his commitment.In addition, the Tánaiste stated in the House last June that in conjunction with the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, she would shortly discuss the mainstreaming of CE schemes for environmental and community support activities. Has there been progress in that regard? Are those who will be mainstreamed into that activity still being included in the projected figures for next year?
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	187	First, I am not in a position to say what the final numbers on the various schemes will be until the Government has taken a decision  in the context of consideration of the Estimates for 2004. As I have stated in the House and elsewhere, we are particularly anxious to cater for greater opportunities for people over 55 – not 50, as the Deputy stated – and those with special needs who, consequently, cannot access the labour force or participate in the progression which is critical to the success of CE schemes. I hope the Government will accept our proposals in that respect. However, it is incorrect to make an assumption with regard to reductions or otherwise in numbers. In relation to a recent report that the number involved in CE schemes would be reduced to 15,000, I assure Deputies there are no proposals for a reduction of that nature.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	188	Does the Minister for Finance agree?
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	189	With regard to mainstreaming, one of the difficulties being reported by CE scheme operators around the country is that education mainstreaming has not worked as intended. Many of those on CE schemes who tried to get employment opportunities in the education system did not succeed in doing so. In many cases, those jobs went to people other than CE participants. Another difficulty is that the cost of that exercise has been significant, in comparison to the cost of a very good CE programme previously provided for schools. While we are still considering the whole future of the programme, the experience in the education sector has not been a good example. Consequently, we will have to be very careful in relation to any further mainstreaming in which we may become involved.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	190	The report to the Cabinet committee on social exclusion made the point very well that the attempted mainstreaming has not worked efficiently. Accordingly, one should not attempt to do, in a different fashion, a job which has been done very well through CE. Since the Minister of State accepts that there are two separate components to CE and the associated schemes such as the jobs initiative and the social economy programme, namely, an active labour market component and a community services component, will he acknowledge that the cuts to date have impacted on valuable and important community programmes? Does he agree they have also impacted on people in respect of whom the Tánaiste had assured us that they would not be affected, namely the disabled?Last week, 17 placements were lost from the employment network in North Strand Road, Dublin 3, including a component of disabled people. At a time when the Tánaiste was exhorting the private sector to ensure a 3% component of employment, the State sector should certainly be maintaining an equivalent provision for disabled workers. Does the Minister of State agree with me in that regard? Will he take specific measures to protect the most vulnerable people who are currently on CE schemes? In relation to  my specific question earlier, will the Minister of State give a guarantee that the 20,000 level for CE schemes, which will be reached at the end of this year, will be maintained for 2004?

#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	200	I cannot give guarantees, as Deputy Howlin is fully aware. However, at all times during the year, recognising the impact of the reduction to 20,000, I indicated that we would try to hold that level as being the bottom rung of the ladder. We accept that the cuts have impacted on people, but I believe even Deputy Howlin will accept that, given the significant changes in the labour market over a number of years, it was necessary to make changes in our labour market programme as we have done.We must ensure we look after the less well off who are not capable of progressing into employment. Those on disability allowance have been exempt from CE schemes every year and it has not been any different this year. We are cognisant of the need to give people who are not capable of progressing into sustainable employment the opportunity to have further training and work experience. That applies to people with disabilities as it does to others. We cannot and will not  provide full-time long-term employment under CE or any other scheme. That would completely defeat the purpose of the scheme and lead to an explosion in public service numbers.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	201	Maintaining Ireland's attractiveness as a profitable location from which to do business is a constant priority for both the Government and my Department. My Department and its enterprise support agencies are acutely aware of the changes taking place in the structure of the country's manufacturing base and how this is evolving in response to international market forces.Largely as a result of our recent economic success, Ireland is becoming increasingly uncompetitive for a lot of basic manufacturing. The challenge is to assist companies to move into the type of higher value-added activities that will provide well paid jobs for our increasingly educated workforce. My Department and its agencies have put in place a range of measures to facilitate this transition including the establishment of Science Foundation Ireland with a €646 million fund to support world class research in Ireland that will provide the essential basis for the development of innovative products and services in the future; support through Enterprise Ireland for Irish-owned companies to develop new products and processes; and the establishment of a competitiveness fund in Enterprise Ireland to support Irish small and medium-sized enterprises in addressing specific competitiveness issues.In addition to current measures, I recently set up the enterprise strategy group under the chairmanship of Eoin O'Driscoll. I have asked the group to recommend new strategies and policies that the Government and I will need to take into account in charting a course for enterprise in Ireland to the end of the decade. Among other issues, I have asked the group specifically to examine what Ireland needs to do to address the strengthening competition from Asian and EU accession states.

If they decide to move to another low wage country, there is nothing the Tánaiste can do about it. Does the Tánaiste support my proposal to develop indigenous industry and what role does she see for the semi-State sector in developing the economy and creating jobs? Does she have a hostile view of the semi-State  sector? If this is the case, it is bad for the economy.Does the Tánaiste agree with me that we do not live in a low tax economy when PAYE workers are paying out over 40% of their wages when PRSI, the 2% health levy, VHI and BUPA private insurance schemes, the extra 15% Government levy in chemists, the 29% increase in the bin tax in the Dublin City Council area, the new ATM tax and an increase of 100% on parking permits are taken into account? Does the Tánaiste accept that, despite the image of being a low tax economy, the average taxpayer is being hammered and this is not good for the broader economy?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	203	I do not accept that the multinational sector dictates the agenda. We live in a globalised economy – a recent survey indicated that Ireland has the most globalised economy in the world. We trade by way of imports and exports and we must compete in that space. Employment will only grow if sales increase and sales will only increase if productivity increases through innovation. We will not achieve productivity through low wages because there are many countries that can produce goods for much less than us.The Irish Congress of Trade Unions stated yesterday that we are a low tax economy and should examine ways of increasing the tax burden. A recent EUROSTAT study of all EU member states showed that those on low wages in Ireland pay less tax than any other European country. The average in Ireland is 17%, while it was 49% in Belgium and 45% in Germany. A person on the average industrial wage with a family has a negative tax rate when child benefit is taken into account. Such pro-work tax policies have helped to generate much of the employment created in recent years. We are conscious that we cannot stand still and that is why there are many strategies to develop the potential of our companies, particularly through innovation or out-sourcing.The semi-State sector has an important role to play. Competition is more important than ownership, as Deputy Rabbitte recently acknowledged. I am not obsessed with who owns what; if there is a better way to run companies we must look at that. Companies in the State sector, particularly the commercial State sector, compete very successfully but if they can be more successful in a different environment we must not close our minds to the idea.

These new rules will significantly lower the permitted grant rate maximum levels and tighten the criteria needed, leading to a requirement for EU Commission approval of grants, which will damage Irish industry.The Tánaiste mentioned Science Foundation Ireland. Does she see this as an important part of the economic development of the State and agree that we cannot trust our economic future to yesterday's ideas? How much money was put into indigenous industry in the past 12 months?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	205	The whole purpose of the EU state aid regime is to create an even playing field within the Union. More State aid can be given to small and medium size companies and greater levels can be granted to Objective One regions. We should not over-emphasise the grants available to industry. Upskilling, human capital development, developing the potential of the workforce and innovation are more important to Irish industry than grant aid. We must continue to move rapidly in that regard.Across all Departments, Irish industry has received at least €200 million in a one year period between the food sector, the sector supported by my Department and the tourism industry. I do not have the precise figures but a considerable sum is devoted by taxpayers to supporting the growth of the indigenous sector. One of the Government's most important functions is to open doors overseas for the indigenous sector in order that sales and, therefore, jobs increase.

#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	206	The recent failure to reach agreement on a framework for the continuation of negotiations under the Doha development agenda at the Cancun WTO ministerial conference is very regrettable and was a serious setback for the DDA. The major losers from the failure to agree at Cancun are developing and least developed countries because the DDA is designed to address their needs and to help them to integrate into the world economy.Trade matters are a European Union competence where the EU Commission negotiates on behalf of the EU member states on the basis of proposals from the Commission, which are agreed by EU Ministers. There was substantial  technical preparation and negotiation on all of the issues across the full Doha development agenda in the lead up to Cancun. Ireland engaged extensively in the preparation of EU submissions to the WTO under each of the headings and in the development of the EU negotiating mandates across the full spectrum of issues under the Doha agenda.The Cancun conference did not fail for lack of effort on the part of the European Union. The EU was among the most persistent advocates for a successful conference and negotiated in good faith at Cancun. For its part, the EU, among all WTO partners, provided significant inputs to the WTO in Geneva in the lead up to Cancun. EU member states agreed the substantial reforms in agriculture under the medium-term review proposals in June 2003.Although the substantive work had already been done on the DDA, by the end of August, in preparation for Cancun, the gaps between the WTO members proved to be wider than could be bridged during the five day conference for reasons of substance, tactics and organisation. Thus, for example, the newly established group of 21 developing countries, including Brazil, China and India, displayed at an early stage of the conference a strong reluctance to move from their established positions on all issues. With progress at the meeting being virtually impossible, therefore, the chairman of the conference, the Mexican Foreign Minister, closed the discussions very shortly after the substantive negotiations had begun.Additional Information.A process of internal reflection and consultation among EU member states and within and between the EU Commission and Council has already commenced. This is appropriate before reaching firm conclusions on the next steps to be taken. This will also allow for critical consideration of the strengths and weaknesses of the WTO as an organisation and what needs to be done to enable it to achieve its objectives. Ireland is participating in this process on the basis that the Government continues to support a multilateral rules-based system of international trade and a strong WTO as the best means to meet the challenges ahead.

I welcome the Minister of State's response, but it is the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Michael Ahern, who should be answering this question. In his absence, I would have thought the Minister, Deputy Harney, should have taken the question.

#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	209	Why is the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment not taking  the question? This is a matter of importance to the Government and the State. I am surprised the Minister has not seen fit to answer it herself.It is remarkable that we are able to say what constitutes the best deal for developing countries. They clearly believed they were getting a raw deal, particularly from the EU which was forcing the introduction of Singapore issues into the agenda. The developing countries were interested in the reduction of barriers on agricultural products and felt they had not gone anywhere close to far enough. I would like to hear Ireland's position rather than the EU one. What was our position within the EU position, even if it is an issue for EU competency? Did the Government believe it was correct that those Singapore issues at Cancun were brought on to the agenda? To most neutral observers, that was the reason the talks collapsed.Is the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment happy with the level of market openness we have allowed for agriculture and textile products from developing countries? The Minister talks about the need for an open and free trade economy. On that basis, it is unfair of us to both maintain barriers on certain products to which the developing countries are best suited and to subsidise our exports, which damage their markets. I know what the EU position was, but what was the Irish position on those two issues? Should we have pushed the Singapore issues? Should we have yielded further in reducing entry barriers for textile and agricultural products and stopped our export subsidies to such products?

It looks after the interests of Ireland in the talks, as it does for all other member states.Ireland is supportive of the developing countries having an opportunity to get a fair chance in free trade. We made that point clearly at the preparation negotiations in Geneva. The established group of 21 developing countries expressed a strong reluctance to move from their established positions on a number of issues. Consequently, the negotiations broke down.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	218	Maintaining Ireland's attractiveness as a profitable location from which to do business is a constant priority for both the Government and my Department. My Department, through the various agencies, is acutely aware of the changes taking place in the structure of the country's manufacturing base and how this is evolving in response to international market forces.It has been apparent for some time that our strength and competitive advantages, vis-à-vis emerging economies such as India have changed as our economy has modernised rapidly in recent years. Competing in international markets with low value added services and basic manufacturing industrial activity no longer matches the competitive characteristics of modern enterprise in Ireland.For example, under my Department, the Science Foundation Ireland programme has been set up to administer the €646 million technology foresight fund to support world-class research that will be the genesis of future innovation and new technologies. That, together with the development of third level education, the capacity to provide infrastructure for research and to transfer that research into companies and commercialise it, will be the future for Ireland. This also includes the upskilling and training of our workforce.The answer is much the same as the previous question. I do want to repeat what I said earlier.Additional InformationThis fund will help to drive long-term growth and competitiveness by helping to attract new high technology firms to Ireland while strengthening the capabilities of existing foreign and Irish-owned enterprises. In addition, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and Shannon Development are implementing a careful pro gression in the sophistication and breadth of higher value activities that companies carry out here. A critical feature of this type of activity is the development of strong partnerships and collaboration between business and universities, jointly undertaking substantial research and development activities. The IDA is placing considerable emphasis on encouraging foreign companies to add strategically important functions to their Irish operations while Enterprise Ireland is providing support for innovation in Irish companies.I recently set up the enterprise strategy group under the chairmanship of Eoin O'Driscoll. I have asked the O'Driscoll group to recommend new strategies and policies that I, and the Government will need to take into account in charting a new course for enterprise in Ireland to the end of the decade. Among other issues, I have asked the group to specifically examine what Ireland needs to do to address the strengthening competition from Asian and EU accession states. Comments and views may be submitted to the group through its secretariat at Forfás, Wilton Place, Dublin 2 or to esg@forfas.ie.

It indicated that County Donegal has the highest unemployment rate in the State at 15.6%, twice the national average. Is the Minister aware that thousands of jobs have been lost in County Donegal in traditional type industries in recent years? The Fruit of the Loom company employed approximately 4,500 people a number of years ago, but now only employs 500. In my parish, 1,000 jobs have been lost. Most of these jobs have not been lost due to recession but have been transferred to north African, east European and Far East countries with low cost economies.We were told high-tech jobs would offer a solution to unemployment, but they are being frittered away now. Call centres were to be established with broadband, but they are also being lost. The High Octane delegation met the Minister last week who informed her of these developments. What is her strategy to redress this imbalance and the serious loss of jobs in County Donegal and on a national basis?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	220	I am aware of the statistics in the CSO report. However, as the head of the CSO said after their publication, the labour force survey is a much more accurate reflection of the unemployment level than the census returns. There is the other reality that a large number of applications for work permits from my Department come from County Donegal.However, I am conscious that County Donegal has many jobs tied up in basic manufacturing, particularly on the textile side. Many of those  jobs have been lost. Clubman Omega Limited announced today it was reducing its workforce there. It lost a substantial contract from the shirt company Mr. Pink Limited, which had a strong business at airport shops. Due to the slump in the airline industry after the events of 11 September 2001, that business has been dramatically affected. International events affect activities on the ground.The key to the economic future of County Donegal lies in the development of the infrastructure. It is one of the most peripheral counties in the State. From an industrial development point of view, the development of the infrastructure, which the High Octane group emphasised last week, will be essential if we are to have more success in the future.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	221	The question relates specifically to the threat the Indian economy poses for job creation in the Irish and western European economies. India is fast developing means by which it attracts much US foreign direct investment into its low cost economy that would have habitually gone to western European economies. The Irish strategy up to now has been to move from an investment-based to an innovation economy. This means that our economy moves up the value chain. However, moving up at a time when there is much out-sourcing to places like India is a serious threat to the economy. In the UK alone, a recent report indicated that 200,000 jobs could be lost from call centres alone to low cost places like India. This is the new challenge. Has the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment new initiatives to meet that challenge?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	222	I accept there is a challenge. I was in India some time ago and a software developer or engineer is paid about $5,000 per annum, which is a very low salary in comparison to the going rate in Ireland. The challenge must be faced by being more innovative, smarter, quicker and more flexible. This is why all the factors affecting competitiveness, including education, innovation and infrastructure must be taken seriously.Many companies in Ireland have outsourced successfully and kept a substantial number of jobs here, including companies in the textile sector in which the more developed end of the business, such as marketing and design, is in Ireland. A company in Cork that does all the work for Cutter & Buck on the golf side has been expanding its employment as a result of outsourcing initiatives that allow it to reduce its costs and compete very successfully. We need a combination of measures and in particular we must not close our minds to outsourcing some manufacturing with a view to keeping some of the business in the country.

The report of the inspectors into Ansbacher Cayman confirmed that my concerns were justified. However, I did not wait for the completion of the report before taking action to ensure that any regulatory failures coming within my area of responsibility were dealt with.Accordingly, I have introduced the following initiatives: proactive enforcement of the provisions of company law by the establishment and resourcing of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement; increased penalties and additional resources to ensure companies meet their filing obligations with the Companies Registration Office; better oversight and regulation of the accounting and auditing profession by the proposed establishment of the Irish auditing and accounting supervisory authority; the establishment of the company law review group on a statutory footing to ensure that the provisions of our company law are appropriate to the needs of Irish society.Following the introduction of the Company Law Enforcement Act 2001, it is now the statutory responsibility of the Director of Corporate Enforcement to pursue the possible breaches of the Companies Acts identified in the report. The director has emphasised his determination to take appropriate action on foot of the report. The Revenue Commissioners have been very active in pursuing tax issues arising from the Ansbacher and other tax evasion mechanisms.

Is she concerned about the fact that the Revenue Commissioners seem to be unable to collect the significant amount of tax that is to be collected, whether onshore or offshore? There is a low level of collection of moneys identified through various reports, including the Ansbacher one. Are these stuck in the system because of litigation? Do the Revenue Commissioners not have sufficient evidence to collect the outstanding money? What action is required to redress this matter, which was identified in the Ansbacher report?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	227	I recently reviewed all the outstanding issues relating to this matter and in so far as they fall under the remit of my Department, I am satisfied they have all been taken on board. Many of them were dealt with in advance of the report in any event, as we were aware of what would emerge. At the time we did not have much by way of enforcement of company law.I am impressed with the changes that have occurred in the attitude in the Revenue Commissioners in recent years. They implement the law without fear or favour. Clearly they have to undo a whole culture, which will take some time. Many of the issues coming to light arose as a result of inquiries of one kind or another. It is going to take some time. It pleases me that they have the powers to ensure that everybody pays the tax due and the determination to enforce those powers. We should all be very grateful to them as in the past even when they had the powers they were not always exercised in full. One of the complaints one sometimes hears in the outside world is that the Revenue Commissioners have become too tough and that company law enforcement is too tough. This is because people have noticed a considerably changed environment, which I welcome.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	229	I am sure the Deputy is aware the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will introduce legislation to require members of the legal profession to report suspected instances of people involved in unsavoury activity. All professions, particularly those with considerable protection under our law, have a responsibility to bring such activity to the attention of the authorities. We must legislate for this in the case of accountants. This has been done in the case of lawyers.The other investigations into professions tend to be on the competition side rather than on the reporting side. However, if there are gaps in the requirements to report, we will not be found wanting in giving the necessary powers requiring the professions concerned to make disclosures. I am not aware of gaps and I am not sure if the Deputy is referring to any particular example. I am not aware of legislation required on foot of the findings in the Ansbacher or any other inquiry. The report of the NIB inquiry is due shortly, which may raise issues that require legislative changes, and if that is the case, they will be forthcoming.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	232	I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 42 together.The number of redundancies notified to my Department in the years mentioned was 13,316 in 2000, 19,977 in 2001, 25,358 in 2002, and 20,150 in the period from January to September 2003. Notified redundancies in September 2003 were 61% higher than in September 2002. However, the pattern over many years is that the number of redundancies fluctuated substantially from month to month. A more meaningful comparison would be January to September when notified redundancies were 4.6% higher this year than the corresponding period last year.The increased level of redundancies reflects slower economic activity in Ireland in line with difficult economic conditions worldwide. Although the Irish economy performed sluggishly in the first half of 2003, growth is expected to pick up next year as conditions in the global economy continue to improve.However, given the open nature of the Irish economy, the Government's focus will be on maintaining competitiveness which is critical to sustaining and developing the manufacturing and international traded service sectors. Enterprise development here is facing a number of challenges, including significantly reduced export growth, increased competition from low-cost locations and cost and other factors adversely impacting on competitiveness.Ireland's ability to compete with the emerging markets of central Europe, India and China for services and manufacturing activities that drove our earlier success is hampered by the rising cost of doing business here. Our strategic response must be informed by these realities and by the certainty that competition, resulting from globalisation and technological change, will continue to intensify. The changed domestic and global  economic context means that Ireland's enterprise policy, which drove our success in the 1990s, based on the advantages of a plentiful supply of skilled and relatively inexpensive labour, a flexible business environment and low corporation tax, will no longer suffice. Future enterprise policy should facilitate the State and industry to create the conditions that will make possible a sustained shift to higher skill, higher value added and a more knowledge-intensive enterprise economy.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	233	Does the Tánaiste accept that while we still have a relatively low rate of unemployment, the figures she has just quoted give cause for concern and require a response? Does she accept that the manpower employment outlook survey published last month showed that almost one fifth of employers will lay off staff this year and just 12% of companies responding to that analysis indicated they intended to hire new employees this year? Does she accept this is in stark contrast to the same survey results last year which showed employers much more confident with just 6% saying they would let workers go and 24% planning to hire new staff? What measures have been taken by her Department to identify redundancies pending, to support vulnerable companies and what early warning mechanisms have been installed in her Department to alert her to potential redundancies?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	234	I will answer the last part of the Deputy's question first. The early warning system in the Department is constantly reviewed and revamped. It is not a perfect system and obviously requires us to be informed by the companies or by the agencies who are in turn informed by the companies. We operate a system where the State agencies involved with enterprise, both Enterprise Ireland on the indigenous side and IDA Ireland on the foreign direct investment side, are in constant touch with what we would call vulnerable sectors or vulnerable companies. A year ago Enterprise Ireland put a competitiveness fund together to help specific companies in particular sectors to overcome particular difficulties.We cannot be complacent and what has happened is worrying. There is no doubt that there is less confidence but we developed employment over the last year by approximately 28,500 and a considerable number of those jobs, 12,000, were in the private sector. Although it is not as optimistic or as upbeat as it was a number of years ago, it is still a far from gloomy picture. The quarterly household survey published recently indicated that people were generally optimistic for the remainder of 2003 and into next year. We believe that the upturn in the global economy led by the United States in particular and to a lesser extent by the Asian economy recovery, will  greatly aid Irish economic recovery. I do not want that to take away from the fact that we cannot be complacent. The number of redundancies sometimes obviously reflect the downturn but they also reflect many of the changes that are occurring. People are losing jobs in the vulnerable manufacturing sector while new jobs are being created in different sectors. The big challenge is to equip those losing their jobs with the skills to take up the new jobs that are being created in different sectors.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	235	The remit of Enterprise Ireland allows equity to be put into indigenous industry but it does not allow for grant assistance to be introduced too often and it is very reluctant to do so. There is an early warning system in that Enterprise Ireland is given advance notice of troubles in various companies that are about to close but it is often hampered by what it can do, not only by the policy but also by EU rules. Notwithstanding that EU rules seem to be used as an excuse on various occasions for its lack of involvement in the early stages to resolve an issue of potential company closure, there are approximately 11 different EU countries—

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	237	Is the Minister aware that there are 11 different sets of grant assistance in several EU countries that are far more generous to the prospect of inward investment than there is in Ireland? There seem to be no common EU agreements. There are rules but not agreements with regard to what is common and what can be used as incentives by any member state in order to attract inward investment.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	238	On inward investment, the most recent EU policy requires large scale projects to be notified to the EU and this is a semi-clearance mechanism. The state aid rules dictate the level of assistance that may be given and that is substantially less now than it used to be. It would be mistaken to think that if we were to plough a whole load of money into a lot of companies we would do better. We put a lot of money into companies in the 1970s and 1980s with very little effect and very high levels of failure. All the companies grant aided in 1973 had gone to the wall 25 years later. Grant aid in itself is not a strategy to sustain companies if there are underlying difficulties and if the company is not going to succeed.If indigenous companies have short-term difficulties to overcome, we have the flexibility to assist with short-term issues and Enterprise Ireland has done that. At the end of the day our companies have to be able to sell their products by growing sales, opening doors and finding opportunities in overseas markets, particularly in the eurozone market. We are exploiting the  Chinese and the American markets to great effect but we need to do more in the eurozone where we could capture greater opportunities.

There are vulnerable, modern high-tech jobs also going.Does the Minister accept that characterising it as a global phenomenon is not entirely true since the analogous survey to the one I am quoting for the Republic of Ireland shows the reverse is the case in Northern Ireland and a much more optimistic view of the 200 companies surveyed there about their employment prospects for this year?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	240	While the company was in the electronics field, the Celbridge jobs were not very high skilled. There are electronics companies with low skill activity and they find it difficult to compete. Notwithstanding what we are saying, the level of foreign direct investment in 2002 over 2001 was up 19%. Statistics can prove anything. We are still doing remarkably well. The issue is whether we can convert the losses into alternative opportunities for those losing their jobs and that is a huge challenge requiring ongoing investment in training, upskilling and education. More flexible training policies are being delivered at company and ground level, not all through formal training or formal education. That is the direction we have been taking in the recent past.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	241	Approximately 30 FÁS projects are  either fully or partially engaged in providing services and supports for homeless people. Of these, 14 projects are located in Dublin. Most of the Dublin projects are located in central areas in the city. The services provided by the projects include: accommodation services; advisory services; rehabilitative and personal development services; counselling and other support services; food preparation and distribution; clothes distribution; and charity shops. The services that these projects deliver represent a substantial commitment by FÁS to addressing the needs of homeless people. FÁS has engaged with the cross-departmental team on homelessness and the Homeless Agency. Senior staff members from FÁS have been active as representatives on both bodies.In this regard FÁS has provided a full outline of its training, employment and community services and supports to a group of homeless service providers at a briefing in the Homeless Agency on 9 July 2003. This was designed to inform homeless service providers on the range and type of programmes provided by FÁS, including information on how FÁS programmes can be accessed by homeless people and to explore ways in which service providers could advocate with FÁS on behalf of homeless people. Service providers were advised that FÁS employment services in central Dublin would act as advocates for their homeless clients in their interaction with FÁS employment services offices that act as the point of access to all FÁS services. FÁS has reached agreement with the cross-departmental team on homelessness and the Homeless Agency that this method of service operation is the most appropriate way to meeting its commitments under the integrated strategy for homelessness. In addition, FÁS has initiated discussions with the Homeless Agency on future joint briefing workshops and other co-operative initiatives aimed at assisting homeless service providers in accessing the full range of FÁS services for its clients.

Will he accept that Homelessness – An Integrated Strategy, was introduced in May 2000 following a doubling in the official homelessness figures? Will he further accept that there is a lack of monitoring and evaluation of progress under the scheme? What specific measures does he intend to put in place to ensure that the commitments in the scheme are monitored and to whom does he intend providing the data in terms of reporting progress on the initiative?

We are most anxious to ensure that there is a greater response by FÁS to the homelessness issue. There is a need for greater integration of services across a number of departments. I do not disagree with the point made by the Deputy.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	244	I understand that the Competition Authority received a complaint about the pedigree dog market and that the authority investigated the complaint under the Competition Act 2002. The authority is an independent statutory body with responsibility for enforcement of competition law in the State and it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on the matter. With regard to the use of its resources, the chairperson of the authority is accountable directly to the public accounts committee under section 38 of the Competition Act 2002.

I asked the Minister if she considered this an appropriate use of resources at a time when there are more important areas where there is a lack of competition in the market, such as legal, banking and waste collection services. Two years ago Offaly County Council asked the Competition Authority—

Does the Minister accept that there are greater priories for the deployment of the Competition Authority's resources than investigating the possibility of an Irish Kennel Club monopoly?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	250	The authority must investigate all complaints brought to its attention. I do not know the extent of the resources devoted to this investigation. I read Mr. Whittaker's article, as I am sure  did the Deputy. It is written in colourful language so I can see why it inspired the question. In deciding whether to carry out an investigation, the authority has to decide the size of the market, the economic impact of the possible breaches of company law, the quality of the evidence, the precedent value and the effect it may have in deterring others.The authority is currently involved in many serious investigations. This is only one of a number of investigations it has carried out. It secured agreement from the Kennel Club which promised not to deter, penalise or discipline its members if they took part as judges in events sponsored by other doggie groups. It may be that this commitment was made quickly and easily.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	251	While it might appear to be a frivolous matter, the decision is unlikely to have earth shattering results for the monopolistic nature of the pedigree dog market. The Competition Authority could better investigate matters which are more deserving of the deployment of its resources.Can the Minister justify this investigation by the Competition Authority? She is the policy maker with political responsibility to the Oireachtas for the manner in which the authority deploys its resources. In this time of scarcity there are more pressing issues that require to be investigated due to allegations of monopolistic activities. At a time when the cost base of business and retailing is increasing every day, there are other matters which require more urgent investigation than a rival organisation of the Irish Kennel Club having a go at it. Will the Minister undertake to direct the Competition Authority to take a more focused and strategic approach in the deployment of its resources? She needs to provide leadership regarding the areas that require immediate investigation into anti-monopolistic activities.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	252	The legislation was passed by the Oireachtas and after that it is a matter for the authority to implement it. It would be a dangerous precedent for me to tell it which matters to investigate. Funny and all as this matter may appear to be – and there is a humorous side to it – it is best left to the authority, which is independent in its functions and operations. I am sure the chairman will read with great interest, as I know he always does, the contributions of Deputies. We have a terrific chairman who never leaves a stone unturned in observing what is said about the authority.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	255	I was very disappointed at the recent announcement by 3Com that it is to close its manufacturing facility at Ballycoolin Business Park, Blanchardstown, County Dublin, with the loss of 640 jobs, due to global restructuring and existing difficulties in the marketplace. The announcement is a blow to the workers, their families and the wider community. The facility will close by February 2004, with redundancies commencing the end of November 2003.I understand that the company is offering a generous redundancy package and assistance in obtaining alternative employment. FÁS has also informed the company that its full range of services will be made available to those being made redundant. Enterprise Ireland, in conjunction with Fingal County Enterprise Board, is organising an enterprise day on Wednesday 29 October 2003 in the Draíocht arts theatre in the Blanchardstown Centre. This will be a high profile event to promote enterprise job creation in the Blanchardstown area.IDA Ireland's strategy for the West Dublin area is to attract and encourage expansion of foreign direct investment projects, moving up the value chain while doing so. In this regard, I was pleased with the announcement in September, by eBay and its associated company PayPal, that they will locate their new European business centres at Blanchardstown. The investment will create up to 800 new jobs by 2005, with recruitment already under way for the PayPal operations.Swords Laboratories Limited, a pharmaceutical facility located at Cruiserath, Blanchardstown, is currently being commissioned. It is projected that 500 staff will be employed at the facility when full production commences. Recruitment is now under way, with 90 positions already filled.I wish to assure Deputy Burton, that the State agencies, under the auspices of my Department, will continue to work closely in the interests of developing the west Dublin area.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	256	I thank the Minister for her reply. The question remains; what precisely is she prepared to do for the 3Com workers? This company has been a good employer. In many ways it was the talisman industry in west Dublin, having been established in the early 1990s and expanded during the birth of the Celtic tiger. Many of its workers were employed in relatively low-skill manufacturing jobs. As the Minister said, they gave excellent service. What will the Minister do  for these young people with heavy family and mortgage commitments?In the Blanchardstown area, as in the parts of the Minister's constituency in Lucan and Clondalkin, there is a complete crisis of confidence, particularly in more deprived communities and areas of local authority housing. This is compounded by the closure of options regarding community employment schemes and others. Will the Minister provide specific training to upskill the 3Com workers in order that they can compete for the welcome jobs in developments like eBay, otherwise a whole generation of workers will be made redundant without any job alternatives being put in place? Job losses are not just happening in Blanchardstown, they are occurring in every town in Ireland.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	257	As the Deputy is aware, the reason for these jobs losses is that the company has decided to outsource the production of network adapters due to the oversupply in the global market. The decision was taken to outsource this work rather than have it as part of its core business, even though the Irish operation was quite successful. FÁS will offer re-training where it is required. It has already engaged with the workforce. It is easier to do this in the Dublin area. We sometimes need to put training facilities in place on the ground in areas where no training centres exist.Many companies in west Dublin and north Kildare are currently recruiting and are interested in acquiring the skills of these workers. I understand the workers concerned come from Blanchardstown, Palmerstown and surrounding areas. Training will be forthcoming for those who need or want to be upskilled for alternative jobs. The company is anxious to participate in the provision of alternative training.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	258	The company has been very good and in fairness to its Irish management as well as its international management, they tried to stave off the evil day in Blanchardstown for as long as possible but the global downturn in IT damaged them. I do not detect any sense of urgency in the Minister's response. Would this be the case if the loss of 640 jobs happened anywhere else in Ireland where people have been working for ten and 11 years? I spoke to one young woman who has worked in 3Com for nine years and would like to upgrade her skills. No specific resources are being provided nor are any specific efforts being made by the Department to bring a message of hope to these workers as Christmas approaches. Apart from the general resources provided to everybody by FÁS, what is the Minister doing for Blanchardstown and the workers in the company under discussion in the context of such a heavy and concentrated loss of jobs?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	259	In the Blanchardstown area, along  the M50, we have announced the creation of 8,000 new jobs over the past three years. That is considerably more than in most places. We do not have a specific programme for each company as that is neither realistic nor possible. However, the facilities and services provided by FÁS have the flexibility to offer the person to whom the Deputy refers what she requires. I do not wish to concentrate on one person as there is much more at stake. I am optimistic that whatever upskilling or re-training is required can be made available by FÁS and I will ensure that is the case.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	260	The Deputy should note that, as the High Court award in this case arose from a civil action by way of a plenary summons, the labour inspectorate of my Department has no role in pursuing this particular aspect of the matter. Labour inspectorate investigations into the employment rights aspect of this case are concluded and the case is now with my Department's legal advisers.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	261	The Minister's reply is identical to the one provided on 1 July in answer to a similar question. At issue is the exploitation of Brazilian workers who were brought to this country. I do not expect the Minister to deal with the High Court aspect of the case, but I expect her to move forward on the assertion she made on 1 July that the legal advisers of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment were informing her of the appropriate next step. Months have passed.The people to whom I refer are the most vulnerable group of people imaginable. They were brought here with the prospect of reasonable employment and wages. Brazilians who were employed as cleaners under work permit were completely abused and exploited in, according to the High Court, a quite despicable fashion. I expected that by now the Minister would have reached out to these vulnerable people instead of repeating verbatim a reply she gave months ago to people whose circumstances have not improved one jot since.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	262	I do not wish to talk about the specific cases involving these individuals as three of them have left the country and issues arose  regarding information that was forthcoming from others. I will refer to the general position.There are a considerable number of foreign workers in our economy, perhaps as many as 100,000. The general view is that while 45,000 are here on work permits, an equal number are here from other EU member states. The number of complaints received is very low in comparison to the numbers involved, but the law is applied with vigour and determination where we can find people who are willing to stand up. It is not always easy to do that. I accept that these individuals are very vulnerable which is why we have gone out of our way to provide resources to the voluntary groups that help foreign workers. We have also translated much of the information available on employment rights legislation into the major foreign languages to make individuals aware of their rights. In advance of issuing a work permit, details of rights available under Irish law are sent to the potential recipients. They confirm that they have read and understood them.We should not exaggerate abuse, which happens on few occasions. While it should not happen, where it is brought to the attention of the inspectors in my Department, it is pursued with greater vigour than might be the case in respect of an Irish person. This is because I realise that people in this situation are extremely vulnerable and can be exploited. A permit is not given again in respect of persons who have mistreated workers. This is an effective deterrent and the law will be applied.I am sorry if this is the same answer that was given before. I am not running away from my responsibility. I am answering this question on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, who is more au fait with the matter than I am. In all cases, complaints are pursued with great vigour by my Department. Sometimes, unfortunately, complaints are not brought to our attention and we have to read about them in the newspapers. In such circumstances, it is very difficult for the Department to be proactive.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	263	I hope the Minister was not suggesting that I tried to overstate the matter. I am concerned about this particular case. It is important in this new era, in which we are accepting non-nationals to work, to welcome them into our community. Where such obviously despicable treatment as outlined in the High Court case occurs, we must be strongly proactive. It was not good enough for the Minister to inform the House on 1 July that the labour inspectorate investigations into the employment rights aspect of this case were concluded and that her Department was preparing the matter for transmission to its legal advisers who will advise on the next appropriate step, only to supply the same answer again in October. That does not indicate that this case is being taken as seriously as it merits.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	264	There are legal issues involved in this case and they are the reason for the delay. I wish to move away from the case, therefore, to the general issue raised by the Deputy. I assure him that my officials, the Minister of State and I take these complaints extremely seriously. Many of our own citizens have worked abroad and some, unfortunately, have been exploited. We define ourselves as a society in terms of how we treat the most vulnerable, particularly those that come here to work. The Deputy should be assured that no resources will be spared in the enforcement of the law in relation to these matters.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	266	As Members head off for yet another week of recess, compliant taxpayers are left reeling at the latest series of revelations regarding offshore tax evasion via accounts held in the Isle of Man. I refer to the prominent stories on the front page of last week's Sunday Independent which referred to €4 billion held on the island.The Dáil is entitled to demand from the Minister for Finance an estimate of the amounts  involved in the latest revelations. Given that the Exchequer has already benefited to the tune of over €110 million from the Bank of Ireland's Jersey trusts in recent months, it is not unreasonable to suggest that the sums involved in the latest revelations will be between €100 million and €600 million. I also want to know what steps the Minister for Finance is taking to examine the offshore activities of every Irish bank and financial institution over the last 20 years, not just on the Isle of Man, but other islands from Jersey to the Caymans. At a time when hospitals and schools are crying out for money, we need to know how much has been taken from the tax pool. Banks and financial institutions must be challenged as to how they enabled this widespread evasion and corruption to take place.It is not good enough for Irish banks to sponsor corporate responsibility programmes and boast of responsible corporate citizenship when up to now they have actively pursued a programme, which facilitated an extraordinary amount of tax evasion. The banks must explain how so many Irish people came to believe that the appropriate home for their tax free money was their Irish bank's friendly subsidiary on some offshore island. It cannot all have been down to the initiative of bank clerks in country branches. Does the Minister propose to challenge the banks and their boards and the financial institutions to come clean?The silence of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, on the implications of these further revelations speaks volumes on the continued toleration by Fianna Fáil and the Government of tax evasion. It is imperative we develop a fair and transparent tax system, not only to fund essential services such as schools and hospitals but also to reassure compliant PAYE taxpayers that others, especially the well-off, are paying their fair share.If there is one thing successive inquiries have shown, it is that the volume of money transferred from Ireland to offshore havens is greater than anyone could have supposed. Those who argued there was no pot of gold from tax evaders have been shown to be wrong time and again. Despite this, the Minister for Finance continues to be blasé about tax evasion. One gets the sense that placating contributors to Fianna Fáil rates far higher on the list of priorities than reforming the tax system.Rates of personal taxation, income tax and PRSI in this country are now among the lowest in Europe while the Minister has repeatedly boasted of slashing capital gains tax rates. In such a low tax environment it is difficult to understand the continued tolerance of tax evasion. It seems Irish taxpayers now have as positive a relationship with taxation as the Germans had with inflation post the Weimar Republic and the war years.My concerns centre on the significant number who, by using any of the various devices available, are effectively avoiding paying their fair share. There is a significant group of very wealthy people in Ireland who not only want a low tax regime but effectively want a no tax regime for themselves. This has a damaging impact on other compliant taxpayers, especially in relation to any sense of social or community purpose in funding services we all require such as education and health.Taxation is a contract between the citizen and the State whereby we collectively pay for those services we deem essential. These revelations further poison that contract and the development of a mature economy with good public services.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	267	I am making this reply on behalf of the Minister for Finance.There is no tolerance of tax evasion on the Government benches and no question of any attitude of tolerance of tax evasion on the part of the Government. The Minister for Finance does not have a blasé attitude to it. No Minister for Finance since the foundation of the State has introduced so much legislation to tackle the problem. He has been in a position to do this because he has reduced basic personal income tax rates to levels acceptable to taxpayers. In that context, he has also introduced far stiffer powers and penalties to deal with those who engage in tax evasion.It is understood that the recent reports to which the Deputy referred and the figure of €4 billion may refer to a KPMG study done in 1999. In so far as such funds may indicate tax evasion involving offshore structures, the priority is to determine the extent to which either the underlying moneys and/or the income earned thereon may not have been returned for tax in this country. The Revenue Commissioners are now actively investigating this.There are two separate components relating to tax evasion, of which the first is the underlying funds and, the second, the income earned by them. Not all of the funds may have evaded tax. In some cases an Irish address account holder may not be resident for tax purposes for a particular tax year or years. In some cases tax may have been paid on both the underlying funds and the income arising from them. In some cases the underlying funds are clean but the income earned has not been returned for tax purposes. Clean underlying funds come from insurance settlements, inheritances, lottery winnings, foreign earnings, sale of a foreign residence when returning to live in Ireland, pension lump sum payments and so on. In many of these cases the interest or other income earned on the funds might not have been returned for tax purposes.The Revenue Commissioners had been concerned for some time about Irish residents using  the facilities of offshore subsidiaries of Irish financial institutions to hide money in trusts or deposits. Revenue has established an offshore assets group whose remit is to investigate the placing of assets offshore by Irish residents for purposes of tax evasion. The initial focus of the group has been on the Bank of Ireland trusts in Jersey. When the bank became aware that Revenue was interested in the trusts, it wrote to its customers to advise them of Revenue's inquiries. It reminded its customers of the standard voluntary disclosure arrangements available to anybody with a tax problem. The immediate consequence of these developments is that Revenue has had a fairly significant disclosure from 254 individuals who have paid €100 million. A further 30 people, approximately, who became aware that Revenue was starting this type of inquiry paid another €11 million.In his recent appearance before the Committee of Public Accounts Mr. Frank Daly, Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, pointed out that almost all of the developments in this area could be attributed to the 1999 powers introduced by the Minister for Finance which allow the Revenue Commissioners to examine financial institutions in a way that was not possible previously. The Finance Act 1999 provided substantial additional powers for Revenue, including the facilitating of greater access to material held by or in financial institutions; allowing access to the account of a named individual by way of an order issued by one of the three Revenue Commissioners where previously High Court approval was required; broadening the existing powers of access to financial accounts of named individuals and providing for access in the case of a group or class of unidentified persons; empowering Revenue to apply to the courts for search warrants to gain evidence of accounts for the purpose of criminal investigations; and permitting Revenue to conduct on-site audits of a bank's affairs, not just a PAYE or VAT audit as had been the case up to then, and enabling Revenue to obtain a greater range of information from third parties. The Act also provided for the closure of certain tax loopholes in regard to offshore trusts and companies and the transfer of assets abroad. Subsequent Finance Acts also provided additional powers.All of these provisions have been used to good effect and in recent times brought in substantial revenues in tax, interest and penalties. Apart from the recent investigation in relation to offshore deposits already referred to, they have facilitated successful investigations into Ansbacher, the Clerical Medical National Irish Bank scheme, as well as the look-back audit of the financial institutions and the identification of bogus non-resident account holders. In addition, the Government has provided significant additional resources for Revenue, an additional  400 posts in recent years, and facilitated a restructuring of the organisation.The Revenue Commissioners' statement of strategy, 2003-05, contains a strong emphasis on maximising compliance. Among the key developments aimed at improving tax compliance and tackling tax evasion, apart from the offshore assets group, are the establishment of an investigations and prosecutions division to deal with the prosecutions of persons involved in serious tax evasion and a large cases division with a specific focus on large companies and wealthy individuals.While the ongoing investigations are yielding significant sums of money, a bigger strategic issue for the Revenue Commissioners is the creation of a culture of tax compliance. Citizens and all persons resident here have to realise that tax pays for services. The message is very clear that anyone who hides money or evades tax will be pursued by the Revenue Commissioners. Unlike those who had the opportunity to do so, the Government has backed the efforts to tackle evasion with important and effective legislative initiatives and provided extra resources for those doing this job.

He said the State would act to redress the matter and provide compensation. The Residential Institutions Redress Bill was introduced approximately three years later, in April 2002, and a further eight months elapsed before the Residential Institutions Redress Board was established, at the end of December 2002.I dealt with the Bill in the Seanad on behalf of the Labour Party. I asked the then Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, about the position of various institutions not included in the schedule of institutions which at the time comprised in excess of 100. He said it was incomplete but that the legislation allowed for ministerial order to extend the number, and that this would be done. When I raised the name of one or two institutions, one of which – Bethany House – I have been pursuing since, I was given the impression it would be done quickly. I took the matter up with the Minister and the departmental civil servants dealing with him at the time.Bethany House is a Protestant institution but Protestant institutions are not covered by the Residential Institutions Redress Board as they are not included in the schedule of institutions. A number of other institutions were also omitted. When I raised this matter with the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Dempsey, this time a year ago, he replied that as the schedule was not exhaustive, institutions could be included  as they were identified and that Bethany House was one of a number of homes being considered in that regard. In response to a further question I put to him on 18 February the Minister replied: "It is my intention that a draft order will be prepared and brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas in the near future."  That was some time ago so I do not know how the Minister determines what is the near future. I am very concerned that there has been no amendment, that it is four and a half years since the apology was made and the commitment given, that the legislation has been tortuously slow in getting up and running and the board being established and that there are whole categories of people in other institutions who cannot, even at this point, apply to the board because they are not included in the schedule. Unless one happens to have been in an institution included in the schedule, one is forbidden from applying for compensation to the Residential Institutions Redress Board.Many of the people involved are quite elderly. Obviously between now and when the apology was made four and a half years ago, countless numbers of people who might have gone to the board for some form of redress have died and others will die before they get any compensation from the State. It is not good enough that we should put off the extension of the number of institutions included in the present schedule. I ask the Minister to accept what his predecessor said, that is, that the schedule was incomplete and there are other institutions which need to be added to the list. Many people are under stress waiting for that to take place and have not been able to get any comfort from the Department of Education and Science. It would be a small matter for the Department to introduce a ministerial order but it would be a very big step for many people who have suffered.I urge the Minister to fulfil his commitment and issue that order as quickly as possible.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	269	I am pleased to reply to the Deputy on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science. I wish to outline to the House the current position regarding the inclusion of additional institutions on the schedule of the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002.The Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002 was signed into law by the President on 10 April 2002. The Act provided for the establishment of both the Residential Institutions Redress Board and the Residential Institutions Redress Review Committee. Both the Residential Institutions Redress Board and the Residential Institutions Redress Review Committee have been put in place and are fully operational.Judge Sean O'Leary, a judge of the Circuit Court, has been appointed chairperson of the redress board and six other members have also been appointed. The review committee is chaired by Mr. Justice Frank Murphy, a former Supreme  Court judge and two other members have also been appointed. A total of 27 administrative staff have been appointed to the redress board and the review committee.The latest information available to the Department of Education and Science indicates that the redress board has received approximately 2,000 applications to date and has made awards or settlements in approximately 200 cases. The Minister for Education and Science understands that the average award to date has been €80,700 and that awards including interim awards have varied between €10,000 and €250,000. The board continues to receive approximately 50 applications per week.The purpose of the Act is to set up a framework to enable victims of institutional abuse to apply for redress. The awards are being made in line with the recommendations of the Ryan report, chaired by the then senior counsel, Mr. Seán Ryan. These are equivalent to the level of awards made by the High Court. The Ryan report specifically did not discount the awards to be made by the redress board, even though there is no need to prove liability before the board and the process is far less adversarial.An applicant is expected to provide proof of his or her identity, that he or she was resident in an institution, that he or she was injured while so resident and that the injury is consistent with any allegation of abuse alleged to have occurred while so resident. An applicant may accept or reject an award made to him or her or may submit the award for review to the review committee.In framing the legislation the Government was conscious that it was putting in place structures to provide redress for victims of abuse and to bring closure to this tragic period of Irish history that spanned almost six decades. At present 128 institutions are listed in the schedule to the Act. Section 4 of the Act enables additional institutions identified as reformatory, industrial, orphanages, children's homes and special schools in respect of which a public body had a regulatory or inspection function to be added to the schedule.The Department of Education and Science has received correspondence from both individuals and survivor groups identifying a number of additional institutions that may be eligible for inclusion in the schedule. Discussions have taken place between the Department of Education and Science and other Departments that provided a regulatory function in the operation of these facilities in order to ascertain whether these institutions were, in fact, eligible for inclusion. The initial information received in some cases was scant due to the long period that had elapsed since the institutions were closed, therefore the process of verifying each of these institutions had been time consuming.The institutions being considered at present include some institutions which were managed by the Protestant community. It is the intention of the Minister for Education and Science that a list  of additional institutions will be brought before both Houses of the Oireachtas as soon as the verification process is completed.

First, I wish to acknowledge the excellent service provided by the search and rescue service since it was established in the north-west. Their dedication to duty and the commitment and efficiency of the crews are what we have come to expect from the Defence Forces. On many occasions in the past I had to request their services when emergencies arose on our offshore islands and they always, if at all possible, responded positively. I know I can speak on behalf of many coastal communities, including the inhabitants of our offshore islands, particularly Tory Island, as they would wish me to express their gratitude and appreciation in the Dáil.For many years we did not have such a service in the north-west, nor on the western seaboard. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, a number of sea tragedies off Donegal resulted in the loss of many fishermen's' lives. I refer to the tragic loss of three fishing vessels in particular, the Skiford, the Carraig Una and the Evelyn Marie. During these tragic years, there were no search and rescue facilities in the west or north-west. Lives could perhaps have been saved if they had been in place.Ultimately, it was the tragic death of a skipper, the late John Ogelsby who haemorrhaged to death as a result of an accident aboard his fishing boat that initiated a campaign, led at the time by Joey Murrin and Joan McGinley to name but two, that resulted in the establishment of a search and rescue facility in the north west.In the past ten years many missions have been successfully executed and many lives saved. However, over the past three weeks the service in the north-west has virtually collapsed following a decision to remove and reassign crew members to other duties.Fishermen and other mariners are now operating without the umbrella of a locally based rescue service, which is completely unacceptable. The north-west coast is one of the most exposed and treacherous coastlines in Ireland, if not in Europe. The absence of a rescue service on the threshold of winter is unthinkable and could endanger more lives in communities which have suffered so much in the past.The winch crew members who have been removed have the highest concentration of bravery awards in the entire Defence Forces, with 16 distinguished service medals. In recent times they have become increasingly concerned that a fatal accident could occur as a result of the way the service is being run. Before their demotion, 11 of the men had already applied for pre-discharge  leave due to their growing concerns about a fatal accident. I understand their applications have been turned down. They claimed conditions were becoming intolerable. I understand that temporary arrangements are now being put in place to give cover to the north-west. These services are based at Shannon and Baldonnel, with back-up facilities by the Royal Navy Helicopter Squadron at Prestwick and the British Maritime and Coastguard Agency based at Stornoway in Scotland.This cover is completely inadequate. Everyone knows that time is a crucial factor in search and rescue missions. Minutes mean the difference between life and death. The extra time it takes to fly from Shannon Airport or Scotland can be critical. This temporary arrangement does not meet the needs of the north-west. We are regressing to square one to the situation over ten years ago before we had any such service.The north-west fought a long battle to have a comprehensive and efficient rescue service in the area. It has served us well. Now it has been critically reduced to a stage where only a search can be carried out. The rescue element has been completely withdrawn due to the fact that winch crews have been reassigned. One could say with justification that it is no longer search and rescue but search and wave.I appeal to the Minister to address this serious issue. Issues of safety and other grievances have been reported. Surely it is not impossible to have them addressed and resolved satisfactorily. We want the service restored as soon as possible because every day and hour brings its dangers.

Níl mé ag déanamh an freagra ar son an Aire Cosanta.The Irish Coast Guard, part of the Department, was advised on Friday, 10 October 2003 that the Air Corps helicopter based at Sligo Airport would have no winching capability over that weekend due to personnel being ill. This meant that the helicopter would be unable to undertake any rescue involving a winch lift, thus limiting its overall rescue capability. The full service resumed on Monday, 12 October. However, the Coast Guard was again notified on Friday, 17 October that the winching personnel were ill and that the helicopter would have no winching capability over that weekend also. Since that date, no winching capability has been available on the helicopter at the airport. I stress that any matters relating to personnel illness in the Air Corps are primarily ones for the Air Corps and the Department of Defence.By way of background, before this incident arose, the Air Corps marine emergency service helicopter was providing a 12 hour, daylight, "all weather" operation. The introduction of a full 24 hour search and rescue service was planned to commence in mid-November. In response to the current situation the Irish Coast Guard is provid ing 24 hour "all weather" emergency response cover, involving full winching services, from Shannon Airport. The 24 hour helicopter service located in Dublin is also on standby where the need arises. In addition, the United Kingdom Coastguard and Royal Navy have helicopters based at Stornaway and Preswick Airport which are also available to the Coast Guard, if required.The Coast Guard is advising fishermen and mariners in the north-west that in the event of an incidence of either sickness or an accident to a crew member or to a vessel, they should advise the Coast Guard as soon as possible of the situation so as to allow for the repositioning of a helicopter, if this is the most appropriate facility to task. It should also be emphasised that helicopters are not the only rescue facilities available in the case of an emergency and that there are many distress situations in which other forms of emergency response are suitable. These other rescue services include a fleet of purpose built lifeboats provided and operated by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution. The RNLI provides cover up to 50 miles off the coast of Ireland with its "all weather" lifeboats. It also provides lifeboats off the County Donegal and County Mayo coasts, including Arranmore, Buncrana, Sligo, Bundoran and Ballyglass and Portrush, Northern Ireland. These facilities are also available to the Coast Guard. In addition, the Coast Guard has rescue and support boats at Bunbeg, Mulroy, Greencastle and Killybegs in County Donegal and Killala on the County Mayo coast.The Department of Defence and the Air Corps are exploring many options to assist the Coast Guard to return to a 24 hour service in the north-west as quickly as possible. It is being kept fully informed of their progress and in the meantime will continue to respond to any incidents that arise through the utilisation of the significant emergency response.

#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	274	I thank the Chair for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment. I urge the Minister for Health and Children to approve an allocation of €3.2 million for the South-Eastern Health Board to permit the opening of the new surgical unit at St. Joseph's Hospital, Clonmel. I hope the Minister of State will be in a position to give us some good news in the matter, the background to which is the fact that acute surgical services in south Tipperary  have been divided for many years between Our Lady's Hospital, Cashel, which provides surgical services and St. Joseph's Hospital, Clonmel, which has traditionally provided medical and maternity services. Many difficulties were encountered in the division of services. Even the best efforts of staff meant a less than adequate service was available to patients for many years.Approximately ten years ago there was a decision and an agreement to amalgamate all of the acute surgical services on the campus at St. Joseph's Hospital. Following seven or eight frustrating years, the facilities for the transfer of the services were in place at the hospital and ready for occupation from 31 March 2003. The facilities available include an accident and emergency department, a CSSD unit, 39 surgical beds, three operating theatres, an intensive care unit, a day care unit, including a dedicated endoscopy suite, a cardiac rehabilitation unit, a CT unit, a medical ward, a coronary step-down unit, a medical assessment unit and a library and education centre. This development cost in the region of €25 million to €30 million. It has been a long drawn out process which has frustrated staff and patients alike in both hospitals and throughout County Tipperary.The position is that while the facilities are available and ready for occupation, they remain empty due to the fact that the Department has not approved funding for their staffing. They have been available for occupation since March. The South-Eastern Health Board met staff and agreed staffing levels which have been pared to the bone. It has forwarded a request to the Department for a sum of €3.2 million to enable this development which is urgently needed to continue. The facilities for patients will be adequate and of an acceptable standard. The difficulties arising from a patient point of view, where surgical patients at Cashel with an underlying medical difficulty have to be transferred to Clonmel and medical patients at Clonmel with an underlying surgical difficulty have to be transferred to Cashel, will come to an end, as will the associated dangers for the health and lives of patients. This will happen only if the Department funds the development and the opening of these facilities.Hospital staff were informed earlier in the year that the facilities would be opened at the end of March. They were later informed that they would open in June and then in September but all to no avail. I ask the Department to approve immediately the provision of funding to staff the facilities and allow them to open. This will have knock-on effects for the Cashel site in the sense that staff will be necessary for a significant development being undertaken there. I ask the Minister to approve the allocation of €3.2 million requested by the South-Eastern Health Board.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	275	I am replying on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin.I avail of the opportunity to set out the position on the development of hospital services at St. Joseph's Hospital, Clonmel. The Deputy is well aware that the provision of hospital services for south Tipperary is a matter for the South-Eastern Health Board. The south Tipperary hospital agreement signed in January 1996, paved the way for development of hospital services in the region and the bringing together of surgery and medicine on a single site. The Deputy outlined the relevant developments in the course of his contribution.A major capital development programme to provide the infrastructure to facilitate the transfer of surgical services from Our Lady's Hospital, Cashel, to St. Joseph's Hospital, Clonmel, was undertaken. The building work is now complete. This landmark development, which has to date cost in the region of €30 million, involves the provision of a new accident and emergency department, ward accommodation, operating theatres , an intensive care unit, a day care unit, a central sterile supplies department, a physical medicine department, an education centre and consulting rooms. Following the transfer of the surgical services, Our Lady's Hospital will be used to provide services for the elderly and also services for those with mental and physical disabilities.In this context the Minister for Health and Children gave approval to the South-Eastern Health Board last year to proceed with the building of the first phase of the new capital development at Our Lady's Hospital, Cashel. The estimated overall capital investment for the first phase of this development is in the region of €12 million and will provide the following facilities on the site: A 20-bed elderly mentally infirm unit; a 12-place supervised hostel for mental health services; 12 independent living units or respite care places for persons with physical disability; a day hospital or day centre for mental health services and a day centre for persons with physical disabilities.The Cashel project, together with the major construction project completed at St. Joseph's Hospital, Clonmel, represents a significant capital investment for the development of health services in south Tipperary. Deputy Healy acknowledged that in his contribution. This investment is an indication of this Government's commitment to the provision of optimum health care facilities to the people of the region.Last week St. Joseph's Hospital celebrated the 150th anniversary of its foundation and these celebrations coincided with the official opening of a number of new facilities at the hospital. These included a coronary care step-down unit, a medical emergency and assessment unit, a new 35-bed medical ward, a cardiac rehabilitation unit and a CT department and library-education centre.The integration of acute services on one site will greatly enhance the services available to patients in the region. The Minister for Health and Children stated that he is fully committed to achieving this objective in as timely a manner as  possible. The South-Eastern Health Board has sought significant resources to complete the transfer. Deputy Healy mentioned a staffing allocation figure of €3.2 million. This allocation is not of a capital character but represents a permanent increase in the current expenditure at the hospital.The board has been asked to finalise its discussions with staff to identify the numbers that  will transfer. It has also been asked to identify the level of services that can be provided at St. Joseph's Hospital within existing resources.The overall objective of the capital developments at Clonmel and Cashel is to ensure that the services available to the people of south Tipperary respond to their needs.The Dáil adjourned at 5.20 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 4 November 2003.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	276	Regional development is a significant focus of Government policy. Its importance has been confirmed in the current national development plan and the national spatial strategy, NSS. The latter strategy addresses the ongoing concentration of population and economic activity along the eastern seaboard, especially in the greater Dublin area, with a view to achieving balanced regional development throughout the country.The objective of the State development agencies has been to encourage the design of a strategy that will enable as many areas as possible to share in balanced regional development. The key determinants of sustained economic performance at both national and regional levels that require development through the NSS include a critical mass of innovative, high value-added enterprises across a range of technology intensive sectors; networked regional gateways and hubs; a well developed educational system and a skilled workforce; high quality physical infrastructure including a modern broadband telecommunications network; an adequate supply of housing and a high quality and sustainable environment. The State development agencies will work to ensure that the key centres under the NSS play a critical role in the promotion of balanced regional development. However, the effectiveness of their strategies will be strongly influenced by a supportive business environment in the regions.The south-east region has been successful in attracting a number of modern industries. The most notable have been Genzyme with its biotechnology facility in Waterford, Alza/Johnson & Johnson, a pharmaceutical project in Cashel, as well as PFPC in Wexford and Deutsche Bank in Kilkenny. In addition to these new substantial investments, there has been a number of notable expansions in the region from companies such as Guidant in Clonmel, AOL and Sunlife in Waterford and Lake Region in New Ross.

Participants are offered temporary full-time employment for a period of three years. There are currently in the region of 2,300 participants on the programme and the figure is set to reduce to 2,200 by the end of the year, which amounts to an overall reduction of 325 places phased over the year. Funding amounting to €35 million was provided for the programme in 2000, €44 million in 2001, €45 million in 2002 and €45 million for 2003.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	278	The report of a review group on public safety entitled, A Review of Public Safety in Ireland, was published in 2000. This group, which was established in November 1999, comprised representatives from Departments, various agencies and bodies. One of the recommendations of the review group was that an office of public safety regulation should be considered, which would not be responsible for public safety issues but would have a form of overseeing role of all the agencies and bodies involved. The review group also proposed that the functioning, appropriateness and continuing need for such an office should be reviewed within a five year period.The group was not in full agreement on its proposal due to issues relating to duplication of existing services and additional cost. Some Department representatives expressed reservations about the need for such an office and the extra burden on State finances. The current situation is that the regulation of public safety is being dealt with by a number of Departments and public bodies and they are encouraged to co-operate as closely as possible. In many cases there are memoranda of understanding and regular ongoing liaison meetings between the various authorities.The review group's recommendation was inconclusive, which questions the need for an office of public safety regulation. A clear-cut case has not been made nor a properly defined role set out for the establishment of such an office. It is not clear that the creation of another State agency, whose function is merely to oversee public safety matters, is the right way forward.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	279	The resolution of the cases at issue here was announced on 19 September. That followed an approach to my Department of behalf of Goodman Holdings in June of this year. Detailed discussions were held in the intervening period involving officials of my Department and legal teams representing both sides. Those discussions were informed by my determination that nothing could or would be entered into which might in any way inhibit the discharge of my political responsibilities in relation to public accountability and transparency.The finalisation involved agreement of both parties to the following: the company agreed to definitively withdraw its claim against the State for an amount of approximately €100 million; contested premium payments to the value of €1.47 million, which were made by the company in 1988, have been retained by the State and will not be refunded; an action taken by the State against the company for the repayment of approximately €5.046 million, a sum which the State was contractually obliged to pay at the time to a bank under the provision of the short-term finance for exports scheme, has been withdrawn. However, in the event that Iraqi debtors make compensation in this respect – a possibility, which should not be totally ruled out – the State will recoup its debt in full or in part. Each side agreed to bear its own legal costs.For the taxpayers, the outcome is highly satisfactory. As the responsible Minister, I am also satisfied with the outcome and wish to recognise the efforts of the team that, under my authority and direction, acted for the State and achieved such a positive outcome.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	281	The proposed introduction of carbon tax is in response to our international obligations under the Kyoto Protocol to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. Taxation is one of the measures included in the Government's national climate change strategy, which sets out a framework of mechanisms to help Ireland meet its international commitment.In his budget speech in December 2002, the Minister for Finance signalled the introduction of a general carbon tax from the end of 2004. The Minister indicated that full consultation with interested parties on the design of the tax would be undertaken and, to facilitate that consultation, the Department of Finance published a consultation paper on proposals for a carbon energy tax in Ireland on 30 July 2003. I understand that the submissions received in response to the consultation paper are currently being studied by the Department of Finance with a view to framing measures as part of the 2005 budget. The impact of the introduction of carbon taxes on the competitiveness of industry will obviously be influenced by the design of the tax measures.

Details of the directives and the proposed transposition instruments are available on my Department's website at www.entemp.ie/ecd/eudirectives. The website also contains information on directives in respect of which infringement proceedings have been commenced.A letter of formal notice, under Article 226 of the treaty, has been issued by the European Commission in the case of five directives and a reasoned opinion in the case of another five of the outstanding directives for which the deadline for implementation has passed. In the case of four of the five directives, which are the subject of a letter of formal notice, the implementing regulations have been signed. However, there is a time lag for lifting infringement proceedings following implementation. I am satisfied that my Department is giving all due priority to the task of implementing the provisions of EU directives in light of available resources.

It is intended to introduce the published Bill into the Houses of the Oireachtas shortly and have it enacted by the end of the year, allowing the Per sonal Injuries Assessment Board to be up and running and hearing cases early in 2004.The main objective of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board is to reduce the cost of delivery of compensation. It is not designed to reduce the level of awards. It will initially deal with employer liability cases where liability issues do not arise. It will subsequently be extended to public liability cases and claims involving motor accidents.

Where these needs are best addressed by the award of short-term contracts to external training providers, the policy of previous years will continue to apply. The award of contracts is subject to a tendering process, which ensures that value for money is obtained.The plans for training programmes for 2004 are currently being prepared by FÁS and, in line with previous years, these plans are being reviewed to ensure that they address the needs of the employed and the unemployed, are in line with FÁS strategic objectives, provide good value for money and stay within the budgetary limits set for 2004. FÁS will, following the finalisation of the 2004 budget, set out its training programmes for 2004 both in terms of its delivery from its own training centres and the utilisation of external providers to deliver such programmes.

This amounts to a reduction of 5,000 places on the year-end position for 2002. At the end of September 2003 there were 20,329 persons working on CE, 2,319 on jobs initiative and 2,402 employed on the social economy programme.The Government is aware of the important contribution that CE has made to the development of services for local communities over the years and the difficulties which now arise for sponsor organisations in the voluntary and community sector due to the reduction in the level of funding available for the programme. Certain essential services are ring-fenced from reductions in order to minimise the effect of reductions on particular groups and services. Services ring-fenced include drugs task force activity, child care services and CE places in the health sector. Projects and/or places in disadvantaged areas, which come under the RAPID initiative, are given priority over places outside these areas, subject to budgetary and quality considerations. While projects in CLÁR areas are not ring-fenced, FÁS makes every effort to facilitate such projects within the level of funding available.FÁS is currently finalising its internal report on CE and jobs initiative, which will be published upon completion. The PPF mandated review of active labour market programmes is also being progressed under the aegis of the standing committee on the labour market, chaired by my Department. In addition, a cross-departmental senior officials group has been asked to consider options for the future of CE, taking account of the link with the provision of community services. Both of these processes are near completion.

Information in respect of 2003 is not yet available as the survey is under way. However, we do have figures for 2002 showing the total employment, gross job gains and gross job losses for the year, which are extracted from the Forfás business information system, BIS. The BIS records numbers employed in all clients of the agencies – IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, Shannon Development and Údarás na Gaeltachta. BIS employment data is updated on an annual basis, with employment relating to November-December of each year. Employment data is not updated on a more regular basis.While overall employment levels in Ireland increased marginally in 2002 as a result of job creation in the public sector and other locally traded sectors of the economy, employment in firms in the more exposed internationally traded manufacturing and service sectors contracted by about 3% in 2002. Companies supported by the development agencies created more than 25,000 permanent full-time jobs in 2002, a strong achievement in the context of difficult economic conditions. However, these employment gains were outweighed by job losses of just over 35,000, as the economic downturn impacted on firms' ability to sustain and expand employment in the face of the global economic slowdown. While I take this situation seriously, the Deputy should note that this still represents a 50% increase in employment on ten years ago.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	290	The Organisation of Working Time Act 1997, which implemented EU Council Directive 93/104/EC of 23 November 1993 concerning certain aspects of the organisation of working time, provides for an annual leave entitlement of four working weeks per annum for full-time employees and pro rata entitlements for part-time employees as well as an average hourly working week of 48 hours averaged generally over a four-month period. The Act also provides for an entitlement to nine public holidays per annum. Notwithstanding these provisions, it is possible for employers and employees to negotiate a longer annual leave entitlement or a lower hourly working week between themselves if they so wish. I have no plans at the moment to increase the statutory minimum annual leave or public holiday entitlement nor to lower the threshold on weekly working hours provided for in the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997.

Assuming that report recommends that a statutory instrument be promulgated which will add ETS to the list of carcinogens to be banned from the workplace, I will be seeking Government approval for the relevant statutory instrument under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 1989. It is also my intention to give the required three months' notice to the European Union of the Government's intention to bring the statutory instrument into operation.Officers from the Department of Health and Children, my Department, the Office of Tobacco Control and the Health and Safety Authority and others are in close contact concerning the implementation and enforcement of the proposed regulations.

The annual competitiveness report for 2002, which was produced by the National Competitiveness Council, while confirming many of Ireland's strengths, highlighted the many challenges we face and the difficult choices we have to make in the present uncertain global economic environment.Strengthening competitiveness requires a number of actions and the Government is fully committed to taking these appropriate measures, as I have stated on previous occasions. The recent IMF report, Ireland: 2003 Article lV Consultation, commended the Irish authorities "for their exemplary track record of sound economic policies, which have resulted in a dynamic, open and robust economy with growth notably above the EU average over the past decade and resilience to external shocks."

Consumers possess considerable purchasing power; without them there would be no markets. That is not to underestimate the responsibilities which Government has in the matter, especially in relation to competition and consumer policy. There is a need in our society to encourage and energise consumers to be more active participants in the market process and I make no apologies for availing of every opportunity to push that agenda. My message to consumers is that if they have financial clout, they should use it.

As such, this is a serious setback for the DDA. The major losers from the failure to agree at Cancún are developing and least developed countries as the DDA is designed to effectively address their needs and to assist them integrate into the world economy.Trade matters are a Community competence where the EU Commission negotiates on behalf of the EU member states on the basis of proposals from the EU Commission which are agreed by EU Ministers. There was a substantial amount of technical preparation and negotiation on all the issues across the full Doha development agenda in the lead-in to Cancún. The basic, often detailed, parameters both of the further negotiations and, in many cases, the actual contents of the future agreements were discussed and elaborated on all the big issues on the DDA, including agriculture, services, non-agricultural market access and the four so-called Singapore issues.

In addition, I have met with representatives of manufacturing, wholesale and retail interests in the grocery sector.As regards the issue of whether the groceries order has contributed to higher food prices, this is a complex area. On the one hand, those arguing for the repeal of the order suggest that it facilitates resale price maintenance and that prices are higher than they would be otherwise. On the other hand, supporters of the order have claimed that price inflation is higher on items not covered by the order compared to items covered by it. Restriction on competition can only be justified when they serve a clear public good and, therefore, need to be kept under review. I am still considering whether the groceries order continues to be justified given the changing nature of competition in the retail sector.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	299	The preparation of the programme of work for my Department in the context of Ireland's Presidency of the European Union in the first half of 2004 is well advanced. However, it will not be finalised until December following the completion of the work of the current Italian Presidency in the policy areas relevant to my Department. The draft programme is also the subject of ongoing consultations with relevant parties in the EU institutions and among our partners at EU level with whom Ireland is required to develop annual and multi-annual operating programmes before the end of this year.The Lisbon agenda of economic, social and environmental renewal of the EU will be a key overarching priority for the Irish Presidency. Progress on the achievement of the agenda and measures to give renewed impetus to advancing economic reform, enhancing competitiveness and stimulating employment in Europe will be the focus of the spring European Council on 25 to 26 March 2004. The priorities of the Irish Presidency in this area are being developed in tandem with the preparation of the overall programme of work for the Presidency.During the Presidency, I will chair two formal meetings of the Competitiveness Council of Ministers, which are scheduled to take place in Brussels on 11 March and 17 to 18 May 2004. Particular stress will be laid by Ireland on the need for the Competitiveness Council to focus on its horizontal remit in line with the Seville European Council in June 2002 and the Presidency conclusions of the 2003 spring summit. It is important that there is attention at the highest political level on issues affecting the competitiveness of enterprise and I see the role of the Competitiveness Council as central to achieving this. The council will also discuss a range of issues coming under its direct remit in areas such as enterprise, research and innovation policies and the completion and effective operation of the internal market, particularly with regard to the services sector. Specific dossiers on issues relating to intellectual property, competition, company law and consumer policy are likely to feature on the agenda, but it is too soon to say with certainty what the precise status of the issues will be when Ireland assumes the Presidency next January. In addition to these two formal councils, I will also chair an informal meeting of Competitiveness Council Ministers in April 2004. This meeting will take place in County Clare.

This means that after EU enlargement on 1 May 2004 employers will no longer require work permits to employ nationals of these states. Accordingly, a significant source of potential labour will become available to Irish employers outside the work permit system which should be of considerable benefit to employers who have not been able to find appropriate staff within the existing Irish or wider EEA labour markets.The EU Accession Treaty, which was signed on 16 April 2003, contains a provision requiring member states, when considering employment permit applications henceforth, to give preference to applications in respect of accession state nationals. I issued a press statement on this matter on 1 August 2003. In light of this treaty requirement, my Department is now giving preferential consideration to applications for permits to employ accession state nationals in respect of jobs where we are satisfied that there is an adequate pool of suitable skills available in the accession states. In other cases, especially for higher skills, employers will be free to submit applications in respect of prospective employees from the wider world.Accession countries accounted for 34% of work permits issued in 2002 and the percentage has remained unchanged to date in 2003. My Department is confident that in light of EU accession Irish employers will be able to find the great majority of their overseas personnel needs from within the enlarged EU, thus obviating the need for work permits. The Department will be working to this end with FÁS and with the relevant authorities in various accession states in the months ahead. I consider that full exploitation of the potential in this area will not only be of considerable benefit to employers, but will also allow Ireland to show an appropriate degree of solidarity with members of the workforce in the accession countries who may wish to work in Ireland.

Prices of goods and services are in general determined by markets and not by Government regulation. Government has an important role in helping to ensure that markets work effectively for consumers and in the interest of the economy as a whole. The main policy levers available to me in this regard are in the areas of competition policy and consumer protection. Consumers also have an important role to play as participants in the market process and it is important that we use every opportunity to get that message across.

The most recent science budget relates to 2001 in which €342 million was expended by Government on research and development throughout the State. My Department's science and technology budget alone has increased by 121% to approximately €159 million in 2003 from expenditure of approximately €72 million in 2001. This money is disbursed through a number of agencies, including Science Foundation Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, which operate under the aegis of my Department and through a number of international research bodies of which Ireland is a member, including the European Space Agency.Science Foundation Ireland funding is being used to recruit and retain researchers and research groups capable of developing high impact, internationally significant discoveries in the fields underpinning biotechnology and information and communications technology, ICTs. These investments are supporting knowledge creation and human capital development, which are the cornerstones of a knowledge based economy. At enterprise level, investment by Enterprise Ireland is being targeted at increasing innovation and new product development and thus raising competitiveness of Irish based companies. In the case of the international research bodies, our national subscriptions provide benefits in terms of membership, including access by Irish researchers and firms to research findings, scientific know-how and industrial contracts.

However, while the company's principal properties at Arklow and Marino Point have been placed on the market, I am advised  that it may take some time to sell them. I also understand that most of the company's obligations to secured creditors have now been settled, while payments to preferred creditors, which would include some amounts due to former employees, have been or are in the course of being made. Unfortunately, it is likely to be some time before payments can be made to unsecured creditors.I also confirm that all claims received by my Department to date under the redundancy payments scheme and the insolvency payments scheme have been processed. Similarly, all applications received from employees for payments from the ex-gratia fund of €24.5 million, established by ICI and the State, have been processed. Payments from the fund were made by the trustee of the fund in accordance with the basis for distribution determined by him following consultations with employee representatives. This basis for distribution was endorsed by a ballot open to all employees.The liquidator has, based on legal advice received, admitted, as unsecured creditors in the liquidation, claims from the employees of the company to have entitlements to enhanced redundancy payments. It must be emphasised that the amount to be paid in due course in respect of such claims is a matter solely for the liquidator and does not imply any commitment by the State to pay enhanced statutory payments. At this stage, I do not expect that the State will receive any payment in respect of its shareholding in the company.

The agency, through its project divisions and overseas offices, is actively marketing the BES building in Charleville to potential clients in both manufacturing and international services sectors. I understand IDA Ireland has met the Charleville Chamber of Commerce to discuss the potential to secure an investor for the vacant BES facility and has also worked closely with the chamber to update profile material for the town. IDA Ireland has introduced two companies to the facility this year to date. The facility was of interest to one of those companies and IDA Ireland anticipates that this may result in a follow-up visit in the weeks ahead. However, it should be stated that ultimately it is  the client company who makes the final decision on where it will locate.At present, we are facing slow growth in the world economy with considerable political and economic uncertainties. This makes it all the more difficult to attract foreign direct investment. However, IDA Ireland's strategies have proved successful to date even in the most difficult of times and I am confident that the strategies and policies being pursued by IDA Ireland, together with the ongoing commitment of the Government to regional development, will bear fruit in terms of overseas investment and jobs for the people of Charleville.

I chair a ministerial committee established to drive the co-ordinated implementation of the reform programme across the relevant Departments. Substantial progress is being made on a range of measures that will radically overhaul the functioning of the insurance market.Progress has been made on the implementation of the majority of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board recommendations and to date 23 have been implemented. I have already brought in regulations requiring insurers to give policyholders 15 working days notice for renewal of motor insurance policies and also requiring no claims bonus information to be provided with renewal notices. These are designed to facilitate policyholders make price comparisons.The Government recently approved the drafting of the general scheme of the Bill to place the Personal Injuries Assessment Board on a statutory basis. It is hoped to enact the legislation by the end of the year and the board should be hearing cases early in 2004.My Department and the Competition Authority are undertaking a joint study into the insurance market. The study will identify and analyse barriers to entry and limitations on rivalry in the insurance marketplace. It is envisaged that the bulk of the work will be completed this year and that a report will be produced in the early part of 2004.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	311	Despite the slowdown in the world economy, the Irish labour mar ket has been resilient with employment continuing to grow and unemployment remaining stable. The most recent data on employment levels available from the quarterly national household survey, QNHS, for the second quarter of 2003 indicate that there are 1,778,300 persons in employment. That represents a growth of 28,000 or 1.6% in the year.At the end of June there were 81,400 persons unemployed, a decrease of 3,500 in the quarter and an increase of 4,200 in the year. The unemployment rate equates to 4.4%, which is well below the EU average of approximately 7%. The level of increase over the year is small and is lower than might be expected in the prevailing international economic climate. While job losses have been experienced in some sectors, these are being more than offset by employment opportunities in other sectors and the ESRI predicts that this will continue to be the pattern into the foreseeable future. The ESRI forecasts that the average numbers in employment will grow by 1.1% in 2003.The challenge for the future is to ensure that Ireland remains competitive internationally. In a labour market context, one of the means for achieving this is through retraining of both the employed and the unemployed. To this end, employers will be encouraged to invest in training and to develop programmes to facilitate employees adapt their skills through further training, re-skilling and lifelong-learning. In addition, research and innovation, both in terms of product and process development, is critical and a key focus is to increase the rate of commercialisation of research.

As part of the expansion, the company agreed with IDA Ireland that up to 80 of the new jobs would be located in Birr, County Offaly.IDA Ireland has informed me that, due to the adverse economic climate, particularly in the e-learning sector, NETg has decided that it will not now undertake the establishment of an operation in Birr nor the expansion of its Limerick facility.

The manager of the company attended as an observer for a short while.The union officials and the workers representatives spoke at the meeting. They made the case that the workers who had already been made redundant up to January 2003 before the new enhanced rates came into force in May 2003 should be retrospectively paid these enhanced rates. However, these workers were paid about 3.2 times the then statutory rate by the company on a voluntary basis and also the company had applied for and been paid by my Department its entitlement to a 60% rebate from the social insurance fund.

It is intended to introduce the published Bill into the  Houses of the Oireachtas shortly and enact by year-end, allowing the Personal Injuries Assessment Board to be up and running and hearing cases early in 2004.The main objective of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board is to reduce the cost of delivery of compensation. It is not designed to reduce the level of awards. It will initially deal with employer liability cases where liability issues do not arise.It will subsequently be extended to public liability cases and claims involving motor accidents.Considerable advances have been made in preparing the book of quantum. It is expected that this will be publicly available in advance of commencement of PIAB operations early in 2004.

The Minister for Finance signalled the introduction of a general carbon tax from the end of 2004, in his budget speech in December 2002. The Minister indicated that full consultation with interested parties on the design of the tax would be undertaken and also that there would be a reasonable lead-in time prior to introduction of such a tax. The Department of Finance published a consultation paper on proposals for a carbon energy tax in Ireland on 30 July 2003.

It was at that stage that the WEF stated that the forum's global competitiveness report would not be available until November 2003.Up to that date there had been a series of contacts between my Department and the secretariat of the World Economic Forum to discuss the format, agenda and logistics of the proposed competitiveness summit.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	323	Before deciding to grant full freedom of movement for purposes of work to nationals of the ten EU accession states, the Government had regard to the findings of a number of studies carried out on the likely impact of enlargement on EU labour markets. These included studies by Brueker & Boeri for the EU Commission (2000), Sinn (2001) and Salt (1999).In general, research suggested that the impact on the EU labour market of the freedom of movement of workers after accession should be limited. However, it was expected that the predicted labour migration would be concentrated in certain frontline member states, resulting in possible pressures on the labour markets there. Concerns about the impact of the free movement of workers were based on considerations such as geographical proximity, income differentials, unemployment and propensity to migrate.Analysis of Irish economic migration from the accession countries showed that, in 2002, just some 34% of personnel coming here on work permits were nationals of those countries. Indeed, the percentage has remained unchanged in 2003. This is at a time when very few other member states are open to relatively low skilled labour migration and Ireland may be particularly attractive at the moment.After May 2004, nationals of the ten accession countries will be able to choose freedom of movement to seek work in Denmark, the Netherlands, Sweden, the UK, Spain and Greece, as well as Ireland.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	324	The insurance reform programme that I announced on 25 October 2002 comprises a comprehensive set of inter-related measures designed to improve the functioning of the Irish insurance market. The key measures include the implementation of the recommendations in the motor insurance advisory board action plan within a target timeframe. To date 23, of the recommendations have been implemented and work is in progress on the implementation of the other recommendations. Another key measure is the establishment of the personal injuries assessment board. The Government has approved the drafting of the general scheme of the Bill to place the personal injuries assessment board on a statutory footing. It is hoped to enact the legislation by the end of the year.My Department and the Competition Authority are undertaking a joint study into the insurance market. The study will identify and analyse barriers to entry and limitations on rivalry in the insurance marketplace. It is envisaged that the bulk of the work will be completed this year and that a report will be produced in early 2004.I chair a ministerial committee established to drive the co-ordinated implementation of the reform programme across the relevant Departments and other bodies concerned. Substantial progress is being made on a range of other measures that will radically overhaul the functioning of the insurance market and help tackle the high cost of insurance. These include measures to reduce the number of accidents, to tackle fraudulent and exaggerated claims and streamline the law on personal injury claims.While EU law prohibits the imposition of price control on insurance, I consider it an onus on the insurance industry to ensure that the reforms to be taken will have the effect of significantly reducing the cost of premia to consumers and businesses. It is heartening to report that a number of insurers have announced reductions in motor insurance premia. As implementation of the reform programme continues, in particular the reform of the law on personal injuries and the establishment of the personal injuries assessment board, I expect reductions to occur in all forms of insurance, including public liability.

As a contribution to the debate on enterprise policy in the future, I published Review of Industrial Performance and Policy a few weeks ago.We cannot be complacent about the relocation of firms, for whatever reason, to other countries nor the associated job losses. My Department and its enterprise support agencies pay particular attention to the structure of the country's manufacturing base and how it is evolving in response to international market forces. However, rapid economic growth over the past few years has changed the structure of our economy. Our strength and traditional competitive advantages in basic manufacturing and services is being gradually whittled away by the emerging economies of Asia and the fast modernising countries of EU accession states.

I understand that the company has recently introduced short-time working because of an increasingly competitive environment, with increased labour and insurance costs. Enterprise Ireland is working closely with the company, including assistance to develop overseas markets.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	328	The issue of job creation is a day-to-day operational matter for the enterprise development agencies of my Department and not one in which I have a direct role.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	329	Ireland exports to many markets and the Government's strategy is to create further market opportunities where they exist. The Government, through Enterprise Ireland, supports the growth of Irish exports by working with individual companies in identifying new product and market opportunities and seeking to capitalise on them. This has been a key priority over the past few years as international market conditions have deteriorated and the focus of exporters has been firmly on generating new sales leads and securing sales.An important source of new market opportunities is the Enterprise Ireland overseas office network, which has an ongoing scanning role for new potential buyers and sectors. These are subsequently brought to the attention of Enterprise Ireland clients in Ireland and incorporated, as appropriate, in their development plans. In addition, the Enterprise Ireland annual business review surveys the sales and export markets of clients and specifically addresses the question of priority markets.The key mechanism used by Enterprise Ireland in developing new market areas for clients is to broker meetings with significant international buyers, either through inward buyer missions or outward trade missions. In 2002, 2,220 such meetings were arranged with 340 client companies participating in 34 such trade missions.Since the middle of September this year Enterprise Ireland has organised significant trade missions, led either by the President or a Minister, to the Middle East, Canada, China and Russia.Further trade missions are planned for Finland, Italy, Germany and Scotland before the end of the year.China is now one of the most sought after trading partners in the world and Enterprise Ireland is keen to build on and expand a pattern of growth in two-way trade between the two countries. An estimated 150 Irish companies are currently doing business in China and Hong Kong and many have well established partnerships and business alliances with local companies.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	330	Exports from Ireland declined by 19% in the first six months of this year over the same period in 2002, and imports declined by 25%. There are a number of reasons for this decline. The global economic slowdown has had an impact on trade globally, notably on the technology sectors in which Ireland is a significant exporter. In addition, a number of export intensive companies based in Ireland have closed over the past 18 months. The rise in the value of the euro against the currencies of our two main trading partners, Britain and the USA, has also had an impact.The Government recognises the importance of ensuring that Ireland remains competitive, as a guarantee to future economic success and to correctly position ourselves to take advantage of improvements in the global economy. The annual competitiveness report produced by the National Competitiveness Council, while confirming many of Ireland's strengths, highlighted the many challenges we face and the difficult choices we have to make in the present uncertain global economic environment. Strengthening competitiveness requires a number of actions and the Government is fully committed to taking these appropriate measures, as I have stated on previous occasions. Indeed the recent IMF report, Ireland: 2003 Article lV Consultation, commended the Irish authorities. It stated: "for their exemplary track record of sound economic policies, which have resulted in a dynamic, open and robust economy with growth notably above the EU average over the past decade and resilience to external shocks."  Sustaining Progress has at its core the need to underpin Ireland's competitiveness. Its goal is to create a virtuous circle of low inflation, moderate wage growth and higher productivity, thereby providing a firm competitive business environment for Irish industry.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	331	IDA Ireland is the agency with statutory responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment to Ireland. The agency, through its project divisions and network of overseas offices, is actively marketing Ireland, including individual regions and areas, to potential overseas investors.In the 12 months to the end of September 2003 there were 161 first-time site visits by potential investors to Ireland and 84 repeat site visits. According to IDA Ireland it can take a considerable time between an initial visit to a site and a final decision from the client. Ultimately, it is overseas investors themselves who decide where they want to locate, including what areas they wish to visit as potential locations.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	332	The Irish economy is undergoing fundamental change at present. Ireland can no longer be seen as a low cost location for investment. Ireland, as a location for what might be called basic, moderate to low technology production only, forms of mobile investment, is being overtaken by other less developed economies, notably in eastern Europe and the Far East, in terms of cost competitiveness.A key component of the Government's strategy to tackle the competitiveness challenge from countries with lower labour costs is to increase the levels of investment in research, technological development and innovation in industry in Ireland. This will assist resident companies to move up the business value-chain, safeguard employment and, in the longer term, provide more sustainable and higher quality jobs. In recognition of the importance of this task, the budget for Enterprise Ireland, targeted at increasing research and innovation in Irish companies, has been significantly increased in recent years.Furthermore Science Foundation Ireland has been set up to administer the €646 million technology foresight fund to support world class research that will be the genesis of future innovation and new technologies. This fund will help drive long-term growth and competitiveness by helping attract new high technology firms to Ireland while strengthening the capabilities of existing foreign and Irish owned enterprises.Last May, a new financial support package for indigenous industry was launched by Enterprise Ireland, which is more suitable to clients' development needs. The Agency has also recently launched the €10 million competitiveness fund, which is designed to build competitiveness in small and medium enterprises. The development of export markets is also a critical factor in sustaining indigenous companies and Enterprise Ireland's range of supports is designed to help Irish companies broaden their reach into more competitive, demanding but more profitable overseas markets.

The State has the  responsibility of meeting any legal liabilities that may arise for the Department. An owner of any land has responsibility for it and should ensure that they carry adequate public liability insurance to take into account third parties who may come onto their property.

A further animal was sent to the knackery on the same date. Twenty-five of these animals were deemed eligible for 2002 slaughter premium and full payment has issued in respect of these animals.Two animals were ineligible for payment, as the information on the Department's cattle movement monitoring system was insufficient to establish whether the animals were held by the person named for two months in the last three months prior to slaughter. The Department wrote to the person named in this regard on three occasions, and as no reply was received the animals in question were deleted. Animals which are moved to the knackery do not qualify for slaughter premium.

However, a wide range of important issues, including the national spatial strategy, have to be considered before a final decision by the Government is taken on the mat ter. It is vital that all involved are consulted, be they staff concerned about their futures or departmental management concerned about the delivery of the public services for which they have responsibility.All of the many submissions and representations which have been received by my Department, including those received on behalf of Kanturk, County Cork, will be taken into account as part of the deliberative process but until a final decision is taken it is not possible to state which locations will be included or excluded from the programme.

This makes it one of the longest running sector specific tax reliefs in the economy and has seen an Exchequer contribution in terms of tax foregone of the order of some €265 million in the past ten years alone. It should be noted that this relief has continued over time against a backdrop of the widening of the tax base and the reduction of rates generally.

In these circumstances, the amount of tax revenue collected in respect of film and television drama activities cannot be readily identified from the overall yield from taxation. Accordingly, the specific information requested by the Deputy is not readily available and could not be obtained without conducting a protracted examination of the Revenue Commissioners' records.For the Deputy's information the following table gives a breakdown for the years 1993-94 to date, of the number of film productions certified by the Revenue Commissioners as qualifying for relief under section 481 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, the total amount of tax forgone and the total amount invested under section 481 in respect of such film productions.

The Department of Transport has informed my Department that Sustainable Energy Ireland commissioned a paper from Teagasc on the current position regarding liquid bio-fuels in Ireland. This paper, which lays out strategic options for the sector, is completed and is published on the Sustainable Energy Ireland website. The Department of Transport is in the process of reviewing this paper in the context of implementing the forthcoming EU Directive on the promotion of the use of bio-fuels and it intends to develop a strategy which takes account of the different interests involved. Pending the outcome of this process, it would be premature and inappropriate to speculate on the issue of the removal of excise duties from bio-fuels.

At present, two proposals have been circulated on the mandate for the negotiation of such a convention. These proposals differ from one another in terms of the scope of the convention to be negotiated.The Government is currently considering their position on each of the proposals before the sixth committee.I also refer the Deputy to the reply provided on 22 October by the Minister for Health and Children, with whom responsibility for the matter lies at domestic level.

This will continue to be the Government's policy. The occupying powers have accepted fully their obligations and responsibilities under international law, most notably in their support for UN Security Council Resolution 1483. I am not aware of the adoption by the US authorities of a policy of collective punishment.

The report observes that the ability to move beyond national interests will be crucial in a more heterogeneous Union. It also concludes, correctly, that the Union of the future needs democratic legitimacy and openness, not alliances which give rise to counter-alliances – it makes particular reference to the need to avoid pitting ‘big' against ‘small'. It rightly suggests that France and Germany have nothing to gain from such an approach.

The projects in question are at various stages of architectural planning.Given the level of financial commitments to be met from projects already in construction under the school building programme, I do not envisage that my Department will be in a position during this year to allow architectural planning for further large scale projects to progress beyond their current authorised stage.The timing of when these projects can proceed is dependent on the financial allocation for 2004 and subsequent years and the competing priorities for this funding.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	349	My Department does not provide any specific grants or funding to persons who wish to open a school of music. The revised primary curriculum music programme places a clear emphasis on the need to give children in all classes appropriate levels of experience of instrumental music, as listeners and as responders, as makers of music and as composers. Guidance is provided for teachers on ways of approaching such activity and a wide range of experiences is suggested. I have already provided all primary schools with a grant to support teaching and learning in the arts, including music.

Applications for the course are administered by the colleges of education who decide which qualifications are acceptable. However, from time to time candidates present with non-standard qualifications and it has been the practice that my Department has provided advice to the colleges of education on a case by case basis.In general, my Department is of the view that the guiding principle in deciding which degrees are acceptable is the general acceptability of the degree awarded by the particular institution or body, in the context of its standing as a recognised higher education institution or body. This could include degrees awarded or accredited by universities outside the State.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	351	The school building programme for  2003 has been published and full details in relation to individual projects are available on my Department's website at www.education.ie. Given the level of financial commitments to be met from projects already in construction under the programme, my Department does not envisage that it will be in a position during this year to allow any further capital projects to commence.My officials are unable to trace an application for capital funding from the school referred to by the Deputy. If accommodation works are required, the board of management should contact the school planning section of my Department directly in this matter.I can confirm that the school in question has disadvantaged status. However, a higher priority is not given to a school building project where disadvantaged status applies on the basis that this status does not infer inadequate accommodation. In addition, the accommodation needs presenting at such a school may not be as urgent as those presenting elsewhere. In the circumstances, all applications for capital funding must be assessed on a competing priority basis in the context of the financial allocation for any given year.

Further discussions are being arranged to address issues relating to accommodation needs and the levels of teaching and other supports required by the school in order to facilitate this development. I am hopeful that the unit in question will be in place for the coming school year.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	353	The Department of Education and Science maintains archive records in relation to approximately 41,000 former residents of the old industrial and reformatory schools system. These former pupils were placed in the schools by way  of court orders. The records are maintained in the Department's offices in Athlone and are in paper form with copies in electronic format.My Department currently processes requests for access to personal records from former residents of industrial and reformatory schools under the Freedom of Information Act 1997. It has been the experience of the Department that the Freedom of Information Act is sometimes not the most appropriate means of dealing with such requests as the records can, in some cases, contain sensitive information. Furthermore, in many cases, the release of documents results in the need for individual to be able to access services such as counselling, tracing and mediation. With this in mind and in order to provide a comprehensive, compassionate and supportive service to former residents, the Department provides financial support to the Barnardo's Origins service to enable it to provide an information and mediation service for former residents who wish to access their records.A service agreement, which governs the operation of the Barnardos-Origins service, is in place and I have requested officials in the residential institutions redress unit of my Department to send a copy of it to the Deputy.A copy of all relevant records held by the Department has been given to Barnardos in electronic format to facilitate the operation of the service. Access to any records that the Department has supplied to Barnardos is strictly controlled and is restricted to those personnel working in the Origins service. Furthermore records will only then be accessed by Origins personnel where a former resident requests the Origins service to provide him or her with relevant personal information. This is in line with section 4(1)(ii) of the service agreement, where Barnados have undertaken to access only those records of former residents in respect of whom an application has been received by Origins.The Department grant aids the operation of the service and provided it with €200,000 in 2002 and to date in 2003 has provided it with €475, 117. This financial assistance funds both the employment of staff by the Origins service and administrative expenditure.While I would actively encourage former residents to avail of this worthwhile service, I would also like to reiterate that it is only an alternative to the freedom of information route and it is entirely optional for former residents as to which route they wish to pursue. All former residents may exercise their statutory rights and apply to my Department for access to their records under the terms of the Freedom of Information Act 1997 if they so wish.

Phase 2 of a large-scale building project at the school, which includes refurbishment of the general purpose hall and adjacent classroom block, is listed in section 6 of the 2003 school building programme which is published on my Department's website at www.education.ie. This project is at stage 4/5 of architectural planning, i.e. pre-tender documents. It has been assigned a ‘band 1' rating by my Department in accordance with the published criteria for prioritising large-scale projects.Projects listed in sections 6 and 7 will not be authorised to progress beyond their current stage of architectural planning at this time. Budgetary provisions in 2004 and subsequent years will determine the rate of progression to tender and construction of these projects in conjunction with the band rating individually assigned. In the meantime, individual schools should, as appropriate, use their devolved grant to deal with any urgent health and safety works.

This issue had been raised previously by former residents of such institutions and led to the inclusion of section 35 in the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002.Section 35 of the Redress Act states:

In this regard, existing structures for delivery of services are being examined. While BIM has an enviable record in the marketing and promotion of Irish seafood, I believe that it would be unwise to rule out any initiatives which could improve the State's performance in this area, in the interests of underpinning and expanding jobs for Irish seafood producers and processors.I am aware of the concerns expressed by seafood representatives and these will be considered when a final decision has been taken on the matter.

This unavoidable delay arose, initially, from the need for clarification with regard to a new EU fleet management policy and, more recently, from the consequent need to introduce a new national licensing policy. The Independent Licensing Authority is not yet in a position to decide on licence applications in the absence of a firm licensing policy.

The Government has made funding available under the previous and current national development plans to leverage investment by the private sector in advanced broadband infrastructure and services.Under the INTERREG programme, part-funded by the European Regional Development Fund, Eircom invested upwards of €4.7 million extending the fibre network from Falcarragh through Bunbeg, Dungloe, Glenties and Killybegs to Donegal town. The broadband infrastructure provides backbone capacity of STM-4 standard – 622 Mbit/s. The surrounding towns are linked to the backbone subsidiary through STM-1 nodes.An indicative figure of €200 million of Government and European Regional Development Fund funding is being made available under the e-commerce and communications measure of the National Development Plan 2000 – 2006 to assist with the roll-out of advanced telecommunications infrastructure in rural Ireland, including fibre trunk lines, metropolitan area networks and digital subscriber lines. Following the Government decision of 7 March 2002, metropolitan area fibre networks are being constructed in 19 towns and cities. Two of these networks are being built in County Donegal, at Gweedore and Letterkenny. The construction phase of the Gweedore fibre network, which will be 3 km. in length and cost €570,000, was officially launched on 6 October. The Letterkenny network, which will be launched shortly, will be 20 km. in length and will cost €3.6 million.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	369	I propose to take Questions Nos. 132 and 133 together.The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter in the first instance for the private sector companies operating in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.Under the communications and e-commerce measure of the National Development Plan 2000 – 2006, an indicative €200 million has been allocated to telecommunications initiatives. Following a Government decision of 7 March 2002, the main thrust of this investment is the creation of metropolitan area fibre networks in 19 towns and cities throughout the country. These networks are now under construction and when completed they will be operated by a neutral, managed services entity, providing open access on a cost basis for all interested parties.Other projects being funded under this measure, such as the roll-out of digital subscriber lines and the upgrade of trunk fibre networks, will see the gradual spread of open access, affordable broadband infrastructure and services to all areas. I understand that upward of 900,000 telephone lines are now DSL-enabled nationwide, and Eircom aims to have 1.2 million lines enabled by March 2004.The Government recognises there are areas of the country that are not likely to attract investment in infrastructure and services due to differing demographics and population densities. Using funding from the regional broadband and technology demonstration programme, my Department is conducting trials of wireless local area network, WLAN, technology. Trials are currently under way in seven locations, and I expect to have a final report by the end of the year. The results of these trials will be assessed by an expert group to establish the best policy in respect of wireless broadband infrastructure.

Under this section, the children eligible for health board dental and ophthalmic services are pre-school and national school children in respect of defects noted at child health examinations. Child health examinations are provided by health boards for children attending national school in accordance with section 66 of the Health Act 1970.There is provision under section 66(3) for a health board, at its discretion, to provide child health examinations for children attending a school that is not a national school. Such discretion may be applied once the governing body of the school so requests. Thus, on receipt of an application under section 66(3), the chief executive officer of a health board-authority may discharge the statutory provisions of that section.

The project team has identified the preferred site for this development on land attached to Tralee General Hospital. The selected site is a three-acre site, accessible from the Killerisk Road, which will allow for the community nursing unit to be developed independently from the Tralee General Hospital campus.The project team has prepared a design brief and the cost of the project is in the order of €8.5 million, at a September 2002 price base date, excluding revenue costs. My Department gave approval to the appointment of a design team in February 2003.

The report of the taxi hardship panel recommends the establishment of a scheme to provide payments to individual taxi licence holders who fall into one of six categories that the panel assessed as having suffered extreme personal financial hardship arising from taxi liberalisation. Any payments to be made on foot of these recommendations will not represent compensation but rather compassionate payments in respect of extreme personal financial hardship. Area Development Management Limited, ADM, has been engaged to administer and manage a scheme to implement the recommendations of the taxi hardship panel report.An application form is in the final stages of preparation and I expect that it will be made available to potential applicants in the very near future. Its availability will be advertised in the national newspapers. ADM will commence assessing applications as soon as the application forms are returned to them. I expect that the assessment process will get under way during the month of November and that the first payments under the process will be made before the end of the year. Payments will be made on the basis of the parameters set out in the taxi hardship panel report. The requirements in terms of information to be provided and conditions to be met in respect of the various categories for which the taxi hardship panel recommended payments will be set out in the application form and associated explanatory material.

#JamesMcDaid	unknown-#JamesMcDaid-party	unknown-#JamesMcDaid-dob	unknown-#JamesMcDaid-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	389	The national car test, NCT, was introduced in order to implement the requirements of EU Directive 96/96/EC relating to the roadworthiness testing of passenger cars. The directive specifies the items to be tested as part of a roadworthiness test and the NCT reflects the directive's requirements. The standards for the test are such that a vehicle that has been maintained and operated in accordance with the manufacturer's requirements is unlikely to be refused a test certificate.The outcome of a NCT on a vehicle represents the actual condition of that vehicle when presented for the test. I am satisfied that significantly more vehicles would pass the NCT at first presentation thereby avoiding the need for re-tests and associated time and cost losses for the motorists in question were more car owners to maintain and service their vehicles in accordance with the manufacturers' recommendations rather than using the first test as a diagnostic to detect defects.Arising from the implementation of the final phase of the NCT on 15 September 2003 whereby failure on any test item is a reason for refusal of a test certificate, the Government has asked me to assess the operation of the new arrangements. I will report to Government on the outcome of my assessment in due course.

The forms are then forwarded to the Garda national age card office, where details are recorded and the forms processed. The turnabout time in the age card office is approximately five working days. The form is then forwarded to a private company which produces the cards and  posts them to the applicants. The turnaround time at the production company is also approximately five working days. Allowing for processing at local stations and posting, the entire process takes between three to four weeks.The success of the national age card scheme is evidenced by the fact that this year 42,699 applications were made up to 30 September. This compares with 39,600 during the whole of 2002. Two civilian employees, with one sergeant, work full time in the national age card office receiving and processing applications. One computer is used to input and store the data, but as I mentioned earlier, the actual production of the card is out-sourced I am assured by the Garda authorities that the process is constantly assessed and monitored with a view to reduction of delivery time and meeting increasing demand.

In relation to the Traveller community, my Department chairs the Traveller monitoring committee which monitors the implementation of policies for Travellers in all Departments. It also funds Traveller specific projects.In addition, my Department was responsible for the preparation of major legislation which combat discrimination on the grounds of race and membership of the Traveller community. These include: The Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989 which, inter alia, prohibits the use of words, behaviour or the publication or distribution of material which is threatening, abusive or insulting and are intended, or are likely to stir up hatred. Under this Act, hatred against members of the Traveller community is specifically covered; the Employment Equality Act 1998 which outlaws discrimination in the employment context on nine grounds, including race and membership of the Traveller community; and the Equal Status Act 2000 which protects against discrimination on the same nine grounds in regard to education, provision of goods and services, accommodation and the disposal of property.

It represents a slight decrease of 0.5% from the grant-in-aid for last year of €17,636 million. However, it must be compared with a significant increase in funding for the board in recent years, up from €10.656 million in 1997 to €17.539 million in 2003, an increase of almost 65%. During this period sanction to employ additional staff was also conveyed to it. Since 1997 sanctioned posts in its law centre network increased from 191 to 215, of which 89 are solicitor posts, an increase of eight solicitor posts.

The visa applications in question relate to their four children who wish to join them in the State.Following the decision of the Supreme Court in the cases of L and O, the separate procedure which then existed to enable persons to apply to reside in the State on the sole basis of parentage of an Irish born child ended on 19 February. The Government also decided that the general policy of allowing such parents to be joined in the State by other family members would no longer apply. Accordingly, my Department's immigration division does not generally approve visas in respect of such applications.

Their claim for refugee status was considered under the process then applicable and refused by my Department's asylum division on 24 November 1999. They were notified of the decision on 10 December 1999. The applicants then appealed this decision to the then appeals authority which affirmed the decision of the asylum division.In accordance with section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 the persons concerned were informed on 14 November 2001 that the Minister proposed to make deportation orders in respect of them. They were, in accordance with the Act, given the options of making representations within 15 working days setting out the reasons they should not be deported. These are as follows: be allowed to remain temporarily in the State; leave the State before the order was made; or consent to the making of deportation orders.Representations setting out reasons they should not be deported were received and I expect a case file to be submitted to me shortly for decision. This decision will be taken after consideration of a number of factors which are specified in section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended. These factors include considerations relating to the common good, the person's family and domestic circumstances and humanitarian considerations. Consideration will also be given to the prohibition on refoulement contained in section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996, as amended.The persons concerned will be notified of my decision as soon as possible.

Only clubs which are named by the ICC in their licence application request are permitted to legally catch hares. No clubs in Northern Ireland are included in the current licence.Any person catching hares other than in accordance with a licence is open to prosecution under Section 23 of the Act. Such prosecutions are currently taking place but it would not be appropriate for me to comment further while the cases are before the courts.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	407	Over the years the Government, through the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, has committed significant resources to assessing the extent of the radon problem and to highlighting public awareness of it.The RPII is allocated a grant-in-aid by Government every year to carry out its functions. They include providing information to the public on any matter relating to radiological safety and protection, including radon. Given the range of the RPII's activities, it would not be possible accurately to determine the amount spent annually by the RPII on radon matters.My Department's building standards section has spent some €8,000 on producing a number of different guidance documents on radon since 1998.My Department is also developing guidelines for local authorities. They will recommend that local authorities undertake a programme of testing for radon in their existing rented housing stock, excluding flats above ground floor level. This programme will be prioritised in areas where high radon levels are identified by the RPII. It will involve remediation works by the local authorities where necessary. These guidelines will be issued in the new year.The Department of Education and Science has spent some €3.3 million under a radon remediation programme for primary and post-primary schools since 1998 when the programme commenced.During the years 1992 to 1999, inclusive, the RPII carried out a national survey of radon in domestic dwellings aimed at assessing the extent of the radon problem in homes. The survey involved the measurement by the RPII of radon for a 12 month period in a random selection of homes in each 10 km x 10 km grid square. Based on the results of its survey, the RPII estimated that 91,000 homes, or 7% of the total housing stock, had radon concentration levels above the national reference level. The RPII also estimated that 234 of the 837 10 km x 10 km grid squares, or 28% of the surface area of the country, could be classified as high radon areas. In other words, areas where the RPII has predicted that more than 10% of houses exceed the national reference level. High radon areas exist in all counties. However, they are more prevalent in the west and the southeast.The RPII's website contains a comprehensive map of the high radon areas in Ireland and its report on the national survey of radon in homes.

Where actions to support the strategies have been agreed by the relevant agencies they are being implemented by them having regard to available resources.Recently I received a copy of the CCDB's submission. At present it is not possible to introduce an additional grant on the lines proposed. However, consideration is being given to ways in which the CDBs can be assisted to carry out their key role to co-ordinate public services at local level in the context of the current review of community and local development programmes and structures, involving the Ministers for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and Justice, Equality and Law Reform and myself.

It is a matter for each local authority to decide on the level of funding to be provided for the schemes in their areas from within this allocation. Authorities were requested to contact my Department if their allocation was either inadequate or surplus to their requirements to facilitate the possible reallocation of funds and to obtain optimum effectiveness from the funding available. Applications for additional funding, including one from Waterford County Council, are now being considered in this context and a decision will be conveyed to the authorities concerned as soon as possible.

Local authorities have indicated that they hope to address the identified need for Traveller accommodation within the lifetime of the programmes.  However, they were not required by the Act to set annual targets or deadlines for the provision of such accommodation.The details of the permanent accommodation, standard local authority accommodation, group houses and halting site bays, provided by or with the assistance of the relevant housing authorities from the commencement of the programmes to the end of 2002, the last full year for which figures are available, are set out in the following table. These figures are from the annual count of Traveller families undertaken by local authorities and figures provided to my Department. They also include houses provided by Travellers with the assistance of local authorities.

Once the measures and related funding are settled by the Department, the measures are generally implemented by local authorities or other official agencies. Accordingly, in the case of measures, such as village enhancement and bilingual signage, the beneficiaries only become known to me and my Department when the claims for payment of the CLÁR contribution are submitted by the appropriate agency.I am arranging to have all of the information in respect of each measure, as is available to my Department to date, sent to the Deputy directly.The only measure where applications are processed by my Department is the single to three phase electricity conversion scheme for small businesses and enterprises. CLÁR funds the cost of the customer contribution to the ESB subject to certain limits.The eligibility criteria for this measure are as follows: the business must have been previously in receipt of assistance, financial or mentoring, but not earlier than 1 October 1997, from either the County Enterprise Board, Údarás na Gaeltachta and-or the Leader group, which are consulted on the merits of the conversion; and the business must have no more than ten employees.Since January, 52 applications under this measure have been processed. Of these 44 businesses in 11 of the counties in CLÁR have received assistance. Eight were rejected as the criteria laid down for the measure were not met.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	415	The conditions for entitlement to BTE allowance were revised with effect from 1  January. From that date the scheme does not apply to certain full-time postgraduate courses. Those wishing to take up a higher diploma in all disciplines or graduate diploma in primary school teaching were not affected by these changes.The length of time taken to acquire a primary degree is not considered in determining a claim for the allowance in respect of a postgraduate course. Specifically, it is not the case that a person who undertook a three-year BA course would receive the allowance while pursuing an MA while a person who undertook a four-year BA course would not.I revised the conditions of the scheme because it needed to be refocused towards people who most need additional training or qualifications in order to gain a foothold in the labour market. People with a primary degree are already in possession of a third level qualification and their academic qualifications should impact positively on their employment prospects.The person concerned was a participant in the scheme from September 1999 to May 2003 while pursuing a four year primary degree. In September 2003 he applied for further participation in the scheme in order to pursue a postgraduate qualification. The course he now intends to pursue is outside the revised scope of the scheme and his application was disallowed. The person concerned has already achieved a high level of academic attainment while participating in the scheme and his prospects of securing employment have been greatly enhanced.In a time of financial constraint I must ensure that supports are directed at those with the most pressing needs. Limited resources must continue to be aimed at those in most need and who are most distant from the labour market.

Information was requested in relation to this income and it has not been supplied. A deciding officer was not satisfied that she continued to satisfy the means test for entitlement and decided to terminate her payment in October. She was informed of this decision and of her right to appeal. Her entitle ment will be reviewed by the deciding officer if the required information in relation to the moneys concerned is supplied.Under social welfare legislation decisions on claims are made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.
