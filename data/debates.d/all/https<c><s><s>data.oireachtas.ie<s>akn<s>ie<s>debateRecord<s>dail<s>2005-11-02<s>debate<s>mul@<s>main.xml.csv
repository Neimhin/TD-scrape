#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	1	I propose to take Questions Nos. 100 and 101 together.A comprehensive body of employment rights legislation is already in place. It has as its objectives the protection of employees against arbitrary behaviour by employers, provision for the safety and health of workers and to foster labour market harmony by promoting policies that minimise conflict and maximise fairness. While recognising the exceptional circumstances which have arisen in the maritime sector, it is important to remember that all labour law on the Statute Book applies to non-national workers working in this country in the same way as it applies to Irish workers. If a non-national worker feels he or she is being treated by his or her employer in a way which breaches any employee protection legislation, it would be open to him or her to refer a case for adjudication to a quasi-judicial body or person such as a rights commissioner, the Labour Court or the Employment Appeals Tribunal.Following the announcement on 12 April last, 31 inspector posts are sanctioned for the labour inspectorate. This represents almost a doubling of the complement of inspectors in the past 12 months and is indicative of the Government's determination to ensure compliance with employment rights legislation.Apart from strengthening staff resources, other initiatives are also under way. Arising from a commitment in Sustaining Progress and to assist in the preparation of proposals for consideration by Government, a discussion document was prepared by the labour inspectorate on its mandate and resourcing. The document covered the full range of issues that impact on the operation of the labour inspectorate, extending from the legislative framework through to operational aspects and staff development. It has been well received among the social partners and the parties are well advanced in their consideration of the proposals, of which there are in excess of 40. The objective is to formulate a set of recommendations for Government and it is intended that the process will feed into and complement any future partnership discussions.On 24 May last, I announced a programme of action in response to the report and recommendations of the review group on the role and functions of the employment rights bodies and following consultations with the various interested parties. This included the establishment of an employment rights group, ERG, comprising representatives of my Department, the employment rights bodies and the social partners. The ERG is to consider how best to simplify and streamline the complaints, appeals and enforcement procedures and documentation across the various employment rights bodies. It will also examine the extent to which common procedures and a simplified approach to the conduct of hearings or investigations can be adopted, leading to procedural simplification and improved customer service. Its work should be completed by the end of next year.The concerns expressed by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and SIPTU to which the Deputy refers raise complex legal and policy issues. The Government is, however, committed to taking whatever steps are feasible, through legislation or otherwise, to develop in partnership with ICTU and employers a meaningful package in the area of enhanced employment standards generally. Those issues can best be advanced through dialogue in the context of the partnership process.I understand that the Irish Ferries dispute has been referred to the Labour Court, an independent statutory body that acts independently in carrying out its functions. I have no function regarding the decision-making process of the court.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	2	Will the Minister of State comment on the fact that, in the context of Irish Ferries changing its workforce in a very unorthodox fashion, the Taoiseach cast doubt in the House on the legality of its conducting its business in such a manner? Has the Taoiseach or the Minister of State checked the legality of the move by Irish Ferries to change its workforce from indigenous Irish to migrant labour? Is that now legal? If not, does the Minister of State intend to change the law to prevent the activity in question from proceeding?The Minister of State said that approximately 40 issues relating to employment law and standards were being considered in the context of partnership. What is the Department's thinking on those issues, and will the Minister of State spare us from having to rely on people involved with the social partners to acquaint us of the issues under consideration? The democratic process of this House requires that he inform it of the 40 ideas that he has said are being considered.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	3	The Deputy has raised several issues. In the first instance, any legislation that might arise would clearly be a matter for the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. However, I had a meeting with the Minister of State at the Department, Deputy Gallagher, and subsequently with officials from it and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment on these issues. As Deputy Hogan said, legal advice was sought on a range of issues.The suggestions and recommendations made during Question Time a few weeks ago were pursued at European and other levels. No definite decisions have been made in that regard, but the matter is being followed up by the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. There have already been more than 40 recommendations which will be brought to the attention of the House at the appropriate time. Some of them concern resourcing and others additional legislation or amendments to existing laws. Some are fairly simple and others quite complex. They deal with the resourcing and mandate of the labour inspectorate.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	4	The Taoiseach wrote to the president of ICTU outlining his views on the protection of workers. That was found wanting and both the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and SIPTU have declined the invitation to participate in talks on a successor agreement to Sustaining Progress. Has there been any further communication from the Taoiseach to ICTU to clarify his position?The Minister of State seems to believe that the Irish Ferries dispute is a unique aberration in this country's labour relations. Has the exchange of legal views between ICTU and the Departments that the Taoiseach told the House was taking place actually happened? What is the current legal situation? Does the position that the Taoiseach relayed to the House on 26 October, that it would be extremely difficult in Irish and international law to deal with the issue of re-flagging, remain the Government's view?Regarding the Minister of State's reply that 31 labour inspectors have now been authorised, how many are in place? Does he believe that even if all 31 were in place, this would be adequate to monitor a workforce that has now exceeded 2 million?
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	5	Subsequent to the Taoiseach's letter to ICTU, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, had meetings with SIPTU on 20 October. On the same afternoon, ICTU had a meeting with the Taoiseach on this and a number of other issues.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	6	Were those meetings with the Taoiseach or the Minister, Deputy Martin?
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	7	Initially, the meetings on 20 October were between SIPTU and the Minister, Deputy Martin. On the same day, however, ICTU had a meeting with the Taoiseach on this and a range of other issues, though principally, perhaps, on this issue. Deputy Howlin is of the view that I consider the Irish Ferries case to be a unique aberration. It is fair to say that the set of circumstances apply to maritime law and the enforcement of Irish industrial legislation outside the jurisdiction. Members of the House are aware of the situation in that regard.The Department has not received a notice of redundancy from Irish Ferries at this stage nor is there any indication that it will. The Taoiseach has indicated that the situation is extremely difficult as regards taking any of the actions stipulated, some of which were proposed in this House when the matter was discussed on a private notice question and some of which were raised subsequently. It continues to be extremely difficult. However, the Government is committed to ensuring that if any means can be found to address the crisis, it will take whatever action is available to it. At this stage it is not clear what effective action is available to the Government as regards the international maritime law.Deputy Howlin asked about the number of inspectors. The announcement was made earlier in the year and subsequently the positions were advertised. There were not sufficient candidates on the first round of interviews. A second round of interviews was held and completed in the middle of October. I understand the positions will now be filled. The inspectors will have to be trained and that process will have to be undergone——
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	8	My question was about how many were in place.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	9	I will find out the exact information for the Deputy. I understand that some from the first round may already be in place. Those appointed from the second round have not been trained as yet. However, the process of short-listing and choosing the applicants has been completed.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	10	The matter does not appear to be that urgent given it is five or six weeks since the Taoiseach indicated that legal advice would be required. I am surprised the Minister of State has not got legal advice that he can impart to the House or indicated that the legal process has been completed. It does not seem to be urgent. It has placed the partnership talks under scrutiny and raised a doubt about the process itself because it has taken so long to get this legal advice.Can the Minister of State make an assessment as to where matters stand as regards a new partnership agreement in the light of this dispute and the lack of clarity by the Taoiseach over the correspondence with the president of SIPTU? Does he believe the current partnership process should be reformed if a new national agreement is to be arrived at within the coming months?
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	11	The Taoiseach has informed the House of the up-to-date situation as regards legal advice. Legal advice has been sought across a range of issues including the implications for redundancy payments and international maritime law as well as those which might arise if flagging were to be undertaken either within or outside the EU. The Taoiseach has answered questions on all of these issues and there is no more up-to-date information available.Deputy Hogan believes there is a doubt about the future of partnership. I assure him that the Government is entirely committed to ensuring that the partnership process continues and that every effort is being made to ensure that the next round gets under way as soon as possible. Notwithstanding that considerable difficulty has arisen, mainly from the Irish Ferries dispute, this has been addressed. The Taoiseach has met SIPTU. I am to meet the ICTU this afternoon as regards related issues and I am sure this matter will be raised at that stage, too. There is no lack of clarity on the Government position. It is entirely committed to the process of partnership. Should the issue of reform arise, I am sure this will need considerable debate. In the interim, a better model has not been presented by anybody. It is clearly in the interests of everybody in the State that every effort is made to ensure that the partnership process continues.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	12	I will pursue that matter again. The Taoiseach told the House on 26 October, that the Attorney General was looking at a legal way to address this issue. Will the Minister of State give the House a progress report on that? Given the degree of urgency which should be attached and which I thought the Government attached to this issue which is the foundation of our economy in terms of the social partnership model that has worked effectively for 18 years now, if the social partnership is under threat because of the actions of one sole rogue operating company, surely we should have a definitive view as to whether legal action is possible at this stage. What views, even in a preliminary way, has the Attorney General given to the Minister of State on this issue? What is the status of the commitment given by the Taoiseach to examine the Labour Party Bill, which has been examined by international lawyers and seems to be a workable solution?
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	13	I am sure the Taoiseach will fulfil his commitment to examine the Labour Party Bill. The legal advice received since 26 October indicates there is no easy way to address the difficulties that have caused problems for ICTU in terms of participation in social partnership. There are clearly difficulties for the Government also. Most of the issues in question arise in the area of international maritime law in respect of which this country cannot unilaterally make changes. None of the legal advice indicates such a course of action is open to the Government.I imparted to the House on a previous occasion the legal advice we received in regard to the redundancy situation. There has been no request from the company in question in terms of the redundancy scheme. Until such is received, it is impossible to be definitive in this regard.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	14	Will the Minister of State share the Attorney General's advice with the Opposition?
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	15	Question No. 102 is in the name of Deputy Eamon Ryan. As the Deputy is absent, the question cannot be taken.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	16	Given the importance of the national consumer agency, NCA, to the development of future consumer protection policy, it is vital that the legislation is framed to ensure the NCA has sufficient powers and functions to enable it to carry out its role as a forceful advocate on behalf of the consumer, as envisaged by the consumer strategy group. In addition to setting up the NCA, I will take the opportunity in the legislation to update the existing code of consumer protection law, some of which is more than 100 years old, as also recommended by the consumer strategy group. Furthermore, the legislation will seek to transpose the recently promulgated European directive on unfair business to consumer commercial practices, one of the most significant directives in the area of consumer protection, into national law.Given the scope of the legislation, its preparation will take time. It is my expectation, however, that the legislation will be published in the latter half of next year and that the national consumer agency will be up and running early in 2007. In the meantime, I have appointed a board to the agency to act in an interim capacity. Since its appointment, it has been active in putting the consumer's case on issues such as the debate on the future of the groceries order. I am confident the interim board will continue to be a forceful advocate for consumers in ensuring their voices are heard.With regard to the timescale for the appointment of a new chairperson of the Competition Authority, the Competition Act requires that the recruitment process be undertaken by the public appointments service. However, the vacancy has been advertised both nationally and internationally, and consultants, PricewaterhouseCoopers, have been engaged to carry out an executive search for suitable candidates. The Public Appointments Service is arranging for a high level board to conduct competitive interviews. However, in view of the high profile of this post and the worldwide scope of the executive search for suitably qualified candidates, it is unlikely an appointment will be made until 2006.The Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs continues in existence until such time as it is incorporated into the new agency. The Director of Consumer Affairs continues to perform her enforcement functions to guarantee the protection of consumer rights. I understand she has been approached in regard to a possible appointment to another position. No decision has been made in this matter, however, and the question of appointing a successor does not therefore arise at this time. The Government is determined that policy in the areas of competition and consumer protection is robust and is fully developed to meet the needs of the modern marketplace and the modern consumer.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	17	Does the Minister accept that the Government voted down a Fine Gael proposal in November 2003 which aimed to establish a consumer rights enforcer, similar to the agency advocated by the consumer strategy group? On its announcement, the Minister stated the national consumer agency was important and urgently required. A year and a half later, however, the relevant legislation has not been produced. There is no evidence of urgency in terms of the importance of ensuring some mechanism of redress for consumers. It is unacceptable to delay until the latter half of 2006 the establishment of an agency that is long overdue. Consumers effectively have no right of redress or of complaint at present.Does the Minister accept that he appears to have decided to merge the Office of Director of Consumer Affairs with this national agency? Would it not be better to state that explicitly now and not allow this inept body, the Office of Director of Consumer Affairs, to continue in existence without knowing its future?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	18	I reject the Deputy's assertions. We said on the publication of the consumer strategy group's report in May that it would take time to produce the legislative template for the new national consumer agency. That is why, almost immediately, we took steps to establish an interim board of the agency. It has already been forceful in articulating and advocating on behalf of the consumer, for example, with regard to the debate on the groceries order.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	19	It has not.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	22	It has made submissions and so forth.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	23	The group made its views known before being appointed to the interim board. The Minister should get it right.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	24	No, the consumer agency advocated in a vigorous fashion on behalf of the consumer in the groceries order debate. It has also been in discussions with the Department with regard to its plans for the coming months. The Estimates assessment will reflect that in due course.It is correct, therefore, with regard to the legislation to be put in place, that we do not simply deal with the establishment of the consumer agency but we also transpose that important directive into law. It is an important consumer protection measure. We must also update consumer law. In the meantime, the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs is not an inept body. It has clear statutory functions to discharge and legislation has been passed to increase the fines the office can levy in penalties. This, too, was recommended by the consumer strategy group.There is a unit in the Department dealing with this issue. Resources have been allocated for people to work on the legislation and it will be a substantial measure. Obviously it is reasonable that it should take that length of time.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	25	After nine years in office it is clear today that there is no consumer policy. The Minister announced last May that he would establish a new agency and that the required legislation would be presented to the House a year and a half later. The Minister has stated that he will bring forward legislation in the latter half of 2006, which will be October or November in 2006 unless the House sits during the summer recess next year or there is some other interruption to the Minister's schedule.The national consumer agency is an important development for consumer protection. The Minister should take a more urgent approach to putting in place an agency to advocate on behalf of consumers and, similar to the Ombudsman, to offer consumers the opportunity to seek redress. The Minister should use his good offices in Government to fast-track this process. It is most important because people are not getting the benefit of good consumer protection at present.The appointment of the chairman of the Competition Authority is most important in the context of policing consumer issues and with regard to mergers and takeovers. There is a vacuum in the chair of the authority at present and most of the members of the authority are not involved in business or consumer activities. Does the Minister have any plans to reform the Competition Authority or to strengthen competition law in the context of the appointment of a new chairman? This would make it easier for consumers to secure a better deal in the marketplace.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	26	The Competition Authority has been an effective body. The chairperson has moved on to a new position——

The aid in this case exceeded the threshold and accordingly had to be notified to the European Commission, and discussions are ongoing.The amount of Government funding already committed to the project is a confidential matter between the Government and the company involved. It would be wholly wrong of me to breach this trust. Construction of the plant has already commenced.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	38	I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and apologise to the Minister for being slightly late to ask the question.I want to broaden the matter. We have been remarkably successful as a location for foreign direct investment. I am querying whether the success of that policy is possibly being threatened by a different perception of it, specifically within the European Commission's rules. We have seen the difficulties in getting certain projects in Intel and others developed. Is that a signal from the Commission or from the European Union of a change of policy on Ireland's policy in this area? Given the failure of other countries to attract similar levels of foreign direct investment and given the concern about our lower tax rate, even though I would contend that their effective tax rate due to reductions for research and development and other expenditure may be as low, if not lower, than ours, does the Minister sense that there is a political problem for this State in dealing with the European Union or with our European colleagues in terms of attracting support for our policy, particularly for having applications for capital grant support accepted, as in this case?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	39	The issue is as follows. The European Commission and its officials must operate in the context of the regional aid guidelines and multisectoral framework that have been passed by the member states. Ireland entered a number of submissions on that, particularly for large projects. There was a footnote attached to the multisectoral framework which we argued should allow for innovation in terms of large-scale projects, even where the company may have a dominant share of the market. In one previously highly publicised case, that argument did not win through.The number of projects caught up in this sort of multisectoral framework is few. The majority of projects do not necessitate notification. Notification can be necessary under a range of criteria. Enjoying in excess of 25% of market share is a key one and it is one which affects this case. We are engaged with the Commission at present, answering questions and responding with information on the market share of the company concerned.The issue the Deputy has raised is more general. It is not a political problem for Ireland vis-à-vis the Commission. It is really about the competitive position of Europe vis-à-vis other trading blocks across the globe and in terms of overall globalisation.We in Ireland have a view and have made a submission to a review being undertaken of those regional aid guidelines and the new multisectoral framework for large investment projects. We have made the point that Ireland often wins these projects not from European member states but from countries in Asia, South America or elsewhere. We submitted that this point should be taken on board and that Europe as an entity must be competitive and must face up to competition in terms of effective corporation tax rates in the context of the state aid policies of non-EU countries. We have concerns about that overall position.The good news is that the significant players see Ireland as an attractive location for industry and for high-end activities. The activities plan in this respect is relatively good for 2005. I have accompanied IDA Ireland on a number of trade missions and we are working hard to position Ireland as an attractive location. That continues to be the position.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	40	When does the Minister expect to get a decision from the Commission in this regard? Can he indicate whether he expects that decision to be favourable or negative? If there were to be a negative response to it, what would be the implications for the project in question or a similar project? I do not want to go into the specifics of a commercial operation. If grant aid is not allowable, what are the implications for projects such as this when they have already proceeded?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	41	There are two stages to the ongoing engagement with the Commission. As a first stage, the Commission must make a decision as to whether to open the issue to full, formal investigation, in which submissions are received from others who may have an interest in the issue. This is a process that can take some time. We hope it will not be necessary in this case but I do not want to be seen to pre-empt the discussions and the exchange of information which are ongoing between ourselves and the Commission.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	42	That would be terrible.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	44	There is little point going into the realm of speculation. "So far, so good" is how I would term the way we are operating within the multisectoral framework. We have strong relationships with many of the companies which have established in Ireland and which may be establishing new phases to their development here. We want to maintain that relationship. I cannot speculate in terms of what may happen. However, it is important that, at a pan-European level, we take a more competitive approach to Europe's global competitors in terms of the attraction of mobile international investment.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	45	The decision to appoint the chief science adviser was made by the Government as part of a package of measures in the area of science co-ordination and oversight. These measures were agreed by Government in June 2004 and included the following: the establishment of a Cabinet Sub-Committee on Science, Technology and Innovation; the establishment of an interdepartmental committee to support the Cabinet committee in its work; the creation of the post of chief science adviser to the Government; and the putting in place of a new Advisory Council for Science, Technology and Innovation, comprised of stakeholder interests from academia and enterprise. The chief science adviser is contracted to Forfás and reports to the chief executive of Forfás in respect of his day-to-day functions. He reports to the Cabinet Sub-Committee on Science, Technology and Innovation in respect of his advisory functions.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	46	Will the Minister answer the question?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	47	As regards the filling of the position of chief science adviser, there were particular circumstances surrounding this matter. The Government was aware of the availability of a specific individual with a particular background and experience of relevance to the position of chief science adviser. That individual was retiring from a post in the European Commission at director general level. The post in question was that of director general of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre. The Joint Research Centre employs over 2,000 staff and covers a broad range of scientific and technological areas including energy research, food safety and quality, and chemicals.The individual had previously worked for the European Commission as head of the unit responsible for the Marie Curie research fellowships. Prior to his employment in the European Commission, he had been responsible for Ireland's first national biotechnology programme, BioResearch Ireland. He had also held a number of positions in industry, as a clinical biochemist at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin and as senior research biochemist at the Wolfson Research Institute, Birmingham. As such, the individual had an extensive range of experience and a track record across a spectrum of science and technology disciplines in the public and private sector, nationally and at European level. That experience and track record matched very well with the multidisciplinary nature of the position of chief science adviser.The prospective availability of the individual in question coincided with the finalisation of the overall package of measures on science and technology co-ordination and governance which I have just described. Following consideration of the experience and track record of the individual, and in the context of its consideration of these measures, the Government approved the creation of the position of chief science adviser. Arising from these unique circumstances, the position was not filled by way of competition and was exceptional in this regard as far as my Department is concerned.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	48	In a previous reply to Deputy Hogan, the Minister referred to the appointment of the Director of Consumer Affairs as being of such importance that a worldwide search would have to be carried out independently by the Public Appointments Service, so critical was that job to the economy. Does the Minister regard the job of chief science adviser, one of the pillars of the approach of recognising science as a pivotal part of Ireland's economic future, in the same light? Would it not have been best to advertise to find whether a more suitable candidate was available, rather than simply selecting one individual, as exemplary as the Minister obviously believes the candidate to be?An  Irish Independent article of 31 October stated the Minister met with the chief science adviser last week to present him with a series of questions and requested that he clarify the position within seven days. Is this the case? Did the Minister meet with the chief science adviser? What questions did the Minister pose to him? What concerns has the Minister in regard to his position?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	49	At the time the Government was satisfied there was a need to give momentum to science co-ordination policy and the general science agenda.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	50	Why was the position not advertised?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	51	A situation arose within the Commission where an individual was readily available to fill the position of chief science adviser. He occupied a significant post in the Commission, under which a significant number of people were employed in a research facility. He had a track record with the establishment of BioResearch Ireland and is well thought of in academia and government circles.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	52	Why was he leaving the Commission then?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	53	It made sense at the time, with the other measures taken in science and technology policy, to create the position of chief science adviser. In a short time, many positive developments have taken place in research, such as the programme for research in third level institutions and the creation of Science Foundation Ireland.Last week, I met the chief science adviser, not to present several questions as has been described or to set a target of seven days, but rather because I received several parliamentary questions, arising from an article in a particular newspaper, pertaining to one of his academic qualifications. I pointed out to him that this raised concerns among parliamentary colleagues and that it needed to be dealt with in a comprehensive and substantive way. I also explained to him that I was receiving follow-up correspondence from a Deputy. Regarding the specific academic qualification in question, I explained to him that I needed to have information to me available to deal with that issue. The chief science adviser undertook to do this and this matter is ongoing.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	54	So he is not qualified.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	55	The Minister's reply was a long one to a simple and straightforward question on the advertising of a post. The principal academic qualification, the PhD held by the chief science adviser, is in question. Is the Minister satisfied that the awarding university, the Pacific Western University, is acceptable for the prestigious post of chief science adviser? Has the Minister independently checked the university's record, its capacity and its recognition within the academic community in the US, or is the Minister entirely dependent on the view given by the chief science adviser?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	56	No, I am not dependent on his views. The National Qualifications Authority of Ireland, the body responsible for accreditation in Ireland, was asked to assess the bona fides of this institution.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	57	What was the authority's view?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	58	Its view was that it did not have accrediting powers within the US. In our discussions with the chief science adviser, his view was that the body he dealt with at that time is vastly different from the one in place now.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	59	What body?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	60	There is an issue of due process in this case.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	61	He is on the way out then.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	62	I am anxious to bear this in mind when considering the individual's position, particularly as he has a significant track record in public positions both in Ireland and the European Commission. I put the position we received from the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland on that body in the US to the chief science adviser.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	63	That does not sound good.

#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	68	A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, unfortunately the effect is that a member of the public, who is not a Member of this House, has more access to accurate information from the Minister through a freedom of information request than a Member of this House through a parliamentary question. I find that grossly unacceptable.
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	69	The point has been made clear on numerous occasions. I call Question No. 105.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	70	The Minister should rethink his position on this matter. It is grossly unfair to Members of this House. Through freedom of information requests, members of the public have more access to accurate information than Members of this House have through parliamentary questions. The parliamentary question system defies logic. It is ridiculous.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	71	Hear, hear.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	72	As I advised the House in my reply to Question No. 205 of 28 September, the consumer strategy group's report, Make Consumers Count, was published on 18 May 2005. The Government has already approved the report's core recommendation that a new statutory body, the national consumer agency, be established to advocate on behalf of consumers. Given that this will require primary legislation, a board has been appointed to act in an interim capacity until the new agency is established on a statutory footing. The Deputy will be aware that since its appointment the interim board has been active in terms of articulating the consumer's case on issues such as the groceries order. In addition to being a forceful advocate on behalf of the consumer, the interim board, as part of its terms of reference, will have a key role in preparing the way for the fully operational agency itself.The other significant recommendation in the consumer strategy group report related to the abolition of the groceries order. The Deputy will be aware that following the publication of the report my Department embarked upon a public consultation process on the future of the order. In excess of 550 submissions were received in the course of the consultation process.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	73	Will we deal with QuestionNo. 107 on the groceries order?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	74	No, this is a recommendation of the consumer strategy group. I will deal with whatever issues the Deputy wishes me to deal with.Those submissions have been examined and I met with various groups in the last month to discuss the groceries order. I intend to bring a report to Government detailing proposals in relation to the future of the order shortly.In addition to the above mentioned recommendations, I have accepted a number of the consumer strategy group's recommendations relating to my Department, some of which have already been implemented. For example, the fines for breaching consumer protection laws have recently been significantly increased. The fundamental review of the existing code of consumer protection law, as recommended by the consumer strategy group, is already under way and additional resources have been dedicated by my Department to this task.The consumer strategy group report contains more than 30 separate recommendations involving a variety of different Departments and agencies whose activities directly impact upon the interests of consumers. The scope and breadth of the recommendations required a co-ordinated response from Government. For that reason a high level interdepartmental committee was established to prepare a detailed plan for the implementation of the recommendations. The report of the high level committee is expected to be submitted to Government shortly.I am confident the consumer strategy group's report offers the way forward in developing a robust and effective national consumer policy. Considerable progress has been made in implementing the report in the short time since its publication. I am anxious that progress continue to be made in this regard and I am confident that in conjunction with the interim board of the national consumer agency we will continue to make progress to the benefit of consumers.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	75	God bless word processors. The reply is identical to the reply given the last time this question was submitted, in September. The Minister tells us again that the scope and breadth of the recommendations require a co-ordinated response from Government. God forbid there might be a joined-up response from Government.What progress has been made in establishing the high level interdepartmental committee? How many meetings has that committee had? Has it submitted the report to Government that was promised "shortly" in September?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	76	The work of the committee is virtually complete. We are preparing a memorandum for Government.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	77	How many meetings has it held?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	78	I do not know. That is not relevant because the report is complete. When it involves other agencies and Departments it is necessary to request consideration of and commitments on the various recommendations from outside my Department.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	79	I ask because the phrase "requiring interdepartmental committees to co-ordinate" normally means long-fingering something. I am heartened to hear the committee's work is complete or virtually so.Has the high level committee submitted its report to Government and when will the House have sight of the implementation procedures that will be agreed?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	80	It will be submitted to Government shortly. The memorandum is in preparation.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	81	I have set up the business regulation forum, BRF, with effect from today. I was very pleased to secure the services of Dr. Donal De Buitléir, General Manager, Office of the Group Chief Executive, AIB Group, as chairman. The members appointed encompass an excellent spread of business and regulatory expertise and this will be complemented by the addition of departmental representatives.Establishment of the BRF is a key element in implementing the Government's commitment to better regulation and to address administrative burdens which can genuinely be identified as disproportionate. My intention is that the BRF will advise me, and that I, in turn, will advise the Government, on regulatory issues as they impact on business and competitiveness, in particular issues and problems arising from outdated, inefficient or disproportionate regulation.The forum will work in parallel with the existing better regulation group of Government officials and regulators. It will take a strategic overview of the application of better regulation principles to new regulation and examine specific existing regulations on a problem-solving basis. As the business regulation forum should be a dynamic body which will identify, focus on and prioritise regulatory issues of concern, I do not want to be prescriptive about its work. The adoption of a detailed work programme will be a matter for the forum. My Department and the State enterprise agencies will assist the forum to carry out its task and I have requested other Departments and the independent regulatory bodies to facilitate the effective analysis and review of particular regulatory issues.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	82	I am sure the Minister will not mind me stating that we have heard all this before. In January 2004 it was stated in a document issued by the Taoiseach that the Government had established a group on better regulation to promote better regulation across the public service and oversee implementation of the commitments and action plan arising from the White Paper. How are we now to believe the Minister on any announcement he makes on a new forum, group or committee established to deal with the same matter?With regard to the bona fides of the Government on the issue of better regulation, how many regulatory impact analyses have been carried out across Departments since January 2004 in line with what was committed to at that time? Will the Minister comment on the company law reform group's report, which was to deal with a number of issues related to company law and which affect the regulatory burden on small businesses in particular?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	83	In terms of the world of business, there was a requirement and a desire from business that there would be formalised dialogue on working relationships with Government on regulations in general. This is a good thing. During the summer, the Taoiseach announced that such a group would be established. It is important for business in Ireland, as there is a strong external perception that the Government and its process are agile and responsive to enterprise and business. We gain competitively on that point compared with other countries with which we compete. This is a strong view of Ireland. I see the establishment of the aforementioned forum in such a context. It clearly demonstrates that the Government listens to what people say on the impact of regulation on business and enterprise.The company law review group was asked to carry out a specific task with regard to legislation pertaining to directors' compliance. It has completed this work, which is currently at Government. The Government will make a decision on the matter shortly.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	84	I do not agree with the Minister's comment that the Government has an agile perspective of the matters that come before it. The approach is reactive rather than agile. The Government has been warned about these issues as legislation proceeded through the Houses. In particular, there were warnings that the directors' compliance statement in the Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Bill 2003 would create enormous problems for inward investment in the country, with directors based in the US, for example, needing to sign off directors' statements for businesses and foreign direct investment here.The Government and the Taoiseach in particular was warned about these issues and potential mistakes. The Minister is now attempting to disguise this with a forum report. Will the Minister comment on the small business forum that he felt obliged to set up recently? There is also a group to implement the enterprise strategy group's report. Another group is being announced today to deal with better regulation, some issues of which we are already aware and which we do not need a group to recognise. Does the Minister agree that what is needed is the implementation of the enterprise strategy group's report in a concerted proactive way? The views of people could be taken at that stage rather than now setting up another committee and waiting another year and a half to implement measures required to assist small business in the regulatory environment.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	85	This is an example of typical cheap Opposition tactics condemning any group established. The bottom line on the enterprise strategy group is that the fundamentals have been implemented in terms of economic migration policy.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	86	How many recommendations have been implemented?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	87	The Employment Permits Bill 2005 is awaiting this House to pass it on to Committee Stage. The transport initiative unveiled yesterday is central to recommendations arising from the enterprise strategy group. Another example is work on and investment in research and development.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	88	Why is another group needed?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	89	I am dealing with the issue. The One Step Up initiative has been allocated an extra €40 million this year. It was used immediately to upskill the workforce. Whatever criteria are used, there is solid progress on the implementation of the recommendations of the enterprise strategy group. The reorganisation of Enterprise Ireland, taking into account its new strategic vision is another example. The restructuring approach is dealing with sales and marketing along with technology. This is a key driver of the recommendations of the enterprise strategy group.The last time a small business task force existed was when Deputy Séamus Brennan was Minister for Trade and Employment, more than ten years ago. Most people would accept the outcome of that work was particularly significant for small business in terms of improving the environment for these businesses within the general economy. We must get away from the simplistic notion that we should not think strategically about the country's future.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	90	This is a talking shop and the Minister knows it.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	91	One of the great driving forces behind Ireland's transformation economically over the past decade or so has been the strategic approach taken on macro issues. These are significant fundamental issues in attracting investment and getting the overall business climate correct. This is why the country has been so successful, more successful than any other country, in attracting mobile investment. We should move away from silly politicking.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	92	No new group is needed to cover up the mistakes made.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	93	I propose to take Questions Nos. 107 and 133 together.The public consultation process on the groceries order generated more than 550 submissions which were received from a wide range of parties, including a significant number from the general public. The submissions have all been considered and my Department has now compiled a detailed report on the process. I have also met various groups in the past month to discuss the groceries order. The report is comprehensive and I intend to bring recommendations to Government shortly. Revocation or amendment of the order will require primary legislation.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	94	The last line has at least been changed from the standard reply. A word processor was required to change the answer this time.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	95	It is definitely changing.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	96	The last answer the Minister gave the House on this issue stated that findings would be considered and recommendations would be brought to Government by the end of October. That date has come and gone. When will the Minister make the decision, and what will the decision be? The Minister has consulted widely and there were 550 submissions, so what is so difficult? The Minister's public utterances convey a very clear view on what he wishes to do, regardless of submissions. When will we witness the decision and relevant legislative proposals?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	97	The Deputy will see those very shortly and I look forward to his support.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	98	It is difficult to support something we cannot see.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	99	What does that mean? In telling this House for months that the decision is coming shortly and then providing a specific date, the end of October, it is not good enough to be glib and state that it will come shortly. The livelihood of interested parties depends on this decision and it is a matter to get right.The Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business has had detailed discussions with all interested parties. I was aghast to hear the Minister dismiss all this on a radio programme as being irrelevant, and that the work done on a cross-party basis by the joint committee was of little concern to him. When will the Minister appear before the joint committee to hear the views of all members, including members of his own party, on the issue and reach an accommodation? The joint committee is agreed on change that will drive forward an agenda to best protect the consumer and present choice, accessibility and proper spatial planning.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	100	I have made no glib response. I have given detailed consideration to the issue, as is appropriate. The Government will make the decision before it is brought to the House along with legislative proposals.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	101	When will this happen?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	102	The Deputy should allow me to respond. I was somewhat surprised that originally, there was a knee-jerk reaction on the part of the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business to oppose any change to the groceries order, even before the consumer strategy group reported.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	103	There was no such thing.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	104	However, I am glad to see there has been some amendment of that position.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	105	Has the Minister read the reports? There are two of them.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	106	I have. While it is extremely carefully worded on a number of fronts, I have made it clear that the retention of the groceries order is not a tenable proposition in the future. However, the Department received 550 written submissions on this matter. As I have stated, it was only fair to give those concerned about the issue an opportunity to discuss it with me verbally. This has taken place over recent weeks. I was not being glib about the issue and it was unfair of Deputy Howlin to suggest that. It is important to give that opportunity to people——
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	107	When will we see a result?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	108	——from different sides. Consequently, as I have stated, I will go before the Government shortly and will not pre-empt its decision. I will come back before the House when that decision has been taken.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	109	Does the Minister believe there should be a retention of the ban on predatory pricing and below cost selling?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	110	As I have stated, the existing order is not a ban on below cost selling but is on below the net invoice price——
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	111	The Minister should answer the question he was asked.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	112	In the first instance, I will bring my recommendations to the Government. It will make a decision on the issue and I will then revert back to the House. In time honoured fashion, I am going about this in the proper manner. First, I will go to the Executive and then I will bring the matter back before the House.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	113	The Minister has stated he is in favour of abandoning the groceries order. He has just stated he will bring his views on the groceries order to the Government first and then before this House in an orderly fashion. He has already made his views known.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	114	That is the Minister's conclusion.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	115	Does the Minister agree that the bans on predatory pricing or below cost selling should be retained? I know this is not easy for me to understand.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	116	The Deputy should define what he means.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	117	The Minister is being quite arrogant.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	118	Does the Deputy understand what he has just asked?
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	119	Yes. The Minister should answer the question.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	120	The groceries order is not a ban on below cost selling and is not a ban on predatory pricing.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	121	I did not ask the Minister about the groceries order. I asked him another question.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	122	Existing legislation already covers that.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	123	I asked the Minister a different question. That is not a shared view.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	124	Can the Minister clarify the supplementary answer he has just given? He stated that existing legislation deals with the issue of predatory pricing. What section of the Companies Act deals with the issue of predatory pricing? Is it not a fact that one must be a dominant player and that in the grocery trade, the criteria are laid down by the courts? No one has reached the 40% threshold for being a dominant player in the market. The Minister has now told the House that a law exists which would protect against predatory pricing. Where is it?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	125	The Competition Act deals with the issue. I sought advice and views on this matter and it deals with the issue of predatory pricing and abuse of dominance.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	126	It does not.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	127	The issue of jurisprudence is separate. However, I do not accept the proposition which the Deputy has just articulated. As I stated earlier, I will bring the full range of proposals and recommendations on this issue to the Government shortly. I will then make a full presentation of those recommendations to the House. Comprehensive work has been carried out on the issue by officials within my Department and I ask Members, when they get time, to read them——
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	128	Has the Minister read the report by the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	129	I have read the joint committee's report and have had discussions with its chairman.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	130	In that case, the Minister is fully briefed. Deputy Cassidy will have briefed him fully.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	131	It is an interesting report.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	132	As a brief and final supplementary matter, there are two reports, so I am unsure whether the Minister has read both. He has referred to a single report when there are two reports.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	133	I know that.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	134	In view of the importance which the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business has attached to these matters and the fact that it has spent a great deal of time and public energy on them, will the Minister come before the joint committee with his comprehensive proposals to discuss them in advance of working out the mechanisms for a final decision? In other words, I ask him not to pre-empt the Government's decision but to discuss mechanisms, as far as the specific legislation is concerned, with the joint committee before reaching a final immutable position.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	135	First, the Government makes decisions on these issues. This is the position.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	136	Under the Constitution, law is made by the Oireachtas. I know that comes as a shock to the Minister.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	137	I have not finished and the Deputy does not appear inclined to give me an opportunity to do so.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	138	It is the Oireachtas and not the Government which makes law.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	139	The Government makes decisions on whether to introduce legislation to the House. Such legislation is then published and it is then open for all Members to have an input into it.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	140	Does that mean the Minister will not come near the joint committee?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	141	The Deputy should allow me to finish. This will require primary legislation and all Members will have the opportunity to contribute to any legislation. In addition, I have no difficulty in discussing the report that I will produce and publish with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business. The joint committee members will require time to discuss the report. However, under no circumstances can the committee itself take on board the executive function of the Government to decide what legislation may be brought before the House. In the ordinary course of legislation which passes through the House, Deputies may table amendments to it. This is the context in which they normally make their views known on any issue.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	142	It is good that the Minister may accept the Members' views. If he had accepted them on the issue of directors' compliance, he would not have walked into that problem.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	143	The framework for development contribution schemes was agreed under the Planning and Development Act 2000 to update the long-standing development levy system. That system had applied since 1963 and is a means of funding capital projects to service land for new development. The operation of these schemes is primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.Nevertheless, from an enterprise development and an employment perspective I am concerned about issues that affect the competitiveness of companies operating in this country and the jobs they sustain. I am aware that some enterprises have voiced concern about their experience regarding development contributions and the manner in which they are applied. This is of particular concern to manufacturing companies and those facing international competition.Consequently my Department recently wrote to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to explore how these issues can be considered. As a result, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has agreed to chair an interdepartmental group to examine the matter.This examination is particularly timely as all local authorities have indicated they will review their schemes in the next year or so. If the Deputy or others in the House wish to contact me about the operation of development contributions from an enterprise perspective, I will ensure that these views will be taken into account in the context of this review.

All local authorities were obliged to have adopted these levies by March 2004. I have recently become a fan of the Minister and read his Ard-Fheis speech in which he criticised what I believe he referred to as the alternative Government when he expressed concerns about the councils and the high level of levies they had imposed. Does he agree that these high levels were imposed when the councils were, in the main, controlled by his party colleagues?Can the Minister indicate what might be a reasonable levy for these councils to impose on potential development? Does he agree that the reason we have these development levies, be they residential or commercial, is because the Government does not fund local authority projects as it did in the past?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	145	I do not accept the Deputy's points because a range of new revenue opportunities have emerged for local authorities in recent times, not least these development levies. The economic growth and buoyancy of recent years must have added significantly to the revenue generating capacity of local authorities.I have been around the country meeting the various——
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	146	Fianna Fáil Deputies.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	147	——sectors involved in the productive side of the economy, particularly on the manufacturing side as well as the chambers of commerce and so on. The variation between local authorities emerged as a factor. There can be quite sharp differences between the levies imposed by some local authorities as opposed to others, which illustrates the strong local control over the schemes adopted by any particular local authority.We must be careful, particularly in respect of export-oriented manufacturing companies, to examine the overall picture in terms of retaining indigenous companies' manufacturing capabilities in this country to avoid the inadvertent creation of disincentives to their expansion here, given the global cost bases involved.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	148	Was the Minister in Government at all during the last two years?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	149	Local authorities must take due note of this in future and I hope they will examine their schemes in that respect. I understand there is no differentiation between the commercial, manufacturing and retail sectors in many of the schemes. That is another factor which should be taken on board.While these levies have been in force since 1963, updating them has been taken as an opportunity to ramp up some of them. The Deputy has asked a simple question and I have a concern about this matter from an enterprise perspective. I have articulated that concern to a number of managers.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	150	The Minister was very disingenuous when he said we always had these levies. A total of €250 million has been collected in levies arising from the Planning and Development Act 2000, at which time the Minister sat at the Cabinet table and allowed the 20% cut in capital expenditure of local authorities to be funded by another stealth charge to communities in the form of development levies. The Minister is crying crocodile tears if he talks about the threat to the manufacturing sector imposed by these levies and other costs when he presided over stealth charges and taxes set by his Government in order to make up the shortfall in local authority funding. He should ask the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to review these levies, the related legislation and the state of capital funding to local authorities in light of this imposition.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	151	Hear, hear.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	152	First, I object to the Deputy's comments. It is about time we accept responsibility at local level.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	153	The Government must accept it.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	154	With the greatest respect, Deputy Hogan's party made a big song and dance about gaining control of local authorities the length and breadth of the country. We will now see how——

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	156	——pro-enterprise and responsible it is in terms of managing these levies at local level.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	157	If the Minister read the legislation, he would see the levies cannot be reviewed for two years.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	158	The legislation is no excuse for the wide differentiation between local authorities vis-à-vis these particular levies. Why is it that in one county it can be at a certain level and at a much higher level in another county? The Deputy cannot keep blaming the centre.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	159	The Government imposed the levies.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	160	When we give enabling powers and authority to local authorities, we in this House should accept that the responsibility then lies——

The amount of funding allocated to local authorities has been increased year by year by consecutive Ministers.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	173	I propose to take Questions Nos. 109, 111 and 151 together.The House will be aware that there have been significant job announcements in County Donegal recently with over 210 new jobs announced by Zeus Industrial Products, Letterkenny and PowerBoard, Burnfoot, which are being supported by the Industrial Development Agency and Enterprise Ireland, respectively. This was in addition to 423 jobs I announced earlier this year for the north west region. I assure the House that the State development agencies under my aegis, namely, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, FÁS and Donegal County Enterprise Board, are fully committed to supporting and promoting job creation and job retention in the county.In addition to recent job announcements, this commitment is also evidenced by ongoing development and support by the agencies for a number of business parks and enterprise centres in County Donegal, which include the completion of the IDA Ireland Letterkenny business park, the provision of a 25,000 square foot advance office building at Windyhall, and the completion of site development work at Ballyshannon for a new facility and a development at Buncrana, where IDA Ireland is working with a local developer to provide new manufacturing and office buildings. In addition to providing support for nine community enterprise centres in County Donegal, Enterprise Ireland has provided substantial support for the expansion of the Letterkenny Institute of Technology business development centre and the development of a marine biotechnology centre.While the Central Statistics Office does not provide information on unemployment rates on a county by county basis, the quarterly national household survey shows an unemployment rate of 4.9% for the Border region in the second quarter of 2005. Bearing in mind that unemployment in 1995 stood at 11.4%, this represents a very significant positive development.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	175	The figure was 11.4% in 1995 but it is now 4.9%.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	177	However, I recognise that there have been significant job losses in County Donegal in recent years, which is why I have visited the county a number of times since becoming Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. I have met many groups and companies on these visits to discuss the county's difficulties and its positive developments. My colleagues in Government recognise the particular difficulties in the county and we will work together to assist in improving the overall environment to increase the attractiveness of County Donegal as a location for enterprises.In this context, I have established an interdepartmental group on County Donegal to be chaired by the Secretary General of my Department. I have asked the group, which will hold its first meeting this week, to report back to me as a matter of urgency. The group's terms of reference are to identify the various local issues posing barriers to the establishment and operation of enterprises, take stock of relevant projects and actions already under way or planned and identify measures that could be taken by the relevant Departments and agencies to support the environment for enterprise development and quantify the resources required. I assure the Deputies that support for job creation in County Donegal will continue to remain a priority for the State development agencies under the auspices of my Department.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19225	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	181	The plan will cost €34.4 billion. Maps were produced that were virtually identical to those produced previously. A total of 35 of the 40 projects were announced previously. Every householder will be asked to pay €25,000 through taxes or road tolls but they were not given any detailed costings, evaluations of the key items or prioritisation of projects based on the rates of return. Why is the Government denying these types of details to the public, which must pay this money in the coming years? Any plan worth its salt would have them. Most of the previous plans originating from any Government source were not slim volumes of this nature or did not cost €34.4 billion but were substantial documents.I suppose we must accept it on faith when Ministers tell us that detailed and due diligence has been paid to this plan and careful scrutiny has been carried out. Will the Taoiseach answer three questions on the plan under this heading? First, will he give an indication of when work on the Luas line to Lucan will start? Will the Taoiseach state how much will the metro cost? Will he also state which projects will be funded under public private partnership? If he has done the due diligence and the analysis he stated he has, those are not unreasonable questions on specific flagship projects within the plan.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	204	After the sixth interruption may I reply to Deputy Bruton, who did not interrupt me once? Deputy Bruton asked a fair question on the detailed cost of each project. If the Department were to outline and detail all of the projects and the cost estimate that CIE and other organisations and agencies had for each project, it would make that information available commercially to everyone who tenders. Deputy Bruton would accept that would be entirely wrong. On each project, the agencies and the Department have individually and collectively given estimates to the Department of Finance. The same processes, including the revised issue regarding value for money requested by the Department of Finance, are dealt with in these projects.Individual projects, such as the Luas from Lucan to the city centre, are listed in the one page report on when projects will be out. For years the agencies had an annual capital programme but were not able to procure the staff or organisation to create a team to deal with projects on a year by year basis. While over the past six or seven years we have made a major move toward producing proper infrastructure, the full list of projects of which is impressive, it is important for the agencies and the country that we systematically analyse all the projects to see what is necessary and put them in a detailed format. That answers the question.With regard to questions asked on due diligence, the Minister outlined in a statement yesterday the criteria he took into account. It is not necessary for me to do so. I am sure the Minister will do it again if he is asked.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19225	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	205	The Taoiseach's answer is an elaborate sham. We know the National Roads Authority published what it projected various projects would cost time and again. That did not result in commercial folly. It resulted in finding that many of those projects ran massively over cost and embarrassed the Government. The Government is not willing to commit itself to any costing. The Taoiseach has not done due diligence on this. If he had, he could tell me what the metro will cost, which projects will be PPP and when the Luas line to Lucan will start, none of which is in the plan.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19225	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	207	Let us be honest. The national development plan was published in 2000. It was to cost €8 billion. Twelve months before the end of that plan, we see that half of the projects will not be completed on time and the cost will be three times what was originally stated. The public is asking how can it have more confidence in this plan than in the previous one, when the Government and the Taoiseach are not willing to give any open evaluation or costing to justify the cost of €25,000 per household and show it will yield value for money.The truth is that every time a difficult issue arises, the Taoiseach and his Government produces another plan. Deputy Martin produced a health plan to end waiting lists. Where did it get us? Deputy Cullen's electoral voting plan is rusting in warehouses. A computing plan for the health service is lying abandoned because it cannot compute.

We now find that less than 5% of the jobs to be moved through decentralisation will be moved within the schedule of the three year plan. The Taoiseach described it as an issue of essential political commitment on which Ministers would be judged. On all of these issues the Taoiseach looks for a card to get him out of jail. Like many of the great socialists before him who produced plans such as the great leap forward, spurious five year plans have been produced to get away from the fact the public does not want plans, it wants delivery. That is the acid test on which this Government fails.Yesterday the Labour Party produced a chronicle of the wasted money that could have had an impact on many critical services. That is where the Taoiseach fails and this programme does not provide the answers to key questions to which the public has a right.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	211	I refer the Deputy to the costing criteria set out yesterday by the Minister for Finance. I do not accept any of the points made by the Deputy. The national plan produced 185 km of motorway, 385 km of dual carriageway and bypasses in approximately 20 towns throughout the country. We spent €1,370 million on roads this year alone. I can outline all of the contracts if necessary. It includes work on doubling Exchequer support for CIE, new buses for Dublin Bus, new buses for Iarnród Éireann——

When the Opposition had an opportunity, it announced the Luas but did not provide funding for it. To announce the Luas, put no money in the kitty and leave it for us was an intelligent plan. Its entire transport plan was approximately €250 million per year, which would never have got us to where we are.

It is true that items in the national development plan are not completed. Those items are included in this plan because we want to see the intercity rail routes completed. We put together a coherent plan based on the best professionalism of all the statutory agencies working with the Department of Transport which we never had.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	227	I have two questions for the Taoiseach. Does he recall the speech made by the Minister for Finance on 20 October? This was a 12 point plan the Minister for Finance announced to counteract the litany of waste, misspending and maladministration that had given rise to the controversies in the public domain before that. He announced a major initiative, a 12 point plan, point three of which was that there would be ex ante evaluations including economic cost benefit appraisal for all projects above €30 million.I presume that as a result there has been that kind of ex ante evaluation and cost benefit analysis of yesterday’s plan. On the assumption the Taoiseach has complied with the Minister’s requirement, when will he put it into the public domain and publish it? For example, I would like to see the costings of the superior plan for a metro system to Dublin Airport, as compared to a spur line to the railway or DART system. I would like to hear the arguments that set out that the metro is the superior system. There are several other things I would like to see supported by the documents. When will the Taoiseach put these into the public domain and lay them before the House?On the subject of the buses, the Minister announced he had provided for 20 additional buses. I asked for information from CIE because I have been looking for more than 20 new buses for my constituency and I was shocked by that statement which he repeated last night on "Prime Time". The information provided to me by CIE is as follows, that the national development programme, as referred to by the Taoiseach, between 2000 and 2006, provided for an additional 275 buses but only 93 were provided and none at all since 2001. I further find that CIE made a submission to the Department of Transport for 210 additional buses between 2006 and 2008 and not 20 buses. The Minister, Deputy Cullen, as brazen as you like, said last night in a speech to which the Taoiseach referred, "However I am conscious that Dublin has short term immediate needs for 20 additional buses in the coming weeks and I will immediately sanction these".

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	256	Deputy Burton should make up her mind whether she is a heckler or a politician.The Luas has carried 20 million passengers so I doubt the credibility of the Labour Party to make any comments on this matter.Deputy Rabbitte asked me three questions. This plan is the result of due diligence and the full costing of the agencies to enable the Department of Finance to properly cost it as a proper national plan. I hope this will be sufficient to deal with it over the years. As the Minister stated yesterday, there may be contingencies needed and other priorities might be decided upon. However, based on what is in this plan and based on the proper costings and on the criteria set down by the Minister for Finance, the first point has been dealt with.On the subject of buses, Deputy Rabbitte has decided to jump on one issue to which the Minister referred yesterday and that is fair enough. I will list the figures for the House. In recent years, 862 new buses have been provided to Dublin Bus, 624 new buses to Bus Éireann——

He then went on to give full details of the full requirements for buses over the next decade and this is contained in his speech. I am sure there is no need for me to read sections of his speech to the House.

The metro north will go from St. Stephen's Green to Swords via Dublin Airport and is scheduled for completion in 2012. A new orbital metro west will shadow the M50 to the west and connect the Luas red line at Tallaght with metro north to Ballymun. A new Luas line will operate from Lucan to the city centre and there will be an extension of the Luas green line from Sandyford to Cherrywood. Those are the details of how it will link in. A railway interconnector will also be constructed while the electrification of the Kildare line——

From an engineering point of view, not to mind a cost point of view, for planning reasons and to try to get co-operation with the agencies, we will not be able to deliver projects like these if we do not work on the basis of a prolonged period. The Government, based on the national development plan, the national spatial strategy and the best advice we have been able to muster, which has included working with people from South Africa, Australia and the United States in the course of the NDP, is trying to move satisfactorily from having very poor infrastructure to having very good infrastructure. We have done an enormous amount of work, which has been far ahead of our commitments.Deputy Bruton mentioned the costs. We have spent more and delivered much more and have not completed all projects. In some cases we got stuck in planning——

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	267	The transport plan is not about making a political point. The Government is not saying what we will have done by 2007 or 2012 but trying, over the next decade, to move infrastructure from the very good base to which we have brought it in a manner which is properly planned, costed and designed and to give people adequate time to get this right. If that approach is wrong, it is a sad day for the country. Rather than whinging about some broken bus somewhere, which is a ridiculous attitude, the Opposition should at least acknowledge that the plan involves proper planning and investment.
#SeanRyan	unknown-#SeanRyan-party	unknown-#SeanRyan-dob	unknown-#SeanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	268	My constituents want to get to work by bus. Delivering a bus service is the simplest element of transport, yet the Government has failed to do so.

I have a copy of a reply to a parliamentary question tabled by my colleague, Deputy Shortall. Dated 3 February 2005, it details the number of buses operating in Dublin in different years. The figures, which can be checked, show that the number of buses in Dublin in 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004, respectively, was 1,062. One can gather from this the number of new buses the Government has provided. Given that the Minister for Transport deliberately sought to misrepresent the figures on buses, what confidence can we have in him on any of the other aspects of the transport plan?The Taoiseach seems to resent Deputies asking him to support the claims he made yesterday, which were purely aspirational and for which no supporting documents were provided. In a speech made on 20 October the Minister for Finance stated:I believe it is appropriate to reduce the project value level to €30 million. This approach will include identification and carefully quantified analysis of all the relevant project costs and benefits, including indirect costs as well as the identification of any risks of cost escalation.The speech is only a couple of weeks old.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	272	That was the new initiative and the Government appears to have spurned it already. I simply asked the Taoiseach to lay the results of the evaluation before the House. The reason he did not indicate that he would do so was that no such evaluation has been done.There is little point in referring to a protest which we — properly — organised when the trams or carriages were delivered during Senator O'Rourke's time as Minister for Public Enterprise when she was trying to make up her mind on whether to go underground or overground. The issue we were protesting against was the delay and serious cost overrun for the project. Since then, the Government has built five kilometres of tunnel in a project which has overshot by two years and €340 million. The Taoiseach now asks the House to believe the Government will build tunnels from Ballymun to Tallaght and the inner city to the airport. What kind of cloud cuckoo land does he believe the rest of us join him in? This only backs up the campaign we launched yesterday which the Taoiseach so resented.The Government Front Bench comprises a shower of wasters who will not come in to the House to support the Taoiseach's grand plan. They misrepresent facts and expect us to buy a pig in a poke. The transport plan is purely a media event to try to get out of the hole in which the Government finds itself and the more it digs, the deeper the hole becomes, although it is not yet big enough to build a metro.

We outlined the details yesterday. I repeat the point that the Department of Transport in the work leading up to the plan with all the relevant agencies looked in detail at the proposals we believed it would be necessary to deal with as a priority. We did this on every single project. As I said, it would be commercial nonsense to indicate the exact figure on costs for every project. However, the Department and the relevant agencies, based on what they have been doing for a number of years, have built up what they require to undertake this plan.Now that we have clearance on the precise elements of the plan, all the necessary detailed planning and development work as well as the implementation of the constituent programmes will have to move ahead in the timeframes outlined. The Department will establish a monitoring group under its chairmanship for the purpose of overseeing the implementation of what is a very elaborate plan to bring the infrastructure of this country up to scale. It obviously irks people that we have done this.The work was done not by politicians but by the best engineers available to us who, day in day out, are delivering successfully, whether it is the rail safety plan, the opening of Luas or the construction of the port tunnel, a hugely successful operation and only the second tunnel of its kind in Ireland.

It is not the case, as one Deputy indicated, that we have not completed projects. The opening of 185 km of motorway, including 66 km this year, ranks very highly by international standards. We have built a massive 385 km of new dual carriageway and single carriageway in recent years and have bypasses in many parts of the country. A total of €1.37 billion was spent doing this. Exchequer funding for CIE doubled, 1,550 buses were delivered, as were intercity carriages and new rail cars. In addition, we had the success of Luas.Unfortunately, all we have seen today is the usual old begrudgery of people who hate to see progress.

Does he realise there can be no meaning or future for it if the management of Irish Ferries gets away with dumping Irish-based workers and hiring vulnerable people who will be exploited through lower wages and poorer conditions? Is he aware that Irish workers in the public and private sectors are deeply concerned at the development and that they express that concern daily? The Taoiseach has condemned the Irish Ferries management, but what will his Government do about it?Is he aware that a draft EU directive on ferry services was proposed by the European Commission but withdrawn in August 2004 because agreement could not be reached on the final text at the Council of Ministers? To his credit, a Fianna Fáil MEP, Mr. Liam Aylward, asked the Commission if it intended again to propose a directive on staffing conditions for ferry services operating not only between EU member states but linking such states with other destinations. Does Mr. Aylward's question reflect Government policy, and will the Government support and lobby for the reintroduction of such a draft directive so that social dumping on ferries and the setting of the lowest labour standards in order to exploit workers further can be combatted and ended?

Does the Taoiseach not also recognise that, in An Post's refusal to pay increases due under Sustaining Progress, its management is also contributing to the further erosion of confidence?

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	298	I have answered the Irish Ferries point three weeks in a row, but I will briefly recap by saying that the issue is before the Labour Court. As Deputy Ó Caoláin stated, we have examined our legislation at both European and national level. Last week Deputy Rabbitte also made some proposals in this regard. We must see if there is a way of dealing with ships registered offshore that endeavour to use this country but keep their staff totally outside its jurisdiction. I have been advised to date that no law can do that. There is no relevant European law, and even if there were one, many of the flags of convenience linked to other places would remain outside of European Union law and the legal difficulties in trying to implement this would create substantial difficulties.I met Irish Ferries management at the beginning of last week. I outlined the difficulty that its actions have caused. It made all its arguments to me, but I do not accept that the procedures it used are valid. I know it argues that nearly all its workers have applied for redundancy. It wishes to deal with that, but it has created difficulties in the wider trade union movement. It is a bad practice to remove Irish jobs in order for others to come in on lower rates. I have heard arguments in that regard outside the House, but I still do not agree with it and I have made my position very clear. I have agreed to work with the unions to examine its legality. The Minister has already done so and set out a detailed case to the unions. Regarding IBEC agreeing with the employers, it is the employers' organisation. Since it tends to agree with employers, that does not surprise me.On the issue of An Post, the membership of the CWU has voted for strike action on the basis of the non-payment of Sustaining Progress increases. The union has granted the company 14 days before industrial action. That will expire on Friday. Talks are ongoing today to see what, if anything, might be done to deal with that. I do not want to say anything about them, other than to say that I naturally hope that they facilitate an acceptable agreement.On the pay issue the Deputy raised, the membership of the CWU voted for action, but it is not clear what form that action might take. At the request of the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, the implementation body will facilitate today's talks between the two sides to find a resolution in the context of the Labour Court recommendation to which I referred last week. The AHCPS, the PSEU and the CPSU have referred the non-union payment of Sustaining Progress to the Labour Court for determination. The Labour Court decided that members of the AHCPS and CPSU have agreed and implemented change agreements and on that basis are entitled to Sustaining Progress increases as set out in the Labour Court recommendations issued last summer.That means that Sustaining Progress payments due this year and next will be paid from the due dates. That due in 2003 and 2004, which amounts to 5%, was paid to An Post employees and pensioners from 1 January 2005 on foot of the assessor's report, and retrospective payments due will be considered in the context of the company's financial situation. The recommendation made regarding the PSEU is that, where it agrees and implements changes to work practices, Sustaining Progress will be paid on the same basis as to members of other unions.An Post has accepted the Labour Court recommendation and stated that pensioner members of the AHCPS, CPSU and PSEU will also receive payments under Sustaining Progress. As I understand it, An Post is prepared to continue negotiations on that basis.I have outlined the position in full regarding all the unions involved. Needless to say, I hope the discussions on the remaining parts will be successful.

The notion is implied in his response that it is normal and acceptable from an employer's perspective, but it is no such thing; it is abnormal and must be addressed. If the Taoiseach is not prepared to grapple with IBEC, recognising his special responsibility for the partnership process, will he not now intervene with An Post to modify its intransigent position and allow for payment to workers to proceed under the Sustaining Progress agreement?

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	304	I do not believe I misheard Deputy Ó Caoláin, but if I did, I apologise. The question he asked was about IBEC in the context of An Post and I said that was normal practice.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	305	No, it was in the context of Irish Ferries, and I put it clearly.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	306	I will not argue, but I thought the Deputy said the opposite. As regards Irish Ferries, I am on record to the effect that I thought that was an ill-advised position for IBEC to take. In fairness to the director general of IBEC, he changed the confederation's position on that about three or four weeks ago, which I certainly appreciated. I believe IBEC should not have taken the line it did. I answered as regards what it said about An Post, because it is the employers' organisation, rather than about Irish Ferries.I have outlined the situation. It is not for me to be directly involved in any of these disputes. That is not the practice and it is not the correct or appropriate procedure. I have just outlined the factual position. The industrial relations machinery, including the Labour Court, the Labour Relations Commission, the conciliation councils and the registered trade agreements as well as the National Implementation Body, NIB, should be used to resolve such matters. I have indicated strongly that these are issues I should like to see resolved and will not change. The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dempsey, has been enormously helpful in trying to resolve these issues and in trying to be fair.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	308	Every Minister involved in such disputes is attacked by both sides, and the Minister, Deputy Dempsey's position is the same. He has been working hard to try to find resolutions for the issues involved and will continue to do so.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	309	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 5, inclusive, together.The total costs incurred by my Department in respect of this tribunal from 1997 to 30 September 2005 is €21,364,879. This includes fees paid to counsel for the tribunal and administration costs incurred to date since its establishment. Total payments made to the legal team were €16,052,473 up to 30 September, 2005.As regards the projected costs for the completion of the tribunal, it is impossible to predict what costs may be awarded, and to whom, by its sole member. The overall estimate for 2005 is €10.552 million. The day to day costs for the tribunal provided for in the Estimate for 2005 amounts to €4 million. However, provision of an additional €6.5 million was made to cover costs such as report publication and some element of award of legal costs in the event that the tribunal completed its work in 2005. I propose to circulate in the Official Report the costs accruing for the tribunal in respect of each year.Given the subject matter of this reply, I think it opportune to inform the House that this morning the Government agreed to a request to extend the deadline for completion of the tribunal. The date originally envisaged for the application of the new fees to the Moriarty tribunal was 11 January 2006. This was calculated on the basis that the tribunal's programme of work, as it stood in mid-2004, would be concluded on or about that date. Due to unforeseen circumstances that have since arisen, the extensive nature of its terms of reference and ongoing inquiries, and litigation by the parties involved, the tribunal has requested that it be given an additional amount of time to complete its work.The matter has been discussed with the tribunal. Given the relative imminence of the conclusion of its work, it is believed that it is reasonable to facilitate its continuance until 30 June 2006. This represents an extension of five and a half months on the previously expected completion date. It is to be borne in mind that the tribunal has been in operation for eight years and is now nearing its completion.It is expected that the new tribunals legislation will be enacted prior to 30 June 2006. Therefore, there should be no obstacle to reducing fees payable to lawyers appearing before the Moriarty tribunal after that date, in the event that it has not completed its work by then.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.The costs of the tribunal accruing in respect of each year is as follows:2005 up to 30 September = €2,721,6312004 up to 30 September = €3,610,0262003 up to 30 September = €3,440,9542002 up to 30 September = €2,799,0572001 up to 30 September = €2,242,3612000 up to 30 September = €2,171,9211999 up to 30 September = €2,139,6651998 up to 30 September = €1,685,9621997 up to 30 September = €553,303
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	310	The Taoiseach has indicated that the goalposts have been moved again. The conclusion date of 11 January has been put back. Can he estimate how long the Moriarty tribunal will continue, based on current information? Will he clarify the situation as regards the unforeseen circumstances, given the unacceptable cost that is involved, since the inquiry is about corruption within the political process? What unforeseen circumstances make it impossible to predict when the tribunal will finish? Given the proposed scaling down of the fees, will he indicate what has been the response to date on that from the tribunal? Is it a matter of course that this will take place or are there unforeseen difficulties in that regard too, given that the House would like to minimise the cost of the tribunal?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	311	The Deputy has asked a number of questions. The tribunal states it will finish its work by the end of June next year. Given the unforeseen circumstances as regards the litigation of parties involved and other matters, it remains confident that it will finish by next June. The new legislation will be in place by then. That means we will automatically move to the new fees arrangements. We have agreed those dates. Were it not for genuine delays and additional work, the new fees regime would be in place anyway. The Attorney General and Government agree that it is reasonable in these circumstances to allow the tribunal the time it needs to finish. I am advised, however, that the tribunal is confident it will finish by the end of June next year.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	312	Does the Taoiseach agree that this tribunal has continued for much longer than anyone could have anticipated? Is it not fair that we factor in the number of times its work has been obstructed? That is not a value judgment on my part as to whether it ought to continue, but merely to note that it has been obstructed many times as various parties have had resort to the courts. In assessing the balance sheet, it is fair to say that?In his reply to Deputy Sargent, did the Taoiseach say that there is informal contact between the tribunal and the Office of the Attorney General and that there is an end in sight? Has the Taoiseach further information on a question which I put to him before about this, whether the figures he has given in the House include the cost of litigation engaged in to date and whether the State is picking up the bill for that? Is that included in the figures he has given the House?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	313	On the first point, it is true that there have been a number of unforeseen circumstances. The extensive nature of the terms of reference, ongoing inquiries and litigation by parties have contributed to this. Nonetheless, the tribunal believes that its work can be finished entirely by 30 June 2006. The Attorney General, who has been notified of the reasons for the extension, has told the Government that he believes this is the last one and that the tribunal will finish on 30 June. It remains to be seen whether that is the case, but I understand that it is, so long as no further difficulties arise.The position is not so clear as regards Deputy Rabbitte's second question. The total cost which I have given is €21,364,879. This figure includes fees paid to counsel for the tribunal, administration costs incurred to date and the cost of the legal team. It is impossible, however, to predict the projected cost upon completion, including what costs may be awarded and to whom by the sole member of the tribunal. That is not in our estimation. Such decisions must be made by the chairman and will depend on those who try, in whatever form, to recover their costs. The precedent set by other tribunals suggests that some but not all third-party costs will be allowed.I included some €10 million for this purpose in this year's Estimates. I have already released a major part of this into the Exchequer because it is clear the tribunal will not end this year. We must decide what figure to factor in for next year. The Government has no clear idea in this regard and this year's figure was indicative. We do not know whether it is too much or too little.

There are many rulings from the Chair that such issues are not a matter for the Dáil.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	316	It was extremely difficult to follow what the Taoiseach said in response to Deputy Sargent. In the context of the ruling to which I referred, does the Taoiseach not anticipate any extensive roll-on in time in regard to the Moriarty tribunal's sittings? Are there cost implications from this ruling for his Department? It is unclear whether the new fee to apply from 11 January 2006 will kick in as of that date, irrespective of what progress has been made by the tribunal at that time.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	317	I will try to be clear. An extension was sought for the reasons outlined in my reply and reiterated to Deputies Sargent and Rabbitte. It is hoped the tribunal will complete its work by the end of June. The new fee rate will come in after that.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	318	The specified time was 11 January.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	319	Yes. However, I have given the reasons for the change in this regard. Due to the extensive nature of its terms of reference, its ongoing inquiries and the litigation of parties involved, the tribunal has asked for additional time to complete its work.I can make no comment or judgment in regard to any of the tribunal's decisions. Neither do I know what costs will be given by the sole member. These are matters he must adjudge at the completion of his work.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19225	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	320	The terms of reference made provision for the publication of an interim report not later than three months from the date of establishment of the tribunal. Was such a report presented to the House? Has the Taoiseach asked for any subsequent reports that would give some indication of the tribunal's thinking, bearing in mind that some of the issues, apart from the investigative side, concern recommendations in regard to public policy, including those relating to the Revenue Commissioners, Central Bank, accountancy law and procedure, company law and public administration? Has the Taoiseach, over the years, sought interim reports that could shed light on how we can prevent any corrosion of the nature in which we do business across all these spectrums?The terms of reference also specify that the inquiry should be completed in as economical a manner as possible and at the earliest stage consistent with the fair examination of the relevant matters. The Taoiseach has stated that provision of €4 million has been made for the 12 sitting days that remain this year. Is he satisfied these are soundly based costings? Rather than deferring the date when lower costings will come into place, should we not bring forward that date? The Taoiseach suggests 30 June is a definite end date as opposed to one that may again be extended due to litigation or some other of the factors listed in his reply. Has he reason to believe this is a more definitive date than the other dates that were extended?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	321	This extension was requested by the sole member and it his belief that the tribunal will end on that date. As the end approaches, he has a clearer picture of the work remaining to be done.I have never asked the tribunal for interim reports because its terms of reference were devised by the Oireachtas and it would be inappropriate for me to do so.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19225	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	322	Was a first interim report presented?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	323	Subject to correction, I understand no interim report was provided by the Moriarty tribunal.In regard to fees, the former Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy, believed the proposed system was fair, based on the workload and commitment of those working at the various tribunals. The Attorney General, on behalf of the Government, consulted them in agreeing a date on which the new fee structure would come into operation, provided there was not some extension of the terms of reference or some additional work to be undertaken. Such dates were agreed with all the tribunals, some now in the past and others still to come, with a view to ending the current fee system.The instigation of a new system of committees of investigation will be the new way of dealing with what has been dealt with by tribunals. The new tribunals of inquiry legislation, which will come before the House shortly, will provide a new framework for tribunals of inquiry and require the chairperson to conduct an inquiry in a cost effective and efficient manner. It will also provide the Oireachtas with a more flexible mechanism for such inquiries, one that will focus on taking evidence in public. Some elements of the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004 relating to the efficient management of investigations, provision of interim reports and requirements to prepare an estimate of the timeframe and cost of an investigation will be incorporated into the forthcoming tribunals of inquiry Bill. These two items of legislation reflect our experience of these issues over the last eight years or more. There will be a new process in the future.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	324	It is becoming increasingly clear that the Taoiseach must not simply come into the House and say he is pushing back the date on which the new rates kick in. On 22 June, he said that if there was to be any change in the coming into force of the new fees by 11 January 2006, he would bring the matter back before the House. This is something that cannot be passed off with the reply that the date has been shifted. This House must consider whether it is right to put back the date of the new rates. Will the Taoiseach bring a more substantial motion before the House so Members can decide whether the new date is to be applied or whether the new rates are to become effective later than was arranged? Where is the legislation that was promised? The tribunals of inquiry Bill has been promised in the last two sessions. Is it not the case that the Taoiseach finds himself on the back foot due to the delay in introducing this legislation and that the solicitors are, essentially, calling the shots——

A sum of €213,000 is the new rate and that is a reduced, bargain rate given the new rates being proposed for a senior counsel. Much money has still to be paid out.

Who ultimately took the decision to concede? Was any consideration given to, and what is the Taoiseach's view of, the consequences of this decision on the Moriarty tribunal applying to the other tribunals that have set dates for the new fees to become effective? There are many questions about this and I urge the Taoiseach to be as open as possible in the House.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	328	This issue does not arise directly from the question. I raised it in the reply because it was appropriate to do so. The Government only made the decision on this today. There was no lobbying on this issue. The original dates were fixed by conversation between the Attorney General and the ten chairmen of the tribunals on dates of completion. If there is some new work under the terms of reference, something comes to light, there are delays because of litigation or some other difficulty arises, the work cannot be completed. All these matters arose in this case and the chairman stated that to complete the work efficiently and to retain the team, that time was required.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	329	Blackmail, in other words.

I have my own views about the tribunals and trying to get them all to the date but where there is additional work, litigation or other issues to hold up a tribunal, particularly if this tribunal is to be finished next summer, that would be an unfair interpretation to put on it.

All the other tribunals are still working to that deadline. It is not a question that this is just being rolled over but the chairman has given a fixed date to end the tribunal and to deal with all aspects. If that does not happen, it is a problem but at least the plan to complete it has been outlined. Based on that, the Attorney General brought the matter to the Cabinet and the Cabinet approved it. Obviously, the Minister for Finance——

Does the Taoiseach accept that the information being sought, perhaps by a journalist, at a cost of €150 per request could well cost a great deal if a number of requests must be made to pursue a line of inquiry? Does he accept that if it costs €450 for three requests or, perhaps, €600 for a further request, that is excessive?

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	361	With regard to my Department, the fees for the year to date are €825 and €35 in respect of search and retrieval fees. I cannot answer for other Departments, although I do not believe they are different from mine, but in my Department there is no cost for personal information, follow up on personal information or appeal on personal information. The cost is €15 with regard to anybody else. I do not know what line of questioning the Deputy is following because that is not the cost of a freedom of information request.

These are statistical questions. Does the Taoiseach agree with the Information Commissioner? Will he, therefore, strengthen the Act——
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	374	That is a matter for the Minister for Finance. The Deputy is well aware of the fact that this issue refers specifically to the Taoiseach's Department.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	375	I am trying to work within the restrictions.

#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	377	On the Taoiseach's position and that of his Department, does he hold with the Information Commissioner's view as to why there has been a steady decline in the use of the Freedom of Information Act to access information from his Department? Surely that applies.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	378	I noted the points which the Information Commissioner highlighted in her report of last year on the operation of the Act. My understanding was that she was more concerned about the costs of appeal to her office than about the €15 application fee, which is generally not seen as a large amount. It is important to point out there is no charge for the time undertaken in making a decision on a freedom of information request and most other jurisdictions impose such a charge in addition to the application fee.It is important to note that a person who appeals to the commissioner receives a preliminary decision, which is a good indication of the likely final decision. Even at that stage of the process, the requester can withdraw the appeal and obtain a full refund of the fees.With regard to the cost of appeal to the Information Commissioner, practice differs internationally. For example, while a fee of approximately €360 is charged by the Australian Government, regional states in Australia do not charge for an appeal to the commissioner.In the case of my Department, the reality is that the main change has occurred at the application stage. It is unclear whether that is due to the introduction of an application fee or a working through of pent-up demand in the early years, which I believe is the reason. No doubt fees have had an impact but I do not believe that in the case of my Department the size of an application fee of €15 is the reason for that. As I have outlined, not many of these from my Department go to appeal. A small number of applications go to appeal. I do not believe the fee is the difficulty. No doubt the Minister for Finance will look carefully at any points that the commissioner makes.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19225	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	379	I note that prior to the date when the fees were introduced, the rate of requests to the Taoiseach's Department was running at 17 per month and, since that date, the rate has dropped to four per month. Less than a quarter of the earlier number of requests is being made. Were those other 13 requests per month frivolous? Did the Taoiseach's Secretary General advise that there were many frivolous requests for information that were extremely costly? When the Taoiseach went to consider this issue at Cabinet, as he undoubtedly did, was he armed with a great deal of information about the frivolity with which people were treating this in his Department? I note he stated in his reply that his Department does not charge the €75 internal review fee.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	380	No, we do if there is an internal review. The upfront fee is €15. Not many requests go to appeal. There are not many requests for an internal review. We give the information and then one does not get into that process.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19225	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	381	What is the Taoiseach's policy on the €75 review fee? In how many instances has the decision gone the whole way, where the person has had to go to the Information Commissioner to appeal his Department's decisions? In such cases, €230, which is non-refundable, becomes the total cost of the request. Is that a frequent occurrence in the Taoiseach's Department?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	382	In my Department, out of a total of 1,143 freedom of information requests received to date, 94 were received for internal review. As I stated earlier, the personal cases, which many of these would be, would not be covered. In my Department, since the introduction of the Freedom of Information Act seven and a half years ago, a total of 13 requests have been investigated by the Information Commissioner. We are talking about 1% or thereabouts.In case I confused the Deputy, we charge for the internal review of non-personal cases. There is not a high number of such cases. We try to satisfy the respondents in the first case to avoid that decision.On the Deputy's first question, there were definitely a small number of individuals, either acting for themselves or acting as agents and trying to make a business out of this, who were submitting a significant number of freedom of information requests in the early years. Many requests arose because this was the first time freedom of information was available and people wanted to know details about the past, about process and about systems. There are only so many such questions. People wanted to find out about internal reviews for promotion and what happened in various internal circumstances relating to human resource issues. Once answered, such requests are answered. There is no great change or difference about those. People wanted information on circulars and what circulars governed procurement issues, contract issues and so on. Requests for such information are not repeated once the requests are fulfilled.On the changes made to the Act in 2003, the status quo was maintained on the ten-year rule for release of Cabinet records. No Secretary General certificates have been issued and no designated Cabinet working papers have been certified. In the case of protection for inter-ministerial communications relating to Cabinet discussions, it can reasonably be said to have had a significant impact on the volume of freedom of information requests. None of the other areas saw changes. Therefore, it cannot be any of these areas. It is hardly due to the initial cost. That is my view of it.Written Answers follow Adjournment Debate.

It could be opened almost immediately, like the western rail corridor, and not in nine and a half years, considering that the rail and trains are already in existence and all that is lacking is a will to proceed to develop Mayo services and to address regional development.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19225	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	406	I am not sure whether it is three, four or five years since the Planning and Development (Strategic National Infrastructure) Bill was initiated as a high priority Bill. As we come to the end of the national development plan, we have not seen the Bill and most likely will not see it before the national development plan expires. In the context of the new transport plan, is this Bill regarded as a high priority or is it taking a back seat?The greater Dublin area land use and transport authority Bill, a Bill that was close to the heart of a former Minister, Senator O'Rourke, was on the list of proposed legislation for a long period but was then dropped. Was I correct in hearing the Minister state yesterday that it was back on again? It must be five years since the former Minister, Senator O'Rourke, presented the proposal as a red paper and a blue paper but it then fell by the wayside. Is it now finding its way back?Perhaps I am mistaken but I understand a proposal was made that responsibility for ports might move to the Department of Transport. Perhaps this comes under the slogan "Dempsey delivers"— he delivers things out of his Department to other Departments. Will we have legislation or an order rearranging ministerial responsibilities in that context?

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	408	The heads of the Planning and Development (Strategic National Infrastructure) Bill were approved in the early part of the summer. The Bill is due in the spring session. The greater Dublin area land use and transport authority Bill, which was only for the Dublin area, was dropped some time ago. The Minister announced yesterday that his Department and the relevant agencies are considering the issue of better co-ordination. Whether that means legislation or some other way——

However, on hearing the Taoiseach's answer, he clearly has not. Will the Dublin transport authority be on a statutory basis? If so, when will the proposals be introduced?

The proposals in the Bill are not sufficient, and it is not considered to be useful or workable. The Minister stated yesterday that changes will be required to get all of the transport organisations working together to implement a plan of the scale proposed based on what has been happening for the past five or six years. Whether these changes are administrative, legal or otherwise, the Minister will bring them forward with the intention of getting the transport organisations to work more effectively together.

Can we have clarity with regard to the promised legislation required for the implementation of the Transport 21 plan announced yesterday? Is a new Bill planned that will not be called the greater Dublin area land use and transport authority Bill? The Minister referred to a high powered organisation required to co-ordinate 17 public bodies dealing with Dublin alone, never mind the rest of the country. When will the relevant legislation be published?I have tried previously to get an answer on a fundamental question for the House. The tribunal of inquiries Bill has been promised "this session" for some years. If it is not published soon, the House must have a motion to agree, or otherwise, the rowing back of the date for fees——

In page 9, between lines 5 and 6, to insert the following:"(a) chiropractor;”.This amendment seeks to amend section 4 on page 9 of the Bill as presented by inserting in the alphabetical list of designated health or social care professions chiropractor, immediately before clinical biochemist, dietitian and medical scientist. Professions following chiropractor would be designated by the following letter so that, for example, speech and language therapist would become designated profession (m).In making the case for the inclusion of chiropracty as a designated profession I have to inform the House that I visited a chiropractor in the early years of my election to this House and acknowledge the professional service and advice I was given. It is important that chiropracty is properly regulated in this jurisdiction. The situation on the island of Ireland whereby chiropracty is regulated north of the Border, as it is in the neighbouring island, but not south of the Border is unacceptable. We may be the only country in western Europe that has not moved to have chiropracty registered as a profession in the sense and context of this legislation. As this legislation is primarily geared toward public protection, it is important that chiropracty is included. Open borders in Europe allow people to practice here as chiropractors without the qualifications required in another jurisdiction. I have been informed, as other Deputies have, that there is concern within the profession that those struck off in other jurisdictions where registration is a requirement, find no difficulty setting up in this jurisdiction and advertising as practising chiropractors, leaving the public vulnerable to people with dubious records. In order to protect our communities and citizens it is incumbent on us to ensure that the highest standards not only apply but are enforceable. If the Bill passes without the inclusion of chiropracty we will have failed in the fundamental objective of the legislation.We must aim for best practice and the highest standards. The only way to achieve that is to give those involved in chiropracty the recognition and public confidence that a common standard provides by adopting this amendment. I note from correspondence that there are some 150,000 registered chiropractors globally. I do not know the number practising in Ireland but it is growing. In small rural locations such as my own there are now practitioners in the high street. It is important to ensure this large number of practitioners is recognised. There is a duty on Government, on the Minister of State and the Minister for Health and Children to adopt the amendment.
#TimOMalleyPD	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	487	The wider issues raised by the Deputy are hugely important. The Bill shows the way forward by establishing a framework for the statutory registration of health and social care professionals. However, the 12 professions listed in section 4 (1) were selected because they are long-established providers of health and social care within the health service and have in most cases experience of self-regulation. In addition the qualifications of the majority of these professions are currently regulated within the public health service by being declared by the Minister under the Health Act 1970. This is not the case for chiropractors as they are not a public health service grade.As Deputies are aware section 4 also provides for the inclusion, by regulation, of additional professions in the proposed system of statutory registration. This section sets out the criteria to which the Minister shall have regard in considering the designation of further professions under this legislation. These include the degree of risk to health, safety or welfare from the incompetent, mythical or impaired practice of the professions. They also include the extent to which a profession has a defined scope of practice and applies a distinct body of knowledge, and the extent to which the profession has established itself, requiring at least one professional body representing a significant proportion of the profession's practitioners. In addition, it includes the existence of defined routes of entry into the profession and of independently assessed entry qualifications. The future inclusion of any profession is dependent on its meeting these criteria.The framework established by this Bill offers greatly enhanced protection for the public. The Tánaiste has made it clear she favours the programmed and orderly inclusion of additional health and social care professionals in the new statutory framework and she will consider the case for chiropractors in this light. I cannot accept this amendment.

I speak not only as somebody who has been lobbied by people personally interested but as somebody who has used the services of a chiropractor and who knows many others who have done so. The numbers who gravitate to the services of chiropractors in Ireland must be significant because chiropractors are mushrooming all over the country. I welcome that fact but they must be encouraged to develop in an environment of best regulation and highest standards. Public confidence is hugely important and it is not satisfactory that the public must base its judgment as to the appropriateness of a service on the latest report, be it a good report or, God forbid, a damaging report. We must ensure those who present themselves as chiropractors offer the highest standards of qualification applying within the profession in terms of the services provided.I have noted section 4(2) of the legislation which was referred to by the Minister of State. It states: "After consulting the Council, the Minister may, by regulation, designate for the purposes of this Act any health or social care profession not already designated under subsection (1)”. This is the area that has been specified by the Minister of State.I am a resident living close to the Border which in reality is open to me and my fellow community members who traverse back and forth for commerce, social life and cultural activities and a variety of services, including chiropractic services. Perhaps people will not travel greater distances, but this is unfair and unacceptable for residents in Border communities. To us, the Border is not so much an impediment in going back and forth but a reality in many other ways. Those who choose to go to a chiropractor north of the Border do so with greater guarantees and assurance in respect of the service received, as opposed to those of us who may choose to avail of the service offered by a practitioner on this side of the Border, simply because of the registration requirement, the due recognition given and the setting of the highest possible standards for a health or social care profession.Health is one of the areas designated for co-operation. There is already in place a raft of co-operative initiatives on health care delivery with the six Northern counties. Surely anomalies such as this should not continue. One would expect this issue to be addressed more effectively. While I have heard the Minister of State's comments, I press him to confirm that chiropracty will come under section 4(2) of the Bill. The House deserves this assurance at least, but I still urge the Minister of State to reconsider the inclusion of chiropractors in the list of designated professions in section 4(1).

It is unfortunate that he represents a constituency adjacent to the northern section of the country. We must, however, be mindful of the position in the whole country. We considered all professions and the 12 to be included initially are the ones it is agreed should be registered. The Deputy will realise from what I have stated that there will be an opportunity for chiropractors to be included under section 4(2) of the Bill. I remind him that many chiropractors are already registered doctors in the State, although I do not know the percentage or actual number. These registered medical practitioners specialise in chiropracty. I am aware of what the Deputy described, that is, that chiropractors are registered in the United Kingdom. This causes a dilemma but I hope the matter will be sorted out in the near future when the legislation is passed.

As a Border resident, I argue that our reality must therefore be taken into account. I made a point about the special circumstances in which we live, but in taking the interests of everyone in this jurisdiction into account one must point to the need for greater regulation and the official designation of chiropracty which is in the interests of every citizen. If the Minister of State is not in the position to accede to my request today, I hope the arguments will be taken on board and that chiropracty will be designated under section 4(2) of the Bill following the Government's acceptance of the sound arguments for why it should be so.

In page 9, line 11, after "physiotherapist" to insert "or physical therapist".With regard to the previous amendment, will the Minister of State and the Department prepare packs in plain English for those professions which wish to be included under this legislation? The required criteria under section 4 might be outlined. This is a matter for the future and need not be dealt with now.Amendment No. 2 deals with the issue of physiotherapists and physical therapists. When it was discussed on Committee Stage, we were made aware towards the end of our deliberations that there had been ongoing contacts between the Department of Health and Children and organisations representing physiotherapists and physical therapists. We were told at the time that the issue would be resolved by the time the Bill was taken on Report Stage in the Dáil. Rather than revisiting the arguments made on Committee Stage, I give the Minister of State the opportunity to tell us how the negotiations have fared and if the issue can now be dealt with before further remarks are made.

I have much sympathy with physical therapists whose concerns are valid. Nonetheless, there is a difficulty in terms of the international nomenclature of physical therapists. This matter could have been dealt with before the Bill was published rather than at this late stage, but I see no indication that it has been resolved. Will the Minister of State clear up the mystery?

I have been a Member of this House longer than him but he appears to have adopted a wiser approach on this issue. He did not meet either side. It appears to be an intractable problem or a zero sum game.On Committee Stage the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, stated negotiations would take place and a compromise could be reached. It appears to me, from discussions with physiotherapists, that they are not trying to play down physical therapists. The great loser could be the school of physical therapy. If negotiations continue, I hope a solution can be found because clearly the terms "physiotherapy" and "physical therapy" are interchangeable in other countries. However, there is a distinction in this country. I hope the Minister of State will continue to seek a solution, although I do not know whether that is possible. I had hoped one would have been reached before this evening's debate. While I understand the Minister of State's position and I am quite sympathetic, given that these difficulties continue, I will support the Opposition amendment. At this point it would probably be the clearest way to proceed.

In the absence of a resolution of this long-standing dispute in respect of descriptions, the difficulties are only deepened by not recognising physical therapists and only making reference to physiotherapists. I appreciate the difference. In the absence of a resolution it is imperative not to proceed with legislation which excludes one group. I support the amendment as it would offer, at least for now, a position where both would be recorded. I hope this would allow for a level playing field in the further and future redress of the outstanding difficulties which clearly must be resolved, preferably sooner rather than later.

A massive amount of correspondence arose from it and I am sure it was the same for every other Member. I am surprised the Bill has returned to the House on Report Stage as on Committee Stage it was made quite clear that the Department would do all in its power to try to resolve this issue before it reached this point. We will be left with a situation where no side will be happy with the outcome. This is unusual.
#TimOMalleyPD	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	502	When we come to the next amendment, Members will find this is not the only section of which this is true. As far as physical therapists and physiotherapists are concerned, Members will be aware that the issue which has consistently attracted attention during the passage of the Bill through the Oireachtas is that of the protection of title "physical therapist". The Bill specifies a single primary title by which each designated profession will be known under the Bill. This is in line with the drafting advice received. In view of the debate on Committee Stage, it will be helpful to elaborate on the reasons this approach has been taken.There is more than one sound reason for avoiding the use of alternative expressions in the Bill for the same profession. For example, certain presumptions apply when courts interpret legislation, one of which is the presumption of consistent expression whereby the Legislature is presumed to have avoided stylistic variation, that is, the same words have the same meaning and different words have different meaning. The courts also presume that the Legislature avoids superfluous or meaningless words and does not repeat itself. Every word is presumed to have a specific role to play in advancing the purpose of a statute. Superfluous words can lead to problems of interpretation and to courts striving, in unforeseen circumstances, to give a meaning that was never anticipated when a statute was enacted.A third reason for avoiding the use of more than one term for any profession is consistency of approach, or parallelism with the treatment of other professions designated under the Bill. If more than one title was to be protected under the primary legislation for any profession, it would be necessary to take the same approach with every other profession. As far as the professions included in the Bill are concerned, there are a number of alternative or variant titles reflecting, for example, specialisms within them. Thus, the title "radiographer" encompasses both diagnostic radiographers and radiation therapists. Variants also encompass titles used in other countries such as speech and language pathologist rather than speech and language therapist or clinical nutritionist rather than dietician. The word "dietician" can be spelled in two ways. Undoubtedly, it would be confusing for everyone if the primary legislation was used to specify several titles for individual professions, not least the public. That is why the issue of multiple titles is tackled in the legislation through empowering the Minister to protect by regulation variants of the primary title by which those practitioners registered with a registration board of a designated profession are known. As Members are aware, it will be an offence for an unregistered practitioner to use a title protected either under the primary legislation or by regulation.Under section 95(3), the Minister can protect variants of the primary title for all of the professions following consultation with the relevant registration board and any organisations that he or she considers appropriate. An important feature of this process is set out in section 95(7) which provides that a draft of a regulation to be made by the Minister protecting additional titles must be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and that a resolution approving the draft must be passed by each House. This allows each case to be examined on its merits, balancing such factors as protection of the public and the promotion of competition. This is the best and most appropriate way to protect any title that warrants protection.As far as the physiotherapy profession is concerned, the title protected under the Bill is "physiotherapist". However, the Irish Society of Chartered Physiotherapists also wishes to have the title "physical therapist" protected for the exclusive use of those professionals registered with the physiotherapists registration board to be established under the Bill. The society considers both titles to be interchangeable in an international context and believes there is a risk of confusion among the public if the title "physical therapist" is not protected for use by physiotherapists. However, members of the Irish Association of Physical Therapists who currently use the title in this country have argued against such protection and wish to retain the title for their own use.Clearly, this is a complex issue to which Members have given considerable attention. The Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children is of the view that matters must be resolved in a timely way. The way forward is to deal with protection of title issues by regulation as provided for in the Bill. In line with the provisions of section 95(3), the Tánaiste intends to consult the proposed physiotherapists registration board on its establishment and any organisations she considers appropriate on prescribing the title "physical therapist" for use by registrants of the physiotherapy profession. She expects to make an early decision in the matter. Therefore, I do not propose to accept the amendment.

As previous speakers noted, this issue was discussed ad nauseam on Committee Stage and obviously there are many strongly held views on the matter. It is most important that the public is protected.

#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	506	I move amendment No. 3:
In page 9, line 20, after "(1),” to insert the following:"and in particular shall, within the period of 12 months from the passing of this Act, so designate the profession of counsellor or therapist,".Will the Minister of State accept this amendment? I am sure he is aware that thousands of people attend counsellors, therapists and psychotherapists for a range of issues and needs. Some people have been in therapy for many years. Many are vulnerable, perhaps going through crises in their lives and need expert and professional support, for which they turn to counsellors or therapists. Regrettably, it is easy for a person to set up as a counsellor in Ireland. There is a wide range of standards in terms of the type of counsellors people go to.When the Ferns report was published, I was struck by the fact that one of the criticisms made of the health board was that it did not provide counselling for the little girls of Monageer national school. The board should have provided it but the question in the context of this Bill is what guarantee have we that counselling to such a vulnerable group of children is of the proper standard if there is no formal regulation? This question must be answered. People may have degrees in psychology, which is at least some level of professional standard, but not every psychologist is a good or appropriate therapist while there are many excellent therapists who are not psychologists. We need regulation of this area.We could argue about people with bad feet or bunions getting professional treatment, which should be the case, but we have a duty to protect an abuse victim with a damaged psyche from meddling by people who guide and direct in a way they believe is appropriate simply because they have set themselves up as counsellors and therapists, done courses or may have strange ideas about what a counsellor or therapist is. It is a central and essential discipline. If we ignore it, we are leaving many people at risk. I would have believed that the Minister of State, who is not listening to a word I am saying, would consider this a primary duty.It is interesting that the Minister for State at the Department of Education and Science with special responsibility for children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, is also here tonight, for is this not a matter for him? I will not start all over again. In terms of counselling and therapy for young people and adults and when we are dealing with emotional needs as opposed to physical needs, do we not need to ensure standards are set and regulations are in place for this area of treatment and professionalism or absent professionalism?
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	507	I second the amendment and echo Deputy McManus's comments. The amendment recognises the difficulties surrounding the area of regulating counsellors and therapists in that it allows a period of 12 months to elapse before the present and totally unacceptable situation is regularised. It gives space to do so and does not insist the situation should be corrected as of now. I have been of the opinion for some time that there is a need to establish a national competent authority to regulate the area of psychotherapy and counselling. The State must ensure that those who offer a service for a fee and have the trust of service users have recognised competencies coming from approved training programmes. I further believe that those who do not have such training should not be allowed to operate.Psychotherapy and counselling have important roles to play in many areas of life. In respect of mental illness, it is repeatedly highlighted that multidisciplinary community based psychiatric teams, including psychoanalysts and counsellors, is the accepted formula for delivering services but such teams are sadly lacking. There is ignorance and not a little confusion among the general public as to what psychotherapy and counselling are and what the difference is. This is compounded by the fact that there are over an estimated 400 different named therapies, which are used to tackle many medical and social problems, including marriage and family difficulties, anxiety, depression, addiction, sexual abuse, rape, psycho-sexual difficulties, eating disorders, bereavement, adolescent difficulties, AIDS, HIV and many more. In other medical professions, there is a requirement for a basic qualification in medicine and professionals continue to specialise.A rhetorical question is are there 400 specialist qualifications in psychotherapy or counselling? The absence of clear roles and dedicated skills for those roles fuels confusion and the absence of regulation allows for a situation where many calling themselves counsellors in the community and private practice do not warrant professional recognition. One does not need a recognised qualification or skill base to call oneself a psychoanalyst or counsellor. All that is required are premises, a gold plaque outside the door and the neck to charge a fee.There are no means to monitor the present unregulated situation and the opportunity for untrained people acting as psychotherapists or counsellors to do damage is frightening. Vulnerable people in crises who need professional help can be destroyed. This situation has been exposed by some practising alternative medicines where people have been duped out of life savings. Is the same happening in the area of psychotherapy and counselling? It is not alarmist to assume there are instances of it. How much is there and what damage is being done? The stigma that persists in respect of mental, emotional and personal problems prevent the exposure of these issues. Those damaged in such a way may not be in a position to recognise their abuse. Do those who are severely damaged die by suicide? There are no psychological autopsies on those who die by suicide. I am convinced of the need to do such autopsies to determine the psychological difficulties and where the services failed. Such information made available without identifying the victim is vital for research into why so many take their lives and is invaluable in formulating suicide prevention programmes.Clients, often in severe distress, make major investments in therapy and have a right to know that the therapy they are engaged in is safe and effective. For this reason, the development of practice standards for accreditation and training is essential. The recent report of the working group on the role of psychotherapy within the health service states the requirements of the various accrediting bodies can differ significantly. The situation is problematic as, given the lack of clarity regarding agreed criteria for training and qualifications, both the health service as an employer and the general public have difficulty in making judgments as to the equivalence of one qualification against another. This is why confusion arises and Deputy McManus's amendment, which would give 12 months and space to all those concerned, including the Government, aims to correct the situation. The professional group strengthened its regulation arrangements. The Government's position, through not accepting this amendment, is to stay on the fence until the various professional groups strengthen their regulation arrangements. I accept they have an onus to do so as a matter of urgency and appreciate that is the Minister of State's difficulty. However, they should have 12 months to do so. If there is no will to do so within that time, the Government must move towards statutory regulation. Only five professions are subject to this, medicine, dentistry, nursing, optometry and pharmacy. As the Minister of State pointed out, there can be only one registration board per professional grouping. A difficulty arises in conferring powers of statutory registration on a professional body where more than one body represents the profession, as is the position in the case of counselling and therapy.We should strongly urge the groups to come to a consensus, which is lacking, on basic definitions, training and accreditation. The professional bodies have a responsibility to ensure the public can have the same confidence in the professionalism of psychotherapists and counsellors as they do in doctors, dentists and pharmacists. This would enable them to supervise the delivery of a safe, high quality service to clients. The role of supervision is becoming increasingly valuable as it enables professionals to maintain good standards of practice and to develop responsive services to meet the needs of clients. Supervision also has a key function in fulfilling an employer's duty of care to staff under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 1989, as employers may not be covered under the Act if employees are not qualified.By accepting Deputy McManus's amendment the Minister of State would accept that there is a difficulty and challenge for the four bodies to come to an agreement within the next 12 months on the criteria for membership of their organisations. The ideal way to do so would be through amalgamating the organisations. If that cannot occur, the organisations should come to an understanding on the criteria, training and qualifications required to ensure those who provide counselling and psychotherapy services have the necessary skills and qualifications. That would also ensure those whom we and medical professionals advise to go to counsellors and those whom psychiatric professionals advise to go to psychotherapists can be confident that persons calling themselves psychotherapists and counsellors are at a level and standard to meet the criteria acceptable under the Bill.

I met organisations representing counsellors and psychotherapists. Four groups are involved and they hope to meet in the near future to see if they can come to a general consensus on entry criteria. I do not know whether they will be able to do so. The concern of Deputies for the inclusion of counsellors and psychotherapists in the system of statutory registration being established has been made clear throughout the passage of the Bill. We are all conscious that the provision of counselling and psychotherapy services has increased in recent years and agreed on the need for people to be confident that a counsellor or psychotherapist is qualified, competent and fit to practice.I have already mentioned that section 4 of the Bill provides for the inclusion by regulation of additional professions in the proposed system of statutory registration. This section also sets out the criteria to which the Minister shall have regard in considering the designation of further professions under the legislation. These criteria include the extent to which the profession has a defined scope of practice and applies a distinct body of knowledge; the extent to which the profession is established, including whether at least one professional body represents a significant proportion of the profession's practitioners; and the existence of defined routes of entry into the profession and of independently assessed entry qualifications. The various professional groups representing psychotherapists and counsellors have been encouraged to prepare for statutory registration by working to explore a common understanding on baseline qualifications and scope of practice. I also hope to see a further strengthening of their voluntary regulation arrangements.As indicated on Committee Stage, a working group was established to examine the role of psychotherapy in the health service in order to assess requirements for the future. The working group's report has been finalised and I expect the next step will be to put in place an action plan for progressing the issues. This will include a further exploration of issues relating to the development of an appropriate model of service. The outcome of this work, together with the work that must be done by the representative professional groups, will form part of the formal process required in line with the provisions for the designation of further professions as set out under section 4. For the reasons outlined, I cannot accept the amendment.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	509	It is clear there is no disagreement between the Government and ourselves on the principle. What is at issue is the timeframe which the Minister of State must consider further. Seven or eight years, or perhaps longer, have passed since the proposal was made to designate these professions. That length of time should inform us of the need to set down a certain framework. Deputy Neville expressed more comprehensively than I the concerns about the influence counsellors and therapists have. Many have a benign influence and it is beneficial and healthy. However, there is great concern about the fact that the influence of poorly trained individuals or persons with an agenda can be malign. I do not want to exaggerate in any way. One must consider that those seeking this help are often extremely vulnerable. They have emotional needs, trauma and distress in their lives and are seeking help. At the very least, the Government owes a duty of care to recognise the mushrooming in the provision of therapy services and ensure certain accreditation and standards apply. However, it should not be left open-ended.If I have a sore neck and go to somebody who is not good at his or her job, all that will happen is that I will continue to have a sore neck. Going with a damaged psyche to somebody who is not good at his or her job can have a far more problematic outcome in terms of trust and dealing with the client's problems in a way that is healthy and appropriate. I am not at all comforted by the approach of the Government which involves stating there is a problem, not putting in place a timeframe, hoping the hundreds of people of varying standards and training will come forward with the solution and leaving the matter open-ended. Of course, we must consult them and ensure they play a role. However, I ask the Minister of State to accept that he is required to set a timeframe as otherwise it may take another eight or ten years to do so. At least, there is a professional body for psychotherapy, although it took this length of time to reach that point.How much longer will it take to arrive at the point where anyone attending a therapist or a counsellor can be secure in the knowledge that the State has ensured the standard of that person's training is appropriate to a client's needs, at the very least?

I will meet all the groups. The expert group examining the whole mental health area will also have a view on this issue. I share the concerns expressed by both Deputies about the lack of standardisation of qualifications. I assure the House that as the Minister of State with responsibility for mental health I foresee a significantly enhanced role for both counsellors and psychotherapists in the area of mental health. I assure the Deputies it will not take years but it would be preferable if base line criteria could be assembled on a voluntary basis by those involved. If voluntary agreement among the various organisations is not possible, I assure the House that the Tánaiste and I will expedite this process.

I believe the Deputy is referring to the awards currently granted by the National Social Work Qualifications Board. Deputies will be aware that this board is being subsumed into the council under the legislation. It should be noted that under the Bill the registration boards generally will have the responsibility for education and training issues and will accredit courses appropriately. Accordingly, the matter is already dealt with in the legislation.The continuity of the work and contribution of the National Social Work and Qualifications Board to professional development will be maintained and the experience and knowledge of the board in addressing many of the responsibilities that will in future fall to the council will be fully transferred.

In page 12, lines 27 and 28, to delete all words from and including "all" in line 27 down to and including "section" in line 28 and substitute the following:"not less than 40 per cent of whom shall be women and not less than 40 per cent men, appointed by the Minister following a process of public advertisement for the positions, assessment of candidates based on published criteria of qualification and interviews".I calculate from the text of the legislation as presented that the council will have 24 or 25 members. It is unclear to me whether the Chair will be one of the 24 members to be appointed, 12 from the designated professions and 12 from a variety of other sources, three of whom will represent management of the public health sector, management of a voluntary or private sector organisation and representative of third level educational establishments involved in the education and training of persons in the practice of the designated professions. Nine others will be appointed by the Minister. Representatives of the interests of the general public are to be appointed with the consent of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.In 1991, Government guidelines were put in place to implement the recommendations of the Second Commission on the Status of Women. These guidelines require that Ministers and Departments ensure that 40% of those nominated to State boards and State-appointed bodies should be women.My amendment seeks to ensure this is lived up to or at least, worked towards. Women are clearly under-represented on State bodies. The Taoiseach and other members of the current Government have acknowledged this on many occasions. Nothing will ever be done about it unless the intent is enshrined in the specific legislation regarding these bodies. The health and social care professionals council provides another opportunity. My appeal to the Minister of State is to recognise that women are under-represented on State bodies. I ask him to accept this amendment and ensure at least 40% participation by women on this important council. I would wish to see more women than that number involved but as that is the position already agreed to by Government in 1991 as the guideline to be met, I hope the Minister of State will accede to its inclusion in the Bill.Women are even less well represented on private boards and bodies and in senior management. The responsibility on the State to give the lead and to demonstrate what society wishes to see is therefore all the greater. This is one area in which Government can impact and facilitate.The second part of my amendment deals with the method of appointment of the members to the health and social care professions council. The basis of this argument is to ensure greater transparency in the appointment. I have raised this matter with the Taoiseach many times and I cannot explain the reluctance to open up access to State boards and other State-appointed bodies to the wider public. Why must it be that somebody must know somebody else which leaves the Government open to accusation of jobs for the boys and fewer jobs for the girls? We want every citizen to have a right of access if they have the required expertise, experience and that they meet the criteria and have the qualifications laid down.

However, this does not appear to be the case. In order to ensure it is open to every citizen, the position should be publicly advertised so that the most suitable people can compete and be considered. There should be a clear understanding of the requirements regarding qualification. This is a very reasonable proposition. I look forward to the Minister of State's response because he is biting at the bit to get going like a greyhound at Shelbourne Park. I will listen to what he has to say in reply and if he satisfies what I am trying to achieve, I will be the first to welcome it.

My party's position on gender balance has been well known for a long time.I hope the Minister of State will accept the amendments, particularly given that other Ministers have accepted similar amendments seeking gender balance in other legislation. It is particularly important that we ensure an appropriate balance between men and women on the registration boards. I note from section 9(3)(b)(iv) that nine members of the board will be representative of the interests of the general public, while the other three members will represent other interests. Ensuring that at least 40% of members will be women and 40% men should, therefore, present no logistical difficulties.When my Limerick East constituency colleague, the Minister for Defence, Deputy O'Dea, served as Minister of State with responsibility for equality, he suggested that gender balance on boards could be made a statutory requirement if it was not achieved voluntarily by Government Ministers and Departments. Unfortunately, he did not implement this suggestion even though the statistics show that a large majority of members of boards and councils established by Ministers do not have a reasonable gender balance. I assume the Minister will have no difficulty providing for gender balance in the legislation given that it is supposed to be Government policy.

The Minister of State indicated that the provisions of the Bill, as drafted, are satisfactory in this regard. Since I entered the House, the need for gender balance has been discussed ad nauseam but progress on the issue has been minimal. The Minister of State has an opportunity to make his mark. I hope his indication that the Bill includes positive provisions which would satisfy the requirement for gender balance will be borne out when he responds.

While it is desirable that membership of both the council and the different registration boards be gender balanced, the Minister cannot accept the amendments. Deputy Ó Caoláin walked into the trap when he made the single transferable part of his speech concerning jobs for the boys because there is no question of jobs for the boys or girls under the legislation which envisages appointment by the Minister following election by members of individual professions.The amendments purport to require the Minister to direct the course of an election and individual voters' preferences. Perhaps this issue should be addressed in the House but we would first have to give a good example by requiring that two seats in every four seat constituency, one seat in every three seat constituency or two or three seats in every five seat constituency be reserved for females. If the Deputy were willing to advance that proposition, the House could lead by example, after which it could legislate accordingly for the various professions covered by this Bill.As Deputies are well aware, the Fianna Fáil Party has taken an initiative on gender balance by providing in its internal constitution at the recent Ard-Fheis that there be full balance. No doubt, having given the lead, other parties will follow Fianna Fáil.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	525	I appeal to Deputies to examine the precise terms of section 9 which provides that the council will comprise a chairperson and ordinary members appointed by the Minister. The concept of appointment by the Minister which the amendments tabled by Deputies Ó Caoláin and McManus seek to change is highly qualified by the subsequent provisions of the section. For example, subsection (3) provides that in the case of the council one person is to be appointed for each designated profession and he or she must be "an elected member of the registration board of the designated profession" and be "nominated by that board for appointment to the Council". The Minister cannot direct the registration boards to appoint a particular person or prescribe gender quotas for them, as the Deputies opposite have urged. This would be a far-reaching intervention by the Minister into the proceedings of a board which will enjoy some measure of autonomy as well as statutory guidance under this legislation.It is true, however, that a further 12 persons must be appointed by the Minister under subsection (3)(b). Again, however, great care is taken in the legislation to designate exactly the qualification of the persons in question. Deputy Ó Caoláin referred to jobs for the boys and argued that every citizen should have the right to be considered for such appointment. Under the legislation, it is the right of every qualified citizen to be considered for appointment to the council.The council contains the representatives of the boards as well as the other appointees of the Minister appointed under exact statutory standards. Section 28 includes basic provisions on the registration boards which will perform a fundamental role with regard to each profession. The section also provides that the Minister shall appoint members to the boards. Deputy McManus has been consistent and tabled an amendment seeking to amend the provisions on membership of the registration boards, whereas Deputy Ó Caoláin has not tabled such an amendment. Deputy McManus, in the spirit of amendments Nos. 5 and 6, is procedurally correct to table an amendment to section 28. Her amendment proposes to prescribe a female quota of 40% for ministerial appointees. However, as an examination of the section reveals, the Minister's discretion is quickly exhausted by the detailed provisions regarding the appointment. Six persons are appointed by the Minister on their election by the registrants of the professions. For the House to amend the section in the manner proposed by Deputy McManus would empower the Minister to direct voters, described in the legislation as registrants or members of the profession, to elect a 40% female quota, irrespective of their preferences. Deputies on the other side are advancing a far-reaching proposition, as is their right, but this Bill is not the context in which this question should be raised. If an example is to be given in a matter of this nature, it must be done through the Constitution.With regard to the board, although seven particular appointments are left to the Minister, again these are carefully designated. Four of them are to be representative of the public interest, while the other three are to be representative of particular disciplines and possess particular expertise. Again, there is no question that these provisions amount to some kind of charter for discretionary ministerial appointments and, in fact, the legislation is carefully circumscribed. It should be noted that many of the professions to be regulated under the Bill are predominately female. It could be argued, therefore, that the composition of the council and registration boards must reflect to some extent the gender composition of the professions represented. An issue may arise regarding male representation in the context of several of the registration boards.I assure the House that in the general making of appointments to bodies the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children will have close cognisance of Government policy in regard to the need for gender balance. On the issue of appointing persons to the council it should be noted that 12 members of the council will be elected representatives of the respective registration boards who have been nominated by the board for appointment. The Minister's power of appointment is, therefore, purely a formality in this context and cannot be burdened with a statutory duty to insist upon a particular gender qualification.

The fact is that the Minister has the opportunity to appoint nine representatives to represent the interests of the general public, quite apart from the other three, something that I pointed out when I originally moved the amendment. These are the words I used very carefully and clearly in proposing the amendment. This allows the Minister to try to ensure that we achieve a guaranteed quota of 40% women on this council. I would be delighted if it proved the case, as the Minister of State suggests it might, that a greater number of women were appointed; I also stated that when I introduced this amendment. Therefore, we are making the point that at least 40% should be men. It is balanced regarding what can — and, one hopes, will — be achieved.There is more to the situation than just that, and that is the reason my amendment goes further. Let us make no mistake. I did not make the accusation of jobs for the boys, or girls, regarding State boards. I said that it left the Government open to that accusation, although I have not subscribed to it. However, the guilt complex is there, and it is bound to present itself.The Minister of State cannot have it both ways. The point is that I wish to see a fair and transparent appointments process. The Taoiseach has said in this House that his greatest difficulty in getting people with the necessary skills, professional experience and so on to come forward is that they are already far too busy to give of their valuable time in serving on State boards and State-appointed bodies. The way to address that is to open the doors to every citizen and not simply the names nominated by those with access to an ear. That has been the practice, but we do society and the State boards a disservice if we cut out ordinary, decent men and women the length and breadth of this country, who, from their experience in their professions or in retirement, can bring expertise and knowledge to bear in the service of the State, which is there to serve every citizen.The second part of my amendment is as crucial and important as the first.

#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	549	I reiterate what I said before. It is Government policy that there be gender balance on State boards, and I do not know why the Minister of State cannot accept the amendment. I do not see why it cannot be done. Section 28 deals with membership of the individual boards for the various professions. Three are to be engaged in the practice of the profession, two in management services and so on, so there is no reason the Minister of State cannot say that one must choose at least one man and at least one woman in situations where there is to be more than one nomination. I accept that when only one is chosen, one cannot stipulate that one should have a man or a woman. However, where there is more than one, there is no reason that the Minister cannot do so. It has been done before by many Ministers. I do not accept that it cannot be done. There are extras to be appointed by the Minister both to the boards and to the council.What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander, and I have no problem saying that, in the very few cases where men are in the minority and one must discriminate in their favour rather than in favour of women, we should do so. We need gender balance on boards. In the vast majority of cases in Ireland, the discrimination must be in favour of women to ensure that they be properly represented. However, if in the case of certain professions it must benefit men, that is fine, since that is what it is all about. We must ensure that this goes into all legislation and that Government policy and that of all parties in this House is implemented. That will not be done by wishful thinking.That is why I raised the fact that the Minister for Defence, Deputy O'Dea, threatened to do it but never did so. He said that he would do it within six months of being appointed as Minister if it did not happen automatically. It did not happen, but he did not do that. If this is the attitude of Ministers, it will not happen. Perhaps it must be enshrined in legislation that Ministers do so regarding Government-appointed councils and boards. In this case, I see no reason that it cannot be done, and I urge the Minister of State to accept the amendment.

He started by stating that his own party had recently introduced a form of gender balance. In my party, we tried to do so many years ago, and I confess that it has not been too successful, even after putting the structures in place. We have six Deputies, all of whom are men. Sinn Féin has five, and all five are men. The Labour Party——

However, the point I was trying to make is that, despite setting up structures, many societal factors militate against female participation. Therefore, a quota system such as this is the best way forward. Deputy Devins was not present, but I recently met Danish parliamentarians. It was quite remarkable, since most were women. There was only one man. They had managed it, and Nordic countries always manage to be far ahead of us when it comes to such issues. To my mind, this amendment makes perfect sense. It is a way of giving legislative effect to the theory, but it must be more than that. It must now become a reality. If we had a list system here, we would have a very different approach. We could have 40% female representation. It is difficult to achieve that with the present system. For many reasons, into which I do not wish to go, there are certain advantages in politics if one is a man; that is the long and the short of it.I support these amendments. I understand that Deputy Ó Caoláin is vexed enough to put the matter to a vote. We shall see.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	554	I assure Deputy Ó Caoláin that I always listen to his every word with the greatest of care. I was commenting on his amendments since they do not seek — neither do those tabled by Deputy McManus — to prescribe how the Minister should make his own appointments. They purport to describe how all the appointments to the council, which is the overarching body regulating such professions, and the individual registration boards should be made. I reiterate my original point that it is Government policy to secure gender equality in the composition of such boards. However, to provide so in the context of such boards is for the Minister to dictate the consequence of a nomination from a professional body or the course of an election.Deputy Gormley put it rather well when he said that the problem may lie in the electoral system that we habitually use in Ireland, generally the spot vote or a single transferable vote. For example, if a list system was to be employed in such elections that might be a way of securing a particular outcome. However, that would require a proposal of much greater detail than that before us. What is before the House this evening is a simple direction to the Minister to ensure that 40% of the appointments should belong to a particular gender. Were we to so legislate, the Minister would then, in effect, have to tell a particular professional body that he cannot accept the freely chosen representative of its registration board, as per its electoral mandate and that it must reballot until such time as the necessary number of acceptable appointees of a particular gender is reached. I do not believe that is a tenable proposition.Equally, in the case of the overall council the nominations come from the individual registration boards representing the particular boards. The Minister would have to give a direction to those boards that he cannot accept their nominations unless they belong to a particular gender. The question would arise as to which particular boards would have to be given such a direction. When all of those issues are looked at one can see the problems which this House may well have to address, though in a different context, as to how gender equality may be ensured. To provide for it in this legislation would require legal architecture of considerably greater sophistication than that which has been put before the House this evening by Deputies Ó Caoláin and McManus, although I accept the spirit in which the amendments were tabled. If I have given Deputy Ó Caoláin the impression otherwise, I am sorry for so doing. I accept it is an issue that must be attended to, but this legislation illustrates very well that it is not as simple a matter as it often seems. Very few Bills, nowadays, provide that a Minister appoints, say, ten persons at his or her discretion, to a particular board. The trend, in statutory draftsmanship, has been towards restricting the scope of the discretion of the Minister and trying to insist that members of particular boards have appropriate qualifications. That is evident in this legislation and it makes the task of gender balance all the more difficult.Add to this the fact that here we are providing representative machinery for professions and there is very great difficulty. As regards the public interest appointment, in the case of a profession where there is a substantial female or male composition, it can be difficult to identify persons who have the type of public interest knowledge of the given professional activity, as distinct from being a member of the profession, and who meet the gender requirements. These are difficulties that Ministers have to grapple with. I am happy to reiterate what the Tánaiste said, which will certainly warrant what has been said in the House this evening being taken into consideration in the making of any appointments that are at our discretion.

I hope, irrespective of what action is now taken, he will raise this matter with the Tánaiste, as indicated, and the Government will adhere to the spirit of this amendment, at least. I acknowledge, too, the Minister of State's point on the legal architecture necessary in this regard, but it must be started somewhere. I may not have the resources in terms of the exactitude required in drafting legislation, but we have some small experience. I assure the Minister of State that it is experience that we will continue to gain. The spirit of it is strongly held by me and clearly, by other Opposition voices. The Minister of State has reflected good intent in this regard and I acknowledge this. However, I advise the Leas-Cheann Comhairle that I will press my amendment.

I welcome to the Visitors Gallery Sinn Féin MPs, including our party president Gerry Adams, and members of the Northern Assembly.Molaim an rún seo ar son Theachtaí Shinn Féin. Is annamh a bhí deis ag an Dáil aontú na hÉireann a phlé. Ní cuimhin liom díospóireacht ar an gceist seo ónar toghadh mé i 1997. Cé gur phléamar próiseas na síochána go minic, ní raibh deis againn díriú ar an ghá a bheith ag obair i dtreo aontú na hÉireann. Mar sin, cuireann séáthas orainn, mar Theachtaí Shinn Féin, an rún seo a chur os comhair na Dála agus iarraidh ar gach Teachta tacú leis.Ní rún amháin atá ann seo, áfach. Seo fógra chomh maith go bhfuilimid chun dul ar aghaidh go dtí an cuspóir sin i gcuideachta gach duine sa tír a bhfuil an cuspóir daonlathach sin aige nó aici.It is an honour to present this motion on behalf of the Sinn Féin Deputies. The motion encapsulates the central aim of our party and, more importantly, the sincerely held objective of the vast majority of the people of Ireland. The democratic objective of the reunification of Ireland is reflected, to one degree or another, in all political parties represented in the Oireachtas. All the principal political parties state that Irish unity is one of their aims but it must be more than an aspiration and an objective, however sincerely held. If we are serious and sincere we must work together towards Irish unity. This motion is an invitation to do just that.We have debated the peace process many times but we have not taken the opportunity to address the issue of Irish unity itself. Our motion presents such an opportunity. This debate comes in the wake of the momentous decision of the IRA to end its armed campaign and to put its weapons beyond use. I do not believe any of us yet appreciates the enormity of this development. It will take time for it to be seen in its proper historical context. It marked a crossroads not only in the peace process but in the development of politics on this island. It confirmed what the peace process had established — that Irish republicans are totally committed to the peaceful and democratic way forward to our objective of Irish unity and national sovereignty.The immediate task before us is the reinstatement of the structures established under the Good Friday Agreement. That is the responsibility first and foremost of the British and Irish Governments. On the part of the DUP there can be no more possible excuses for non-engagement with Sinn Féin. The excuse of IRA weapons is no longer tenable; indeed, the hollowness of that excuse as used so often in the past has been exposed since the IRA's announcement and its putting of weapons beyond use.Those who seek to minimise the significance of developments this past summer and the potential for progress which they offer, are doing a grave disservice to their constituents. However, I believe the DUP will enter negotiations with Sinn Féin. One thing is certain — whittling down the Agreement, failing to implement it or abandoning the legitimate political objective of Irish unity will not encourage dialogue. On the contrary, it will reinforce intransigence.Sinn Féin has tabled this motion and we urge the Irish Government to publish a Green Paper on Irish unity because we believe that the practical planning for a United Ireland should begin now. It is a moderate motion and I am disappointed at the Government amendment which does not reflect in full the essence of the proposition before us. I urge the Government, even at this late stage, to abandon its amendment and to support the Sinn Féin motion.Throughout the peace process we have consistently urged an island wide approach in key policy areas, including the economy, health, education, employment, agriculture and tourism. We have given practical expression to this through the work of our Ministers in the Executive and the all-Ireland Ministerial Council. In the Assembly and in the Dáil, Sinn Féin representatives have continuously pressed the need to sustain and develop the all-island approach enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement. By planning for Irish unity and by demonstrating that unification can lead to a better society for all the people of this island, Nationalists will go far towards persuading many Unionists that they can have a secure future in a new, united Ireland.We should be strengthening and building upon the all-Ireland aspects of the Agreement. The Irish Government should be initiating and sustaining a planned programme of all-Ireland social and economic development which aims to remove the obstacles created by partition, strengthen the links between the people in all parts of the island and integrate the economy and society. Such work should proceed at all levels and the Irish Government should not be dependent upon the active co-operation of any British Administration, although such co-operation is not only desirable but an obligation of the British Government under the Agreement.Central to the Good Friday Agreement is an equality agenda which seeks to address many injustices. It cannot be stressed enough that equality applies to everyone. It will benefit all sections of the community. The attempt to portray the equality agenda as meaning privilege for Nationalists is the latest manifestation of the sectarian scare tactic designed to prevent Unionists making common cause at any level with Nationalists. Unionists need to embrace the equality agenda. There is no other way forward for their community. Refusal to do so can slow down but cannot halt the process of change. Participation now in the process of change is the best guarantee that their interests will be represented most effectively.Many in the unionist community already privately admit that Irish unity is inevitable. Recognition that this process of change is leading to Irish unity will be a very painful but ultimately liberating development for Unionists. Nationalists throughout Ireland also need to come to terms with the reality that the achievement of their aim of Irish reunification will mean profound change. The political landscape will be transformed. New political alignments will evolve. New island wide economics will develop. There will be new demands on the economy to meet the needs of a reunited island and people. There will be many challenges but also many opportunities.Every Deputy and Senator has received a copy of Sinn Féin's discussion document, A Green Paper on Irish Unity. In summary it sets out the following programme. There is a national responsibility on the Irish Government to formulate and implement a strategy to achieve the democratic objectives of national self-determination, Irish reunification, political independence and national reconciliation. Consultation, engagement, persuasion and negotiation, with a view to securing active support for a united Ireland, must be the means towards these ends. It must involve a negotiation with the British Government and must be underpinned by a meaningful and substantial peace dividend from both Governments.Such a strategy needs to have an international dimension which includes seeking specific forms of support from popular and political opinion in Britain, the Irish diaspora and the international community. The Taoiseach should commission a Green Paper on Irish unity to be completed within one year. The aim should be to identify steps and measures which can promote and assist a successful transition to a united Ireland and to develop detailed planning for a new state and a new society that all Irish people can share. All stakeholders in society on this island must be given an opportunity to take ownership of the debate and be part of the process this initiates.The Green Paper should be referred to a specially dedicated joint all-party committee of the Oireachtas on Irish unity to monitor, assess and report progress on implementation. A Minister of State should be appointed by the Government with the dedicated and specific responsibility of driving forward and developing policy options and strategies to advance the outcomes of the Green Paper and to direct and co-ordinate the Government's all-Ireland policies. Participation by people resident in the Six Counties in the democratic life of the nation should be facilitated and include Northern representation in the Houses of the Oireachtas. Citizens in the Six Counties should have voting rights in presidential elections and for a reformed Seanad elected on a national list system.Finally, the Irish Government, in consultation with the social partners, the community and NGO sector, the business and agricultural sectors and the trade unions, must begin the process of co-ordinating economic planning on an all-Ireland basis.I look forward to a serious debate on these proposals. I call on the Taoiseach to proceed with his invitation to the 18 MPs in the Six Counties to participate in a committee of the Dáil, beginning in early 2006 and to be held at least twice a year. The knee jerk and partitionist reactions to this reasonable and modest proposal from the leaders of Fine Gael and Labour surely raise profound questions for the members of these two parties, one of which subtitles itself "the United Ireland Party" and the other which claims the mantle of James Connolly. I ask Fianna Fáil Deputies and Senators, and indeed their party's members, if they will allow this proposal that we have put forward to be vetoed by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, who has called for Irish republican MPs, elected on the basis of non-participation in Westminster, to take their seats there and to swear an oath of allegiance to the English Queen. These nay-sayers have misrepresented the Irish people. We are mandated by them to work together for the benefit of this country, and that includes working together towards Irish national reunification.The type of society we will have in a united Ireland is already being shaped. We must ensure that it is not a cold house for any section of our community. What Dr. Martin Luther King said about the world in 1967 applies equally to Ireland and the world in this new century:We have inherited a large house, a great ‘world house' in which we have to live together — black and white, Easterner and Westerner, Gentile and Jew, Catholic and Protestant, Moslem and Hindu — a family unduly separated in ideas, culture and interest, who because we can never again live apart, must learn somehow to live with each other in peace.I put the motion to the House and recommend it to all Deputies.

Ba chéim chun tosaigh bunú Choimisiún Chearta Daonna na hÉireann, ach má tá sé chun an teist atá luaite agam a chomhlíonadh agus a ghlanadh is gá déileál leis an easpa maoine a choscann é ó bheith ag obair agus ag gníomhú gan stró. Is gá chomh maith a rá leis an Aire Dlí agus Cirt, Comhionannais agus Athchóirithe Dlí gur gá dó éisteacht agus aird a thabhairt ar mholtaí a thagann ón choimisiún sin. Arís agus arís eile, tá tar éis teip ar an Rialtas ó thaobh an Chomhaontaithe de sa chás seo. Feictear é sin ar an tslí a bhfuil sé ag caitheamh leis an lucht siúil, na dídeanaithe agus imircigh, agus an dá leibhéal de shaoránacht a bhunaigh sé anuraidh. Féach ar an phraiseach a dhein sé maidir leis an Acht míchumais níos luaithe i mbliana. Nuair a chaith daoine vóta ar son an Chomhaontaithe i 1998, bhí siad ag tnúth go mbeidh tairbhe le baint acu as an chosaint ar chearta a bhuaigh poblachtánaigh san idirbheartaíocht roimhe sin. Ach níl le feiscint acu ó shin ach go bhfuil an chosaint sin á laghdú de réir chlár polaitiúl na heite deise.Ar cheist na slándála bhí an méid seo le rá ins an Chomhaontú: "gur féidir agus gur chóir gurb ionann forbairt timpeallachta síochána ar bhonn an Chomhaontaithe seo agus gnáthshocruithe agus gnáthchleachtais slándála a thabhairt isteach". Bhí sé i gceist, dar ndóigh, go scarfaí leis na hAchtanna um Chiontaí in aghaidh an Stáit 1939-85 mar a ligeann na coinníollacha síos. De thairbhe na forála seo, thuaraiscigh Binse Morris, mar shampla, moltaí Hederman, agus go háirithe conclúidí an Choiste um Chearta Daonna sna Náisiúin Aontaithe, a dúirt go lom díreach "Nach gcreideann siad go bhfuil aon bhonn cirt leis — An Chúirt Speisialta — bheith ann san lá inniú". Tá tionchar creimneach ag reachtaíocht éigeandála ar nós na hAchtanna um Chiontaí in aghaidh an Stáit agus na Cúirte Speisialta agus níl aon áit in aon stát lena leithéid de reachtaíocht.Tá fís ag Sinn Féin i leith Éireann ann aontaithe lonnaithe i bhForógra 1916 agus i gClár Daonlathach na Chéad Dála.

Sin an aidhm agus féachaint amach anseo chun tosaigh.
#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	563	As this motion states, there is a clear and pressing need for the case for Irish unity to be actively promoted. Not to do so will condemn the north-eastern counties of this country to another prolonged period of crisis. There are those like Deputy Rabbitte who argue the opposite. In his speech here on 28 September, Deputy Rabbitte spoke about the Six Counties as though it was some exotic country on the other side of the world, and its inhabitants a strange band of beings whose actions and motivations are a constant puzzle to all of us in this part of our country.I wonder to what extent the leader of the Labour Party speaks for all his members when he adopts that attitude. The vast majority of Labour members and supporters who I know see themselves in the tradition of James Connolly and strongly support the demand for a united Ireland. Perhaps Deputy Rabbitte is speaking more from the perspective of the anti-republican ideology that dominated Democratic Left.Deputy Rabbitte and others contend that the solution to their problem is to engineer a permanent settlement in which the Six Counties remain forever under British sovereignty. Republicans who argue to the contrary are accused of going beyond the Good Friday Agreement and of deepening divisions.Republicans have never made any secret of the fact that we do not regard a devolved administration as the final settlement. What we have done, with others who do not include Deputy Rabbitte, is bring about a situation in which advocates of Irish unity and defenders of the union can argue their respective positions in something approaching a normal political environment.However, we do not believe that political normality can ever be achieved while the British claim and exercise jurisdiction over that part of our country. Far from that jurisdiction being "bedded down", as hoped for by Deputy Rabbitte and others, the period since 1998 has proven that it is the ultimate and ongoing cause of tension and instability. Therefore, the logical solution to that is to bring about a situation in which all the people of Ireland can create a state in which all our cultural identities and interests are accommodated. It is our belief that this can be best achieved in an all-Ireland republic.Deputy Rabbitte also accused republicans of failing to recognise or to address what he terms inter-communal divisions. That is patronising nonsense. How could republicans in the Six Counties fail to recognise differences that govern every aspect of their life there?As for failing to do anything to address those divisions, I assure Deputy Rabbitte that my party has far closer and more genuine links with members of the Unionist community than he or anyone else in this State. Those links are extensive and ongoing and sometimes, in the light of sensitivities, of necessity, low-key. They are something we take very seriously and not to be used as occasional publicity stunts.Over the course of our dialogue with unionism we have come to recognise deeply held beliefs and fears, and have sought in various ways to address them. We have no wish to oppress or dominate those with different belief systems and cultures but we are nonetheless convinced that the best way in which to protect all differences is through the creation of a genuinely republican society, as envisaged by the founders of Irish republicanism and the framers of the 1916 Proclamation and Democratic Programme. It was not Irish republicans who allowed this State to be turned into a narrow clerical dominated society in which the sort of horrors we read about in the Ferns Report were allowed take place — a society of mass poverty and emigration. Those responsible for that were successive Fianna Fáil Governments and coalitions that included Fine Gael and the Labour Party. Republicans did not create that society and we have no wish to recreate it and foist it on our fellow Irish men and women in the Six Counties.I must also refer to the positive role played by the Irish Republican Army in attempting to bring about a settlement. The IRA helped to initiate the peace process and the ceasefires declared by the organisation were crucial steps on the way to the Good Friday Agreement. Unfortunately, the goodwill displayed by the IRA and the risks taken by that organisation have not always been reciprocated. Nonetheless, the IRA has continued to take bold initiatives. In September it took an unprecedented step in regard to its structures and arms. This was done despite considerable unease among republicans conscious of the dangers inherent in a situation where Unionism retains the physical means to attack Nationalists. While I know that there has been a generally positive reaction from members of the Unionist community, there is little leadership among its political representatives, who are either unwilling or afraid to reciprocate in a way that would lead to the re-establishment of the political institutions. Of course, it is also the responsibility of the two Governments, particularly the British Government, to ensure that this takes place as soon as possible. Once that is done there can be some semblance of normal democratic politics. Unionists will be free to argue their position and Sinn Féin will certainly not be found wanting in promoting the need for an all-island settlement.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	564	I move amendment No. 3:To delete all words from and including "promote all-Ireland" in the fifth paragraph and substitute the following:"—promote the full development of strands one, two and three of the Agreement so that decisions in relation to North-South as well as East-West and Northern concerns are taken on a sustainable basis at the lowest effective level and in a way that respects diverse political aspirations and devolved decision making as provided for in the Good Friday Agreement."Is oth liom a rá nach féidir liom aontú go hiomlán le rún Shinn Féin, cé go dtugaimid tacaíocht do cheithre as seacht gcuid den rún atá os ár gcomhair anocht. Tá an Comhaontas Glas ar bun ó 1981 ag obair ar sheacht bprionsabal. Those principles include a sustainable quality of life, maximising self-reliance for communities and encouraging grassroots democracy which prioritises consensus based decision-making principles. Like all parties in the House, we have campaigned for the Good Friday Agreement and continue to work for its full implementation. However, we are unique among Dáil parties in that we do not trace our origins back to violent revolution, which I acknowledge resulted in the formation of the State, represented by Deputies in Dáil Éireann while the Northern province was represented by Northern MPs, some of whom we welcome to the audience for this debate.For many Greens, the nation state has a useful role in forging identity and in addressing many needs but it is not by any means sufficient to deal with the major global and international problems we discuss on occasion in the House, although not often enough, such as climate change, drug trafficking, the exploitation of workers and so on. For this reason, our amendment recognises the importance of the Good Friday Agreement in its totality, including the importance of strand one. Much work remains to be done and we must focus on this, for example, with regard to policing. Sinn Féin has an important role in moving forward that agenda, which I hope it will help by joining the policing authorities as soon as possible.Strand two is vital and needs to be further developed. The Ceann Comhairle will know that on the Order of Business we regularly ask, particularly in the context of the Ferns report, when we will have a register of people considered unsafe to work with children. We are repeatedly told that the hold-up is due to the lack of progress in the peace process and the lack of an Assembly in the North. For many, this is ironic because rather than doing away with all forms of terror, we seem to be replacing one form of terror, paramilitarism, with another form involving children being exposed to danger.The Sinn Féin amendment should focus more on strand three, which concerns the east-west dimension of the Good Friday Agreement. We know of the threat of bird flu, the ongoing threat of rabies, fisheries issues and, given the Rossport five controversy, the importance of gas supplies for this country. Gas will not be supplied from the Corrib gas field in anything like the quantity needed so we must ensure good working relations and co-operation between Ireland, Britain and mainland Europe as far as Siberia if we are to take for granted the supply of energy at current levels. The east-west dimension is not simply a political aspiration; it is vital for our day-to-day needs.The Sinn Féin motion, while valid in terms of the aspirations of that party and many other people of a Nationalist background is, unfortunately, another example of putting the cart before the horse. As one who sees a rationale behind an all-island organisation which takes into account the co-operation of people of diverse political opinions, I believe it is more likely to frighten Unionists than to persuade them down the road to joining a united Ireland. For example, if we all support the Good Friday Agreement, we should acknowledge that Northern Ireland exists. I repeatedly ask why we must listen to constant references to the Six Counties. I accept that the term is a numerically correct statement of fact but Northern Ireland exists. The Good Friday Agreement acknowledged this fact and we all supported the Agreement on the basis that we accepted it. It is time we were mature enough to recognise it. That said, this is not to agree that Northern Ireland must always exist or that we wish to deny anyone's valid political aspirations.I agree with the motion that we need to maximise North-South developments, whether in regard to REPS, an island-wide environmental protection agency, transport issues that relate to both sides of the Border, or energy issues. I do not blame Sinn Féin for rushing the fence at this point given that Fianna Fáil has demonstrated it is quite happy to make political footballs out of serious issues such as the commemoration of 1916.

As Dublin Castle no longer hosts the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, it is in effect a cold house for Opposition parties. This must be resolved if the Government is serious about inclusiveness and bringing Unionists on board in future governance. How can the Dáil agree to this motion when all parties have different views on what a united Ireland means? We must set down the different options and hold a referendum to avoid the pitfall of majority rule which gave us so much grief in the North.The issue of Northern Irish MPs having speaking rights in this House must be discussed. There are several options to ensure there is an outreach north of the Border and that the door is not closed to those voices in the North which can be examined through the precedent when the late Gordon Wilson was appointed to the Seanad. We need to reform the Dáil. How can we persuade Unionists if smaller political parties are denied party recognition in the Dáil? This would not be acceptable in the Northern Ireland Assembly. Parity of esteem is needed on both sides of the Border.

It is clear and straight, meriting Members' support. This motion is above party politics. We all need to unite around these positive principles of democracy, equality and Irish independence. Sadly, there are many in the House who do not have the courage of their convictions and constantly throw out their two-nation rants in regular debates.I am pushing for the implementation of this motion, along with the principles of Tone and Connolly. I commend and thank all those who worked hard in the peace process and who, over the years, held their nerve against doubt, cynicism and suspicion. I pay tribute to those Members involved in the process. I challenge those Members who are trying to wreck this beautiful project. I will use this occasion to defend the integrity and vision of Fr. Alec Reid, particularly in light of recent criticisms and attacks against him. I stand by Fr. Reid, one of the main architects of the peace process.I challenge the hypocrisy of those who claim to follow in the tradition of Collins, Connolly and Pearse and yet have a problem with having Northern Irish representatives speaking in this House. Statements on this matter over recent days were a disgrace. I want to see Nationalist and Unionist representatives speaking frequently in the Houses of the Oireachtas. The House should not be a cold house for any community or religion. The door must always be open for Catholic, Protestant, Muslim, Jew or dissenter, and particularly for those with a democratic mandate.I support the recent calls for all elected representatives in the North to participate in the House. It is particularly relevant with the talk of commemorating the ideals of the 1916 Rising which preach independence, sovereignty, equality, justice and respect for diversity. I find it astonishing that some parties have tried to hinder the principles and ideals of 1916 by preventing representatives from the North speaking in the House. It is a shameful disgrace, showing a lack of political vision and making a mockery of political and social inclusion. The majority of the people on the island of Ireland want this to happen. I urge all Members to support the motion.The motion resolves to work for the full implementation of the Agreement in all its aspects and for the re-establishment of the institutions of the Agreement at the earliest date. It seeks to promote all-Ireland policies and strategies, benefiting all parts of the island. It actively seeks to persuade Unionists, through dialogue, of the advantages of Irish unity for all the people, in their diversity, who share this island. It resolves to prepare politically, economically, socially and culturally for Irish unification, identifying steps and measures, including a Green Paper, which can assist a successful transition to a united Ireland.These are sensible proposals that deserve all Members' support. I recognise the political progress brought about by the peace process and how it has benefited the people of the island of Ireland. I had my doubts about losing Articles 2 and 3 and other matters. In the end I went with those who took the risk for peace, justice and equality. It is up to all of us to move the process forward. Not talking to political opponents must never be an option in any conflict resolution scenario. Politicians must be brave with vision. We must try all options in leading our people. We now have a wealthy island but a divided people. We need to unite the people and the island of Ireland. This strategy is clearly set out in this motion. This motion is about Irish independence, justice, equality and peace but also a progressive future for all our people on the island of Ireland. I urge all Members to support the motion.

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	575	Both the Sinn Féin motion and the Government amendment are predicated on the belief that the Good Friday Agreement is a template for a resolution to the political crisis in Northern Ireland. That is a fundamental fallacy. The Good Friday Agreement has provided for the institutionalisation of sectarian division, not for its overcoming. Since the IRA ceasefire halted its disastrous paramilitary campaign, the polarisation of the communities in Northern Ireland has widened horrifically. It has been a process not of coming together, but unfortunately of the separation of communities. Sectarian-based political parties are part of this polarisation. They contribute to it and, in many cases, lead it.The Provisional IRA correctly realised at the end of the 1980s that its paramilitary campaign was not winnable. In a modern industrialised society, the methods of paramilitarism or individual terrorism cannot defeat state imperialism. The end of the Provisional IRA's campaign was also predicated on the belated acceptance by republicans that the British establishment had no vested interest in holding on to Northern Ireland as a colony. It would be quite happy to see unification of this island on the basis of the present establishments, North and South, and why not? The Twenty-six Counties is a mecca for profits for British, US and other companies without the costs of an army, administration, etc.Opposition to a united Ireland within the context of the present set-up comes from within the Protestant population. What is sought by Sinn Féin is unification on the basis of the present system, in reality the coming together of the capitalist states, North and South. The Protestant working class in particular will simply not agree to this. If pushed in that direction, it will resist. Any delusion that a demographic change in the North will solve the problem is wrong-headed. Just as the Catholic population, a minority, never reconciled itself to the Unionist state, neither will the Protestant population ever accept a united Ireland on the basis of the present system. Sinn Féin's attempt to rally Fianna Fáil, a right-wing party of neoliberal capitalism, behind its Green Paper for a capitalist united Ireland will copperfasten the rejection of the Protestant population. If pushed, it will not lead to a united Ireland but to a Balkanisation of Northern Ireland. A dangerous vacuum exists in the Protestant population which Love Ulster and other sectarian groups are seeking to fill.Sinn Féin aspires to coalition with Fianna Fáil. It has a similar formulation to the Labour Party of the past in that it will decide after the general election. Coalition with Fianna Fáil would mean acquiescence in the new liberal agenda dominating European capitalism at present, just as Sinn Féin Ministers in the North implemented private finance initiatives and other right wing policies of the Blair Government. That which was true in the days when James Connolly and Jim Larkin organised working class people in Belfast is true today. Only the unity of working people can overcome sectarian divisions, and that can only be achieved by working class people struggling together on the issues that confront them both at the time, such as the horrific poverty that still exists in both communities.By opposing the economic attacks of the Blair Government such as the attempted imposition of water charges and the attack on public services they will find in the struggle the way to a democratic and socialist resolution to the national question and a future where there is no risk of one community being discriminated against by the other. The only unity achievable on this island is a socialist Ireland jointly achieved by working people, Protestant and Catholic, North and South, on the basis of a socialist economic and political transformation of society.

Dá mbeadh cead agam, b'fhéidir go n-éireoinn as an mhéid atá le rá agam agus atá scríofa síos, mar tá sé an-deacair a bheith ag éisteacht lena bhfuil le rá ag go leor daoine anseo, ní amháin ó mhuintir Shinn Féin ach ón Teachta os mo chomhair chomh maith. I am delighted to see he is the last bastion of the socialist point of view in the House.I welcome the opportunity to address the House this evening and to reiterate the Government's strong commitment to the Good Friday Agreement as the template for a peaceful democratic society in Northern Ireland and for political agreement on the island as a whole.In 1998 the people of Ireland, North and South, voted by an overwhelming majority to support the Good Friday Agreement. In the first Thirty-two County act of self-determination since 1918, the Irish people gave the two Governments a strong, clear and unambiguous mandate for our ongoing work with the political parties to restore partnership Government to Northern Ireland. The Government's resolve to fulfil the people's mandate, to implement the Good Friday Agreement in full and to restore the institutions established under the Agreement has never wavered and will not waver now.Devolved Government on an inclusive basis is clearly in the best interests of all communities in Northern Ireland. All political parties and politicians want to serve their communities and deliver for their communities. All Members of this House know this as fact. That is why we are here. Our democratic tradition, embodied and practised in this Chamber, is a strong one. We are elected to exercise responsibility on behalf of the communities we serve and we are directly accountable for the decisions we take. There is no substitute for democratic Government, linking communities with the decision-making process and those who represent their interests. We should not lose sight of the fact that our main objective is the consolidation of truly democratic institutions in Northern Ireland. That means the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. It means the restoration of partnership government with locally elected Ministers working in partnership for the benefit of all. This is the fundamental purpose of our ongoing efforts.The Government's motion this evening underlines the simple fact that to rebuild the institutions of Government we must first rebuild confidence and momentum in the political process. When political parties North and South commended the Good Friday Agreement to the people of Ireland and when the Irish people overwhelmingly endorsed that Agreement they did so in the firm belief that it represented the definitive path to peace. We will not betray the people's trust or undermine their confidence by settling for anything less than full implementation of the Agreement.The constitutional balance struck in the Agreement is a careful and sensitive one. It underlines the legitimacy of seeking a united Ireland. It also recognises, however, that it is the current wish of a majority of people in Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom. Most importantly, it clearly and unequivocally enshrines the principle of consent. Article 1 clearly states:It is for the people of Ireland alone, by agreement between the two parts respectively and without external impediment, to exercise their right of self-determination on the basis of consent, freely and concurrently given, North and South, to bring about a united Ireland, accepting that this right must be achieved and exercised with and subject to the agreement and consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland.The Agreement also puts in place a mechanism through which, when the time is right, support for a united Ireland can be measured and through which effect can be given to any resulting vote in favour of change. Many in this House, including the members of this party in Government, are firmly committed to creating a climate in which unity can be achieved, a unity of people as much as of territory. Indeed our programme for Government clearly commits us to securing "lasting peace in Ireland through the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement". It further states that the efforts to this end will be "without prejudice to the ultimate goal of achieving a united Ireland in peace and agreement".That aim will not be realised through the rather simplistic formula of persuasion and preparation proposed in the motion tabled by Sinn Féin this evening. Neither will it be realised through bringing forward a Green Paper on Irish unity. These proposals simply ignore the urgent and primary need to restore trust and confidence in the political process itself and to re-establish the institutions of devolved Government in Northern Ireland. The Good Friday Agreement is the Government's clear mandate in this regard. We have no other. Any other approach to the question of unity would serve as a distraction from our immediate priority of restoring the institutions and would act as a damaging and destabilising influence on a process that can only thrive where there is trust and confidence.I am glad to say that through the tenacity and perseverance of both Governments, in challenging circumstances, there have been significant developments in the past few months which represent a promising start towards the rehabilitation of that trust. The date on which the IRA leadership issued a statement formally announcing an end to its armed campaign, 28 July, was described by the Taoiseach as heralding a new era for all the people of the island of Ireland. He said he hoped it would mark the day when the tradition of using violence to advance political objectives in Ireland would finally come to an end. The unprecedented commitment by the IRA to end its armed campaign, to complete the process of decommissioning and to use exclusively peaceful means was welcomed here in Ireland and across the world. At that time, the Government said we would judge that statement based on actions. We said that independent verification would be vitally important to enable trust and confidence to be restored.The confirmation on Monday, 26 September by the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning that the IRA had put all its weapons beyond use was acknowledged and welcomed in this House as a momentous development. We received a comprehensive and unambiguous statement from General de Chastelain and his team that "the totality of the IRA's arsenal" had been decommissioned. We also had a statement from two independent clergymen, who witnessed every stage of the process and confirmed that they were "certain, utterly certain, about the exactitude of this report". Many will still need some time to reflect on these developments. They will need assurance that the IRA is true to its commitment of 28 July to use exclusively peaceful means. They will want to check against delivery on decommissioning and on the ending of all IRA paramilitary and criminal activity. We should be clear that there must be an end to all IRA paramilitary and criminal activity.The seventh report of the Independent Monitoring Commission was published on 19 October. While the IMC could only make a limited assessment at that stage of the effect of the IRA statement of 28 July, the Government welcomed its findings that the initial signs are encouraging. We now look forward to the IMC reporting more fully in its next report in January 2006. We hope that the report will allow us to move forward. However, it is clearly incumbent on all parties in Northern Ireland, including those represented in this House, to co-operate and engage constructively with the IMC.Both Governments have consistently stated that there is no place for any illegally held weapons in the new society that is emerging in Northern Ireland. We need an end also to loyalist paramilitary activity and a start to the decommissioning of loyalist arms. In that context, let me echo the words of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, when he welcomed the announcement at the weekend that the LVF is to stand down. This move is an important and necessary step towards decommissioning by all loyalist paramilitary groups and we are hopeful that it can lead to further positive developments. We urge and encourage other loyalist paramilitary groups or organisations to build on this opportunity to bring a speedy end to all paramilitary activities.In order for us to turn the potential of recent developments into real progress for the people of Northern Ireland we will need courageous political leadership from both communities. The Government motion explicitly condemns sectarian attacks on both communities. Political leaders cannot and should not show any toleration of the street violence, sectarian attacks and intimidation we have seen directed towards both communities in parts of Northern Ireland this summer.Over the course of the past few weeks, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, has made frequent visits to Northern Ireland and met with community representatives and victims of sectarian violence. He assured them of the Government's commitment to challenging sectarianism at every opportunity. Sectarianism eats away at the fabric of society. It strangles the economy and inhibits investment, saps business confidence and costs jobs. It traps people in a cycle of poverty and hopelessness. If we are to see the new beginning for the people of Northern Ireland envisioned in the Good Friday Agreement, we need to tackle sectarianism, from any quarter, once and for all.The full rigour of the law must be used by the authorities on both sides of the Border to counter the destructive agenda of those who engage in sectarianism and paramilitarism. At this juncture I commend the PSNI for its work in dealing with public order incidents during the marching season. I also call on Sinn Féin, in the interests of peace and political stability, to take their place in the governance of policing. No police force is perfect.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	582	However, the PSNI has clearly staked a claim to the trust of all communities. If it is held back, that is due in no small measure to want of support in the communities it seeks to serve. It has earned that support. A vacuum in policing is in nobody's interest. It is certainly not in the interest of the communities most affected by the violence we have seen in recent months.The Government is committed to a fully inclusive peace process that leaves no one behind. We support efforts to reach out to all communities in Northern Ireland and we fully accept that there is an onus on the Governments to instill confidence so that both communities find their political voice. The Taoiseach has made it clear that those in the loyalist community who seek genuine efforts at transformation will receive a genuine, open and positive response. The Government is ready and willing to work with those leaders within loyalism who are seeking to address the real needs of their communities through peaceful means.We are under no illusions that notwithstanding the major improvements in economic and social conditions in Northern Ireland over the past 15 years, there are also serious issues of deprivation and inequality across both communities. As we work towards the restoration of the institutions, we are committed to engaging with the British Government to ensure that disadvantage and inequality is tackled wherever it exists and that resources are targeted at those in greatest objective need. Ultimately, it is the restoration of devolved government that is the best way to address these issues for all sides of the community. There is simply no substitute for a locally elected executive, accountable to a locally elected assembly and working for the social and economic development of Northern Ireland.Social and economic development North and South is inextricably linked. It is sound policy for us to address common challenges and opportunities on the island on a shared basis. This is particularly apparent to me, coming as I do from a Border constituency. Our motion is explicit in commending the excellent ongoing work of our North-South bodies in this regard. A recent Government announcement is an example of the type of North-South strategic thinking in which we believe. The Government launched a massive ten year transport investment plan yesterday to transform our transport infrastructure.

Business throughout the island will benefit from improved journey times and enhanced access to key transport hubs such as ports and airports.Apart from the transport agenda there are huge challenges and opportunities to boost the island economy and quality of life through infrastructure improvements in areas such as energy, telecommunications, waste management and spatial planning. This is why the Government believes in pooling thinking, planning and resources to boost the island economy.We are conscious of the challenges that still remain to be resolved. We are also conscious of the real opportunity to fulfil the promise of the Good Friday Agreement. The Government is determined to seize that opportunity. We have been lucky in our friends. From the earliest days of the peace process, our efforts have been enriched by the talent, support, patience and encouragement of many in the international community, individuals and governments alike. The Government's amendment recognises in particular the continued and valued support of the President of the United States. President Bush and his envoy are unfailing in their personal commitment to the peace process.

Fáiltím roimh ár gcuairteoirí— na hionadaithe atá anseo —ó Thuaisceart an oileáin seo. Tá mé ag cuidiú ar son an Rialtais leis an leasú oifigiúil ar an rún atá os ár gcomhair. The Government amendment to this Private Members' motion is a comprehensive one that seeks to address some glaring deficiencies in the motion as tabled by Sinn Féin.The Good Friday Agreement offers a new beginning for all the people of Northern Ireland. It is also a challenge to leaders in both communities to take up the responsibility of building a new and shared future together. In our time, unprecedented strides have been taken in breaking what seemed to be an endless cycle of violence. However, for this cycle to be left behind forever, it will take unflagging commitment by both political and community leaders on both sides to prevent violence and foster positive relationships.One deficiency in the motion is the absence of any reference to the sectarian attacks which in recent months have posed a very real threat to the peace process. This summer, we have seen a worrying pattern of sectarian attacks, particularly in north Antrim and in Belfast. Petrol bombs, vandalism, arson, harassment and intimidation have spread fear and reinforced segregation. These attacks have not been restricted to one side of the community. The Government has condemned these attacks and my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, has visited the communities affected and has had discussions with representatives of these communities to hear their concerns directly.Another deficiency relates to the need to avoid moves which can increase tension between the two main traditions on this island. We have also seen a demonstration of the ongoing potential for violence and disorder following the rerouting of the Whiterock parade last September. While the Government welcomes the fact that the majority of parades pass off peacefully, where they are contentious, they must be resolved through dialogue and positive engagement with the Parades Commission. The main Orange Order march in Derry on 12 July this year demonstrated what can be achieved. For the first time in 13 years, cross-community agreement was sought and reached for a route that included the city side of the Foyle. This shows that it is possible, through leadership and genuine commitment to constructive negotiation, to end destructive patterns of confrontation and begin new traditions of mutual respect.By way of contrast, a single day of violence can undermine months of patient work to build trust between communities. Such violence must be condemned, not just by one voice but by all. If the people of Northern Ireland are to be free of fear and the threat of violence, all those who claim to lead must do all in their power to prevent sectarian violence continually and without exception. The right of everyone to be free from sectarian harassment, as affirmed in the Good Friday Agreement, is unconditional.However, we must do more than condemn those who act against this right. We must all support those who work to make its promise a reality. We must work to reduce the feelings of insecurity that go with times of change.Another deficiency relates to the lack of any clear definition or recognition of the need to reach out in a practical and concrete way to all communities so that none is left behind by the current tide of opportunity. As the Taoiseach made clear in his speech in Bodenstown last month, the Unionist community can be sure that this part of the island holds no constitutional threat to the position of Northern Ireland within the United Kingdom. The Irish people have rejected violence and sectarianism and those who used violence to bring about a united Ireland by force have stopped their war and decommissioned the means by which they waged it.Progress from this point must be balanced or it will sow the seeds of future instability. The Good Friday Agreement is the basis for a peaceful, more prosperous and open society. As such it must be a springboard for all the people of Northern Ireland and not be treated as a framework for separate and competitive development between communities there.Therefore, I fully support the Taoiseach in his pledge to meet genuine, constructive loyalist leadership with an open and positive response. I also welcome the commitment by both Governments at the last British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference to enhanced engagement with the representatives of the loyalist community.Another deficiency in the Sinn Féin motion concerns the lack of any call for an end to all paramilitary and criminal activities. This is surely central to future progress and cannot be avoided or evaded.

#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	623	The Government will not seek to sideline any people who raise their voice constructively and peacefully on behalf of their community. No one needs a gun in his or her hand to have his or her concerns and those of his or her community listened to. Any leaders who stay on the path of confrontation and violence should note it is the surest way to hold back the development of the community they claim to represent. I therefore reiterate the call for all remaining paramilitary groups to engage with the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning with a view to decommissioning their weapons along with standing down as paramilitary organisations. In that regard, I welcome this week's announcement by the LVF.Those committed to violence on either side and in either jurisdiction must be met with the full force of the law. The eradication of paramilitarism is a priority concern of the Government. It is an easy and contemptible thing to exert power over one's neighbours through anxiety and fear or to intimidate people from their homes.All the decent people of Northern Ireland have been held hostage long enough by the cowardly and criminal thuggery of the few on both sides. The Good Friday Agreement gives the framework that allows leaders on both sides to be courageous. We have already seen acts of considerable political bravery in the cause of peace. However, until we see the normalisation of society in Northern Ireland, we need political courage to be normal. We need condemnations of violence to be consistent and not selective. We must be proactive in challenging all the forms that sectarianism takes and must be consistently supportive of progressive political voices from all sectors of society in Northern Ireland.As the Taoiseach has noted, this does not require anyone to give up his or her culture, identity or political ideals. It simply requires the peaceful expression of one's own culture, identity and political ideas as well as tolerance in both word and deed for those of others. The Government believes that if this challenge is taken up, the Good Friday Agreement can be the basis of a true fresh start for all the people of Northern Ireland in which no one is left behind, be they Protestant or Catholic, Nationalist or Unionist, in all parts of Northern Ireland.

I wish to be associated with the welcome extended to their colleagues in the Visitors Gallery. It is very important that politicians on both sides of the Border should have an opportunity to meet one another to share ideas on a regular basis.It is interesting to note that on a day when Sinn Féin talked about being ready to be in Government, it has managed to divide the Opposition in a manner that is not always achieved by Members on this side of the House. I commend the Sinn Féin Members in this respect.I will not rise to any point made except to state that I will not take lectures from Green Party Members about our commitment to 1916. My family is no different from any other in this regard. My father's uncle was a legendary figure named Holy Joe O'Connor who was with Éamon de Valera in 1916.

The Sinn Féin Deputies should examine the Government amendment, as it does less harm to the motion than what some of their close colleagues are trying to do. The amendment highlights the Government's strong commitment to the Good Friday Agreement, as endorsed by the people of Ireland, North and South, in the 1998 referendums. As we know, the historic Agreement provides the basis for permanent peace and a lasting settlement in Northern Ireland. It is essential that we continue to work towards its full implementation.There have been some significant developments in the peace process in recent months which we should strongly welcome. As efforts by the two Governments continue to rebuild political momentum and confidence in the process, I recall the role of the international community in supporting the Good Friday Agreement as the basis of a lasting settlement in Northern Ireland.While it is regrettable that this is not acknowledged by some of the other amendments before the House, I am pleased that the Government's amendment includes an explicit acknowledgement of the valuable support provided by the United States of America and successive American presidents. On the long and often difficult path to peace in Northern Ireland, America has been with us every step of the way. The importance of bipartisan US support cannot be overestimated. Its contribution to the efforts to secure a lasting peace and stability in Northern Ireland has been immeasurable. We cannot overstate the political importance of this solidarity in bringing us so far on the road to peace. It is crystal clear to the people of Northern Ireland that the US is committed to their future.This is a worthwhile debate and I look forward to listening to other contributions, particularly tomorrow night.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	630	I wish to share time with Deputies Jim O'Keeffe and Crawford. During the recent Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis, the Taoiseach announced that the traditional 1916 Easter parade would be reinstated. An announcement of this type should have come about following extensive consultation with all political parties and not as part of a political party jamboree. However, the announcement was made without any consultation with my party or with some other parties in this House.It is very telling to note that, following this announcement, Sinn Féin has tabled a motion calling for Ireland to prepare politically, economically, socially and culturally for unification. It seems to me that what we are witnessing is a type of power play between Fianna Fáil and Sinn Féin where each party is more concerned with consolidating its respective position with certain elements of the electorate rather than concentrating on the real work that must be done to ensure that the Good Friday Agreement is implemented in full and that peace and stability is fully embedded in Northern Ireland.The Sinn Féin motion as presented to this House is, therefore, opportunistic and premature. The goal of unification is valid but failing to recognise the work that must be done here and now will do nothing to achieve it. Instead of putting forward motions extolling the virtues of unification, Sinn Féin would be much better employed working in all possible ways towards meeting its responsibilities to the communities it represents. Sinn Féin representatives should take their places on the Northern Ireland Policing Board and at the district policing partnerships. Policing in Northern Ireland has been revolutionised with the establishment of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, PSNI.At the time of the murder of Mr. Robert McCartney, Sinn Féin found it impossible for many weeks to call for witnesses to go to the PSNI with any information they may have had regarding that dreadful crime. This failure to recognise the rule of law and order and the role of the PSNI in Northern Ireland was unacceptable, as was the party's entire response to the murder of that unfortunate individual.Sinn Féin calls for the establishment of restorative justice schemes in Northern Ireland which it describes as a viable alternative to the PSNI. Alternatives to the Garda Síochána or the Defence Forces in this State would not be tolerated by Fine Gael. Similarly, members of Sinn Féin should no longer seek to undermine the new structures of the PSNI but should take their places on the Northern Ireland policing board and work with other parties in Northern Ireland to build the best possible policing for the communities they represent.Sinn Féin also has a clear obligation to co-operate fully with the Independent Monitoring Commission, IMC. IRA decommissioning is welcome but we must see an end to punishment beatings, the exiling of individuals and criminality perpetrated under the veneer of political activity. The recently published seventh report of the IMC noted that the Provisional IRA was responsible for a number of attacks over the period under review, including a shooting and ten assaults. In May, the Provisional IRA forced the removal of one family from its home and attempted to do the same to another last June. The IMC has frequently noted that the leadership of the republican movement has the capacity to turn on and off the tap of violence. We want this tap to be turned off for good and disconnected at the mains. All Members of this House will await the next set of findings of the IMC with considerable interest.I am not in favour of any move that could be seen to inflame tensions on any part of this island. There are two main communities in Northern Ireland and a myriad of other people who are uncomfortable in aligning themselves with either grouping. The role of this House is not to alienate one community over another or to move in a direction that will clearly, overtly or deliberately antagonise or frighten others. Our role is not to frustrate the peace process or progress in Northern Ireland but to support it and the best way to do so is to focus all our energies towards the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.In this regard, the recent proposals from the Government to allow Northern Ireland's Members of Parliament access to the Oireachtas are deeply unhelpful. These proposals will damage the prospects for political progress because they clearly follow the demands of one party alone, as is also the case in this motion presented by Sinn Féin.

What must be clear is that the opportunity will not be realised by those who believe unity can be achieved by force or sleight of hand. Neither can this unity be achieved by those blind to the reality of the situation in so far as they are stubbornly opposed to progress that is acceptable to normal and reasonable people on this island.

#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	642	Fine Gael has always had a bipartisan approach to matters relating to Northern Ireland. Essentially, this has involved not making political capital out of such matters and, while in Opposition, broadly supporting the thrust of Government policy in dealing with the issue without giving a blank cheque. Fianna Fáil has mainly followed the same approach. I recollect the bizarre exception concerning the Anglo-Irish Agreement of 20 years ago, which laid the foundation for this country's present progress and the Good Friday Agreement.Apart from that bizarre exception, Fianna Fáil has followed that bipartisan approach during its time in Opposition. That bipartisan approach helped to bring about results in determined opposition to terrorism and paramilitarism, in advancing the peace process and eventually contributed to the development of the Good Friday Agreement. I commend this bipartisan approach, in particular resisting the temptation to make political capital from the national issue, to others in the House, in particular Sinn Féin.I examined the Government amendment and I state genuinely that I support and endorse every phrase in it, no doubt delicately crafted by those in Iveagh House in the Department of Foreign Affairs. It would be in the national interest to have a unanimous vote in support of those sentiments tomorrow.I mentioned the full support of the courts for the Good Friday Agreement and bipartisan support for the Government's approach to Northern Ireland. However, let me make clear that Fine Gael does not give the Government a blank cheque. The leader of the Fine Gael Party, Deputy Enda Kenny, made it clear that Fine Gael would not support issues outside of the Good Friday Agreement, such as arose in the case of the release of the killers of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe. Deputy Kenny stoutly stood up and defended the position of Detective Garda McCabe's family and widow and members of the Garda Síochána. We did not and will not support anything other than that. Whether or not it was a side deal to the Good Friday Agreement, it was not part of the Agreement.In the same way, it is not in the Good Friday Agreement to extend either representation or speaking rights in this House to people from Northern Ireland. I was vice-chairman of the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution which examined this issue two days after the conclusion of the Good Friday Agreement. The views and decisions of that committee have been misrepresented. The decision of that committee was to endorse the proposal in paragraph 18 of strand two of the Good Friday Agreement that the Northern Ireland Assembly and the Oireachtas should consider developing a joint parliamentary forum bringing together equal numbers from both institutions to discuss matters of mutual interest and concern.The committee also supported the establishment of an independent consultative forum as mooted in paragraph 19 of the Agreement. It examined the issue of representation in this House and the unanimous recommendation of the committee was that no change should be made in the franchise for Dáil elections. The committee also examined the issue of speaking rights, teased out all the aspects and its final view was, "that any such participation should take place on a cross-community basis with parity of esteem for the different communities in Northern Ireland".

In his letter he envisages that a committee of this House would meet at least every six months, with the first meeting to be held in early 2006. Is there the slightest opportunity that we would have cross-party representation from Northern Ireland in this House in early 2006? Is the Taoiseach living in another world or does he have another agenda as far as Sinn Féin is concerned?

I recognise more than most the benefits that permanent peace can bring to this island home of ours. I am old enough to clearly remember the 30 year period, from the late 1960s to the end of the last century, when more than 3,000 people died and thousands of others took injuries to their graves or still bear the burden of injuries on both sides of the religious and political divide. Fine Gael has a proud record, being the first party to clearly see that this issue could be dealt with through democratic political means. Unfortunately, when the Sunningdale Agreement was signed by the then Taoiseach, Mr. Liam Cosgrave, and the late Mr. Brian Faulkner, other so-called democrats went out of their way to make it unworkable.In the 1980s Fine Gael, led by the then Taoiseach, Mr. Garret FitzGerald, followed through with the Anglo-Irish Agreement. At that time, the main Opposition party went out of its way to condemn that agreement, to the extent of sending people to the United States to undermine it. Of course, records will show that 12 months later, while in Government, the same party fully operated the agreement which brought about a new and workable structure on this island. IFI funding came about because of that agreement and the European funding for peace that came from the Good Friday Agreement has also been of benefit. I sought IRA decommissioning, which recently occurred, since the Good Friday Agreement was signed. I wish to make it clear to the people in the Public Gallery that I did not seek it for the sake of decommissioning. They are welcome here and I would be happy to see them in this House rather than at the activities in which they were previously involved.It is equally important to finalise policing structures. It is clear that many young Catholic men and women are prepared and eager to join the ranks of the PSNI. It is vital that personnel come from all areas and backgrounds because without proper policing and control of racketeering it would be difficult to have constructive peace. To this end, I believe a strong policing presence should be along the Border, both North and South. It is unacceptable to me and most right-thinking people that robbery with the use of balaclavas, knives and iron bars should happen in broad daylight, or at any other time of day for that matter.I sought to recall the Dáil on 10 August, without apology, because I was extremely anxious that deals were being done that far exceeded what people voted on in the Good Friday Agreement referenda. My request is more justified now than ever, when we read correspondence sent from the Taoiseach's office and hear what has been stated by the leadership of Sinn Féin regarding special rights. They claim to have agreement on speaking rights in the Dáil Chamber under the guise of a committee. My party has worked with the British Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body and all other agreed structures. It is vital that we finalise the aspects of the Good Friday Agreement and get the Assembly up and running and ensure that structures used are inclusive rather than perhaps aggravating some sections of the Northern Ireland community solely for the benefit of one party rather than for the common good.Fine Gael has given total support to Government negotiations through the normal and proper structures and will continue to do so. However, there must be no side deals and no effort to jump ahead until what was agreed in the Good Friday Agreement is brought to full fruition. The full working of the Assembly and the cross-Border bodies brings tremendous benefits to all the people of the island. That is what we voted for in the referenda and that is what was agreed in the Good Friday Agreement, that we would accept that in the short term we would work within the current structure in Northern Ireland. Now some people wish to ignore that and jump ahead.I will support the Government amendment tomorrow night.

The sins of An Post against its workers are gross. The Sustaining Progress agreement has not been honoured and that is unforgivable. A basic cost of living increase, which has been outstanding since 3 November 2003, is being denied to those workers. The workers received 5% this year but that payment was not back-dated. It is unacceptable that An Post workers are still owed the remainder of that money. The total amount is 12.5%.The Minister has treated An Post workers very badly. They are public servants but they are not paid like other civil servants. The company claims it cannot afford to pay them. It wants changes in the collection and delivery service before it will pay, which is a separate issue. The company is denying just payment to post office workers and that is a cost of living issue.An Post staff and pensioners are owed money by that semi-State company dating back to November 2003. The Communications Workers Union has exhausted all the procedures outlined in Sustaining Progress but has not been able to resolve the matter despite its best intentions. Some 90% of staff have voted in favour of industrial action, which is their democratic right and which is provided for under Sustaining Progress.As a result of this vote, An Post staff have rejected the Labour Court recommendation. I hope for successful talks because unless that happens, there will be a strike, and nobody wants a strike, particularly the long-suffering public.The management of An Post is the worst ever. It launched many serious and unsubstantiated allegations against the workers and argued that overtime working is required to maintain the service, yet it has increased the levels of overtime in the past two years and staff have been threatened with disciplinary action or accused of unofficial industrial action if they refuse to perform overtime. Those are low paid postal workers and it is not fair they should be expected or allowed to bear the burden of serious mismanagement and neglect by Government.I have great sympathy for the postal workers. Rationalisation is the thin end of the wedge. The United States has decided on a policy of keeping its public service, yet we are running towards privatisation which is not in the interests of the people, particularly in rural Ireland. The public service obligation has worked well.I know of a case of a man who sends a letter by post to his mother every day, which is delivered by the postman. This ensures his mother is being looked after. Such a service cannot be costed other than with reference to a social service. The country is all the richer for having postmen who know their locality and have a wonderful relationship with the people.I hope the postal service will be retained but the postal staff must be respected. I hope the Minister of State will have some news to give the House tonight to show this situation is being taken seriously before regrettable action occurs.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	664	The failure of An Post management to fulfil one of the key objectives it was mandated with, to successfully manage change and renewal at the company in the context of market deregulation and liberalisation, has been a hallmark of its performance in recent years. The management style has been by diktat rather than by facilitating a transformation in a climate of consultation, co-operation and harmony with the workforce. The results of the failure of An Post management are an indictment of the paucity of its style of management in recent years.Industrial relations at the company are at an all time low; they are now at a poisonous level. Workers' deep concerns about the deterioration of the postal service have not been taken on board by management. Management has long implemented a ban on recruitment of new staff members, whether in a temporary or permanent capacity, and this has had a serious effect on the universal service obligation, as was the case in the summer. Many districts around the country have not been receiving their due post on a daily basis, rather there is a delay of ten or 15 days. An incredible situation has been allowed to develop. The Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, may think that people easily agree to go out on strike but I assure him that is not the case. Over 90% of a workforce voting 90% in favour of strike action illustrates serious disharmony at the company.Postal workers and their families have been in contact with my office to alert me to the dire circumstances that often exist in families due to the current pay and conditions at An Post, and that is not including what is being withheld from staff.Since November 2003, An Post workers and pensioners have been denied the 8% cost of living increase to which they were entitled under Sustaining Progress partnership agreement, which all Members of this House received. Postal employees have been extremely tolerant in enduring this wage freeze for so long when all other groups covered by the Sustaining Progress agreement have received their increases.An Post made a €7 million profit last year on the basis of a number of years of serious decline. It has built up a considerable war chest from the sale of a number of overseas companies. As the Irish Congress of Trade Unions conference held in Belfast was told, the burden of resolving the difficulties at An Post cannot be exclusively borne by An Post staff, but that seems to have been the case. The staff have been denied their Sustaining Progress increases while at the same time the management received significant bonus payments such as the €12,000 Christmas pay-out last year and the €50,000 received by the part-time chairperson, Ms Margaret McGinley.If greater efficiencies, productivity and cost-cutting measures are being demanded of the workforce, why is the same not being expected of management, given that it has managed the company so badly?One of the most outrageous aspects of this whole saga has been that An Post pensioners have been left for so long without receiving their agreed increases. I was informed today that 78 An Post pensioners have passed away in the interim period without ever receiving the increases they were guaranteed under Sustaining Progress. That is an astonishing figure and it a shocking indictment of the way industrial relations have deteriorated at the company.The Minister has been extensively quoted in the media during the last week and at the Fianna Fáil ard fheis as rubbishing the concerns of postal workers and implying that they are a highly paid and over-indulged group of employees in this State, but the opposite is the case. He referred to a postman who is working for just three and a half hours a day yet being paid for seven and a half hours. The Minister has, as yet, been unable to produce any evidence that this postman, with a seemingly Stakhanovite productivity rate, actually exists.At such a critical juncture in this dispute it would be outrageous if it were to emerge that the Minister has been acting as a mouthpiece for An Post management, with not a shred of evidence to back up his claim. We have subsequently heard from An Post workers that the new delivery arrangements will result in a significant deterioration in the service to the public. For example, no weekend collections would take place and none would be scheduled after 6 p.m.For all these reasons postal workers are, correctly, concerned about the effect of current collection and delivery proposals on take home pay and conditions. Given that the universal postal service has been on the verge of collapse under the current management in what is classically a people business, it is clear management has signally failed to manage the company or the change and transformation processes which, as we are all aware, are necessary in this era of deregulation and electronic substitution.The Minister must give a lead and try to ensure the looming action, which is set to take place at midnight on Thursday, does not take place. I urge the Minister of State to indicate to the House the way forward and how the matter can be resolved.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	665	Sadly, it is almost a year since Deputies discussed the issue of An Post in the House and on Molesworth Street. At that time, everybody agreed that the sad state of industrial relations was of deep concern to An Post workers. The increments to which my colleague, Deputy Broughan, referred were not paid on time during a period when, according to the economic experts on the Government side, the country was awash with money. For some unknown reason, An Post was able to plead inability to pay as a result of which its workers were not paid their entitlements. Worse still, An Post pensioners were given a commitment in legislation passed in 1982 that, notwithstanding the changes being introduced, they would continue to be treated as civil servants, only to find that once the company became a commercial entity, it decided it could not afford to pay them their entitlements.The Minister's recent intervention, when he suggested he might bring forward competition legislation to speed up privatisation, was not helpful. He should have taken a more positive approach and used his influence, as I hope he is now doing, to bring about a resolution of the underlying issues which have caused the current problems in the company.Everybody wants and is entitled to a good postal service and people should be able to expect one day delivery in the modern world. There is, however, no point blaming post office workers when this expectation is not realised. Instead, we should ask why An Post workers are discontent. Until the reasons as set out by Deputy Broughan are addressed, the Minister has no right to accuse workers at the company of sabotage or anything else.The workforce of An Post, from postmen to postmasters, agree that improvements and modernisation are required and that the public must be given a good service. The problem is that nothing is being done to encourage them to take this route and, instead, they are being threatened that increments will be withheld, pension entitlements will not be paid and the company will be privatised if they do not knuckle under.Is the current fixation with privatisation the answer to everything? While it appears to resolve some problems, any consideration of the privatisation of Telecom Éireann — the classic case of Eircom — raises the question as to whether consumers benefited. Does Eircom deliver better service? Are we better served now in terms of the international league on the provision of modern telephonic services? The answer to both questions is "No".Would it not be better to modernise An Post and ensure the company has a future by providing a space for it in the modern Ireland? Instead of depriving workers of that to which they have been entitled for the past ten or 15 years, we should recognise the company's pensioners. As Deputy Broughan noted, it is a sad reflection on society that at a time when the country is allegedly awash with money, much of which has been lost and frequently not found, we refuse to recognise the existence of An Post pensioners, many of whom have passed on, by giving them what is theirs by right.I realise the sensitivity of the negotiations and discussions taking place. As I noted, this is not a time for the Minister to use threats but one for compromise and negotiation. Ultimately, however, we must recognise that if we do not utilise the assets of the postal network, that is, its post offices, sub-post offices and the company's workers, in a manner which delivers an improved, more extensive and efficient service, the current negotiations will go nowhere.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	666	I apologise to Deputies Broughan, Cowley and Durkan and other Members present on behalf of the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, who is unable to come before the House. I thank the Deputies for raising these important issues and giving me an opportunity to respond on behalf of the Minister.The Government recognises the invaluable contribution made by An Post and its staff down through the years in terms of their input to the overall business climate and the role played by rural post offices and postmen in maintaining the social fabric of rural society. The strong contribution by An Post was possible in the context of a slow moving operational environment. However, the company has not been immune to the seismic changes in the communications sector. The move to e-mail and electronic fund transfers has impacted on postal volumes and post office users. To be relevant in the new environment, therefore, the company must modernise.The basic building block for any company is financial stability and An Post has not yet met this basic requirement. As the Minister stated previously in the House, the company has suffered significant losses in recent years, starting with €6.7 million in 2001, rising to €17.4 million in 2002 before reaching an unsustainable level of €42.9 million in 2003. Between 2001 and 2002, payroll costs alone increased by €50 million. This financial performance, if allowed to continue unchecked, would have bankrupted the company.An Post needs to introduce modern work practices if it is to thrive in a competitive environment. The company will face more rather than less competition in coming years and it needs to be geared to address this challenge. Large international companies such as Royal Mail and the German post office are already operating in the Irish market. If An Post cannot meet consumer needs and deliver a high quality of service, these companies will be more than happy to ramp up their operations here to fill the gap.

#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	668	Time is not on the side of An Post and its workers. I will outline the lengthy background to current industrial relations at An Post and impress upon the Deputies that the current circumstances have not arisen overnight. An Post has been through one of the most intensive industrial relations processes imaginable. The process started when, following the disclosure of serious losses for 2003, the Government asked the board and management of the company to prepare a recovery strategy to return An Post to financial solvency. The plan involved changes in work practices and voluntary job losses. This strategy, in setting the way forward for the company, has assumed significant changes in work practices, tariff increases and the payment of wage increases.The plan was presented to An Post trade unions in late 2003. The Communications Workers Union withdrew from negotiations in December 2003. In recognition of the dire financial position facing the company, An Post invoked the inability to pay clause available under Sustaining Progress. This was followed by industrial action in the Dublin Mail Centre in March 2004. The Labour Relations Commission brokered settlement proposals which involved negotiations on collection and delivery and, in the event of failure to reach agreement in the LRC, referral to the Labour Court. The LRC proposals stated that the outcome of any LRC or Labour Court negotiations should be put to the respective sides, including a ballot of members.The two parties spent from April 2004 to November 2004 in the LRC. The proposals arising out of the LRC were put to the Communications Workers Union membership and turned down by the union. The outstanding issues were then referred to the Labour Court for resolution. On foot of union concerns that An Post management had no real experience of the postal sector, the Labour Court appointed a three-person expert group to come up with a workable proposal on collection and delivery that would be acceptable to members of the CWU. That group spent six months working on a comprehensive proposal regarding collection and delivery, which was published in July 2005.In the early part of 2005, the An Post group of unions referred the non-payment of Sustaining Progress to the LRC, as provided for under the Sustaining Progress agreement. The LRC appointed assessors to examine the claim. The assessors' report recommended that, having regard to An Post financials, 5% should be paid to employees, backdated to 1 January this year. That recommendation was accepted by An Post management and rejected by the CWU.The Labour Court issued a comprehensive recommendation which outlined that the acceptance of the deal on collection and delivery would trigger payment of the bulk of Sustaining Progress. The Labour Court deal would have allowed a postman to obtain a 9% pay increase this year on top of a 5% Sustaining Progress pay increase already made, giving a total increase of 14%.The Labour Court recommendation was considered by the executive of the CWU but was not put to a ballot of members. Instead, the union decided to ballot for strike action on the non-payment of Sustaining Progress. The membership has voted for strike action and the union has given two weeks' strike notice, with action possibly to commence on 4 November. It is still not clear at this stage what type of action that will be.On the other hand, a recent and very positive development in the payment of Sustaining Progress to An Post staff and pensioners occurred yesterday when An Post accepted the Labour Court recommendations on the claims by the other unions in An Post, the AHCPS, CPSU and PSEU, for payment of Sustaining Progress. The rejection by the CWU in September of the Labour Court recommendations issued to the An Post group of unions regarding the payment of Sustaining Progress effectively blocked payment to the AHCPS, CPSU and PSEU.The three unions then decided to pursue separate claims for payment of Sustaining Progress on behalf of their members. The Labour Court decided yesterday that, as the members of both the AHCPS and CPSU have agreed and implemented change agreements, they are entitled to Sustaining Progress as set out in the Labour Court recommendation issued last July. The PSEU has agreed in advance to accept an imminent Labour Court decision on a programme of change for its members. The Labour Court, having examined those issues, recommended that PSEU members receive the same Sustaining Progress payments as the other two unions on acceptance of its decision by both parties.Following acceptance by the three unions of the Labour Court recommendation, I understand that arrangements are being made by the company to proceed with the outstanding payments as soon as possible. I am particularly pleased that the increases will also be paid to all pensioners who retired from positions represented by the three unions as it is an unfortunate side effect of the dispute that payments to pensioners have also been affected.The recent Labour Court decision clearly shows that, where unions agree and implement change agreements, outstanding payments will be made. It is a reality that change is imperative in An Post as almost 70% of costs are payroll related. To provide Deputies with an example, every 1% increase in the payroll costs the company €5 million, and the cost of Sustaining Progress alone this year is estimated at €38 million. To enable the company to pay the large wage bill, the cost-saving measures outlined in the recovery strategy must be implemented.The Labour Court would not have tied payment of Sustaining Progress to a deal on collection and delivery if it had not recognised the imperative to begin restructuring now. There is no doubt that the decision by the CWU to take industrial action will have an impact on both personal and business customers. An Post is preparing contingency and communications plans to deal with the forthcoming industrial action which will address, in particular, the needs of social welfare recipients and provide information to customers regarding postal services.No interest is advanced by a descent into industrial relations chaos in An Post. Unlike with the postal strike 25 years ago, alternatives to the postal service now exist. Customers who leave An Post may not return, a fact which everyone should bear in mind. As the Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, have both outlined, the blueprint for the settlement of this dispute is the Labour Court recommendation. That is necessary to bring about the essential modernisation of the company, which is the best way of securing long-term sustainable jobs for An Post workers and ensuring the continuation of a high quality nationwide postal delivery and post office service. The earlier that the CWU recognises that, the better for the public, social welfare clients and its own membership.With that in mind, both parties accepted an invitation to meet the national implementation body separately for talks aimed at resolving the dispute and averting strike action. Those talks took place this afternoon and the outcome should be known shortly. However, it is hoped that both parties availed of this opportunity to resolve their difficulties and agree a road map for the implementation of the recommendations of the Labour Court. It is important that all players realise that globalisation, liberalisation and developments in technology are changing the way that people communicate. All national postal operators, including An Post, must change very rapidly to stay competitive and commercial in the European postal market.In light of the recent announcement by the CWU that it had rejected the Labour Court recommendation on collection and delivery and that it had balloted its members on taking industrial action which may lead to a serious disruption to postal services, the Minister announced that he was considering all options open to him, up to and including early liberalisation of the sector, to limit the disruption caused to the sector and the economy at large as a result of any prolonged period of industrial action.The unresolved difficulties in An Post cannot remain unresolved into the future. The momentum for liberalisation already exists and if An Post does not start to restructure, it will not be in a position to meet the competitive challenges of a fully liberalised postal market. For that reason, I urge all parties to reconsider the terms of the Labour Court settlement as time is not on the side of An Post.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	669	On 22 May 2003, a young woman, Georgina Eager, was brutally murdered in Dublin. Her family was devastated by the loss of a lovely and gentle daughter and sister. Their anguish was compounded by an ordeal resulting from a decision by the Irish authorities to let the case be heard in a British court. For the first time, a person accused of such a crime committed in Ireland did not have his extradition sought by the Irish Director of Public Prosecutions to stand trial here. It was an unprecedented and, for the family, inexplicable decision.To this day, they have received no clear explanation why the decision was made. I raised this matter by way of a parliamentary question and got no explanation either. The family was eventually advised to contact the DPP's office. When they did so, their calls were not returned. Finally, an approach was made by the family to the Garda Síochána and a letter issued from the DPP on 14 September. The DPP's explanation is in direct conflict with the statement made to the family by the British police who expressed both frustration and puzzlement with the Irish authorities for failing to seek the extradition of the accused.In January 2005, the accused began a fitness-to-plead challenge, which was heard in London. One family member attended court, but there was no Garda or legal presence representing the Irish State at that hearing. The DPP stated in his letter that he was satisfied with the efficient way in which the murder case had been handled by the Crown Prosecution Service and so did the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell. However, how do they know to make that judgment when they received no legal advice? The DPP and the Minister would no doubt claim that the verdict proves that they were right, but that is disingenuous. If the next time a family is put in this position and the verdict goes against them, what will the Minister and DPP say?The trial began on 8 August 2005 and the family travelled to London at its own expense and without support. It sought to have a legal representative of the Irish State present in the court, but that was denied. It sought assistance for help with the costs. That too was denied, in stark contrast to the decision by the Irish Government to send a legal representative to the inquest into the deaths of three Irish people in Gibraltar and to have diplomatic representation at the trial of the Columbia Three, together with the loan of money for bail. In the case of the Eager family, however, no support was provided. Any diplomatic presence in the court was a result of my independent representations. With the exception of help given by the Garda, it is shameful that members of an Irish family forced to depend on British justice found themselves effectively abandoned by their own State.After intense lobbying we were informed that funds were available through the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal Board. The circumstance of the trial, however, had no bearing on eligibility for this funding. Anyway the funds have run out so it will be next year before the family has a chance of getting anything.It is bad enough for a family to have to travel abroad for a trial of this nature without consular or legal assistance from the State, but what marks this case was that the Irish authorities had an option to hear the case in Ireland and chose not to. The family have three different accounts about why that choice was made, one from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, one from the DPP and one from the British police. Is it not time that they were told the truth?
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	670	I thank Deputy McManus for raising this important issue and apologise for the absence of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I express my deepest sympathy to the family and friends of the late Georgina Eager on her tragic and untimely death. The facts that I have to outline, in answer to the assertions made by Deputy McManus, concerning the assistance provided by a number of State agencies are not meant to detract in any way from the loss suffered by them. Nothing could compensate for that.Deputy McManus will be aware that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform does not have a role in providing assistance to the family of a victim of a crime in attending a trial abroad. There are, however, other supports available which were availed of by the family of Georgina Eager during the trial of Christopher Newman.Christopher Newman was arrested in London having fled Ireland following the murder of Georgina Eager. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform had no function or role in the decision to charge him here with her murder. The role of the Minister and his Department, in so far as they had any role, was confined to the provision of mutual legal assistance to the UK authorities. In this case a request for assistance was made by the British authorities. This request, which was complied with, consisted of interviews with certain witnesses, including the victim's father, as well as the provision of other evidence. Without the provision of this assistance it is doubtful that Christopher Newman would have been found guilty of the murder of Georgina Eager.Significant assistance was provided to the family by the Garda before and during the trial. From an early stage a Garda liaison officer was appointed and he was in regular contact with members of the family. The liaison garda also met the family each day during the trial. This was in addition to the assistance provided by the Garda with the arrangements for the attendance of witnesses at the trial, including family members who gave evidence.The Irish Embassy in London provided all possible consular assistance to the Eager family members during the time they spent in London attending the trial. The Irish Ambassador, who met them during their stay in London, assigned a diplomatic officer to members of the Eager family on the opening day of the trial on 8 August 2005, who assured them that she would be available to provide consular assistance throughout their stay in London. She ensured that they had her direct contact details and suggested that they could contact her at any time.This officer attended the trial for the opening and closing weeks and approximately twice a week in the intervening period. She provided information and advice to family members on a number of issues of concern to them, including compensation available towards the financial costs of attending the trial in London. This was provided on advice from the Minister's Department. She also liaised with the UK witness service victims support unit on their behalf to ensure that transport to and from the family's hotel would be provided throughout the trial. She arranged for the typing of printed statements for the family, including the victim impact statement which was presented to the judge before sentencing.Furthermore, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform indicated that the financial burden suffered by the Eager family in attending the trial could be alleviated through the criminal injuries compensation scheme. This scheme, to which the family can apply, is administered by an independent tribunal. Its purpose is to compensate victims for expenses and losses borne as a result of personal injuries inflicted in a crime. The tribunal is entirely responsible for deciding whether compensation is payable in any particular case but if an applicant is unhappy with the initial decision of a single tribunal member, the case can then be appealed to a three-member oral hearing.Under the scheme, the family of a person who has died as a result of a criminal injury is entitled to apply for actual loss of earnings or expenses that have arisen due to the person's death as well as for funeral expenses. Although the scheme does not cover compensation for pain and suffering, a payment can be made in respect of mental distress for the immediate family members, as defined in the Civil Liability Acts. The total amount available under this heading is just over €25,000.I understand that, with Deputy McManus's assistance, the Eager family has applied to the tribunal for compensation. As is normal practice, the secretariat is endeavouring to assemble sufficient information so as to enable the tribunal make a properly informed determination on the case. For that reason, the secretariat is following up a number of queries with the family, again via Deputy McManus. Of necessity a certain amount of detail will be required to support the claim but the documentation sought is not particularly onerous or unusual. Expenditure incurred can generally be vouched using receipts or credit card accounts, for example, while loss of earnings are normally certified by an employer. Details of expenses met from any other sources, such as the UK authorities in this instance, will also be followed up by the secretariat.The tribunal secretariat will offer any assistance to the family or the Deputy in clarifying the requirements so as to enable the claim to be advanced as soon as possible. As soon as the necessary detail is assembled, the case will be referred to a tribunal member for a decision. Depending on the complexity of the case and the other claims on hand, the processing time may take a number of months but I am sure that the tribunal will deal with the claim as quickly as possible in the circumstances.I hope that what I have said will serve to put the record straight on the support provided to the family by the various State agencies.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	671	The main purpose of the community employment programme operated by FÁS is to provide work experience and training for the long term unemployed and disadvantaged groups and thereby enable participants to advance successfully to employment in the open labour market.Following a review of FÁS employment schemes — community employment, job initiative and social economy programmes — on 10 November 2004 I announced that the three year cap for participants on community employment was raised to six years for those over 55 to ensure the maintenance of essential community services, particularly in rural areas where it had been found that difficulties existed in finding replacement participants. I have no plans to make any further changes of this type to the community employment scheme.A review of the social economy programme, SEP, highlighted the valuable role it plays in the delivery of community services throughout the country. In light of this, discussions are taking place between my Department and the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs about the transfer to that Department.There is nothing to prevent projects of the type to which the Deputy refers being funded under the community employment or social economy programme. I would point out, however, that to be eligible for funding under the SEP, enterprises are required to be established as legal entities.

This approach involved the provision of funding calculated on the basis of a standard allocation to each board as well as an additional allocation that was determined mainly by population but which also took account of issues such as unemployment, capacity to spend, existing commitments and regional spread.My Department is at present engaged in reallocating additional funding to individual boards that have identified a capacity to utilise such additional funds in the current year in accordance with normal practice. This additional funding has been made available from boards that have indicated that they are not in a position to spend their full original 2005 allocation.In addition, my Department, in conjunction with the CEBs, monitors on an ongoing basis the level of service provided by the boards to their client base. There is both a formal procedures manual and operating agreement in place between the Department and the boards which aim to provide a standardised delivery of services by CEBs across the country.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	673	As a consequence of a Commission audit decision in the year 2000, €15.6 million of European Social Fund moneys were withheld from Ireland. The sum involved represents less than 1% of the amount allocated to the three operational programmes for the period 1994-99. The Commission decision was contested by my Department and this resulted in a hearing before the European Court of Justice this year. On 15 September 2005 the European Court of Justice agreed with the European Commission's opinion that Ireland had over-claimed the contribution due from the ESF. This was due to a technical issue in the manner in which Ireland presented ESF claims.It should be noted that the Commission accepts that all expenditure incurred under the programmes in question was eligible and that no allegation of fraud was made.Of the €15.6 million withheld after the Commission decision in 2000, €7.2 million was withheld from the funding allocated to my Department and the following Departments — Education and Science, Health and Children, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The remaining €8.4 million of funding was paid from Exchequer resources to what was then the National Training Development Institute, which was a non-governmental organisation. The action required to be taken in respect of these funds is under consideration, in consultation with the relevant Departments.Irregularities of the type that have caused this clawback are very unlikely to recur in relation to the current operational programmes period because of the additional management and financial controls implemented within the funding cascade structure as a result of the expertise gained from the previous period of funding, 1994-99.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	674	I propose to take Questions Nos. 114, 120, 162 and 169 together.I would first like to extend my sympathy to the families of those involved and affected by the workplace fatalities so far this year. The Government's commitment to ensuring high standards of safety, health and welfare in Irish workplaces is illustrated in the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005, which came into force on 1 September last. The Act updates, repeals and replaces the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 1989 and provides a modern legal framework to guarantee best international practice in regard to safety, health and welfare in Irish workplaces.The Act aims at striking an appropriate balance between imposing duties, encouraging better consultation at workplace level on occupational safety and health matters, providing for an improved focus on better prevention systems and practices and the possible application of increased fines and penalties, where warranted.Overall trends in absences from work due to workplace accidents are best described by reference to the data from the occupational injury benefit claims published by the Department of Social and Family Affairs. Although the statistics show an increase in the number of claims in recent years, this has to be read in the context of the expansion of activities and the number in employment over the period. The number of occupational injury benefit claims per 100,000 employees has shown a steady decline in Ireland. In fact, these rates have declined from one in 885 in 2000 to one in 638 in 2004, as the following tables show.The number of fatalities at work has also declined from a total of 70 in 2000 to 49 last year. Nonetheless, the rate of deaths and injuries in Irish workplaces is unacceptable.I am very concerned at the total of 61 workplace deaths that have occurred so far this year. The Health and Safety Authority has also expressed concern over the number of workplace deaths, particularly of non-nationals. Provisional figures indicate that ten non-nationals have died this year in work-related accidents. The Health and Safety Authority has called on all employers to ensure that they are adequately communicating the risks and providing appropriate safety training for all employees, including those who are non-English speaking.Of the ten fatalities involving non-nationals at the workplace this year, four have occurred in construction, three in manufacturing, one in agriculture and two in the wholesale and retail trade. The Health and Safety Authority has been working on a programme of information resources aimed at non-English speakers and specific provisions relating to such workers are now included in the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005.That authority has also recognised the new challenges that the growth of non-English speaking people within the workforce brings. Earlier this year the authority launched a new initiative, entitled the safe system of work plan, which is aimed at reducing injuries and deaths on construction sites. This initiative relies heavily on pictograms to explain and clarify hazards and controls, thereby creating a wordless document where safety can be communicated to all workers regardless of literacy or language skills. The plan aims to focus on those who are most at risk and empowering them to ensure that all necessary safety controls are in place prior to the commencement of work.In addition, the authority has work under way to produce the safe system of work plan in a number of different languages. The plan has been translated into Turkish and Polish and shortly a seven-language training DVD will be available. I would also like to say that the authority's safe system of work plan, SSWP, for construction was recently awarded the innovation prize for good prevention practices in the construction industry by the International Social Security Association, ISSA, during the recent World Congress on Safety.In 2004, the authority, in conjunction with Bord Glas, recognised the multicultural nature of the horticultural workforce, with the launch of the essential health and safety guide for horticulture, which aims to promote health and safety awareness and accident prevention in this sector. As a labour intensive industry, horticulture is an established employer of migrant workers and 30% of these originate from the recent accession states to the EU. The guide is available in four different foreign languages, that is, Latvian, Lithuanian, Polish and Russian.There are huge responsibilities on all parties in the workplace and the issue of safety can only be corrected by dedicated efforts by all those involved in day to day operations.Health and Safety Authority evidence is that up to one half of the small employers in this country do little or certainly not enough to ensure a safe workplace and that the most common causes of accidents are slips, trips and falls at work and bad lifting habits resulting in injury.I appeal to all parties to do more work to promote awareness of the need for a safe work environment which has benefits for workers, employers and society generally and which will engender a safety culture.Number of OIB claims acceptedNumber of EmployeesRate per 100,000 employees200011,9951,355,600885200112,0501,406,400857200212,2801,440,000852200311,0961,502,800738200411,7051,835,9006382005Figures unavailable as yetYearNumber of Fatalities200070200164200261200367200449200561(to 26 October)

The group's final report, Make Consumers Count, was published in May this year. The report contains over 30 separate recommendations, including the recommendations mentioned in the Deputies' questions, covering a variety of different Departments and agencies whose activities directly impact upon the interests of consumers.The scope and breadth of the group's recommendations required a co-ordinated response. For that reason a high level interdepartmental committee was established to examine the CSG's recommendations and to report back to Government with a detailed implementation plan.It is expected that the committee's report in relation to the implementation of the CSG's recommendations, including the recommendations referred to in the Deputies' questions, will be submitted to Government shortly. The implementation of all the CSG's recommendations will then be considered by Government in the light of the high level committee's report.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	676	Statutory redundancy payments are the responsibility of the employer in the first instance, and should be paid in accordance with the relevant legislation.The Redundancy Payments Act 1967, as amended by the 1971 Act, contains the definition of redundancy in section 7(2). This definition has withstood the test of time. The redundancy payments scheme was examined by the redundancy review group in 2002. The review group consisted of representatives of the social partners and Government Departments. The review group agreed several changes to the redundancy payments scheme which were implemented in the Redundancy Payments Act 2003. However, the group saw no reason to change the statutory definition of redundancy.As my Department has not received any communication from Irish Ferries regarding the proposed redundancies, which were announced to the media on 19 September 2005, it is not in a position to give a definitive opinion on whether or not redundancies at this company, should they occur, fall within the provisions of the Redundancy Payments Acts 1967 to 2003. Based on media reportage of the proposed redundancies I sought and obtained preliminary advice from the Attorney General's office which is to the effect that redundancies as proposed by the company may not fall within the definition of the legislation. However, clarity can only be established if and when the company makes a formal application to the Department for a statutory redundancy rebate. The company and the unions are involved with the State's industrial relations machinery in attempts to seek a solution to the issues involved.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	677	Since 1997 over 450,000 new jobs have been created. There has also been a significant fall in unemployment from 10.4% to 4.2% at present.Long-term unemployment fell from 5.5% in 1997 to 1.6% in 2000 and this very low level has been maintained; it is now at 1.4%. This long-term unemployment rate compares very favourably with the EU average of 4% and ranks fourth lowest among the 25 EU member states. However, we are not complacent about this level of long-term unemployment and in order to reduce it a range of new initiatives has been introduced.In addition to the FÁS and local employment services and the community employment, social economy and job initiative programmes, the most significant measure has been the national employment action plan referral process. This involves early intervention by FÁS with unemployed people. It seeks to help the unemployed to reintegrate into the labour market as quickly as possible by providing them with the necessary skills and supports to improve their employability.Under this process, since 2003 anyone who has been on the live register for six months, and all persons were not previously referred and who were more than six months on the live register, were referred to FÁS for interview. The majority of such referrals were long-term unemployed. Since June 2003, approximately 27,000 long term unemployed clients were referred to FÁS. Since the introduction of the NEAP in September 1998, a total of 247,000 clients have been referred to FÁS for assistance. An external evaluation of the NEAP preventive strategy, which is due to be released shortly, concludes "that the NEAP process has been a success".Other innovative responses developed by my Department and FÁS to assist unemployed persons have included: the Pathways programme, which identifies the most appropriate development pathway to assist clients to obtain employment; the high supports process, which assists clients on a multi-agency basis to address personal barriers to employment; and the customised training fund to flexibly meet training needs of the unemployed. We are therefore continuing to engage with those in long-term unemployment through a wide range of labour market measures and activities to help them return to the labour market.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	678	A registered employment agreement provides for the establishment of the construction federation operatives pension scheme, generally referred to as CFOPS.A registered employment agreement is an agreement that is negotiated between two parties, for example, a body representative of employers and a similar group representative of employees, who are all engaged in the same sector of activity in the economy. The agreement, once finalised between the contracting parties, is then registered with the Labour Court. Having completed that process the terms of the agreement are binding nationally for all employers and all workers covered by the categories of work included in the agreement.A board of trustees comprising an independent chair together with five members, each nominated by the CIF and the union side respectively, administers CFOPS. Broadly speaking, monitoring of compliance with the CFOPS is a matter for signatories to the agreement. To assist them in this task they established the Construction Industry Monitoring Agency, known as CIMA, for that purpose. CIMA is independent of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. In processing a case of non-compliance CIMA ultimately refers matters to the Labour Court, which will hold a hearing and, if satisfied as to non-compliance, issues an order against the employer concerned. The court may ask the labour inspectorate for assistance in checking records.There are also provisions in legislation whereby a trade union, an association of employers or an individual employer may complain to the Labour Court that a particular employer is not complying with a registered employment agreement. If, after investigating a complaint, the court is satisfied that the employer is in breach it may by order direct compliance with the agreement. Failure to comply with such an order is an offence punishable by a fine.Compliance with CFOPS has been an issue of concern for some while and it prompted the Pensions Board to engage Mercer Consultants to carry out a review. Mercer's report was recently published and it sets out a range of proposals that focus on a range of issues including compliance. The proposals in the Mercer report are being considered by the parties to the registered employment agreement.Those recommendations of the Mercer report that may impinge on the activities of the labour inspectorate will be considered by the Department, together with the social partners, in the context of ongoing work concerning the mandate and resourcing of the labour inspectorate.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	679	I propose to take Questions Nos. 119 and 149 together.Sixteen investigations into company law matters were initiated by my predecessor in the period since 1997. In three cases, the High Court appointed, on an application by the Minister, inspectors under section 8 of the Companies Act 1990. The inspectors appointed to Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited presented their report to the High Court on 10 June 2002. The report was subsequently published and referred to the DPP.The inspectors appointed to National Irish Bank Limited and National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited presented their report to the High Court on 12 July 2004. The report was subsequently published. The court ordered that a copy of the report be referred to several relevant authorities, including the DPP. Earlier this year, the Director of Corporate Enforcement initiated proceedings in the High Court under section 160(2) of the Companies Act 1990, as amended, seeking the disqualification of nine persons against whom adverse comment was made by the inspectors. I welcomed the director's action in this case. I note that last week the High Court granted a disqualification order against one of the nine persons. The proceedings against the other eight remain before the court.One investigation under section 14 of the Companies Act 1990 was completed in 1998. The report on this was referred to the DPP. One investigation was undertaken under section 59 of the Insurance Act 1989. The report on this was referred to the DPP as well as to the inspectors who undertook the section 8 investigation into that company.Eleven investigations were initiated by the Minister under section 19 of the Companies Act 1990. Six of these have been concluded. Of the six investigations completed, two of the reports were referred to the DPP. A number of summary prosecutions have since been successfully concluded in one case. One report provided an input into the successful application to the High Court for the appointment of inspectors under section 8 while the fourth report was passed to the relevant High Court inspectors. One report was completed in September 2002 and a further report was completed in March 2003. Both reports have been referred to the Director of Corporate Enforcement.Two of the eleven section 19 investigations were held up in legal appeals. These inquiries are now the responsibility of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.In relation to the three remaining section 19 investigations, the current position is that following the completion of the review to which I referred in response to a previous question on 31 May 2005, I directed the authorised officer to place at the disposal of relevant public authorities, including tribunals, whatever information arising from his investigative work was required for the purpose of the performance by those authorities of their statutory functions. This process is progressing and I hope that it will be completed shortly. My objective in giving this direction is to achieve the earliest possible pursuit by the appropriate authorities of any matter which may require action by them.The costs incurred since 1997 on company investigations initiated by or on behalf of my Department amount to approximately €10.9 million. This amount does not include the salary costs of Civil Service staff working on a number of these investigations or the legal costs which are primarily being borne by the Vote of the Chief State Solicitor. Of the €10.9 million expended, €1.6 million relates to section 19 investigations by authorised officers and the remaining €9.3 million was incurred by High Court inspectors appointed under section 8 —€5.8 million in the case of National Irish Bank Limited-National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited and €3.5 million in the case of Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited.The question of recovering costs from the section 8 investigations does not arise until such time as the inspectors complete their investigations. In the case of the Ansbacher inquiry, the High Court proceedings taken by the State to recover the costs of the inquiry were settled out of court for the sum of €1.25 million in favour of the State.In the case of National Irish Bank Limited-National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited, the court ordered that National Irish Bank pay the full costs of the investigation. I understand that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, which had borne the costs of the investigation, has received payment of those costs from National Irish Bank.Section 19 as originally enacted did not provide for the recoupment of costs. This has now changed with the enactment of the Company Law Enforcement Act 2001.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	680	The enterprise strategy group recommended that the existing regulators for networked sectors, for example, electricity, gas, telecommunications and broadcasting, should be replaced by a new regulatory body covering all networked sectors.The Government considered this recommendation and decided not to implement it. In looking at international experience the Government remains to be convinced that regulatory amalgamation on the scale proposed would be an efficient model. Indeed, there is a danger that a single regulator could give rise to slower decision making and less focus on smaller sectors compared with more dominant ones. Any further action in this area is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources whose remit covers these networked sectors.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	681	I propose to take Questions Nos. 122 and 351 together.The review group on public safety was established in November 1999. The group comprised representatives from Departments, various agencies and bodies. Its report entitled A Review of Public Safety in Ireland was published in 2000.One of the recommendations of the review group was that an office of public safety regulation should be considered, which would not itself be responsible for public safety issues but would have some form of overseeing role of all the agencies and bodies involved. The review group also proposed that the functioning, appropriateness and continuing need for such an office should be reviewed within a five-year period.The group was not in full agreement on its proposal due to issues relating to duplication of existing services and additional cost. Some members of the group expressed reservations about the need for such an office and the extra burden on State finances. In my view, this in itself questions the need for such an office of public safety regulation in the first instance and the establishment of yet another State agency, whose function is merely to oversee public safety matters, is not the right way forward.The review group's recommendation was quite clearly inconclusive and a clear-cut case has not been made for the establishment of a new agency. Another State agency, whose function is merely to oversee other agencies on public safety matters, is not the right way forward. As outlined previously, it is not intended to act on the recommendation.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	682	The Small Business Forum, which I have set up to consider the current environment for conducting small business in Ireland, has held two plenary sessions to date. In addition, the forum has held a number of thematic workshops covering various areas of interest identified by the initial plenary meetings. I should also mention that the forum has been very proactive in seeking to obtain the views of the small business community. The forum published a public invitation for submissions and has received some 60 submissions from interested parties to date. Furthermore, the forum has held a number of meetings with small businesses around the country recently to discuss their concerns and to identify any suggestions they might have for improvements in the environment for small business. Some 80 businesses have been involved in these meetings. I have asked the forum to report back to me, with its findings, by 31 March 2006.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	683	The National Competitiveness Council, NCC, in its annual competitiveness report 2005, found that of the 16 countries benchmarked, Irish expenditure on non-life insurance was the fourth highest. However, the NCC also found that the rate of growth in the cost of insurance has slowed down substantially in recent years. This can be attributed to the series of initiatives the Government has pushed through to reform the insurance sector. The action taken by Government to ensure healthy competition in the insurance sector had already seen benefits for consumers.Sub-indices calculated from the all items consumer price index at mid-September 2005 show that since the insurance reform programme began in October 2002, there has been a reduction of 23.5% in car insurance. My Department has no data in relation to public liability insurance.The Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, which was one of the key initiatives of the Government's insurance reform programme, published it first annual report on 13 September 2005. This shows that PIAB assessments to date have been delivered approximately three times faster and at a delivery charge four times cheaper than under the litigation system. As well as being a major benefit to victims of accidents this is a significant reduction in the cost to insurance companies for the delivery of compensation and hence facilitates reductions in liability premia.Supervision of insurance undertakings is the responsibility of the financial regulator, formerly known as the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority. The financial regulator has a wide regulatory remit covering consumer protection and prudential supervision of practically all of the financial services industry, including insurance, and the services provided by it. The financial regulator comes under the aegis of my colleague the Minister for Finance.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	684	I would point out to the Deputy that on the occasion of the publication of the final report of the Consumer Strategy Group in May of this year, I clearly stated that notwithstanding my desire to have the national consumer agency up and running on a statutory basis as soon as possible, the preparation of the legislation to establish the new agency would take some time.Given the importance of the national consumer agency to the development of future consumer protection policy, I am anxious that the legislation is framed so as to ensure that the NCA has sufficient powers and functions to enable it to carry out the role of being a forceful advocate on behalf of the consumer as recommended by the Consumer Strategy Group.In addition to setting up the NCA, the new legislation will take the opportunity to update the existing code of consumer protection law, some of which is over 100 years old, something which was also recommended by the Consumer Strategy Group. Furthermore, it is intended that the legislation will also transpose the recently promulgated European directive on unfair business to consumer commercial practices, which is one of the most significant directives in the area of consumer protection, into national law. Given the scope of the legislation it will be appreciated, therefore, that its preparation will of necessity take some time. It is my expectation, however, that the legislation will be published in the latter half of next year.I would point out to the Deputy that it was for the very reason that the establishment of the NCA would take time that I appointed a board to the new agency to act in an interim capacity until the NCA is established on a statutory footing. This appointment will ensure that in the interregnum until the NCA is formally established, the momentum built up by the Consumer Strategy Group's report will be maintained and that the consumer's case will be continue to be forcefully advocated.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	685	The labour inspectorate of my Department carried out two inspections of the records of Irish Ferries. The first inspection was carried out in 2000. This was a routine inspection which was carried out during the course of a major campaign to ensure compliance with the then recently enacted National Minimum Wage Act.The second inspection of the company's records was carried out in April this year, following media reports regarding rates of pay of employees of the company.The labour inspectorate does not carry out inspections onboard shipping vessels. Surveyors from the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources may inspect ships docked at Irish ports to ensure that foreign registered vessels are maintained and operated in compliance with international safety standards and to ensure that the living and working standards are in compliance with the relevant standards.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	686	I propose to take Questions Nos. 127, 131, 153, 161 and 164 together.In January 2005 the complement of labour inspectors was 17 officers. When all  sanctioned posts are filled there will be 31 officers assigned to labour inspector posts.A selection interview process was undertaken following the announcement of additional labour inspectorate posts earlier this year. Arising from that process four officers were appointed. A second round of interviews to identify suitable personnel to fill the remaining vacancies has now been completed. The interviewing process commenced at the earliest opportunity following the summer annual leave cycle and was completed during the past month and a panel of officers has been established. It is intended that these assignments will be completed during November this year.The Government is aware of the concern being expressed by public representatives, trade unions representing employees and others close to the issues with regard to the abuse of vulnerable workers by a small minority of unscrupulous employers. To enhance the efforts of the labour inspectorate in discharging its remit to enforce employment legislation, increases in staffing levels this year mean that, when all posts are filled, the complement of inspectors will have almost doubled.The strengthened inspectorate will be concentrating on those sectors of the economy where workers tend to be more vulnerable to suffering the effects of non-compliance with employment legislation. It is these sectors also that appear to have high concentrations of non-national workers.In addition to the labour inspectorate, it should be noted that there is a wide corpus of employment rights legislation administered by various State organisations and services. These include the Employment Appeals Tribunal, the redundancy and insolvency sections of this Department, the rights commissioner services provided by the Labour Relations Commission and the services provided by the Labour Court. The labour inspectorate is itself a unit within the employment rights compliance section, which also includes the employment rights information unit and a further separate unit that administers the referral of cases for prosecution and legal enforcement of orders. Between them, these various services have a complement of staff in excess of 140 people.Work has also been progressing with regard to the discussion document prepared in connection with the mandate and resourcing of the labour inspectorate. The social partners, together with representatives from the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Finance, are members of the employment rights compliance group, ERCG, that is considering the discussion document. Among the issues being examined is the simplification and streamlining of employment rights compliance monitoring and the redress system. Those recommendations of the Mercer report that impinge on the activities of the labour inspectorate will be considered by the ERCG.In 2004, labour inspectors of my Department undertook 462 inspections under the National Minimum Wage Act 2000. So far this year the inspectorate has undertaken 384 inspections under the legislation. Inspectors operate on the basis of achieving compliance. Where an inspection occurs leading to a detection of infringements the employer is required to rectify the infringements detected. Failure to do so to the satisfaction of the labour inspectorate within a specified period results in the initiation of legal proceedings.In many sectors, including the construction industry, the pay and conditions of employment are governed by employment regulation orders and registered employment agreements. The orders and agreements regulate statutory minimum rates of pay and conditions of employment for workers employed in the various sectors where these apply. Ensuring compliance with the minimum pay amounts, terms and conditions forms a major element of the work of the inspectorate.The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 is separate legislation dealing with occupational safety, health and welfare. The labour inspectorate has no role in relation to this Act. The Health and Safety Authority is the State body charged with overall responsibility for the administration, enforcement and promotion of workplace safety and health and therefore for the implementation of this legislation.The authority has 100 staff specifically involved in inspection, investigation and enforcement of health and safety legislation and it has an ambitious work programme for 2005, which includes an increase in the level of inspections to be undertaken and the related enforcement. In the context of the overall allocation of resources I am confident the authority can achieve the objectives which are set out in its work programme for 2005.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	687	Earlier this year the Government considered and endorsed the report of the high level committee that was asked to look at the most appropriate implementation arrangements for the enterprise strategy group's, ESG, recommendations. The Government is broadly supportive of the policy directions recommended by the ESG as underlined by its intention to implement, either in full or with some modifications, most of the its recommendations. The Government's response to the ESG report can be found on my Department's website.The most important overall theme to emerge from the ESG's analysis and policy recommendations is that we are broadly on the right track as regards the right mix and focus of enterprise support policies. These will also improve the competitiveness of the economy and sustain growth.The central theme of the ESG recommendations concerns a strategic evolution to a more competitive, innovative and knowledge centred economy. To help create quality and sustainable employment we have to make sure Ireland continues to be an attractive place in which to invest and from which to undertake increasingly profitable business. The ESG's report makes a valuable contribution to embedding strategies appropriate to the new realities and challenges facing the Irish economy. The ESG policy prescriptions are particularly relevant to my Department and the enterprise support agencies that report to me.As part of the ESG implementation process some significant progress has been made in making important strategic changes to enterprise support policies and how they will deliver real and tangible benefits to SMEs. Already I have agreed a fundamental reorganisation of Enterprise Ireland that will change its operational engagement with indigenous firms.Many ESG's recommendations involve new programmes that are either being designed for pilot testing or have been launched. Others will follow over the coming months so that each recommendation is carefully implemented to achieve measurable targets with a defined target group. For example, I recently launched the One Step Up programme that is an initial response to the ESG proposals about a continuous upgrading of our labour force skills.I recently announced the business representatives of the enterprise advisory group. That group will advise me on progress in implementing the enterprise strategy group's recommendations. The advisory group will also involve the Secretaries General from a number of Departments and I will listen carefully to the group in preparing a periodic report to Government on the pace and progress in implementing the ESG recommendations.

For example, in line with previous NCC recommendations the Government has introduced two consecutive non-inflationary budgets, a 20% research and development tax credit and has extended the business expansion and seed capital schemes until the end of 2006. The Government has also established a system of competitive funding for research developed under the programme for research in third level institutions, PRTLI, and has put in place procedures for the roll-out of national broadband infrastructure.My Department is preparing a report to Government outlining progress to date in relation to the implementation of the council's most recent recommendations. It is intended that this report will be presented to Government for its consideration before the end of the year.

However, as previously stated on a number of occasions in the House, it is now considered, on reflection, that the provision of statutory protection for whistleblowers on a sectoral basis might provide a better and more focused approach to dealing with this issue. Recent legislative initiatives in this regard are: section 27 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005, which came into effect from 1 September 2005 and provides for protection against dismissal and penalisation of employees who, in good faith, take steps to protect themselves or others in a workplace situation; and section 124 of the Garda Síochána Bill 2004. This section of the Bill provides for regulations relating to the reporting of corruption and malpractice in the Garda Síochána.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	690	I propose to take Questions Nos. 132, 148, 159 and 163 together.I take it that these questions relate to a view expressed by the Competition Authority in a recent investigation into alleged price fixing involving the Equity trade union and the Institute of Advertising Practitioners in Ireland.The aim of the Competition Act is to prohibit anti-competitive practices by "undertakings" such as price fixing and-or the abuse of a dominant position. The Act applies to all sectors of the economy in the State.An "undertaking" is defined as "a person being an individual, a body corporate or an unincorporated body of persons engaged for gain in the production, supply, or distribution of goods or the provision of a service". This definition has been in use in Irish competition law for some time and is supported by EU case law.I understand that the view expressed by the authority in its investigation was in respect of that particular case only and the parties to that investigation do not appear to have taken issue with the authority's view as they entered into undertakings with the authority in settlement of the case, thereby avoiding the necessity of going to court. It is only the courts that can interpret the law.The authority's decision, which describes how it came to its view in the matter, is published on its website, tca.ie. It states, however, that while it is perfectly legal for a trade union to represent employees in collective bargaining with their employers, its trade union mantle cannot exempt its conduct when it acts as a trade association for self-employed contractors.In considering the question of whether a legislative exemption should be provided for actors, musicians and freelance journalists, therefore, we need to bear in mind that a similar argument could be made for almost any group of self-employed contractors such as barristers, farmers, publicans, doctors, pharmacists etc, who, by coming together, adding union to their name and getting a negotiating licence, could circumvent the protections afforded to consumers by the Oireachtas in the Competition Act. Accordingly, I have no plans to amend current legislation in relation to this matter.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	691	I am concerned about the recent job losses in the Youghal area, particularly the loss of 38 jobs in Seafield Technical Textiles Limited that has ceased operations due to adverse trading conditions. However, I am also aware that the relevant development agencies in my Department, namely, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, FÁS and the county enterprise board, are responding to such job losses in the area in a co-ordinated way in order to attract new investment, grow existing business and employment and provide training and assistance to those seeking employment. While I may give general policy directives to the agencies I am precluded under the Industrial Development Acts from giving directives regarding individual undertakings or from giving preference to one area over others.IDA Ireland has assured me it is actively marketing and promoting Youghal for new overseas investment and every effort is being made to secure further advanced knowledge-based industry for the east Cork area. Over recent years, in terms of new foreign investment in east Cork, pharmaceuticals, medical technologies and internationally traded services are among the area's strongest performers. Direct employment in IDA supported companies in Cork city and county has grown from 10,345 in 1993 to 18,500 in 2004.Enterprise Ireland is working closely with community groups in the towns of east Cork, including Youghal and Midleton, to foster further embryonic enterprise and to encourage young graduates to set up businesses in their own localities. The agency supported the setting up of the Knockgriffin Community Enterprise Centre in Midleton which is full and supports 24 full-time jobs in six companies as well as approving feasibility study funding to explore the possibility of a centre in Youghal under its CEC 2002 programme.FÁS is running a number of training initiatives in Youghal at present. The programmes on offer are Pathways to Employment, which commenced on 24 October, and Return to Work and Care of the Elderly, Midleton. In March of this year, FÁS commenced a free daily bus service from Youghal to the FÁS training centre in Bishopstown, Cork. The full range of FÁS services are also available to all companies in the Youghal area. The South Cork County Enterprise Board is also available to develop indigenous enterprise potential and to stimulate economic activity throughout the area.Under the Government's decentralisation programme 200 jobs will be relocated to Youghal. It is intended that the Civil Service Commission will relocate 100 jobs and the Valuation Office will relocate 100 jobs to the town.I am confident that the strategies and policies being pursued by the development agencies, together with the ongoing commitment of Government to regional development, will bear fruit in terms of additional sustainable investment and jobs for the people of the east Cork, including Youghal.

They are referred automatically by the Department of Social and Family Affairs to FÁS for advice and assistance.Particular emphasis is placed on the identification of training needs and on the provision of tailored responses. There is also a customised training fund to enable unemployed persons access training that is not readily available through FÁS or other State providers.The local employment service, LES, which is funded by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment through FÁS, also provides an intensive guidance and placement service to persons who are most distant from the labour market.The National and Economic Social Forum, NESF, on which FÁS and DETE are represented, has completed a final report, Creating a More Inclusive Labour Market, which will be presented to Government. Its conclusions and recommendations should make a significant contribution towards influencing and informing future policy in this area.In relation to redundancies, FÁS has a policy of early intervention whereby they offer a range of customised services to companies which are facing closure or to employees who have been notified of impending redundancy. Responses range from the establishment and co-ordination of multi-agency teams to specifically address the needs of the employees affected and the provision on site of the full range of FÁS employment services. FÁS makes contact with the companies concerned as soon as they are notified of proposed redundancies. This pro-active approach has been very successful to date. As part of the new FÁS strategy, a review of the FÁS response to company closures is under way. The outcome of this review will inform future developments in this area.

The Act also provides for an entitlement to nine public holidays per annum.Notwithstanding these provisions, it is possible for employers and employees to negotiate a longer annual leave entitlement between themselves if they so wish. The average public holiday entitlement in the EU at present is approximately 11 days per annum.I have no proposals at the moment to increase either annual leave or public holiday entitlements. However, should these issues arise in the context of discussions on a new social partnership agreement, they will be considered at that stage.

There are 234 participants in this category on community employment.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	696	Economic migration policy is formulated within a context where the focus on meeting our skills needs is: first, on upskilling our resident workforce; second, on maximising the potential of EEA nationals to fill our skills deficits; and third, with a new green card and revised work permit system, to meet those skill needs which cannot otherwise be addressed.I announced my proposals for employment permits policy on 12 October 2005. The new employment permits system will have three pillars: pillar one is the establishment for the first time in Ireland of a green card for occupations where there are skills shortages, which will be for a restricted list of occupations in the annual salary range from €30,000 to €60,000 and for a more extensive list of occupations in the annual salary range above €60,000; pillar two is a re-established intra-company transfer scheme for temporary trans-national management transfers, and pillar three is a work permit scheme for a very restricted list of occupations up to €30,000. These new arrangements will be implemented next year.The Employment Permits Bill 2005, which is being considered by the Dáil, will put in place a statutory framework to allow the implementation of an active, managed economic migration policy. These proposals are fair and reasonable and will support our economic development into the future.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	697	I propose take Questions Nos. 140, 143 and 171 together.The construction federation operatives pension scheme, generally referred to as CFOPS, has been established on foot of a registered employment agreement for the construction industry. A separate registered employment agreement in the construction sector provides for the establishment of statutory rates of pay and related working conditions of employment. The terms of both agreements apply to a range of categories of workers in the industry.Compliance with CFOPS has been an issue of concern for some while and it prompted the Pensions Board to engage Mercer Consultants to carry out a review. The terms of reference for the consultants were formulated by a steering committee that included representatives of the social partners.The report was recently published and it sets out a range of recommendations that focus on the issues highlighted above. The recommendations have policy and operational implications for various Departments that are being examined at present.In the meantime work has also been progressing with regard to the discussion document prepared in connection with the mandate and resourcing the labour inspectorate. The social partners, together with representatives from the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Finance, are members of the Employment Rights Compliance Group, ERCG, that is considering the discussion document. Among the issues being examined is the simplification and streamlining of employment rights compliance monitoring and the redress system. Those recommendations of the Mercer report that impinge on the activities of the labour inspectorate will be considered by the ERCG.A board of trustees comprising an independent chair together with five members, each nominated by the CIF and the union side respectively, administers CFOPS. Broadly speaking, responsibility for compliance with the registered employment agreement rests with the signatories to the agreement and to assist them in this task they established the Construction Industry Monitoring Agency, known as CIMA, to monitor compliance on their behalf. In processing a case of non-compliance CIMA ultimately refers matters to the Labour Court which will hold a hearing and, if satisfied as to non-compliance, issues an order against the employer concerned. The court may ask the labour inspectorate for assistance in checking records.There are also provisions in legislation whereby a trade union, an association of employers or an individual employer may complain to the Labour Court that a particular employer is not complying with a registered employment agreement. If, after investigating a complaint, the court is satisfied that the employer is in breach it may by order direct compliance with the agreement. Failure to comply with such an order is an offence punishable by a fine.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	698	Ireland no longer operates as a low cost location for investment; our strengths and competitive advantages have inexorably changed. High output and productivity together with high returns to labour in the form of wages, salaries and better living standards now typify Ireland's economy. The low technology production that characterised our economic output in the past is being replaced by higher technology and services enterprises. A more attractive cost environment abroad will inevitably entice some firms that are unable to generate their required return from the modern enterprise economy into which we are transforming ourselves. A continuing structural evolution of our economy is both unavoidable and necessary to maintain present levels of growth and low unemployment. Part of this evolution entails some inevitable plant transfers and other adjustments, but where relocation has occurred to date, it has largely been limited to relatively low-technology, labour-intensive activities.We have become a more sophisticated and developed economy where the application of technology and intellectual endeavour is becoming more important than simple cost competitiveness as the foundation for growth and prosperity. We now have one of the most open economies in the world where trends in world trade, global business investment and consumer decisions directly influence the pattern of economic growth, company development and job prospects in Ireland more so than probably in other developed economies. Pro-enterprise policies have helped propel economic growth and employment expansion and these have encouraged deeper and stronger links to both the enlarging EU markets and internationally. The consequent ability of entrepreneurs to operate more profitably in and from Ireland has seen both Irish enterprise and Irish society grow prosperous.To circumvent the competitive threat from lower cost competitor economies, our policy is to encourage a move to higher levels of competitiveness and value added products and services. Our focus is on the creation of sustainable employment. Such employment will be driven by companies with higher profitability that are more technologically advanced and prove a better fit with the competitive characteristics of our economy and that are consequently less likely to move on the basis of simple cost influences. We are continuing to develop those infrastructures, both physical and intellectual, to create and maintain an attractive environment for investment and expansion in Ireland. Such investment will be sourced by a combination of developing existing clients and new investors in existing or new activities or sectors. Given the critical mass of FDI in Ireland and its linkages with indigenous companies, one of the greatest potential contributions will come from developing companies already operating here. The enterprise development agencies are continuing to encourage companies into more sophisticated activities, reducing the likelihood of our competitive advantage being eroded by cost based competition.

However, if it is the case that non-national workers were paid less than Irish workers for comparable work and there are no other relevant differentiating features it may be appropriate to refer the matter to the Equality Authority for consideration under equality legislation.Furthermore, in the event that there is information provided to the effect that the workers concerned were not in receipt of the statutory minimum rates of pay set out in legislation, for the particular economic sector in which they were employed, the labour inspectorate will investigate the matter, in confidence.

This report benchmarks Ireland's competitiveness relative to our 15 main trading partners and competitors using a compendium of 170 indicators. The indicators contained in the report are published by a wide variety of international sources.The NCC expects to publish its annual competitiveness challenge later in the autumn. That document, which will draw on the findings of the annual competitiveness report, will highlight the main issues facing the Irish economy and will identify policy options to address them.The NCC provides a valuable input to the formation of Government policies through its work on competitiveness benchmarking as it highlights where the economy is strong in competitiveness terms but also warns us emerging or potential challenges. Upon publication of the competitiveness challenge the Government will give careful consideration to the policy options identified by the council.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	702	Allegations of non-compliance with labour legislation in respect of a major construction firm were raised in the House on 8 February last by Deputy Joe Higgins. Those allegations were that certain non-national construction workers were required to work excessive hours and that such workers were in receipt of pay of between €2 and €3 per hour in contravention of the statutory minimums applicable.The labour inspectorate of my Department undertook an investigation of these allegations. That investigation was completed within six weeks and required the exclusive attention of three labour inspectors under the direction of two senior members of staff. A report on the investigation was prepared and circulated to relevant parties, including the construction firm involved.Subsequently, the Department was informed that the firm proposed seeking a judicial review with regard to the investigation and inspector's report. At an interlocutory hearing a judgement was given whereby the Department was restrained from publication of the inspector's report but permitted to forward the document to relevant prosecutorial bodies. On foot of this outcome a copy of the inspector's report was sent to the Department of Social and Family Affairs, the Revenue Commissioners, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Competition Authority, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement and the Garda Commissioner.The inspector's report was quashed in the judgement that followed the full High Court hearing of the case. That decision is being appealed to the Supreme Court. Accordingly, I am unable to elaborate any further on the content of the inspector's report or offer any observations on the actions that the prosecutorial bodies, mentioned above, may be considering.I was concerned that all Turkish workers would have access to the money that had been transferred to their bank accounts in Finansbank in Amsterdam. To that end, I and my officials met with senior management from Gama Turkey and Gama Ireland, the legal advisers to Gama Turkey, and a human resources consultant, retained by Gama. At that meeting, I was assured by these senior managers, their legal adviser and the human resources consultant that all Gama workers in Ireland, past and present, would have full access to the money that had been transferred to their bank accounts in Finansbank.I contacted the president of Finansbank. He assured me that, provided the consent of the workers was forthcoming, his bank would co-operate in ensuring that my officials would have sight of relevant bank records in his bank so that they could be satisfied that all workers would have access to the money in their bank accounts. Officials from my Department travelled to Finansbank on 14 April last.Following these meetings and contacts which my officials had with SIPTU and Deputy Higgins, I am satisfied that a substantial number of Turkish workers, who were in Ireland around last April, received value for the funds that had been transferred to their personal bank accounts in Finansbank.My Department wrote to Gama Turkey's legal advisers on 29 April seeking certain details on each current and former Gama employee, including the money transferred to Finansbank and the money transferred from Finansbank to their personal bank account in Isbank in Turkey. Despite reminders to Gama Turkey's legal advisers, and engagement with a PR company engaged by Gama, this information has not been supplied to date. Accordingly, I cannot assure the Deputy that all Gama workers in Ireland, both past and present, have received value for the amounts that were transferred into their personal accounts in Finansbank.In the meantime, there were ongoing contacts between officials of my Department and the company. Matters were brought before the Labour Relations Commission and then the Labour Court. Arising from these actions substantial transfers of money were secured for workers in lieu of overtime worked.In addition, certain professional Gama workers, in respect of whom transfers were not made into Dutch bank accounts, were also awarded sums of money by the Labour Court. Many of these Turkish workers have now returned home.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	703	I have no plans to break up Shannon Development. On 28 July last, following detailed consultations with the board of the company, other stakeholders and regional interests, I announced a decision on a future mandate for Shannon Development. This new mandate envisages an active, focused role for the company, complementary to that of the national agencies, in the best interests of the economic development of the mid-west region.As I have indicated in response to previous similar Dáil questions, there have been a number of recent developments that impact on the future role of Shannon Development, the most significant of which are: the proposed relocation of the headquarters of Enterprise Ireland to Shannon as part of the decentralisation programme; the Enterprise Strategy Group recommendation that Shannon Development should disengage from industrial development functions; and the establishment of an independent Shannon Airport Authority.Discussions commenced with Shannon Development early last year and, in March 2005, the company submitted proposals for a revised strategy for the company. These proposals provided that the company would exit certain tourism and enterprise support activities and they would focus on strategic value added activities that would contribute to the economic development of the region. Following an examination of these proposals and after consultation with the company and other stakeholders, I decided on the revised mandate for the company. The main features of the new mandate are: the company will place an increased focus on the regional development aspects of its mandate and special emphasis will be placed on addressing the needs of the less-developed parts of the mid-west region; the company will retain ownership of industrial property in the Shannon region and responsibility for managing the Shannon free zone and will have responsibility for providing appropriate property solutions for both indigenous and overseas enterprises; the support functions in relation to indigenous enterprises in the Shannon region that are carried out by Shannon Development on behalf of EI will revert to EI; the IDA will assume responsibility for promoting investment in, and supporting, FDI companies in the Shannon free zone; and the company will produce a new three year corporate plan to reflect the new mandate and this will be reviewed annually.All of the interested parties in the region agree that Shannon Airport is vital to its economic well-being and that Shannon Development is ideally placed to support the new Airport Authority and to complement its activities. How this should be done will, however, have to await consideration by the Minister for Transport of the authority's business plan. Similarly, any changes to Shannon Development's tourism remit will be decided by the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism in consultation with the company.The Enterprise Strategy Group recommendation, which is now Government policy, that the company disengage from industrial development activities, which should be left to the national agencies, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland, was central to my consideration of this issue. Shannon Development supported this recommendation and other regional interests also favoured the streamlining of industrial development functions in the region.I recently met members of the board and I believe there is both support for the new mandate and energy present to implement it. Discussions between departmental officials and the executive have also commenced in this regard. I am also facilitating clarification of specific elements of the new mandate between my departmental officials and the main trade union, SIPTU.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	704	The determination of any payments due to creditors of IFI is a matter solely for the liquidator. The position of unsecured creditors can only be determined by the liquidator when all the assets of the company have been realised and all liabilities established. In this regard, I understand the liquidator has made considerable progress in realising the assets of the company and establishing the full extent of its liabilities.At this stage, the main production sites at Arklow and Cork remain the principal assets yet to be realised. Contracts have been signed for the sale of both these sites and I understand that it is hoped to close the sales in the near future. The main liability to be established at this stage relates to a claim made by the trustees of the Richardsons superannuation scheme, covering the employees in Belfast. The liquidator has accepted, in principle, that there is an admissible claim on the liquidation but the quantum of that claim remains to be established. The liquidator is engaged in discussions with the trustees of the scheme with a view to agreeing the quantum of the claim and hopes to do so in the near future.While it may take some more time to finalise all outstanding matters, I understand the liquidator hopes to be in a position to make at least an interim payment to creditors before the end of the year.

The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and its agencies, including FÁS, are expected to contribute to this reduction. In the case of FÁS a reduction of 150 from a staffing level of almost 2,400 over several years is considered appropriate and I do not propose to review the situation.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	707	I propose to take Questions Nos. 156 and 167 together.There is already a comprehensive body of employment rights legislation which has as its objective the protection of employees against arbitrary behaviour by employers, provision for the safety and health of workers and to foster labour market harmony by promoting policies that minimise conflict and maximise fairness.While recognising the exceptional situation that has arisen in the maritime sector, it is important to remember that the full panoply of Irish employment law and social protection still applies to persons employed in Ireland regardless of nationality. This body of law is, and will continue to be, enforced by my Department.Following the announcement on 12 April last there are now 31 inspector posts sanctioned for the labour inspectorate. This represents almost a doubling of the complement of inspectors in the past 12 months and is indicative of my determination to ensure compliance with employment rights legislation.Apart from the strengthening of staff resources, other initiatives are under way also. Arising from a commitment in Sustaining Progress, and to assist in the preparation of proposals for consideration by Government, a discussion document was prepared by the labour inspectorate in relation to its mandate and resourcing. The discussion document covered the full dimension of issues that impact on the operation of the labour inspectorate ranging from the legislative framework right through to the operational aspects and staff development. The discussion document has been well received among the social partners and the parties are well advanced in their consideration of the proposals that exceed 40. The objective is to formulate a set of recommendations for Government. It is intended that this process would feed into and complement any future partnership discussions.On 24 May last, I announced a programme of action in response to the report and recommendations of the review group on the role and functions of the employment rights bodies and following consultations with the various interested parties. This included the establishment of an employment rights group, ERG, comprising representatives of my Department, the employment rights bodies and the social partners. The ERG is to consider how best to simplify and streamline the complaint, appeal and enforcement procedures and documentation across all the various employment rights bodies. The ERG will also examine the extent to which common procedures and a simplified approach to the conduct of hearings-investigations can be adopted across all the bodies, leading to procedural simplification and improved customer service. Its work should be completed by the end of next year.The concerns in relation to the protection of workers' jobs, pay and conditions of employment to which the Deputies refer raise complex legal and policy issues. The Government is committed, however, to taking whatever steps are feasible, through legislation or otherwise, to develop in partnership with congress and employers, a meaningful package in the area of enhanced employment standards generally. These issues can best be advanced through dialogue in the context of the partnership process.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	708	The Labour Court is an independent statutory body that acts independently in carrying out its functions. The Deputy's question relates to an issue concerning the day-to-day operation of the court, and is one in which I have no direct function.There are two employment agreements relating to the construction sector registered with the Labour Court: (1) pensions assurance and sick pay; and (2) wages and conditions. Alleged breaches of registered employment agreements are considered by the Labour Court under procedures provided for under section 32 of the Industrial Relations Act 1946.According to the Labour Court Annual Report for 2004, the increase in referrals to the court in 2004 was mainly attributable to an increase of more than 75% in the number of complaints alleging non-compliance with the registered employment agreements for the construction industry on pension, assurance and sick pay. This has resulted from increased monitoring of the level of adherence to the agreement by both union and employer bodies in that industry.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	710	The process of comprehensively addressing the research and development agenda was commenced by this Government under the current National Development Plan, NDP, 2000-2006. Within the current NDP, STI has become a major plank of this Government's policy, underpinned by very significant resources. The importance of ensuring greater coherence in the development of the overall national system of innovation and the value of a whole of Government approach has also been recognised by this Government. A cabinet sub-committee for STI, serviced by an interdepartmental committee, is fully operational and active.Achievements have been made. Ireland is now in a period of catching up. Real annual average growth in gross expenditure on research and development, GERD, for Ireland was 4.5% for 2001-03 rising to 4.8% for 2003-05. In GNP terms the ratio for GERD to GNP has risen from 1.3% in 2001 to 1.45% in 2005.However, this is not yet commensurate with our ambitions to develop as a knowledge-based economy. The publication of Building Ireland’s Knowledge Economy last year set out the challenges. The response to that document is being prepared by my Department, in association with other relevant Departments in the interdepartmental committee on STI, and I will shortly be bringing forward a strategy on STI to 2013, which will drive this agenda forward.As the Deputy will be aware, the Lisbon Agenda is aimed at making Europe more competitive and innovative on the world stage. There are very significant challenges ahead. Science, technology and innovation in Ireland is still under developed by comparison with our key global competitors and challenges are increasing from locations such as China, Singapore and South Korea. Recent work by the EU Commission has provided a timely review of progress towards achieving the Lisbon objectives and provides a sobering reminder of the challenge that faces us all in our efforts to drive investment in research and development and innovation.We need to make the next quantum leap forward. Making that vision a reality requires strategic investment. We will continue to work to ensure that, within the next decade, Ireland becomes internationally renowned for our research, generating and using new knowledge for economic and social progress to the benefit of all.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	711	As I advised the House in my reply to a previous question, the core recommendation of the Consumer Strategy Group is that a new statutory body, the national consumer agency, be established to be an advocate on behalf of consumers. The Government fully approved this recommendation and has agreed to establish the new agency as soon as practicable.The establishment of the NCA will require primary legislation. My Department has already commenced the necessary preliminary legislative and organisational work to ensure that the NCA is established as soon as possible. I am conscious, however, that establishing the new agency may take some time. For that reason, with the approval of the Government, I recently appointed a board to the national consumer agency to act in an interim capacity until such time as the agency is established on a statutory footing. The board, which is comprised of a chairperson and 12 other members, has held three meetings to date.Given its non-statutory status, the interim board does not have any staff itself. It does, however, have the assistance of Forfás in carrying out its activities. Forfás has assigned 4.5 staff to assist the interim board in this regard. This number will increase considerably in 2006 to cater for the significant increase in activities which the interim board intends to undertake in the course of next year.With regard to the numbers of staff that the NCA might have when formally established, it is not possible to give a precise estimate of that number at this stage. It is the case, however, that one of the interim board's priority tasks is to prepare a detailed estimate of staffing, resource and budget requirements of a fully operational and statutory based national consumer agency.I very much welcome the Government's decision to approve the establishment of a national consumer agency. I am certain the agency will have a key role in advocating the consumer case and in the development of future consumer policy. I am also of the view that the appointment of an interim board until the NCA is formally established is most important. The interim board will ensure that the momentum of the Consumer Strategy Group's report is maintained, that the consumer's voice will be heard and that the construction of a fully operational NCA can begin.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	712	Job losses in the manufacturing sector are of ongoing concern and the Government is doing all in its power to create structures through its enterprise development and training agencies, which will facilitate those who have lost jobs to gain new ones, particularly ones that offer more opportunity both in terms of skills and permanence.Ireland has a predominantly modern manufacturing base which competes in a range of growth sectors. However, as with most other European countries, there are areas of activity in which Ireland's competitiveness is seriously challenged. In the main, these are in areas where the availability of lower cost locations is making cost the primary driver behind business decision making. It is inevitable that the investment decisions of some companies will be influenced by the competitive attractions of alternative geographic locations. Our focus is firmly concentrated on managing the current transition with the best possible blend of policies to strengthen both national and firm level competitiveness.Manufacturing has been a key driver of prosperity across the economy for many years and enterprise policies will continue to emphasise the strategic importance of the sector to future economic growth. The Enterprise Strategy Group, ESG, recognised the importance of the sector in providing a foundation of skills and technologies on which to build a high performance, high value added and technologically orientated manufacturing sector into the future.My objective and that of the Government is to ensure that our economy remains a globally competitive, profitable and secure location for business. We can best help enterprise, including the manufacturing sector, by continuing to implement policies that are pro business and by implementing the right balance of enterprise supports and at the right time to help business. When provided with the best supporting and competitive environment, business and industry will develop to capitalise on investment and growth opportunities. It is the Government's intention to enable enterprise growth by policies tailored to address the competitive pressures transforming the global economy.A key element of the Government's strategy to help enterprise is to encourage increased levels of investment in research, business related technological development and innovation across all enterprise sectors. These increased levels will assist firms to produce improved products and services with added value. In the longer term, this approach will provide both more sustainable and higher quality jobs.While there has been a decrease in the number of jobs in manufacturing in recent times, there is consistent growth in job numbers in other areas. The most recent quarterly national household survey published by the Central Statistics Office on 14 September 2005 shows that there were 2,014,800 persons in the labour force, which represents an annual increase of 94,500 or 4.9%. This is the highest year on year increase since the survey began.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	713	The growth in employment by 93,000 in the year to the second quarter of 2005 is the highest annual growth rate recorded in five years. Full-time employment increased by 72,500 — males, 39,200 and females, 33,300. Part-time employment increased by 20,600 — males, 5,800 and females, 14,800 — compared with 6,000 in the same period last year. Overall, since 1997, full-time employment has increased from 1,215,000 to 1,597,500 while part-time employment has increased from 252,700 to 331,700.The construction and financial-business services sectors accounted for more than 50% of the employment growth. Across all sectors, practically every occupational category experienced an increase in employment with the largest increases in the craft, clerical and secretarial occupations.The latest quarterly economic commentary from the ESRI has indicated that the growth rates in employment, as well as sustained economic growth, have had a significant positive impact on incomes. The reporting of tax receipts is the responsibility of the Minister for Finance.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	714	I visited Kerry on 21 July 2005 with officials from my Department and the State development agencies. During the course of this visit I met the Kenmare Chamber of Commerce, and representative organisations and businesses in Caherciveen, Killorglin and Killarney. Wide-ranging discussions were held concerning economic development in the region.IDA's strategy for Kerry is to win high value investments in the international services, engineering and ICT sectors. IDA Ireland is pursuing this strategy within the NSS, which has designated Tralee and Killarney as linked hubs. While I may give general policy directives to the agency under the Industrial Development Acts, I am precluded from giving directives regarding individual undertakings or from giving preference to one area over others.However, I am informed that IDA Ireland is actively marketing the region. At the end of 2004, there were 2,022 people in permanent employment in 21 IDA supported companies in the county. The agency has now completed site development works on its business and technology park at Tiernaboul in Killarney. The site area totals 4.66 hectares and the work involved significant landscaping, access development and site clearance. This work has cost in the region of €1 million. A local group of business people have completed a new building of 14,716 sq.ft. on a site acquired from IDA on the this park. IDA is also actively marketing the Kerry technology park adjacent to the institute of technology in Tralee and the Listowel development centre.In addition to targeting potential new projects, the agency is also working with its existing portfolio of companies in the region, with a view to supporting such companies with potential expansions and diversification of activities.It is my intention to visit the Tralee and north Kerry area as soon as my departmental and parliamentary commitments permit and I look forward to discussion with the local chambers of commerce and other interested groups about employment prospects specifically and economic development generally in the region.

#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	727	My Department does not directly fund or co-ordinate health and personal social services to victims of abuse. Moneys are made available each year, formerly through the health boards, and now through the Health Service Executive, for the provision of services to women victims of violence. In recent years there has been a substantial increase in funding so that now more than €12 million is provided annually for the provision of such services. The distribution of this funding is a matter for the Health Service Executive.The determination as to whether services should be provided by Health Service Executive employees or by the voluntary sector is also a matter for the Health Service Executive.My Department has requested that the parliamentary affairs division of Health Service Executive reply directly to the Deputy on the matters raised in his question.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	737	I propose to take Questions Nos. 196 and 197 together.National population based screening programmes for cancer are only considered where clear evidence exists of the benefit to the whole population to be screened. Population based screening programmes for cervical screening have demonstrated their efficacy internationally. A pilot cervical screening programme commenced in October 2000 and is available to eligible women resident in the HSE mid-western region. Under the programme, cervical screening is being offered, free of charge, to approximately 74,000 women in these three counties in the 25 to 60 age group, at five year intervals. I am committed to the national roll out of the cervical screening programme in line with international best practice.An international expert examined the feasibility and implications of a national roll out of a cervical screening programme. The examination included an evaluation of the current pilot programme, quality assurance, laboratory capacity and organisation and the establishment of national governance arrangements. Following the publication of this report my Department undertook a consultative process with relevant professional and advocacy stakeholders. The consultative process is completed and my Department will now discuss options for the roll out of the programme with the Health Service Executive, including indicative timeliness.
#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	738	I propose to take Questions Nos. 198 to 204, inclusive, and 208 and 209 together.It is the intention of the Department to put in place a more robust regulatory system as quickly as possible to protect vulnerable older people and to provide for the highest possible standards of care for older people in long-stay facilities.It is intended that the Health Bill 2005 will establish both the HIQA and the SSI on a statutory basis and will contain provisions to underpin a more robust inspectorial system. The Nursing Homes (Care and Welfare) Regulations 1993, made under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990, set out the standards to which private nursing homes must adhere. The Health Service Executive carries out inspections in private nursing homes. In the context of the Health Bill 2005, the process has begun to review the current system with a view to strengthening the powers available to those involved in inspecting facilities and to extend a strengthened inspection system to public facilities.It is also intended that the Bill will provide for the setting and monitoring of standards for residential facilities for older people. To this end, the Department has commenced a review of the Nursing Homes (Care and Welfare) Regulations 1993, and will be working in conjunction with the HSE, the SSI and other relevant bodies, with the intention of developing a new set of standards that would apply to all residential services for older people.The Department is also working on primary legislation to expand the policies and principles of the subvention scheme to facilitate implementation of the scheme by the HSE throughout the country, and it is the intention to bring this legislation before the Oireachtas in the near future. It is also intended to increase the thresholds contained in the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations 1993. These thresholds have not been updated since being set in 1993 and increasing them will render an increased number of people eligible for subvention.

However, persons presenting with eating disorders are generally treated through the local psychiatric services. Outpatient psychiatric services are provided from a network of hospitals, health centres, day hospitals and day centres.Under the new Disability Act, the definition of disability is based on the degree of disability and not on the type of illness. This means that all severe and enduring, or chronic, mental illnesses would be covered. It is most likely therefore that the severity of the eating disorder and the patient's prognosis would determine eligibility for services under the Act.An expert group on mental health policy is preparing a new national framework for the further modernisation of the mental health services, updating the 1984 policy document Planning for the Future. The expert group has a number of sub-groups looking at specialist issues in mental health services, including the development of services and facilities for the treatment of eating disorders. The report of the expert group is expected to be published early in 2006.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	744	In 2004 the Irish Blood Transfusion Service invested more than €3 million in the refurbishment of its Cork centre to ensure compliance with good manufacturing practice standards. As the House was informed last April, there is provision in the Capital Investment Framework 2005 — 2009 for the appointment of a design team and commencement of the planning process for a new Cork centre. This project is the subject of ongoing consultations between the IBTS and my Department.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	745	The Health and Social Care Professionals Bill 2004 provides for the establishment of a system of statutory registration for certain health and social care professionals, including psychologists, whether they are employed in the public service, the private health sector or are self employed. Under section 38, responsibility for the approval of qualifications attesting to the standard of proficiency required for registration will rest with the psychologists' registration board to be established under the Bill.The qualifications referred to by the Deputy are those listed for existing practitioners as part of the transitional arrangements set out in the Bill for their registration. These arrangements will apply for a period of two years from the establishment of a register and include the provision that practitioners who hold a stated qualification and who have been in practice at any time during a period of five years before the establishment of a register shall be granted registration. A practitioner must also satisfy the registration board that he or she is a fit and proper person to engage in the practice of that profession.The stated qualification for psychologists under the transitional arrangements for the registration of existing practitioners is a recognised university degree or diploma obtained with first or second class honours in which psychology was taken as a major subject and honours obtained in that subject. As indicated by the Deputy, this does not reflect the current qualifications required of persons recruited as psychologists within the public health service as, since 2002, psychologists recruited to the public health service have been required to hold a post graduate qualification.The qualification set out in the Bill for psychologists under the transitional arrangements is instead designed to take proper account of those practitioners previously recruited to the public health service and also those who are practising elsewhere who may not hold a post graduate qualification.The current provisions in the Bill for the registration of practising psychologists are appropriate in the context of a transitional period and having regard to arrangements in the public health service prior to 2002. I am conscious that any registrant — whether registered under the transitional provisions or otherwise — who does not meet the standard of proficiency and competence expected of registered professionals will be subject to the complaints, inquiries and disciplinary procedures set out in the Bill. The Bill represents a significant step forward in the protection of the public.

On the basis of advice from the office of the Attorney General, my Department instructed the former health boards to immediately cease charging all fully eligible persons in receipt of in-patient services in publicly funded long stay institutions with effect from 9 December 2004.The decision to limit repayments to the estates of those who died in the past six years reflects the reference in the Supreme Court judgment to the Statute of Limitations, "the State has available to it a defence of the Statue of Limitations, i.e. a 6 year limit". The Government has had regard to what the Supreme Court said about the Statute of Limitations in order to limit the scale of total repayments which today's taxpayer must fund and I am satisfied the scheme strikes a fair balance. The date 10 December 1998 is six years prior to 9 December 2004.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	767	Under the Health Act 2004, which established the Health Service Executive on 1 January 2005, the HSE is responsible for managing and delivering, or arranging to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. Therefore, it is responsible for the provision of neurology services.The Comhairle report on neurology and neurophysiology, which was published in April 2003, recommended significant enhancement of such services, including the appointment of consultants in Limerick. Following the publication of the report, my predecessor, Deputy Martin, endorsed the report's recommendations and wrote to the health boards to urge them to progress the recommendations as the funding available permitted. Additional revenue funding was made available in 2005 to support the development of neurology and neurophysiology services in a number of regions, including the mid-west, having regard to agreed priorities. As the continuing development of such services is a matter for the HSE, having regard to available funding, accordingly, the Department of Health and Children will ask the parliamentary affairs division of the HSE to arrange to have the matter investigated and for a reply to issue directly to the Deputy.

Patients in the north west, including Sligo, are being referred for radiation oncology treatment to the recently commissioned radiation oncology department at University College Hospital Galway and to St. Luke's Hospital in Dublin. The new radiation oncology centre, which is being provided at Beaumont Hospital on the north side of Dublin city as part of the national radiation oncology services network, will cater for the needs of patients in the north-west, including Sligo. The precise patient referral pattern, which will be a matter for the Health Service Executive, will be factored into the planning of the national network.The Government is considering the option of facilitating access for patients in the north-west, mainly County Donegal, to radiation oncology services as part of North-South co-operation on cancer. I have met the Minister for Health for Northern Ireland, Mr. Shaun Woodward MP, to discuss access by patients mainly in the north-west to radiation oncology services in Belfast City Hospital. A state-of-the-art facility is scheduled to open in Belfast in March 2006. I will meet the Northern Ireland Minister, Mr. Woodward, again to make further progress on the Government's position on radiation oncology. Officials from the Department of Health and Children will soon meet officials from the Northern Ireland Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety.

Family expenditure covers the nominated adult, his or her spouse, including a person with whom he or she is living as husband or wife, and children under the age of 18. Dependants over the age of 18 and under the age of 23 who are in full-time education may also be included. A dependant with a physical disability or a mental handicap or illness who cannot maintain himself or herself fully and does not hold a current medical card may be included in the family expenditure under the scheme. I have no plans to amend the conditions of the scheme.
#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	774	The general labelling of foodstuffs in this country is controlled under the European Communities (Labelling, Presentation and Advertising of Foodstuffs) Regulations 2002 to 2005. The regulations apply to the labelling of pre-packaged foodstuffs for sale to the ultimate consumer or for supply to mass caterers. The principle underlying food labelling is that the purchaser must not be misled. Therefore, pre-packaged food sold at markets is not exempt from the labelling requirements which apply to such food sold by other means. However, foodstuffs sold loose — without pre-packaging — such as olives sold from drums or cheese sliced at the request of the consumer need only indicate the name of the food, either on the label or displayed on a notice near the food.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	784	The Government has agreed the key elements of a scheme for the repayment of long stay charges for publicly funded residential care. The full details of the scheme have yet to be finalised. Those who were charged and are still alive and the estates of all those who were charged and died in the six years prior to 9 December 2004 will have the charges repaid in full. The scheme will not allow for repayments to be made to the estates of those who died more than six years before that date. The repayments will include the actual charge paid and an amount to take account of inflation, using the consumer price index, in the time since the person in question was charged.The HSE has informed the Department of Health and Children that an outside company with experience in handling mass claims will be engaged by the end of the month to provide an independent input into the design and administration of the scheme. I intend to bring legislation before the Oireachtas in the next parliamentary session. Repayments should commence shortly after the Bill is approved and signed into law.

#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	786	I intend to bring a motion before the Oireachtas tomorrow seeking approval for the ratification by Ireland of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. The convention is an initiative of the World Health Organisation in response to the global epidemic of tobacco addiction. The treaty, which was adopted unanimously by the World Health Assembly in May 2003 and signed by Ireland in September 2003, provides an agreed approach to tobacco control at a global level. It will be the first binding international treaty that addresses all aspects of tobacco control, including the traditional health interventions such as advertising and sponsorship bans, passive smoking and retail licensing, economic and trade issues such as taxation policy, international trade and smuggling and other areas such as product specification and issues of compensation and liability.Ireland, which is a strong advocate of effective tobacco control policies and the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, has consistently pressed certain policies nationally and internationally to protect public health and reduce deaths from tobacco related illnesses. Ratification by 40 states is necessary to enable the treaty to come into force. This figure was achieved at the end of last year. Ireland is committed to effective tobacco control policies. Its smoke-free workplace initiative, which commenced in March 2004, has drawn favourable comment from public health authorities throughout the world as an effective public health instrument in tackling the negative health effects of tobacco smoking. A number of other jurisdictions are using the Irish experience as a basis for health interventions of a similar nature.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	787	The Department of Health and Children is working closely with the Health Service Executive to develop a parliamentary affairs division, under the chief executive, to distribute parliamentary questions and to track them within the HSE to the point of reply. The HSE's parliamentary affairs division, which commenced operations at the beginning of April when a central office was established, has done a great deal of good work to date in devising and implementing the arrangements for dealing with parliamentary questions within the wider HSE. I am satisfied that the HSE is continuing to develop its structures and its capacity for dealing with parliamentary affairs as a matter of priority. It is fully committed to enhancing its performance in providing timely replies to Members of the Oireachtas. I have been advised by the parliamentary affairs division of the HSE that a reply was recently issued in respect of the question referred to by the Deputy. I regret that the HSE did not reply, in this instance, at an earlier date. The Department will be bringing this delay to the attention of the HSE.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	788	The Department of Health and Children has been advised that following wide consultation, and with support from the chief ambulance officers of the former health boards, the patient report form that is in use by the ambulance sector in the Dublin area was produced by the chief fire officer of Dublin Fire Brigade, SIPTU, ATGWU and the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council, which is the association of ambulance personnel. The council's principal remit is the development of standards in pre-hospital emergency care and the accreditation of institutions which provide training to ambulance personnel.The purpose of the form is to provide accurate, robust and timely data on the continuum of care to the patient between the pre-hospital emergency care provider and the receiving health care professionals in hospitals. The Department has been advised by the council that the information collected is similar to that collected by other pre-hospital emergency care services around the world, including those in the UK, USA and Australia. The Department has referred the Deputy's question to the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council for a more detailed reply.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	789	As I have previously indicated in the House, appropriate transport arrangements for patients requiring radiotherapy should be made available, where necessary, by the Health Service Executive. The Department of Health and Children asked the HSE last May to ensure that appropriate transport arrangements are put in place on a national basis for patients who are required to travel to obtain radiotherapy. Transport solutions are a feature of the current provision of radiation oncology services. The Department has asked the HSE to advise the Deputy directly about current and proposed transport arrangements for radiation oncology patients throughout the country.Last July, I announced the Government's plan for a national network of radiation oncology services to be put in place by 2011 and commencing in 2008. The network will consist of four large centres in Dublin, Cork and Galway and two integrated satellite centres at Waterford Regional Hospital and Limerick Regional Hospital. The Government considers that the best option in terms of improving geographic access for patients in the north-western area is to facilitate access for those patients to radiation oncology services as part of North-South co-operation on cancer. Appropriate transport arrangements will form part of the planning and implementation of this plan, given the significant increase in capacity involved. The national radiation oncology co-ordinating group advises the Department and the HSE on radiotherapy. In that light and given that under the Health Act 2004, the HSE is responsible for the management and delivery of health and personal social services, the group does not intend to prepare a specific report on transport. The group, which has met three times this year, is finalising quality standards for the provision of radiation oncology services for public patients. I expect the standards to be submitted to me shortly.

GP visit cards will be granted to individuals and families based on income guidelines 25% over the medical card income guidelines. However, the Health Service Executive, HSE, has discretion to grant a GP visit card to persons whose income is in excess of the guidelines but for whom, in the opinion of the HSE, it would be unduly burdensome to meet the cost of general practitioner services.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	805	I propose to take Questions Nos. 278 to 280, inclusive, together.The vaccine is available free of charge from general practitioners to medical cardholders who are deemed to be at risk of serious illness as a result of contracting the disease. Persons in the at risk group who do not have a medical card can obtain the vaccine free of charge but the fee for administering the vaccine in such cases is a matter between the general practitioner and the patient. The at risk groups include persons aged 65 years or older, those with specific chronic illness such as chronic heart, lung or kidney disease, and those with a suppressed immune system. For persons in the at risk groups, complications arising from influenza such as pneumonia are common and can be fatal particularly in the elderly.Private patients who request flu vaccine and are not in the at risk group receive a prescription from their general practitioner and purchase the vaccine from a pharmacy for administration by the general practitioner. All flu vaccinations should be given either by a general practitioner or under their supervision. It is the decision of the general practitioner to determine what administration fee will be charged when a person does not have a medical card. I expect the new GP visit cards to benefit, among others, older people on modest incomes who have not yet reached 70, at which age they are automatically entitled to a medical card. People in the 65 to 69 year age bracket, and who are therefore at risk from influenza, and holding a medical card or a GP visit card, will in future be able to receive the influenza vaccine free of charge from general practitioners who hold a contract under the general medical services scheme.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	807	Garda vetting services are available in respect of public health service employees with substantial unsupervised access to children and vulnerable adults, including employees of agencies funded by the Health Service Executive. In line with the recommendations of the working group on Garda vetting, it is planned that all organisations that recruit and select persons who would have substantial unsupervised access to children should avail — and should be entitled to avail — of the vetting services of the Garda central vetting unit. To this end, the number of staff employed in the central vetting unit run by the Garda Síochána is being doubled to ensure that they can handle a greater volume of requests from employers. The further expansion of the service will allow the vetting of volunteers. The unit will commence the augmentation of its existing vetting arrangements upon its decentralisation which is targeted from mid-November this year.Ensuring the protection, health and welfare of children and other vulnerable people is a key concern for the Government and I think it is important in that context to make one further point. While criminal record checking of people with substantial unsupervised access to children is a vital component of a well developed child protection system, there are other elements. Good recruitment and employment practices and the checking of references are also an integral part of such a system.

The total cost of the purchase was €1.5 million, including VAT. The premises has not been sold and is being considered for alternative Government use. There are no charges involved in holding the premises, however since the purchase, minimal works have been carried out to ensure the maintenance and security of the premises while it is unoccupied.

Planning permission will be applied for when a site has been formally acquired. A firm estimate of the cost of constructing the decentralised office for the Department of Education and Science will only become available when the construction tendering process has been completed. At this point in time, the latest decentralisation implementation group report of June 2005 specifies an indicative timeframe of building completion to be second quarter 2008.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	812	I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that three stamping services are provided in the stamp office in Dublin Castle — two dealing with personal callers and the third a postal service. Instruments presented by personal callers for over-the-counter stamping are, subject to the documentation being correct, processed immediately at the time of presentation. For those personal callers who do not require immediate processing, a drop-in service is provided with a five day turnaround. A postal stamping service is also available to deal with instruments originating within the geographic areas for which the Dublin stamping district has responsibility. I am also informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the operation of the Dublin Castle stamping service is constantly monitored and reviewed by the Dublin stamping district management at regular periods throughout each day. This is an extremely busy and highly pressurised office as staff deal with increasing volumes of often very complex legal instruments. For example, the volume of such instruments processed by this office in the first nine months of 2005 was up by 27% over the equivalent period last year.Every attempt is made to provide an efficient service to solicitors, their agents and the public, having regard to the number of available stamping machines and staff resources, and delays are kept to an absolute minimum. However, delays can sometimes occur, particularly when a large number of personal callers attend the office — all seeking to have their instruments stamped over the counter. In such instances, callers are encouraged to use the five day drop-in service in order to avoid waiting, but many choose to wait for same day stamping. I am assured that the Revenue Commissioners will continue to monitor their Dublin stamp office customer service performance to ensure it consistently achieves its service standards.

The temporary relocation of the Garda station will not proceed as the costs involved cannot be justified due to the prohibitive level of State expenditure required for a short-term relocation. In the meantime, preparations for the planning and procurement of the replacement station are at an advanced stage.

OPW normally requires a local authority wishing to advance a flood protection scheme to, at a minimum, provide detailed information on the flooding risk and its impacts with an engineering assessment of the most likely causes and possible solutions, before it decides whether it should be further involved with the matter.

The overall objective is to ensure that property being acquired at a regional level is matched as closely as possible, both in time and in cost terms, by the disposal of property held in the Dublin region, whether held on lease or otherwise. No decisions have been made yet on the disposal, retention or re-allocation of office buildings in Dublin, post decentralisation. The Office of Public Works will bear in mind the particular requirements of Departments remaining in Dublin and the need to ensure that all office space remaining in Dublin is utilised in the most cost effective manner possible.Civil and public servants who do not wish to transfer to a decentralised location will be assigned to an alternative public service post in Dublin. Each individual will be able to indicate via his or her personnel section the organisations remaining in Dublin which would interest them. As people are appointed from the central applications facility to decentralising locations, vacancies become available in Dublin and these posts will be available to be filled by people who wish to remain in Dublin. Consultations will be held with the public service unions on an ongoing basis to address the concerns of all staff affected by the programme.

All applicants will be invited to sit a written test scheduled for early-mid December 2005. Applicants who qualify in the written test will be placed in an order of merit based on their qualifying marks. Interviews will be held in January 2006 confined to a group of the highest qualifiers, and successful candidates will undergo a six week training process in the February-March period before taking up their posts with the Department of Transport as contract driver testers. In view of the statutorily independent role of the Public Appointments Service, I am not in a position to comment on cases of applicants.

It is understood that the main findings of the survey will be made available to my Department and the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance and the Public Service shortly.As the Deputy is aware, the financial regulator's consumer director has encouraged people to come forward if they are concerned about the possibility of having been mis-sold an endowment mortgage. The financial regulator has emphasised the importance of bringing complaints, in the first instance, to the financial institution from which the policy was purchased to seek to resolve the matter.As I stated in my reply to the Deputy on 28 September last, there are no plans at present to amend the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Act 2004, with regard to the time limit for making complaints to the Financial Services Ombudsman. The retrospection limit of six years was put in place following careful examination in the context of the consideration of the 2004 Act. It is consistent with best practice standards, including the approach adopted for the Pensions Ombudsman Scheme.

The monitoring committee ceased to exist when it was subsequently decided that the recommendations of the review group could better be pursued within the broader context of the then Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs on the White Paper on a Framework for Supporting Voluntary Activity and for Developing the Relationship between the State and the Community and Voluntary sector, rather than via a separate committee. The White Paper was published in 2000; responsibility for its implementation now rests with the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	824	The Government decided in May 2004 to reform construction procurement to help ensure that taxpayers are protected from the financial consequences of unnecessary delays and, in turn, cost over runs on capital projects. At the heart of the reforms is an attempt to ensure cost effective and timely delivery of capital projects. The aim of the new contracts is to help ensure that there is a fair sharing of risks and that contractors take on those risks that they are able to manage and control. New conditions for the employment of construction consultants are designed to ensure that professional fees do not escalate with project costs.A suite of four new standard forms of construction contract and new conditions for the engagement of construction consultants have been drafted with input from the Government contracts committee for construction and technical support from legal drafters and external technical expertise. A process of consultation with the construction industry on the draft contracts and related material is in train and, following final completion of this process, my intention is to have the new contracts available for use in early 2006.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	825	The position is that the VAT rating of goods and services is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply. Under the sixth VAT directive, member states may retain the zero rates on goods and services which were in place on 1 January 1991, but cannot extend the zero rate to new goods and services. As children's car seats were not subject to the zero rate on 1 January 1991 it is not possible to apply the zero rate to the supply of such products. However, member states are permitted to apply a reduced rate to those goods and services, which are set out in annex H of the EU sixth VAT directive. Children's car seats are listed under category 4 in annex H. It would therefore be possible to apply a reduced rate of VAT to children's car seats. Ireland operates a single reduced rate of 13.5%.In relation to the benefit of a VAT reduction being passed on to the consumer which is normally the main reason given for VAT reductions or refunds, experience shows that there is no guarantee that moving products to the reduced rate would necessarily be reflected in the retail price of products. In addition, a reduction along the lines suggested would only bring about a reduction of approximately €6 for every €100 spent on a child car seat. Therefore such a reduction, even if passed on, would not necessarily bring about an increase in the sales of new car seats.Finally, it is not customary for me to comment on any possible changes to the VAT rate applied to such products which may, or may not, arise in the context of the forthcoming budget.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	827	Recruitment to the Civil Service is governed by the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act 2004 which applies to the recruitment of non-industrial civil servants to established and unestablished posts.Recruitment of State industrial employees is carried out by individual Departments by way of competitive interview depending on specific needs and the nature of the employment position on offer. Applications are received from individuals, and on behalf of individuals from, for instance, FÁS and public representatives.In respect of the recruitment of civil servants to established and unestablished posts, the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act 2004 provides for the establishment of the Commission for Public Service Appointments, CPSA, and of the Public Appointments Service, PAS.Among its functions, the CPSA establishes the standards of probity, equity, fairness, selection on the basis of merit, protection of the public interest, implementation of best practice and good governance and other principles as it considers appropriate, to be followed, in the selection and recruitment of persons for positions in the Civil Service and other public bodies. The standards are set out in codes of practice to be followed in recruitment to positions in the Civil Service. The CPSA also has responsibility for the issuing of recruitment licences to the Secretaries General of Departments of State and to other designated officers in the public service.The PAS provides a centralised recruitment, assessment and selection body for the Civil Service and provides a similar service, where requested, to the local authorities and health boards, the Garda Síochána and any other public service body.Recruitment competitions run by the PAS are advertised in one or more of the national papers and on its website at www.publicjobs.ie. Application forms, together with all relevant details, are only available when competitions are announced. Potential candidates can register their interest in a position on the PAS website and will be notified by e-mail when the competition is announced. Anyone can apply for a position in the Civil Service but candidates must fulfil the eligibility requirements and criteria of the grade or post being filled.Under the Act, recruitment to the Civil Service is to established posts, unestablished posts and to posts covered by Schedule 1 of the Act. Recruitment to established posts is carried out under licence as set out above. All temporary posts in the Civil Service are filled on an unestablished basis. Recruitment to unestablished posts takes place under licence but may also be the subject of an excluding order. The Act provides for the issuing to Departments by the CPSA of an excluding order for a limited period, for the filling of certain positions on a temporary basis, on conditions other than those set out in the codes of practice.Schedule 1 of the Act — Scheduled Occupations — covers appointments to posts such as services officer, services attendant, night-watchman, cleaner or analogous employment in the Civil Service. The Schedule also covers employment outside the State in a clerical or ancillary capacity in offices of the Department of Foreign Affairs. Recruitment under Schedule 1 is carried out by individual Departments by way of competitive process. Applications may be made directly by individuals, through registration with FÁS or as result of communications from public representatives.As regards provisions in relation to canvassing, section 34(2) of the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act 2004 stipulates that the Public Appointments Service is independent in the exercise of its functions. The Act also provides that, inter alia, canvassing is an offence attracting penalties including fines of up to €10,000 and-or imprisonment for up to two years. Anti-canvassing provisions are also expressly set out in section 4 of the CPSA code of practice on external recruitment for appointment to positions in the Civil Service.

On the basis of this assumption, it is tentatively estimated that the full year cost of refundable tax credits to income earners who are charged tax at or below the standard rate, including those who are exempt, would be in the region of €461 million.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	829	This is a matter for the Departments directly concerned in the first instance — variously the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Social and Family Affairs and Health and Children. The cost to the Exchequer of two weeks' paternity leave would depend on the model involved, for example, whether it would be PRSI based, the take-up and whether it would be at full pay or whether there would be a contribution.There is no statutory entitlement to paid paternity leave in this country. The Civil Service provides three days' paid paternity leave on the birth or adoption of a child. In 2003 approximately 300 fathers in the Civil Service availed of paternity leave. Based on these figures the cost of two weeks' paid paternity leave on full pay in the Civil Service would be in the region of €1million per year. Additional costs would arise if the officers concerned were replaced.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	831	The following table sets out the net yield from DIRT collected from 1997 to 2004:Year€m1997187.61998238.71999161.22000386.0*2001228.02002206.02003153.02004144.0* The figure quoted for 2000 includes €215.7 million which was a result of the DIRT look-back audits.The amount of DIRT due to be paid each year is dependent on the amount of moneys on deposit and the rates of interest applying to such deposits rather than on the number of accounts involved. I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the statutory return of DIRT filed by the financial institutions requires details only of the relevant amount of interest paid in the year and the appropriate tax in relation to the payment of that interest. Such DIRT returns are subject to audit by the Revenue Commissioners.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	832	I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the most recent relevant information available is that the total amount of DIRT repaid in 2004 was €2.1 million and the number of such repayments was 1,003.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	833	I advised by the Revenue Commissioners that some 36,000 income earners are estimated to qualify for the age exemption or the associated marginal relief in 2005. This figure is provisional and likely to be revised. A married couple who has elected or has been deemed to have elected for joint assessment is counted as one tax unit.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	834	I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the most recent data available on incomes and tax by income decile are in respect of the income tax year 2002.The information requested is set out in the following tables for the income tax years 1997-98, 1998-99, 2001 "short" year and 2002.The 2001 short income tax year was a short transitional tax "year" running from 6 April to 31 December 2001 which preceded the first full calendar tax year 1 January 2002 to 31 December 2002. It should be noted that as PAYE taxpayers were charged to tax on their earnings in the period from 6 April to 31 December 2001 and self-employed taxpayers were assessed to tax for the short "year" on 74% of the profits earned in a 12 month accounting period, the income figures will not be directly comparable with those of earlier or later years.To assemble the figures by decile the total number of income earners on the income tax record for each year was broken down into ten equal groups and distributed over ten income ranges in ascending order of gross income. The figures for effective tax rate and aggregate tax liability were then established for each decile group as appropriate. As both the income levels and the numbers of income earners changed each year the income tranches representing the different deciles also vary from year to year. It should be noted that the tax liability in any of the income deciles shown also includes a liability to DIRT. In the lower deciles, this is likely to be the only tax liability arising.The income ranges referred to in this examination relate to gross income. Gross income is income which: is prior to deductions for capital allowances, interest paid, losses, allowable expenses, retirement annuities etc; is after deduction of superannuation contributions by employees but not by the self-employed; includes income of individuals whose total income falls below the exemption limits; does not include certain other income which is not income for tax purposes or is exempt from tax such as profits or gains from stallion fees, profits from commercial forestry and certain income from patent royalties, certain investment income arising from personal injuries, child benefit, maternity benefit and unemployment assistance paid by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, certain earnings of writers, composers and artists, bonus or interest paid under instalment savings schemes operated by An Post, interest on certain Government securities, certain foreign pensions which are exempt from tax in the foreign paying country, portion of certain lump sums received by employees on cessation of their employment, statutory redundancy payments and certain military pensions; and does not include or not fully include other income sources such as interest income that does not need to be declared or is not recorded, but from which tax has been deducted, unemployment benefit and disability benefit, non-recording of non-taxable amounts and of amounts taxed by restriction of repayments or indirectly through employers in the PAYE system, and the incomes of certain self-employed persons, including some farmers, as well as some individuals in receipt of pensions, who are not processed annually on tax records because their incomes are below the income tax thresholds. The information on incomes is based on income returns on Revenue records at the time the data were compiled for analytical purposes, representing 90% or more of all returns expected.A married couple who has elected or has been deemed to have elected for joint assessment is counted as one tax unit.1997-19981998-199920012002Income Decile Group *Effective Tax RateTaxEffective Tax RateTaxEffective Tax RateTaxEffective Tax RateTax%€m%€m%€m%€m10.10.10.10.20.10.30.10.520.52.80.53.00.11.00.11.435.758.75.157.71.622.30.713.048.8129.58.1132.44.483.13.389.9512.0227.611.1233.76.6159.15.7196.7614.6345.413.6358.28.3245.97.6321.6717.7520.216.9551.910.7388.19.6504.1820.5767.819.5812.513.8626.113.0856.0922.11,099.921.21,175.316.2979.516.21,409.11029.02,850.728.73,315.524.63,156.023.64,415.26,002.96,640.35,661.47,807.4* The lowest incomes are represented by group number 1.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	836	The Public Appointments Service, PAS, acts as the centralised recruitment, assessment and selection body for the Civil Service, acting at the behest of individual Departments and offices.Civil servants assigned to ICT work in the Civil Service are in general service grades. Staff in these grades can be directly assigned to ICT work or as a result of specially organised competitions, at either departmental or interdepartmental level. Such competitions are held at clerical officer, executive officer and higher executive officer levels respectively. Subsequent to an assignment, whether direct or by competition, specialised training is provided.Other than recruitment of a small number of administrative officers for ICT work a number of years ago, it has not been the practice to specifically recruit ICT staff from outside the Civil Service. However, officers recruited from open competitions have regularly been assigned by Departments or offices to ICT work as a result of their having significant prior experience in ICT or an ICT qualification.The Sustaining Progress agreement includes a provision to directly recruit staff where it is identified that certain skills and expertise are in short supply. Departments or offices were surveyed and skills shortages were identified for a number of posts in the ICT area. The posts in question were at the levels of executive officer, higher executive officer and assistant principal officer.The implementation of this provision was subject to consultation and agreement was reached with all Civil Service unions on recruitment, by open competition, to a number of ICT posts at executive officer level in various Departments. These posts will be filled from a Public Appointments Service competition advertised in mid-October 2005.Agreement was not reached on number of other posts identified in the survey, at the levels of higher executive officer and assistant principal officer. These posts were the subject of an arbitration finding, as result of which further discussions are required to identify the best method of progressing recruitment to these posts as provided for under the Sustaining Progress provisions.Apart from the foregoing, in the context of supporting the needs of decentralising Departments or offices, consideration is also being given to centralised arrangements for recruiting and training ICT staff, including the possible need to recruit ICT staff from outside the Civil Service. Recruitment of information and communication technology, ICT, staff for the Civil Service and the appropriate level at which such posts should be filled is kept under review in the light of business needs of Departments and offices.The Deputy may wish to note that, from time to time, open recruitment has taken place to fill individual ICT posts at management level in certain offices. Examples include posts filled at the Garda Headquaters and Ordnance Survey Ireland.

These are of 17 February 2004 and 28 June 2005, and together they give details of the purpose and recipient of my Departments consultancies in the years he mentions, along with the payments made in each year. As the Deputy will appreciate, given the amount of information they contain it has not been possible, in the time available for answering the present question, to compile the information in the format sought by him, that is, showing the cost by contract rather than by year and showing also which contracts have reached fruition. However, my Department is compiling the information in that format and it will be forwarded to the Deputy shortly.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	840	I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that there are approximately 5,000 road hauliers registered with them — this figure includes both companies and individuals.Revenue have advised me that it is not possible, in the time available, to get detailed information on the amount of arrears of tax and PRSI contributions outstanding from cases in this sector. However, I am informed that during 2004, 198 Revenue audits were carried out on road hauliers resulting in additional tax, interest and penalties of €1.36 million being recovered from 73 of those cases, 125 audits were non-yielding. Also in 2004, Revenue detected 250 hauliers using marked gas oil and 26 hauliers using "laundered" diesel.The Deputy will be aware that where a haulier is carrying goods for hire or reward, a road freight carrier's licence is required from the Department of Transport. In order to obtain or renew such a licence, evidence of compliance in the form of a tax clearance certificate must be produced to the Department of Transport. This tax clearance requirement helps considerably in improving compliance in this sector.While the haulage sector poses some special tax compliance risks — as already indicated, these include the illegal use by some operators of laundered or marked diesel — I am advised that Revenue are vigorously pursuing non-compliance in this sector and remain alert to the emergence of any increasing risks.

This report provided a model for identifying non-property costs and savings that might arise both during the relocation phase and in the context of a post-decentralised Civil Service. While my Department is making arrangements to identify costs in accordance with this model, expenditure to date has been limited. The costs associated with the provision of accommodation in Tullamore and Kildare will be met from the Office of Public Works Vote.

#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	844	I have recently received a report from the South Western Regional Fisheries Board on the final year of a three-year experiment carried out since 2003 to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of alternative methods of draft net fishing, in particular the use of monofilament netting, for wild salmon in Cork Harbour. In forwarding this report to me the chief executive officer advised that the South Western Regional Fisheries Board has, by majority decision, decided to endorse the findings in the report and to recommend that monofilament and other operational changes be legalised for draft net fishing within the harbour.I am examining the report submitted to me and assure the Deputy that I will make a decision, having considered all relevant issues involved and bearing in mind that any legislative changes which may be required will need to be put in place in good time before the commencement of the next draft net fishing season in Cork Harbour in May 2006.

The county council forwarded proposals in December 2001 and again in 2003 to the Department for Exchequer funding under the national fishery harbour development programme for improvement works to the pier, estimated to cost €88,300. No funding was available for these works. The question of providing funding for works at Parkmore Pier will depend on the amount of Exchequer funding available for works at fishery harbours generally and overall national priorities. The Department has not received a proposal from Galway County Council regarding the construction of a breakwater at Parkmore Pier.

Interaction with the OPW on these elements is well established in my Department, informed by site visits and a thorough ongoing consultative process. The latest report from the OPW indicated that negotiations on the purchase of a suitable site in Cavan are progressing. My Department has already provided an outline specification of our accommodation requirements to the Office of Public Works and will provide a detailed brief when required by the OPW.The latest information from the Public Appointments Service is that 171 expressions of interest have been received for 378 Department posts in Cavan. The process of reassigning Department staff who made a CAF application to relocate with the Department to Clonakilty, Drogheda or Cavan is under way. In addition, in line with the centrally agreed protocols contact has been made by my Department with relevant Departments regarding their staff who wish to move with the Department to these decentralised locations. The Department's move to Cavan is scheduled to take place at the end of 2009. Arrangements to have staff in place and operational in line with that schedule will continue to be progressed.

Arising from these studies, coast protection works were funded in the years 1999 to 2004 amounting to a total of €321,763. In the current year an amount of €303,750 has been offered to Dún Laoghaire Rathdown County Council for coastal protection works in the Killiney area.The stretch of coast between Killiney, County Dublin, and Carnsore Point, County Wexford, is the subject of a detailed pilot study as part of the national coastal protection strategy study. Vulnerability of the coastline to erosion is one of the matters being examined. It is expected the results of the pilot study will be available in 2006. The question of funding coast protection works in the Killiney area in 2006 will depend on the amount of Exchequer funding available for coast protection works and overall national priorities.

#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	852	The licensing and registration of the vessel referred to was facilitated by a decision of the European Commission in January 2002 to grant additional capacity of 14,055 gross tonnes and 14,400 kilowatts in respect of the Irish pelagic fleet segment to take account of fishing opportunities in Mauritanian and other west African waters. The European Commission's decision followed negotiations with the Commission on a legitimate application by the company which owns the vessel, under EU legislation in place at that time, which provided for the introduction of additional capacity into the fleet where additional fishing opportunities were identified. The capacity allocated by the European Commission was additional capacity over and above the existing EU capacity limits for the Irish fleet.As part of the overall agreement, the company which owns the vessel has permanently withdrawn its other vessel from the Irish-EU fishing fleet. The package agreed allowed the company to retain the annual quota and fishing entitlements in EU waters of the withdrawn vessel. It should be noted that the vessel is only allowed to fish in EU waters to the same degree, in terms of catch limits and fishing effort, as the withdrawn vessel was allowed. The withdrawal of this vessel also enabled Ireland to resolve long-standing engine power over-capacity in the pelagic segment.

Ireland, along with Norway, the Netherlands, Denmark and Germany, has denounced the North West Europe and North Atlantic Loran C System — NELS — Agreement. Denunciation takes legal effect from 31 December 2005.The mast, consisting of the antenna and transmitter, cost €1.9 million and was purchased by France and the Netherlands as per the international agreement. The legal costs associated with the project amounted to €561,000, which includes legal fees for the planning appeal. The land at Loop Head, totalling 137 acres, was purchased for €479,000. Lease of the land for grazing rights has generated €13,530 in revenue over the past three years. Cost of storage for the mast amounted to €326,000. The mast was stored at Pacy-Sur-Eure, near Paris, France. A breakdown of the storage costs over the past five years is as follows:YearAmount€200159,909200247,108200447,476200527,829Ownership of the mast was transferred to France in April this year, with the agreement of the Netherlands.

These risks cover the major areas of business and service continuity, particularly significant staff turnover, financial management and control, customer service and the logistics of relocation. Plans for managing and mitigating the impacts of the process on the Department's business and staff encompass a comprehensive knowledge management initiative, human resource strategies and training and development plans, ICT strategies aimed at enhancing the quality and benefits of automated systems and maintenance of mission critical business areas and service levels.On the costs of implementing strategies to address the issues, the knowledge management initiative, ICT strategy and training and development strategies pre-date the decentralisation programme. These initiatives have been synchronised with the decentralisation programme as major planks of our risk mitigation plans and have not to date resulted in material additional expenditure over and above that already planned for these initiatives. The Department has carried out a preliminary assessment of the possible costs associated with decentralisation in terms of both once off costs over the period of relocation and ongoing annual costs post relocation. Further comprehensive analysis is under way to underpin fully quantified estimates of these costs.The major capital costs related to the decentralisation of my Department to Cavan, Clonakilty and Drogheda relate to the acquisition of sites and building of facilities. These costs are being borne centrally and my Department is liaising closely with the Office of Public Works to ensure quality facilities are delivered commensurate with the value for money imperative.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	860	The importance of building trust and improving community relations, tackling sectarianism and addressing segregation in Northern Ireland was specifically acknowledged in the rights, identity and community section of the joint declaration published by the two Governments in 2003. Accordingly, the British Government was mandated to review good community relations and bring forward a strategic and integrated good relations policy.The shared future document referred to by the Deputy, A Shared Future — Policy and Strategic Framework for Good Relations in Northern Ireland, was published by the then Minister of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. John Spellar, on 21 March 2005. It sets out practical steps and actions aimed at achieving a shared and inclusive society. The new policy was informed by an earlier report on community relations policy by Dr. Jeremy Harbison and drew on responses generated by a consultation document launched in January 2003. It includes such policy objectives as the elimination of sectarianism and racism, the reduction of tension at interface areas, integrated education, mixed housing, the promotion of cultural diversity, shared workplaces and community development and tackling disadvantage.The document lays out a comprehensive approach to the promotion of good relations between all communities in Northern Ireland. The implementation of the strategy on the ground will be key in terms of ensuring this work is ultimately successful. In that context we understand that, arising from a comprehensive consultation process, the British Government is due to publish a triennial action plan associated with the shared future document in the coming months. This will further develop the aims and objectives set out in the document and specify detailed actions to be taken by public authorities in Northern Ireland to achieve them.The new shared future document contains much that is welcome and timely. At the general level, we welcome the new policy's recognition of the centrality of equality in creating the basis for good relations. At the more specific level, we also welcome, for example, the commitment in the document to tackling the visible manifestations of sectarianism and racism, in particular inappropriate and aggressive displays of flags and emblems. I had a useful discussion on this issue with Secretary of State Peter Hain at the most recent meeting of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference on 19 October last. We are hopeful the new policy, as elaborated in the forthcoming action plan, could facilitate effective handling of this issue.The recommendations contained in the document relate to actions to be taken by Departments, agencies and public authorities in Northern Ireland. They are, therefore, not directed at the Government. We continue, however, to monitor progress in implementing commitments arising from the joint declaration in the area of improving community relations. We keep in touch with the position at community level through engagement with local representatives on the ground, members of the NGO and academic community and representatives of the relevant official bodies. During my own frequent visits to Northern Ireland, I make a point of meeting individuals and community representatives from both traditions to hear their concerns.We will also maintain our dialogue with the British Government on improving community relations, including issues arising from the document, A Shared Future, and the forthcoming action plan within the framework of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference and at official level.

The Department commissions consultancies where specialised knowledge and-or skills are not available within the Department and, particularly in the case of the Development Co-operation Ireland, DCI, programme, where an independent evaluation of programmes and projects is required. The awarding of the contracts referred to below is done at official level and I have had no personal involvement in the process.The information requested by the Deputy for Vote 28 is set out in Table A. The majority of expenditure on consultancies during the period in question relates to the upgrading of the Department's information technology infrastructure at headquarters and in our missions abroad and to the development of an automated passport production system, APS. The upgrading of the Department's information technology infrastructure commenced in 2002 and covered a broad range of technologies which required specialised expertise in a number of areas. No fixed contract was agreed with a single supplier or contractor. Instead, rates were agreed for specialised expertise with several contractors and these were utilised on a draw-down basis, as and when required.The information relating to Vote 29, development co-operation, is set out in Table B. The vast majority of these consultancies have been completed. Those with an asterisk (*) beside them represent ongoing assignments. Consultancies undertaken by Development Co-operation Ireland cover a wide range of sectors, including HIV-AIDS, education, health and rural development. A high proportion of these concern the monitoring, review and evaluation of development programmes and projects commissioned at headquarters to ensure quality and value for money. These consultancies are almost always 
based on a daily rate of payment with a maximum number of days stipulated in the contract.CompanyService ProvidedActual CostStatus€Padraig WhiteTo advise the Garvaghy Roads Residents Coalition on

The economy has contracted by approximately 40% in recent years and devaluation of the currency is a function of this economic crisis. Continuous devaluation fuels inflation and puts basic necessities further out of the reach of the poor. Poverty and vulnerability are worsening and the current political climate is extremely difficult for donors and aid agencies. Zimbabwe has now slipped from 117th on the United Nations human development index, HDI, to 145th in 2005.Ireland continues to assist many of the poorest and most vulnerable communities in Zimbabwe. Our support is delivered through UN agencies and NGOs with a proven track record of meeting the needs of the poorest. We have, for instance, been supporting the World Food Programme, WFP, Concern, Goal, Trócaire, missionary and local groups and other agencies.Zimbabwe was once the breadbasket of southern Africa but hunger is now a daily experience for millions of Zimbabweans. The Government is funding the provision of food assistance and focusing on school feeding programmes. A sum of €900,000 has been provided in 2005 for this purpose and additional funding is under active consideration. During the recent visit of Mr. James Morris, executive director of the WFP to Ireland, I discussed with him the food security situation in Zimbabwe and how best to address the food deficits in a very difficult operating environment.Zimbabwe is also one of the countries most affected by HIV-AIDS, with an estimated 25% of the population infected. Life expectancy has fallen below 40 years. This year Ireland has committed €1 million to mitigate the impact of the pandemic, through partnerships with aid agencies and civil society organisations. Since 2004, Ireland has committed approximately €7 million in aid to Zimbabwe. Despite the difficult operating environment, we will continue to deliver assistance directly to those most in need through a broad range of civil and aid organisations.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	867	Under the Government's decentralisation programme the development co-operation directorate of the Department of Foreign Affairs, based in Dublin, is scheduled to decentralise to Limerick. This will involve the relocation to Limerick of 123 posts and is scheduled to take place during the first quarter of 2007. The decentralisation of the Development Co-operation Directorate will take place during a period of significant growth in the overseas development aid budget. The Taoiseach announced at the UN Millennium Review Summit in New York on 14 September that the Government would reach the target of spending 0.7% of GNP on official development assistance by 2012. Interim targets of 0.47% of GNP in 2006 and 0.5% in 2007 have also been agreed. The 2006 Estimates process is under way and the allocation to the Vote of the Department of Foreign Affairs for international co-operation, Vote 29, will be agreed in the context of the Estimates negotiations. On the basis of anticipated growth rates, total overseas development aid is expected to be of the order of €675 million in 2006 and €793 million in 2007.Risk analysis carried out by the directorate in this context has identified the following as the main risk factors, for which appropriate risk mitigation strategies are being implemented: financial, including accountability and control; human resources, including loss of expertise and institutional memory; communications between the directorate and internal and external stakeholders; and associated operational and reputational risks. The risks associated with the decentralisation are considered in detail in the Department's decentralisation implementation plan which has been published on the Department's website. www.dfa.ie .To avoid a high level of staff turnover in the months immediately preceding the decentralisation, the Department commenced importing staff from the central applications facility, CAF, in May 2005. Already, 26 staff for Limerick — 21% — are in place in the directorate and the Department will accelerate the process of importing staff from the CAF from next January onwards, with a view to having as many as possible of the staff in place by the autumn of next year, well in advance of the move.The Department recognises it is important to take steps to ensure continuity of service to clients and stakeholders, including the NGOs, by minimising the disruption to the directorate. Departmental officials are finalising strategies for the preservation of the corporate memory of the directorate, through the development of effective knowledge management systems and by ensuring the provision of appropriate induction and ongoing training programmes and adequate hand-over periods for new staff. High quality communications facilities between the directorate in Limerick and the rest of the Department and missions will also be provided.The Office of Public Works, OPW, is responsible for the provision of office accommodation for the directorate in Limerick and will bear its rental costs. The Department is working closely with the OPW to identify suitable accommodation in Limerick and it is hoped to select a premises in the very near future. Pending this, it is not possible to estimate the level of costs which the Department will incur in the provision of the information and communications technology infrastructure and in other areas. Salary and training costs, which can be attributed to the decentralisation programme, are estimated at €550,000 for the three-year period March 2004 to March 2007.

#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	872	I am not aware of the company in question having sought funding from my Department. As my Department does not directly disburse tourism grants to individual enterprises, neither the company in question nor any other tourism enterprise would be able to obtain funding from my Department. Tourism Ireland, likewise, does not operate a grants support scheme. As a public agency, it works with trade and industry, on a co-operative basis, in promotional efforts overseas. Fáilte Ireland offers some advice and support to individual tourism enterprises under a variety of initiatives, and it is up to the company concerned to contact Fáilte Ireland in that regard.The Deputy should be aware that Tourism Ireland is not a commercial enterprise. Tourism Ireland is the North-South agency, established within the framework of the Good Friday peace agreement, to perform the public-good function of marketing the island of Ireland as a tourism destination and, thereby, contribute to the overall peace, harmony and development of the island and its people. It is funded by the Exchequers, North and South. It does not receive or disburse EU funds.

The main risks identified in the plan relate to the loss of expertise and corporate knowledge owing to the high turnover of staff. The provision of appropriate and timely training for new staff will be key in addressing the issue.The main costs of the decentralisation of my Department will be those relating to the acquisition of the site in Killarney and the construction of the new building. Those costs will be borne and monitored by the OPW, which has been charged with the responsibility of providing the office accommodation for my Department. It is not possible to project the overall cost of my Department's decentralisation programme at this stage, but all relevant costs will be carefully monitored.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	874	Officers of the Labour Inspectorate met some of the workers in June 2005 to discuss their concerns. The employees concerned were advised of the relevant bodies to which their complaints should be addressed. In that regard they were told that matters relating to allegations of workplace bullying are dealt with by the Health and Safety Authority, Temple Court, 10 Hogan Place, Dublin 2. I understand several employees have made formal complaints to the authority.They were also advised that matters relating to dismissal generally are more appropriately put to either the rights commissioner service of the Labour Relations Commission or the Employment Appeals Tribunal under the Unfair Dismissals Acts or Industrial Relations Acts and that complaints relating to changes to terms and conditions of employment or delays in pay should also be addressed to the rights commissioner service of the Labour Relations Commission.Regarding issues concerning P35 and P60, the employees were advised that the appropriate authority for such issues is the Revenue Commissioners.With regard to breaches of the Payment of Wages Act 1991, it is the responsibility of the employee to present his or her complaint to a rights commissioner. The legislation does not give me, as Minister, the power to present complaints. With regard to the scheduling or hearing of cases by a rights commissioner, this is a matter solely for the management of the rights commissioner service of the Labour Relations Commission.In addition, some employees expressed concern regarding their pay slips. The Payment of Wages Act 1991 provides that employers must give to each employee with every wage packet a written statement of gross wages, or pay slip, itemising each deduction. The Labour Inspectorate is responsible only for monitoring compliance with that specific provision, and in that regard the Labour Inspectorate is investigating the matter. The inspectorate has been in contact with representatives of the company to inspect the relevant records. The Deputy will appreciate that this task is difficult in circumstances where the company is now closed, and the company is unable at present to gain access to the premises in which the records are retained. However, every effort is being made to gain access to the relevant records.Regarding any suppliers of the company who are owed money by the company, they should pursue that issue through the legal channels available to them.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	875	Since 1997 more than 450,000 new jobs have been created. There has also been a significant fall in unemployment, from 10.4% to 4.2% at present.Long-term unemployment fell from 5.5% in 1997 to 1.6% in 2000, and that very low level has been maintained — it is now at 1.4%. That long-term unemployment rate compares very favourably with the EU average of 4% and ranks fourth-lowest among the 25 EU member states.However, we are not complacent about that level of long-term unemployment, and to reduce it a range of initiatives has been introduced.In addition to the FÁS and local employment services and the community employment, social economy and job initiative programmes, the most significant measure has been the national employment action plan referral process. That involves early intervention by FÁS with unemployed people. It seeks to help the unemployed to re-integrate into the labour market as quickly as possible by providing them with the necessary skills and supports to improve their employability.Under that process, since 2003 anyone who has been on the live register for six months, and all persons not previously referred and on the live register for more than six months, were referred to FÁS for interview. The majority of such referrals were long-term unemployed. Since June 2003, approximately 27,000 long-term unemployed clients have been referred to FÁS. Since the introduction of the NEAP in September 1998, a total of 247,000 clients have been referred to FÁS for assistance.An external evaluation of the NEAP preventive strategy, which is due to be released shortly, concludes "that the NEAP process has been a success".Other innovative responses developed by my Department and FÁS to assist unemployed persons have included: the pathways programme, which identifies the most appropriate development pathway to assist clients to obtain employment; the high supports process, which assists clients on a multi-agency basis to address personal barriers to employment; and the customised training fund to meet training needs of the unemployed flexibly.We are therefore continuing to engage with those in long-term unemployment through a wide range of labour market measures and activities to help them return to employment.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	876	As a consequence of a Commission audit decision in 2000, €15.6 million of European Social Fund moneys were withheld from Ireland. The sum involved represents less than 1% of the amount allocated to the three operational programmes for the period 1994-99. The Commission decision was contested by my Department, and that resulted in a hearing before the European Court of Justice this year. On 15 September 2005, the European Court of Justice agreed with the European Commission's opinion that Ireland had overclaimed the contribution due from the ESF. That was owing to a technical issue in the manner in which Ireland presented ESF claims.It should be noted that the Commission accepts that all expenditure incurred under the programmes in question was eligible and that no allegation of fraud was made.Of the €15.6 million withheld after the Commission decision in 2000, €7.2 million was withheld from the funding allocated to mine and the following Departments: Education and Science; Health and Children; Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs; and Justice, Equality and Law Reform.The remaining €8.4 million of funding was paid from Exchequer resources to what was then the National Training Development Institute, which was a non-governmental organisation. The action required to be taken in respect of those funds is under consideration, in consultation with the relevant Departments.Irregularities of the types which have caused this claw-back are very unlikely to recur regarding the current operational programmes period because of the additional management and financial controls implemented within the funding cascade structure as a result of the expertise gained from the previous period of funding from 1994 to 1999.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	877	I propose to take Questions Nos. 354 and 355 together.Support for job creation and investment in individual counties is a day-to-day operational matter for the development agencies as part of their responsibility under the Industrial Development Acts. While I may give general policy directives to the agencies, I am precluded under the Acts from giving directives regarding individual undertakings or from giving preference to one area over others. In line with the national spatial strategy, a key goal for the agencies is the achievement of balanced regional development.IDA Ireland, the agency charged with the attraction of foreign direct investment, FDI, to Ireland, has assured me that it is actively marketing and promoting the linked hub towns of Ballina, Castlebar and Westport for new greenfield investment. At the end of 2004, there were 22 IDA Ireland-supported companies in Mayo, employing 3,213 people. The agency is actively working with those clients with a view to encouraging them to grow and expand.To underpin those efforts, they are working with local groups, utility providers and other agencies to ensure that Ballina has the appropriate infrastructure to support growth and attract new projects. In that regard, IDA Ireland has been deeply involved with local partners in the development of regional planning guidelines, and negotiations are at an advanced stage to acquire 27 acres of land on the Sligo Road in Ballina that will be developed into a high-quality business and technology park.Enterprise Ireland is the agency which concentrates on the development of indigenous industries. Since 2003 Enterprise Ireland has approved funding support of over €4.6 million and paid more than €2.4 million to companies in County Mayo. Of that amount, Enterprise Ireland client companies in the Ballina area have been approved funding of almost €1 million. That financial support will enable the companies to fund their plans for innovation and new product development.Enterprise Ireland also works with local communities and the county enterprise board in developing the business infrastructure in the county through its community enterprise centre programme. Enterprise Ireland has supported a total of ten community enterprise centres in County Mayo. In addition, it has committed funding of over €0.7 million to Moy Valley Resources IRD Group for the development of enterprise space in Ballina. That centre, which was completed at the end of 2004, is being marketed to potential clients.Since January 2004 Mayo CEB has approved grant aid totalling €85,000 in favour of five separate micro-enterprise projects in Ballina. In addition, during 2005, the board provided training support to 36 people on courses also based in Ballina.I am confident the policies and strategies being pursued by the development agencies, together with the ongoing commitment and support from Government, will bear fruit in sustainable additional investment and jobs for the people of Mayo, including Ballina.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	878	I provided details to the House in regard to certain other aspects of this case in my reply to a question on 25 October last.Section 27 (3) of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005, which came into effect on 1 September 2005, states thatAn employer shall not penalise or threaten penalisation against an employee for ... making a complaint or representation to his or her safety representative or employer or the Authority, as regards any matter relating to safety, health or welfare at work . . .For the purposes of this Act, "penalisation" includes dismissal within the meaning of the Unfair Dismissals Acts.Accordingly, the employee concerned may have recourse to a rights commissioner of the Labour Relations Commission under the above Act. Alternatively, the employee may be entitled to take a case for unfair dismissal under the Unfair Dismissals Acts. To take such a case, an employee must, with certain specific exceptions, have one year's continuous service with the employer who dismissed him or her. Further information in that regard is contained in my Department's Guide to Labour Law, which is available from the employment rights information unit of my Department (Lo-call 1890 201615) or by e-mailing info@entemp.ie. My Department’s website also contains detailed explanatory information on the various pieces of employment rights legislation administered by my Department. Information and clarification of rights and entitlements may also be obtained from the employment rights information unit, should the employee concerned wish to enquire into his or her entitlements in this regard.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	879	The financial regulator, under the aegis of the Minister for Finance, is responsible for the financial supervision of insurance companies here. Before the establishment of the financial regulator, my Department regulated and supervised insurance undertakings. I had ministerial responsibility, and my Department had access to detailed statutory returns which would have allowed my Department to make judgements relating to levels of reserves and profits in insurance undertakings. The financial regulator now receives those statutory returns and has responsibility for protecting consumer interests regarding insurance.The insurance reform programme brought about improvements in the functioning of the Irish insurance market, and very real reform has been delivered. The reform programme, no doubt, has contributed to recent improvements in profitability in the insurance sector. It was expected that the insurance industry would ensure that reductions in insurance costs translate into significant reductions in premia to consumers on a quid pro quo basis.I understand there was a reduction of 23.5% between October 2002, when the reform programme was launched, and August 2005 in motor insurance, according to the figures of the Central Statistics Office. Clearly, competition in the market is driving premia downward. My Department does not collect any figures in respect of public or employers' liability.It must be noted that EU law prevents Governments from intervening regarding premium levels or risks that insurers are prepared to underwrite. Insurers generally make decisions about whether they are prepared to quote for a particular risk, and if so, at what premium level, based on their underwriting experience or assessment of that risk in the market.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	884	The Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, was established by ministerial order on 13 April 2004. From 1 June 2004, all personal injury claims arising from workplace accidents where an employee is seeking compensation from his or her employer, must be referred to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board before legal proceedings are issued. From 22 July 2004, all motor liability and public liability claims must also be referred to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board before legal proceedings are issued.The issue of individual claims being handled by the PIAB is a day-to-day operational matter for which the CEO of the PIAB is responsible. However, I have been informed by the PIAB that the named person has a personal injury case before them. The case was first notified to the PIAB on 16 June 2005. Therefore, the case is well within the nine-month statutory assessment period as set out in section 49 of the PIAB Act 2003. It is also worth noting that this nine-month assessment period compares very favourably with the litigation system, where claims take on average three years to be settled.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	886	I propose to take Questions Nos. 364 and 365 together.The current regional aid guidelines are due to expire at the end of 2006. Negotiations regarding the revised regional aid guidelines covering the period 2007 to 2013 have been ongoing with the European Commission. Ireland has taken part in two multilateral meetings of state aid experts and also in a bilateral with senior officials of the Commission to discuss the new guidelines. It is expected that the revised regional aid guidelines will be approved by the end of 2005.As the Deputy is aware, the purpose of regional aid is to assist the development of the most disadvantaged regions by supporting investment and job creation in a sustainable context. It promotes the expansion, rationalisation, modernisation and diversification of the economic activities of enterprises located in the less-favoured regions and encourages firms to set up new establishments there. The new draft regional aid guidelines stress that regional aid should only be used sparingly and proportionately and should be concentrated on the most disadvantaged regions of the European Union. Given Ireland's economic performance in recent years, we can no longer be classed as being among the most disadvantaged regions. Therefore, regional aid is being phased out in the most prosperous regions of the EU, including the BMW area. The new rates being proposed for the BMW are attached. No changes are proposed to the designation of the BMW region.Under the proposed draft guidelines for regional aid, the southern and eastern region will no longer automatically qualify for regional aid. However, as a result of our negotiations regarding the proposed revised guidelines, the Commission is proposing to retain the safety net whereby no member state will lose more than 50% population coverage. As a consequence, it is likely that we will be able to designate 23.4% of population from the southern and eastern region in addition to the BMW region. In selecting the 23.4%, we must comply with the provisions of the draft guidelines with regard to unemployment rates and GDP. It must be noted that, given the higher GDP and employment rates in the southern and eastern region, aid rates in those additional areas will be much lower than available in the BMW region. No aid will be available for large firms, while small and medium firms can receive aid of up to 30% and 20% respectively.Large firmsMedium firmsSmall firms01.01.0701.01.0901.01.1101.01.0701.01.0901.01.1101.01.0701.01.0901.01.1130%20%10%45%35%20%45%35%30%
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	887	The issue of job creation is a day-to-day operational issue for the industrial development agencies under the remit of my Department and not one in which I, as Minister, have direct involvement.IDA Ireland has responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment, FDI, to Ireland. The attractiveness of Tipperary for inward investment has to be seen in a regional context and, in that regard, IDA Ireland's regional strategy reflects the national spatial strategy, NSS, with an emphasis on the gateway and hub locations. In addition, IDA actively promotes the county towns of Thurles, Clonmel and Tipperary.IDA recognises the need to provide high-value employment opportunities in Tipperary that provide sustainable long-term jobs and is consequently targeting companies and projects which are more knowledge-intensive and have a higher skill requirement.Fundamental to regional success is the quality, calibre and drive of the third level education infrastructure in the region, and IDA Ireland continues to work closely with the Tipperary Institute, the universities of Limerick and Cork, and the Cork and Limerick institutes of technology in the development of new areas of opportunity through its strategic business group, SBG, and towards greater industry collaboration and research through its education, skills and research, ESR, group.At the end of 2004, there were 2,805 people in permanent employment in 18 IDA-supported companies in County Tipperary. There is a diverse range of companies located in County Tipperary representing several industry sectors such as pharmaceuticals, health care, engineering and consumer products. IDA Ireland is confident that the strategies and policies being pursued in the county, together with the ongoing commitment to regional development, will bear fruit in overseas investment and jobs.Enterprise Ireland is the national agency responsible for the development of indigenous industry, and Shannon Development acts as its agent in the mid-west region, which includes north Tipperary. Since the beginning of 2002, Enterprise Ireland has approved funding of over €4.9 million and made payments of over €5 million for client companies in Tipperary South. Enterprise Ireland also has a range of services offerings to encourage high-tech, high-opportunity indigenous enterprise such as: project-building; mentoring; training; space; patent protection advice and business angels. Community-based enterprise centres are also a crucial part of the drive to create new regional enterprise and Enterprise Ireland has provided support of over €700,000 for community enterprise centres in Carrick-on-Suir, Tipperary town and Clonmel.Shannon Development supports the indigenous sector in north Tipperary through a range of support programmes. The ICT sector is not well represented in north Tipperary, and Shannon Development has initiated several initiatives focusing in particular on the development of Tipperary technology park in Thurles. There are eight companies operating out of Tipperary technology park, five based in the incubator innovation works. Those companies are involved in e-commerce, digital cinema, software development and health and safety.Shannon Development initiated the establishment of a Thurles marketing group representing Thurles Town Council, Tipperary Institute, Leader, the county enterprise board, Thurles Chamber of Commerce and Shannon Development to promote the attractiveness of Thurles as an investment location.Shannon Development has also acquired a 29-acre site adjacent to the N7 in Roscrea with a view to the development of a business park appropriate to the needs of the area. Shannon Development is also involved in Newport as part of its e-towns pilot project. That project is part of a pilot of demonstration locations to develop a template for the renewal or improvement of smaller communities in multiple locations.Tipperary North Riding and Tipperary South Riding County Enterprise Boards were established in October 1993 to provide a source of support in County Tipperary for small businesses with ten employees or fewer. In 2004 the two boards assisted in the creation of 101 net jobs and paid out €454,608 in grant assistance to 36 projects in the region. Up to the end of 2004, both CEBs contributed to the creation of 1,190 net jobs and delivered over €6.7 million in grant payments to 761 projects in the county as a whole.For the remainder of 2005, both Tipperary north and south riding CEBs will continue to be proactive in ensuring that all available funds are targeted to maximise entrepreneurial development in the micro-enterprise sector throughout the county.

Discussions are taking place between my Department and the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs about the possible transfer of the programme to that Department.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	889	IDA Ireland is the agency with statutory responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment to Ireland. While I may give general policy directives to the agency, I am precluded under the Industrial Developments Acts from giving directives regarding individual undertakings or from giving preference to one area over others.IDA Ireland is working closely with several public and private bodies, including Enterprise Ireland, which is concentrating on the development of the indigenous sector, the County Enterprise Board, which has responsibility for supporting the micro-enterprise sector, the county council, county development board and major infrastructure and utility providers to improve the business environment of the town.I understand from IDA Ireland that phase 1 of the development of the new Tuam business and technology park was substantially completed in 2003 and that a minor estate access road and associated landscaping have recently been completed.The next stage of the project will be the building of "advance technology units". The park will initially accommodate four units, two 5,000 sq. ft. units and two units of 7,500 sq. ft., for which planning permission has been obtained from Galway County Council.Planning permission is also being sought for a new "advance technology building" on a site adjacent to the park entrance. This 20,000 sq. ft. building will be designed to accommodate manufacturing type operations but can alsobe converted to office based activity, if required.Although the construction of an initial advance unit is not immediately planned, I understand that the park is actively being marketed to potential overseas investors by IDA Ireland through its network of overseas offices and project divisions. I have no doubt that the availability of the flagship park, together with the planned associated buildings, will enhance the attractiveness of the area to potential overseas investors.I am confident that the strategies and policies being pursued by IDA Ireland, together with the ongoing commitment of the Government to regional development, will bear fruit in additional sustainable investment and jobs for the people of Tuam.

That is because international trade policy matters are a Community, and not solely a national, competence. As such, the European Union negotiates as a single entity on the basis of proposals made by the European Commission, which are developed and agreed by the EU Council of Ministers. However, the European Union has not in the past five years entered into bilateral trade agreements with third countries, given that it was a period in which the Community conducted extensive multilateral trade negotiations under the Doha development agenda with our WTO partners following the launch of the WTO trade round, in Doha, in November 2001.

Last year, Asia, a relatively new export market for Irish companies showed the largest growth in exports for Enterprise Ireland client companies, increasing by almost 20%. That region continues to demonstrate great potential. Pursuing the targets set out in the Government's Asia strategy is a priority for the next five years. In addition, exploiting the prospects offered by existing export markets and newer markets such as central and eastern Europe will also be important for future growth.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	894	According to the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Report 2005-2006, Ireland has moved up four places from 30th to 26th out of 117 countries. This improvement in Ireland's national competitiveness is further supported by the findings of the National Competitiveness Council's Annual Competitiveness Report 2005. This report highlights several encouraging statistics, which show that we are broadly implementing the right mix of policies. In 2004, the number of people in employment in Ireland grew strongly with almost 1.9 million in employment by the end of the year. Consumer inflation stabilised, Government finances remained healthy and our investment in infrastructure, which stands at 5% of GDP, is approximately twice the EU average. However, the ACR 2005 also highlights two principal areas where Ireland's performance could be improved. The first is our price and cost competitiveness, which has been eroded in recent years. This, combined with a weak dollar exchange rate, means that Ireland is now an expensive production location relative to several of our trading partners.A key factor in improving cost competitiveness is robust consumer and competition policies. The Government has already put in place the necessary measures to establish a national consumer agency to advocate the consumer's case. It has also implemented a successful reform process of the insurance sector and increased the powers and the resources of the Competition Authority, to aid it in tackling any anti-competitive practices in the economy.Another area of concern arising from the ACR 2005, involves the significant discrepancies in the productivity performance as between different sectors of the economy. Superior productivity growth has been concentrated in a small number of sectors, with evidence of much weaker productivity growth in sectors of the economy less exposed to international competition such as retail, construction, general services and in some sectors of indigenous manufacturing. The enterprise agencies of my Department have been mandated to adjust their support strategies to the needs of their clients in the modern global economy. For example Enterprise Ireland has launched a €20 million productivity improvement fund, which will assist Irish firms in their drive for higher efficiency and international competitiveness.The Government is determined to ensure that Ireland's competitiveness and the conditions for businesses operating here are as favourable as possible. In this context it looks forward to receiving the NCC's Competitiveness Challenge Report 2005, which is due to be published later this year.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	895	I propose to take Questions Nos. 374 and 375 together.It is not possible to determine the number of manufacturing or service jobs that have relocated to lower wage economies in the past five years. Relocation is just one factor in the many enterprise-related issues that determine employment levels. Firms invest in different regions for a variety of reasons and while there is little doubt that some firms establish themselves primarily to take advantage of reduced costs in lower wage economies this is often not the only factor in deciding where to invest.Where relocation has occurred to date, it has largely been limited to relatively low-technology, labour-intensive manufacturing activities. The service sectors in Ireland are holding firm, and as the country grows increasingly economically sophisticated, services are likely to become a much more important source of wealth and employment creation. This is an economic fact of life and one which policy makers have to work with and not against. We have consistently recognised the value and potential of services to propel economic growth. This is reflected in changes to tax rules to promote the location of corporate head quarters or to encourage more R&D activity to take place here, as well as expanding the range of service industries that can be grant aided. At the same time, we must recognise that lower cost locations abroad will prove attractive to some companies whose margins are tighter, which is often the case with basic manufacturing. The sustainability of employment levels in our companies, operating in both manufacturing and internationally traded services, is heavily tied to the sustainability of their competitiveness both in terms of delivering products and services in Ireland and in export markets.Sustainable employment will be linked to companies that have higher profitability, are more technologically advanced and thereby prove a better fit with the competitive characteristics of our economy. Such companies are less likely to move on the basis of simple cost influences. The enterprise development agencies have a clear mandate to align their operations around this policy objective, and are working to source new investment by a combination of developing existing clients and new investors in existing or new activities or sectors. The enterprise development agencies will attract and support such growth by providing funding for innovation development, upskilling within client companies, developing export opportunities in overseas markets, and providing advice and referrals for clients to improve their competitive position.The Government is committed to developing a competitive economy that can meet the challenge from the competitive pressures of today's global economy. This involves maintaining a pro business environment that will provide firms with a solid stable platform from which they can successfully compete on both domestic and international markets, helping to make Ireland one of the most attractive locations in the world from which to do business.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	896	I propose to take Questions Nos. 376 and 378 together.The National Competitiveness Council, NCC, in its Annual Competitiveness Report 2005 found that of the 16 countries benchmarked, Irish expenditure on non-life insurance was the fourth highest. However, the NCC also found that the rate of growth in the cost of insurance has slowed down substantially in recent years. This can be attributed to the series of initiatives the Government has pushed through to reform the insurance sector. The action taken by Government to ensure healthy competition in the insurance sector had already seen benefits for consumers.Sub-indices calculated from the all-items consumer price index at mid-September 2005 show that since the insurance reform programme began in October 2002, there has been a reduction of 23.5% in car insurance. My Department does not have data in relation to public liability insurance.The Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, which was one of the key initiatives of the Government's insurance reform programme, published it first annual report on 13 September 2005. This shows that PIAB assessments to date have been delivered approximately three times faster and at a delivery charge four times cheaper than under the litigation system. As well as being a major benefit to victims of accidents this is a significant reduction in the cost to insurance companies for the delivery of compensation and hence facilitates reductions in liability premiums.Supervision of insurance undertakings is the responsibility of the Financial Regulator, formerly known as the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority. The Financial Regulator has a wide regulatory remit covering consumer protection and prudential supervision of practically all of the financial services industry, including insurance, and the services provided by it. The Financial Regulator comes under the aegis of my colleague the Minister for Finance.

This assessment, which is included in the Department's most recent decentralisation plan submitted to the Decentralisation Implementation Group, identifies specific actions to deal with risks in the areas of HR-staffing, training, business continuity, IT, customer service and accommodation.Decentralisation is now central to my Department's corporate decision making and business planning process. Specific actions in place to minimise the risks associated with decentralisation are factored into the day-to-day business of the Department. These include proper manpower and succession planning, implementation of enhanced records management policies, continued improvement in customer services, including the availability of online services and the establishment of internal committees and structures to progress specific aspects of the decentralisation programme, such as ICT, knowledge management and communications. The actions progressed to date are, by their nature, part of day-to-day management and governance. It is difficult therefore to quantify the cost involved.It is not possible at this stage to put an overall cost on the decentralisation of the Department. My officials are developing a decentralisation costing framework, which will be used to produce reports to the Department of Finance on a quarterly basis. To date, approximately €51,000 has been spent directly on decentralisation within the Department. The costs incurred in the acquisition and development of the site and building in Carlow will be met centrally.

As recently as 2001, improvements were made to increase core maternity leave, which attracted an entitlement to maternity benefit, from 14 to 18 weeks. The period of unpaid maternity leave was also increased from four to eight weeks, bringing the total period of maternity leave to which a woman is entitled to 26 weeks. Based on the current average number of recipients and average rate of payment, a further increase in the duration of maternity benefit by eight weeks would cost approximately €60.9 million in a full year.There would also be additional Exchequer costs arising from the payroll costs of the many public servants who do not pay full PRSI contribution. While there are no immediate plans to extend the period for which maternity benefit is paid, this issue is being kept under review.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	900	I propose to answer Questions Nos. 381 and 387 together.The requirement to be habitually resident in Ireland was introduced as a qualifying condition for certain social assistance schemes and child benefit with effect from 1 May 2004. The old age non-contributory pension scheme is one of the schemes affected.The basis for the restriction contained in the new rules is the applicant's habitual residence. The restriction is not based on citizenship, nationality, immigration status or any other factor. The effect of the restriction is that a person whose habitual residence is in the United States, Europe, Africa or elsewhere is not paid certain social welfare payments, including old age non contributory pension, on arrival in Ireland. The question of what is a person's habitual residence is decided in accordance with European Court of Justice case law, which sets out the grounds for assessing individual claims.Each case received for a determination on the habitual residence condition is dealt with in its own right and a decision is based on application of the guidelines to the particular individual circumstances of each case. Any applicant who disagrees with the decision of a deciding officer has the right to appeal to the social welfare appeals office.The habitual residence condition does not affect missionaries returning to Ireland on a permanent basis. They still qualify immediately for an old age pension or any other social welfare support on the same basis as heretofore if they meet the standard criteria. The application of the habitual residence condition has to be compatible with EU law and other international and national legal obligations and it is not possible, in applying the condition, to discriminate in favour of any particular group or nationality. It is not possible to waive the habitual residence requirement in respect of Irish missionaries who return home on holiday.The habitual residence condition is being operated in a very careful manner to ensure that Ireland's social welfare system is not open to everyone who is newly arrived in Ireland, while at the same time ensuring that people whose cases are appropriate to the Irish social welfare system have access to the system when they need it.

The package is also available to carers and people with disabilities under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments. People aged over 70 years of age can qualify regardless of their income or household composition.Widows and widowers aged from 60 to 65 whose late spouses had been in receipt of the household benefits package retain that entitlement to ensure that households do not suffer a loss of entitlements following the death of a spouse. The free travel scheme, is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years, or over, to all carers in receipt of carer's allowance and to carers of people in receipt of constant attendance or prescribed relative's allowance. It is also available to people under age 66 who are in receipt of certain disability type welfare payments, such as disability allowance, invalidity pension and blind person's pension.The estimated cost of extending the household benefits package and the free travel scheme to all widows and widowers irrespective of their age would be some €45 million. A range of proposals, including those referred to by the Deputy, have been made to extend the coverage of the household benefits package and the free travel scheme.

This measure will cost an estimated €139.3 million in 2005 and will benefit some 1.2 million persons comprising 835,000 recipients and 384,000 dependents.The estimated cost of extending the Christmas bonus to all persons in receipt of short-term payments, that is, short-term unemployment payments, disability benefit, maternity benefit, carers benefit, family income supplement and basic supplementary welfare allowance, is €31 million. Approximately 198,000 persons are receiving these short-term payments.I am satisfied that the Christmas bonus payment is effectively and appropriately targeted. The focus of the bonus has always been on persons who rely on the social welfare system for financial support over the long-term. There are no plans to extend entitlement to the short-term schemes, having regard to the resources available and the significant cost which would be involved.

The programme of work is known as the standard authentication framework environment, SAFE.Following approval from Government, an interdepartmental steering group was established in September 2004 to develop the framework. The steering group comprised representatives from 12 Departments and the Reach agency. The term "framework" is being used to emphasise that a single public service card is not necessarily envisaged but rather a standard within which individual initiatives can operate. One of the objectives of SAFE is to facilitate convergence over time of existing cards and other tokens under a single branded scheme. The individual will benefit from a reduction in the number of tokens required and will give them enhanced control of the use of their data. Agencies can benefit from the streamlining of existing schemes and sharing of administrative costs.The first phase of this work was completed by June of this year and the business principles for the framework were agreed. It was recognised that any framework needed to operate in a defined policy environment and my Department and the Department of Finance are engaged in the necessary technical research to bring forward recommendations on such a policy. This will be accompanied by a parallel stream of work to define a detailed functional architecture to support SAFE. My department intends to develop a public service card in line with its existing responsibilities, for issue in 2007. This will be compatible with the SAFE standards and the emerging policy. The card will include identification features which could include a photograph but this will depend on the policy adopted.

A PPS number issues automatically to children born in Ireland. In all other cases, a person seeking a PPS number must apply at one of my Department's local offices.It is necessary to have effective controls around the PPS number registration process to guard against fraud and to protect the integrity of data under the Department's control. It is important therefore, that a person receives only one PPS number and that it is allocated on information that is accurate and verified. To ensure the security of the system, certain procedures are set down by my Department when dealing with applications. Evidence of identity is a vital element of the allocation process. When applying for a PPS number, applicants are asked to complete an application form and to supply documentation to establish their identity. In the case of a US citizen, he or she will be asked to provide a current valid passport and evidence of residence in this country — for example, a copy of a tenancy agreement or a public utility bill. Once the process is satisfactorily completed, the PPS number will issue in most cases by post within five days.Where queries arise, staff in the client identity services section of my Department will provide advice and assistance to an applicant, or someone acting on his or her behalf.

Neither I nor my Department has any function in determining entitlement to a supplement in individual cases. The mid-western region of the HSE has advised that the person concerned is in receipt of full entitlements. The person applied for a diet supplement in 2001 and was awarded an amount based on the household income at the time and the application of the diet supplement scheme rules.The rate of diet supplement in payment was based on his income from disability allowance. The person concerned subsequently transferred to an old age pension and his entitlement to diet supplement was reviewed to take account of the increase in his income, in accordance with the scheme rules. Following the review, his diet supplement was reduced in June 2005.The Health Service Executive is not aware of any outstanding application by the person concerned for supplementary welfare allowance.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	908	In recent years the Government has concentrated on increasing primary social welfare payment rates by amounts far in excess of inflation. This approach, although more costly than increasing fuel allowances, delivers a better outcome for pensioners and others by substantially increasing their real income over the whole year.Since 2002, pensioners and other eligible groups have received cumulative increases of between 33.6% and 37.3% in their primary social welfare payment rates. These higher rates of primary payments are payable for the full 52 weeks of the year as opposed to the 29 weeks for which the fuel allowance is paid. This approach has improved the income situation of welfare recipients considerably in real terms relative to solid fuel cost increases and to price inflation generally. For example, a single person on a contributory old age pension has received an increase of €32 per week over the last three budgets when fuel allowances were held constant. This is approximately double the amount required to compensate for all inflation, including fuel price inflation.Some 274,000 customers — 151,000 with basic fuel allowance and 123,000 with smokeless fuel supplement — benefit under the scheme at a cost of €85.4 million in 2005. In addition to fuel allowance, over 320,000 pensioners and their households qualify for electricity or gas allowances through the household benefits package, payable towards their heating, light and cooking costs throughout the year, at an overall cost of €108.8 million in 2005. As structured, these allowances are linked to unit energy consumption, so that recipients are protected against unit price increases. There is also a facility available through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to assist people in certain circumstances who have special heating needs.I consider it important to continue the policy of concentrating available budget resources to providing real increases to these primary social welfare rates and to move towards the targets set out in the national anti-poverty strategy. This is aimed at ensuring that people who depend on social welfare income support will have adequate income to meet their normal living expenses, including their heating costs. This approach will involve compensating them fully for all price inflation, including fuel price inflation, and providing additional increases over and above that in their year round weekly payments.However, I am keeping the fuel allowance under active review. Any change to the scheme would have very significant cost implications and would have to be considered in the context of the budget and in the light of the resources available to me for improvements in social welfare generally.

They are intended to meet any shortfall that may exist between the cost of a special diet and the amount it would be reasonable to expect a person to pay towards their food costs. These diet supplement payments are not confined to pensioners. Any person who receives a social welfare or HSE payment, has been prescribed a special diet as a result of a specified medical condition and is unable to provide for his or her food needs from within his or her own resources may qualify for a diet supplement under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.Diet supplements are subject to a means test. Under the existing scheme, the amount of supplement payable in individual cases depends on the income of the individual and his or her dependants and which of two categories of diet, low-cost or high-cost, has been prescribed by the applicant's medical advisor. The basis for calculating the amount of diet supplement remained unchanged between 1996 and 2004. Increases in social welfare rates and in the cost of special diets since 1996 had not been taken into account in assessing entitlement in individual cases. With effect from 1 January 2004, the diet supplement scheme was restructured to take account of increases in both social welfare payment rates and the rate of food inflation since 1996. Due to the fact that increases in the social welfare payment rates were higher than food price inflation since 1996, the shortfall needing to be met by the diet supplement is less than in the past. People who were in receipt of a diet supplement prior to the introduction of the revised regulations on 1 January 2004 continue to receive their existing rate of supplement until such time as there is a change in their circumstances which warrant a review of their cases. The amount of supplement for new applicants, at €44 for lower-cost diets or €57 for higher-cost diets, less one third of the applicant's income or one sixth of the joint income in the case of a couple, is now based on increased up-to-date diet costs.In order to inform a reappraisal of the scheme, my Department commissioned a study by an expert from the Irish Nutrition and Dietetic Institute. The study examined the special diets prescribed in legislation for which assistance is available through the existing diet supplement scheme. The study also considered the appropriate level of assistance required to cater for any additional costs involved in providing for necessary special diets, relative to the cost of a normal healthy eating diet.The findings of this research study have been assessed by my Department to determine how the diet supplement scheme should be developed. Development of a new scheme is complex, as the expert advice is that certain diet conditions covered under the existing scheme should be adjusted to reflect the latest medical and dietary thinking, and the increasing availability of the standard food products that are suitable for people with special dietary needs.My Department is making arrangements to publish the research study. In finalising the revised scheme and regulations, I want to make sure that any new supplement coverage and payment rates put in place continue to enable people on low incomes to meet the identified extra cost of medically-recommended special diets if they need them. In the meantime, diet supplements continue to be provided for existing recipients and new applicants as heretofore.

It is scheduled to decentralise to Sligo and Carrick-on-Shannon early in 2007, to Carrickmacross in 2008, and to Drogheda, Donegal and Buncrana in 2009.My Department has submitted implementation plans to the decentralisation implementation group, one feature of which is the identification of the potential risks to the Department's operations in completing the decentralisation programme. The Department has extensive experience of decentralisation having already established decentralised offices in Letterkenny, Sligo, Longford, Waterford and Dundalk. These moves were completed with minimum disruption to the service of the Department and the experience gained will assist us in the current programme.The Department has established a project board to oversee the process and is taking steps to mitigate the risks associated with the moves. These include management of the movement of staff, adequate training of all staff before the moves take place, co-ordination of the accommodation and information technology requirements in a timely manner, and identification of the communication strategies required, both during and after the moves have taken place.Early estimates of the costs associated with the programme were based on a roll-out of the programme over the three-year timeframe and included staffing, travel and subsistence, overtime, furniture, and information technology and telecommunications costs. These estimates will be refined on an ongoing basis as the longer timeframe is implemented. Risk mitigation strategies associated with the decentralisation programme will form part of the general estimated figures. The Department will track the costs associated with the programme on an ongoing basis.

The criteria essential for recognition of licences from other countries are testing and licensing regimes that meet the requirements of the EU directive and reciprocal recognition of Irish licences.A person who holds a driving licence issued by a member state of the European Union or of the European economic area, which includes Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, is permitted to drive in Ireland for so long as that licence remains valid. Where such persons take up normal residence in Ireland, they may exchange their licence for an Irish licence without taking a driving test.In addition, Australia, Isle of Man, Japan, Jersey, South Africa, South Korea and Switzerland are recognised states for the purpose of driving licence exchange under the terms of Article 30(7) of the Road Traffic (Licensing of Drivers) Regulations 1999. Under these regulations, persons holding a valid driving licence from a recognised state may exchange their licence for an Irish driving licence where they take up residence here, without the need for a driving test. However, a holder of a New Zealand licence, on taking up residence here, would be required to obtain an Irish driving licence by undergoing both the theory and practical tests.

Vehicle in-service standards are specified in the Road Traffic (Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles) Regulations 1963 which requires vehicles to be fitted with a silencer or other device that is suitable and sufficient for reducing to a reasonable level the noise caused by the escape of exhaust gases from the engine. Article 85 of these regulations prohibits the use in a public place of a vehicle which causes excessive noise; in this respect the article does not specify decibel levels.An examination of the silencer to assess its effectiveness in reducing noise is part of the NCT and the roadworthiness test carried out on commercial vehicles. It is an offence to use in a public place a vehicle which causes excessive noise. Enforcement of the law in this regard is a matter for the Garda Síochána.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	937	The planning, design and implementation, including the supervision of construction, of national road improvement projects, including the Dublin Port tunnel, is a matter for the National Roads Authority, NRA, and the local authority concerned. I am informed by Dublin City Council that as with construction of any tunnel, under a 20m head of ground water, some minor initial entry of water is anticipated. I understand at the following locations; vehicle cross passages, chainage 3,000 m and 4,000 m, and the tunnel boring machine turn shaft head wall, at chainage 1,900 m, such entry of water has been encountered.Dublin City Council inform me that the contractor has in place a sequence of preventative grouting, to seal off these ground water paths. No flooding has or is occurring, nor have there been any ceiling falls. Where voids are detected, in the crown of any concrete closure pours, these are to be dealt with by specialist grouting subcontracting firms. I understand these works are routine quality control activities, as part of the completion of the main civil works.

It has responsibility for the management, maintenance and development of inland waterways, principally for recreational purposes.The extension of the Erne navigation to Killykeen is not included in the National Development Plan 2000-2006 and Waterways Ireland advises me that it has no plans to extend this stretch of canal at present. Clearly, in the context of the current suspension of the institutions in Northern Ireland, Waterways Ireland is continuing to work at present on a care and maintenance basis. However, I have been informed by the body that it proposes to begin to collate all existing studies relating to the Killykeen proposal before the end of the year. This should provide a useful set of background information to allow further studies to be undertaken on the feasibility and desirability of the proposal.With regard to the underspend to which the Deputy refers, this arose primarily due to the suspension of the institutions in Northern Ireland and the subsequent and related deferral of the building of the Waterways Ireland headquarters in Enniskillen, which is now due to commence in 2006. In the event of an underspend under any heading, the money is either re-allocated to other projects within the Vote or surrendered to the Exchequer. In the case of deferral, a further provision is re-entered in the Vote the following year.

However, it is worth pointing out that I have recently approved the first tranche of funding to some 100 applicant groups, which has enabled earlier payments than in previous years. Assessment of the remaining applications is in progress and further approvals and payments will be notified to eligible applicant groups over the coming weeks.

Completed projects are indicated by an asterisk. This largely reflects material provided in reply to Question No. 344 on 12 October 2005. However, a number of contracts were inadvertently omitted from the appendix to the reply on 12 October 2005. Most of these had in fact already being previously notified to this House and all these contracts are included in the table.For completeness of information I also draw attention to the contract for the development of an information system to support the administration of Leader+ and NRDP programmes. This contract was initiated by the Department of Agriculture and Food in 2002 and tender documentation assumed that the substantial IT infrastructure and staffing supports of that Department, along with software licenses it held, would support the project.However, the new Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to which the rural development programmes transferred from mid-2002 does not have a major IT function or comparable delivery capability nor did it hold the relevant application server licences. In addition, significant enhancements, including an audit module, were required. Hence fundamental and extensive re-negotiations with the provider were required. Nevertheless it is more appropriate to regard the two processes — the initial tendering and subsequent re-negotiating — as coming within a single contract rather than two separate contracts, as had previously been described in reply to Question No. 344 on 12 October 2005.Recipient of the contract in each caseDetails of the work covered by the contractThe original estimate of the cost of the contract € (Incl VAT)The final amount paid in respect of each such contract € (Incl VAT)2002C.H.L.

My Department's primary involvement with Irish summer colleges is with the administration of a scheme entitled Scéim na bhFoghlaimeoirí Gaeilge. The object of this scheme is to provide grant assistance for Gaeltacht households who provide suitable accommodation for students attending recognised Irish courses in the Gaeltacht. The Irish colleges themselves are approved and inspected by the Department of Education and Science.My Department has been in contact with the Department of Education and Science, which will investigate aspects of the complaint concerning the college and will reply to the parents regarding those matters. My Department will also follow up on those aspects of the complaint that come within its remit and a reply in this regard will be sent to the parents as soon as possible.

Building on this initial work, these registers were reviewed by the Department's audit committee in December 2004 and this review informed the development of the Department's updated implementation plan of April 2005.In the wider context of implementation of the recommendation of the Mullarkey report, and to help deepen the Department's capability and effectiveness on risk management, the Department has appointed consultants with appropriate risk identification, assessment and management skills and expertise to further support divisional and corporate risk management. These consultants, who will particularly focus on risks arising from decentralisation, are scheduled to complete their work by January 2006. Pending completion of that work, it is not feasible to speculate on costs issues.

The first application, in respect of four animals, was received on 1 March 2004 while the second application, in respect of 22 animals, was received on 31 December 2004.Following computer validation of the second application, it was found that all of the animals were non-CMMS compliant, that is, they were not recorded as being in the herd of the person named on the date the application was received by the Department. This is a basic requirement of the scheme and, if not complied with, can result in regulatory penalties. By letter dated 4 March 2005 and again by letter dated 27 September 2005, the person named was requested by my Department to provide an explanation as to why the animals were found to be non-CMMS compliant.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	953	The person named presented an animal for slaughter at a meat export plant on 13 October 2005. When a CMMS traceability check was carried out at the factory, it was discovered that an animal with the same tag number had been recorded as having been exported the previous year. A feature of Ireland's traceability system is that each bovine's tag number details are unique. In the circumstances, an investigation was initiated by my Department to ascertain which was the correct animal. Thus, the animal presented at the factory was rejected for slaughter until such time as this investigation was completed.The investigation found that the animal exported in the previous year was incorrectly recorded on the CMMS system and the rejected animal was cleared for slaughter on 20 October, some seven days later. While it is acknowledged that the person in question was not to blame in this case, my Department had no option but to await the outcome of the investigation before allowing the animal to proceed for slaughter for entry into the food chain. I am satisfied that there was no disease risk from the return of this animal to the farm while the investigation took place. I regret the inconvenience caused to the person named in this case. However, I have a duty to ensure that only cattle whose origin, identity and life history are verified by the traceability system enter the food chain.

The value of these entitlements is in excess of €58 million.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	956	The person named submitted an application for a review of entitlements under the single payment scheme. During the processing of this review my Department took the view that the case of the person named should be assessed on the grounds of force majeure or exceptional circumstances as provided for in Article 40 of Council Regulation (EC) No. 1782/2003. My Department has completed the examination of the force majeure circumstances and a decision was made that the single payment entitlements for the person named would be based on year 2000 only with the years 2001 and 2002 excluded. Details of the revised entitlements will issue to the person named shortly.The person named also submitted an application for an allocation of entitlements from the national reserve under category C, which caters for farmers who, between 1 January 2000 and 19 October 2003, sold their milk quota into the milk quota restructuring scheme and converted their enterprise to a farming sector for which a direct payment under livestock premia and-or arable aid schemes would have been payable during the reference period 2000 to 2002. More than 23,000 applications for an allocation of entitlements from the national reserve were received. Processing of these applications is continuing and the intention is to make allocations to successful applicants at the earliest opportunity. The Department will be in touch with individual applicants as soon as their applications are fully processed. A successful application under the national reserve would serve to increase the entitlements already advised to the person named.

The first application, in respect of one animal for bull premium, was received on 7 September 2004; the second application, in respect of 18 animals for first age premium, was received on 6 October 2004 and the third application, in respect of 13 animals for first age premium, was received on 24 December 2004.Following initial computer validation, it was found that some of the animals included on the applications of the person named appeared ineligible under the scheme. However, following further examination, it has now been established that these animals are eligible and, accordingly, the file is being further processed with a view to payment at an early date.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	961	The person named had completed three years in REPS 2 and was selected for a compliance inspection in his fourth year. Following the inspection, he was notified on 3 November 2004 that he was to be penalised for not spreading lime as required in his farm plan. This was because he could produce no record of having bought lime. He appealed the penalty locally and at the end of November 2004 he provided a photocopy of a receipt for the purchase and spreading of lime. My officials did not consider this to be acceptable evidence of the transaction and asked him to produce a bank statement to prove it. On 10 January 2005, the person named contacted my officials again but did not provide the material requested. In March 2005, my officials contacted his planner asking him to produce the original of the receipt.Instead of the original receipt the planner provided another copy of the receipt, which he certified. My officials still considered this unacceptable and in a final effort to resolve the situation so that the person named could be paid, they contacted the company named on the receipt and verified directly from them that they had provided him with lime and spread it on his land. He was then told that the matter had been resolved and his payment issued on 5 September 2005.While the delay is regrettable, my Department has an obligation to operate effective controls in REPS to safeguard national and EU funds.

There are approximately 1,000 commercial poultry farms in Ireland and 40% of these farms are based in County Monaghan.While there are no official statistics for the numbers employed directly and indirectly in the service industry, it is estimated that there would be roughly up to 6,000 people involved in the production, processing, packing and associated activities in the poultry industry.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	963	Official data on deer farming is available from the census of agriculture which is carried out by the Central Statistics Office roughly every ten years. The first and so far only census of agriculture that included deer was in June 2000. This stated that there were farmed deer on 266 farms. Teagasc has estimated that the number of farms involved in deer production peaked in the mid-1990s at about 450 and estimates that the number stands at between 200 and 250.The structure of deer farming has altered over the last ten years and the number of units has decreased. While there are fewer enterprises now, they are larger, more specialised and moving towards quality assured high value product outlets.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	964	According to the Teagasc survey, the number of mushroom producers in Ireland in 1997 was 576. The latest information available from Teagasc is that the number of producers has now fallen to 135. However in the same period, the level of production has increased from 57,000 tonnes of mushrooms in 1997 to 65,059 tonnes in 2004 due to the increasing scale and production output of farms remaining in operation.The mushroom task force which published its report in May 2004 agreed that the industry needed to become more efficient to move forward in a very competitive market environment and agreed a set of recommendations to put it on a firm footing. A review group continues to monitor the implementation of these recommendations.Under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 my Department will be providing funding of more than €2 million this year to growers for capital investments in buildings and equipment. This follows on the €2.5 million paid to growers under the three earlier rounds of the scheme. Funding under the EU producer organisation scheme is also being provided and this year €5 million was paid to six mushroom producer organisations, bringing the total EU aid in this sector to €16.5 million since 2002.

The person named submitted an application for consideration of force majeure-exceptional circumstances in respect of his entitlements under the scheme. The circumstances outlined by him did not satisfy the criteria for force majeure-exceptional circumstances under Article 40 of Council Regulation (EC) No. 1782/2003. The person named appealed that decision to the independent single payment appeals committee. The finding of the appeals committee was that the original decision taken by my Department should be upheld.The person named submitted an application for an allocation of entitlements from the single payment scheme national reserve under category B which caters for farmers who, between 1 January 2000 and 19 October 2003, made an investment in production capacity in a farming sector for which a direct payment under livestock premia and-or arable aid schemes would have been payable during the reference period 2000 to 2002.The person named also submitted an application under category C which caters for farmers who, between 1 January 2000 and 19 October 2003, sold their milk quota into the milk quota restructuring scheme and converted their enterprise to a farming sector for which a direct payment under livestock premia and-or arable aid schemes would have been payable during the reference period 2000 to 2002. It should be noted however that the rules governing the single payment scheme stipulate that an applicant who is found to be eligible under more than one category in the reserve may only receive an allocation of entitlements under whichever category is most beneficial to him.The position is that more than 23,000 applications for an allocation of entitlements from the national reserve were received when account is taken of farmers who applied under more than one category. Processing of these applications is continuing and the intention is to make allocations to successful applicants at the earliest opportunity. The Department will be in touch with individual applicants as soon as their applications are fully processed.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	967	I propose to take Questions Nos. 452 and 460 together.Finance Ministers will conduct their second reading of the preliminary draft budget for 2006 later this month following which it will be sent to the European Parliament for its final reading. I will endeavour to ensure that the budget for 2006 is sufficient to provide for the full range of market and other supports, direct payments and rural development measures which are essential to allow Irish farmers and processors to maintain their competitiveness in 2006 and beyond.As regards the dairy sector I have continuously impressed upon the Commission the necessity to ensure flexibility in its ongoing evaluation of aids and subsidies in order to take full account of variations in the market or weaker dollar-euro exchange rates. I am particularly concerned that the dairy sector be provided with sufficient resources to meet its market challenges and that the market dynamics take precedence rather than an undue emphasis on the budgetary requirements, while respecting prudent budgetary disciplines.My priority in the ongoing implementation of the CAP reform is the maintenance of a stable and appropriately resourced dairy sector. This requires the provision of a combination of appropriate levels of internal supports and export refunds to safeguard the sector's market share, allow for its expansion and provide the necessary returns to farmers.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	968	My Department has in recent years made ex gratia payments to a number of bodies involved in the actual delivery of animal care and welfare services throughout the country. The funding available to any individual organisation is dependent on resources available and the level of demand and is therefore intended only as a contribution to the overall costs of the organisations. Until 2004, these ex gratia payments were made from residual funds available in my Department’s Vote at the end of the year. However from 2004, specific provisions for this purpose have been included in the Department’s Estimates. I will be making decisions in the next few weeks on payments to these bodies, including the body named, which have made applications for funding for 2006.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	970	My Department has taken a range of measures aimed at minimising the risk of the introduction of avian influenza into the country. The Department is constantly reassessing the level of risk and will continue to introduce such measures as are proportionate to that level of risk. To date, bans have been placed on the importation of live birds and specified poultry products from countries affected by outbreaks of H5N1 avian influenza. In addition, the European Commission has introduced a ban on the importation of captive birds into the Community and controls on imports of pet birds.Last week, I signed two statutory instruments providing for the registration of all poultry flock owners, including owners of racing pigeons, the reporting of all unusual or unexplained patterns of mortality among poultry flocks, and an immediate ban on the collection of poultry and captive birds for poultry markets, shows, exhibitions and cultural events, other than under licence. In addition to these legal measures, my Department has also updated and reissued biosecurity measures to flock owners which, if followed, will also help to reduce the risk of introduction of disease.My Department has an early warning system in place which operates with the assistance of the national parks and wildlife service, the National Association of Regional Game Councils and BirdWatch Ireland. My Department also participates fully in the annual EU avian influenza survey, which includes a survey of both domestic poultry and wild birds while our laboratories also screen all samples received for avian influenza. These extensive measures play a central part in ensuring that any outbreak of avian influenza will be detected early. Conscious of the potential role of migratory birds in introducing the disease, much of our focus is placed on early detection and speedy eradication of the disease.Our approach at all times is one of vigilance as well as being measured in our response. That response will continue to be informed by our assessment of the risk level at any given time and we will continue to introduce such additional measures as are proportionate to that risk and as are appropriate in an Irish context.

The safety statement must be based on the identification of the hazards as well as the risk assessment for the place of work, that is, the farm.The Act also provides in section 60 that the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, "may, and shall if so requested by the Minister [for Enterprise, Trade and Employment] prepare and publish [Health and Safety Authority] Codes of Practice" relating to employers with three or fewer employees and these codes of practice will be sufficient to meet the general duty to prepare a safety statement, referred to above. The HSA is actively involved in the preparation of a code of practice for the agricultural sector. I welcome this approach and will continue to support all actions aimed at preventing accidents on farms.All farmers have received a HSA document, Farm Safety Self Assessment for family farms and self employed farmers, on the basis that the completed document should be kept on the farm.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	977	Under the existing arrangements, the main compensation scheme for farmers whose herds are affected by TB or brucellosis is the on-farm market valuation scheme, which provides for compensation to be paid on the basis of market value. Under the scheme, market value is the equivalent price that might reasonably have been obtained for the animal, at the time of determination of compensation, from a purchaser in an open market if the animal was not affected by TB or brucellosis or was not being removed as part of a depopulation under the disease eradication programme. Cattle removed as infected animals are valued by suitably qualified valuers approved by my Department and by reference to Department guidelines on market values of animals. The amount payable is subject to a maximum ceiling of €2,540 applying in respect of any individual animal, except in respect of one pedigree stock bull per breakdown episode where a ceiling of €3,175 is applied.All reactor animals are valued as if they were not affected by disease and are categorised by breed and quality. Summary market guideline prices are compiled and issued by my Department to independent livestock valuers on a weekly basis for use as a reference for the valuation of animals affected by disease prior to slaughter. These prices are based on current livestock sales which are closely monitored by my Department. Prices for finished cattle are obtained from the meat factories each week. The prices for all other commercial cattle are obtained by my Department from representative livestock marts throughout the country. Prices for breeding animals are obtained from clearance, reduction and specialised sales that are normally held during the breeding season, that is, during spring and autumn. Department staff also monitor the valuations attributed to animals by the valuers.Farmers receive payment from meat plants for the meat value of reactors. This payment is netted against the on-farm valuation, with the appropriate net differential payment being paid by the Department to the farmer. With regard to prices paid by the meat plants buying tuberculosis reactor animals, my Department operates a weekly tendering system whereby the meat plants submit quotations for the purchase of the reactors. My Department does not advise factories as regards the meat price of reactor animals. The farmer receives the full market valuation of his or her reactors irrespective of the price paid by meat plants.I am therefore satisfied that the guidelines issued by the Department reflect the appropriate market value for all animals, including first class herefords and other native breeds, and I do not propose to revise the current market valuation arrangements.

The document outlines the risks of decentralisation and the mitigating actions necessary. It is not possible to estimate at this stage the cost of these mitigating actions. The Department is satisfied that any costs arising can be met from its existing administrative budget.The main costs associated with decentralisation will be accommodation costs. In its report of November 2004, the decentralisation implementation group, DIG, indicated that the Department's corporate headquarters in Portlaoise would be provided on a design, build, finance and maintain, DBFM, approach and the OPW is proceeding on that basis.

The principal officer in the Department's financial shared services centre is responsible for complaints relating to the Garda Síochána superannuation scheme. The principal officer is the person who receives the complaint and who ultimately issues a notice of determination. In his notice of determination he is required to include the following: a statement of what has been decided; a reference to relevant legislation, regulations, legal precedent or any other material relied upon; where a discretionary power has been exercised, a reference to any provisions which confer such power. The principal officer is required to issue a determination within three months of receiving sufficient information to enable the complaint to be considered. It is then open to the complainant to bring forward his complaint to the Pensions Ombudsman who may then decide to investigate the matter, which will result in an order binding on all parties.

She was granted permission to remain until 19 July 2001 on work permit conditions. Her employer did not seek to renew the work permit in respect of her. She subsequently took up employment with a new employer. However, this employer had not obtained a work permit on her behalf. She failed to renew her permission to remain in the State from 19 July 2001 and continued to reside in the State.As a result of representations received on her behalf in February 2004 and following consideration of all the circumstances of her case, she was granted permission to remain for a three-month period to enable a prospective employer obtain a work permit on her behalf. This permission to remain was subsequently renewed on two occasions and she has permission to remain until 21 June 2006.If the person concerned wishes to take up employment in the State, a prospective employer will first have to obtain a work permit on her behalf. In the event that a work permit is issued in respect of the person concerned, she should return to her local immigration office to have the appropriate permission endorsed on her documents.

The annual Garda budget has a national remit and is not allocated on a programme or county basis. Therefore, it is not possible to quantify Garda expenditure designed to prevent road deaths on a county basis. However, expenditure of funds is consistent with the objectives set out in the annual policing plan, which include Garda duties and initiatives designed to prevent road deaths.The assistant commissioner for traffic has overall responsibility for identifying and recommending necessary expenditure on a national basis. Prior to the establishment of a new traffic corps in 2005, this responsibility lay with the Garda national traffic bureau.I am informed by the Garda authorities that funding for road traffic enforcement technology and road traffic equipment is accounted for under E5 subhead.

The number of speed related fines and dangerous driving incidences for the years 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003 are available in the Garda annual report 2000-2003, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library. The Garda annual report for 2004 is not yet available.I am advised by the Garda authorities that they consider high visibility Garda traffic corps patrols are a deterrent for errant motorists. I am also advised that unmarked cars have limited deterrent effect but are used in appropriate circumstances. Unmarked patrol cars are allocated to the Garda traffic corps and the number will be increased as additional gardaí are allocated to the Garda traffic corps in line with the strategic review of traffic policing 2002. I am informed by the Garda Commissioner, who has responsibility for the allocation of Garda resources, that there are no plans to introduce unmanned patrol cars on the roads and streets.The annual budget provided for the purchase of Garda vehicles, marked and unmarked, is accounted for in the D subhead of the Garda Vote. The actual and budgeted expenditure on the acquisition of Garda vehicles for the years 2000 to 2005 inclusive is as follows.Year€000’s20008,29120017,30720029,58920035,880200414,3522005*10,299*Figures of expenditure for 2005 is the budgeted amount.As the purchase of all Garda vehicles, irrespective of their disposition, must be financed from the funds provided, there is no incremental cost associated with the purchase of such vehicles. Some small operational cost maybe incurred if it is determined to deploy vehicles in such a manner.

A policing plan was prepared and was in operation over the Hallowe'en period. I understand that where bonfire material is located it is removed by Fingal County Council. I am further informed that additional resources, including public order units, were available over the Hallowe'en period in the area concerned and local Garda management is satisfied that adequate resources were available to address any policing issues arising.

The Garda response is being examined by Garda management. I am further informed that the Garda response to all emergency calls received is monitored by Garda management and is the subject of regular examination. An officer is appointed in each Garda division in the Dublin metropolitan region to review the Garda response to all calls, in particular the times of arrival at the scenes of calls. The Garda Síochána is conscious of the demands on all emergency services and members endeavour to respond promptly to calls for assistance.

The PULSE project was initiated in 1996 and development was completed in 2001. As a result of its size and complexity, the system was implemented in a number of phased releases commencing in November 1999 with the final release rolled out nationwide at the end of 2003. As with any major information technology system, there is ongoing support and maintenance together with software and hardware upgrades and replacements required from time to time.

The claim was investigated by the Refugee Applications Commissioner who concluded that the person concerned did not meet the criteria for recognition as a refugee. The commissioner's recommendation was communicated to the person concerned by letter dated 24 March 2005. This communication advised the person concerned of their entitlement to appeal the commissioner's recommendation to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. The person concerned duly appealed the commissioner's recommendation.The Refugee Appeals Tribunal considered the appeal of the person concerned, following which the tribunal affirmed the commissioner's recommendation. The outcome of the appeal was made known to the person concerned by letter dated 14 October 2005.In accordance with normal procedures, the file of the person concerned has been forwarded to my Department's ministerial decisions unit for final processing. A representative of that unit will write to the person concerned in the near future to advise him of his position in the State.

The position as stated in that reply regarding the long-standing policy of the Government in not allowing asylum seekers take up employment remains and, so, the issue of a work permit does not arise.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	993	The current position in respect of the five members of the Garda Síochána in question is as follows. One member was transferred on 24 June 2005 but is now absent without leave and has been taken off the payroll. One member retired from the force before his transfer was to come into effect. One member appealed his transfer to the assistant commissioner, for human resource management. This was refused but the transfer has not yet taken place because the member is on sick leave. One member appealed his transfer to the Commissioner. This was refused but the transfer has not yet taken place because the member is on sick leave and suspended from duty. One member has taken his appeal to the transfers review body — the third and last stage in the appeals process — and his case was heard on Monday, 10 October. The recommendation of the review body is being examined by the Commissioner.It is clear from the foregoing that the Garda Commissioner has taken all available steps to effect each of the proposed transfers. Due process and the right of appeal must be observed, but if we stand back from the detail and look at the position as a whole, we can see that of the five gardaí concerned, one has retired, one is suspended and one is no longer on the payroll. Of the remaining two members, one is on sick leave and one is awaiting the Commissioner's response to the recommendation of the transfers review body.

The Deputy will be aware that all organisations that recruit persons who would have substantial, unsupervised access to children and vulnerable adults will shortly be entitled to avail of the vetting services of the GCVU. The augmentation of the GCVU's existing vetting arrangements will commence on a phased basis upon decentralisation of the unit later this month from Dublin to Thurles, County Tipperary.

The commission's term of office is for three years and its members are: Mr. Jim Mc Hugh, retired Garda assistant commissioner, Chairman; Ms Nora Owen, former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform; Mr. Sean Lowry, former head of the probation and welfare service; Mr. Michael Whelan, Gemini Consulting; and Ms Marian Finucane, broadcaster.The commission's remit is to devise an appropriate support framework for victims of crime into the future and disburse funding for victim support measures. The commission's remit also includes the examination of all aspects of the provision of services for victims of crime within the criminal justice system. These provisions are set out in the victims' charter which was last updated in 1999. In addition, the commission supervises the disbursement of funds to community and other voluntary groups providing victim services, with a particular emphasis on the funding of activities on the ground that provide direct supports for victims of crime. I am advised that the commission has received over 60 applications for funding for measures to support victims of crime in response to a public advertisement earlier this year. The commission examines each application on its merits and makes an independent decision in relation to eligibility for funding.I understand that these included independent applications from a number of former elements of the Victim Support organisation including a group of ten branches that have formed a new Federation for Victim Assistance, as well as the interim board of Victim Support. It should be noted that I decided to terminate funding for the Victim Support organisation with effect from 31 March 2005 because of reductions in service levels and concerns in relation to governance, accountability and value for money arising from ongoing internal difficulties in that organisation and because an independent review, carried out early in 2005, concluded that the organisation was terminally damaged.The Deputy may be interested to note that the commission has already agreed to make funding available to the following: the national crime victims helpline, a single low-call number manned by volunteers and providing information on all services available to victims of crime; Rape Crisis Network; Women's Aid Dublin; Irish Tourist Advisory Service; Support after Homicide group; Advic, a new organisation providing advocacy for families of homicide victims; Court Support Service, which provides impartial practical support for victims and witnesses in court proceedings; Muintir na Tíre, for follow-up support to elderly rural crime victims; ICPAC, the Irish Centre for Parentally Abducted Children; CARI, which provides services to child abuse victims. A number of other applications are under consideration.

The Attorney General approves the appointment having discussed the suitability of counsel for the tribunal with the chairperson. The names of the approved counsel are then submitted to the Department of the Minister responsible for the tribunal, who pays the counsel in accordance with rates sanctioned by the Department of Finance. Counsel to represent Departments before a tribunal are nominated by the Attorney General on a criteria of suitability, expertise and experience and are paid by the Department they represent at rates sanctioned by the Department of Finance.The total cost of legal fees paid in relation to the Morris tribunal since its establishment in April 2002 to the end of September 2005 is €9.94 million.

It was operated by Victim Support and supported by the Garda Síochána. Funding of €110,000 was provided to the helpline by my Department in respect of the years 2002-2004. In addition, my Department also provided funding for the Victim Support organisation.Following a review of existing support provisions, I established the Commission for the Support of Victims of Crime in March 2005. The commission's remit is to devise an appropriate framework support for victims of crime into the future and disburse funding for victim support and assistance measures. Victim Support and its associated services ceased to operate from 31 March, 2005.I am advised that in response to a public advertisement earlier this year the commission has received over 60 applications for funding for measures to support victims of crime. The commission examines each application on its merits and makes an independent decision in relation to eligibility for funding. One of these applications was from the missing persons helpline. I have been informed that the commission made an offer of funding to the helpline and that this offer was refused.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	1003	A survey of the Garda property portfolio was carried out on behalf of the Office of Public Works some time ago to determine and list the Garda properties considered to be economically maintainable and those considered to be uneconomic to repair. Following that survey, the Office of Public Works last year ran a pilot equity exchange programme of eight Garda stations in counties Limerick and Tipperary selected by that office, following consultation with my Department and the Garda authorities. The programme was developed to test the feasibility of exchanging clusters of small Garda stations which cannot be viably maintained in return for new modern station facilities. It was intended to extend this programme to other Garda stations such as Castlepollard.However, I understand from the Office of Public Works that the level of interest expressed was not adequate to meet the requirements of the programme and that the Commissioners of Public Works are now considering alternative approaches. Furthermore, until the Office of Public Works has concluded its deliberations, I am not in a position to indicate when Castlepollard Garda station will be addressed. I can say, however, that in the meantime the Commissioners of Public Works will undertake any essential maintenance works.I understand that the Office of Public Works are aware of the interest that the county council has in the matter.

In addition, the RIA has engaged independent companies with expertise in HACCP and fire safety to conduct inspections on its behalf.Before carrying out an inspection, the inspector reviews the centre file and is aware of any issues that may have arisen in relation to the centre. During the course of the an inspection any resident or member of staff at the centre is free to make any representations they wish to the inspector. During the inspection in question representations were received from some residents. However, no representations were made by any member of staff.

There is no separate permit scheme for persons wishing to engage in work of a self employment nature.The following criteria must be met in order to qualify for business permission: the proposed business must result in the transfer to the State of capital in the minimum sum of €300,000; the proposed business must create employment for at least two EEA nationals; the proposed business must add to the commercial activity and competitiveness of the State; the proposed business must be a viable trading concern and provide the applicant with sufficient income to maintain and accommodate themselves and any dependants without resorting to social assistance or paid employment for which a work permit would be required; the applicant must be of good character and in possession of a valid passport. The current processing time for applications of this type is approximately six to eight months.

I interpret this to mean extradition requests under Part 2 of the Extradition Act 1965, as amended, which have not as yet been certified by me under section 26(1)(a) of the Act and European arrest warrants that have not yet been presented to the High Court for endorsement.There are 24 Part 2 requests and 47 European arrest warrants still being considered by my Department at present. For obvious reasons I cannot indicate the names of the persons involved in any of these requests.The Deputy will appreciate that I, as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, can only exercise my powers under the 1965 Act when I am satisfied that a request has been made in accordance with Part 2 of that Act. I can assure the Deputy, however, that requests for extradition or surrender are dealt with in my Department without any undue delay.The tables which follow set out the date on which each of the 71 requests still under consideration was received in my Department, as well as the principal offence identified in each.Request No.Date ReceivedPrincipal Offence118/1/02Murder/Robbery229/11/02Theft/Driving Offences35/9/03Rape423/10/03Robbery512/12/03Public Disorder65/2/04Fraud/Forgery76/5/04Forgery/Fraud825/5/04Fraud/Forgery925/5/04Fraud1029/7/04Sexual Assault1120/1/05Offences relating to terrorism1220/1/05Armed Robbery136/4/05Murder/Robbery1412/5/05Embezzlement/Theft1525/5/05Theft1625/5/05Theft171/6/05Rape182/8/05Robbery192/8/05Theft/Assault2013/8/05Theft/bodily injury2114/9/05Training for Unlawful Activities/use of false documents2214/9/05Training for Unlawful Activities/use of false documents2314/9/05Training for Unlawful Activities/use of false documents2417/10/05Fraud/ForgeryNo. of OffenceDate ReceivedPrincipal Offence120/02/2004Robbery202/08/2004Assault316/08/2004Fraud416/08/2004Forgery529/08/2004Rape626/10/2004Drug Trafficking710/11/2004Theft824/11/2004Robbery924/02/2005Indecent Assault1005/04/2005Sexual Assault1114/04/2005Sexual Assault1220/04/2005Fraud1320/04/2005Murder1416/05/2005Conspiracy to Rob1517/05/2005Attempted Murder1617/05/2005Attempted Murder1702/06/2005Assault1810/06/2005Assault1916/06/2005Death by Dangerous Driving2020/06/2005Robbery2126/06/2005Rape2228/06/2005Fraud2329/06/2005Racketeering2410/07/2005Handling stolen goods2512/07/2005Drug offences2613/07/2005Terrorist Offences2714/07/2005Theft2814/07/2005Escape from Custody2922/07/2005Fraud3027/07/2005Robbery3109/08/2005Attempted Murder3209/08/2005Attempted Murder3309/08/2005Attempted Murder3410/08/2005Murder3512/08/2005Robbery3617/08/2005Robbery3712/09/2005Fraud Type Offences3816/09/2005Sexual Offences3928/09/2005Drug Trafficking4030/09/2005Drug Offences4130/09/2005Robbery4205/10/2005Assault/Robbery4314/10/2005Robbery4418/10/2005Fraud4521/10/2005Murder4624/10/2005Murder4724/10/2005Murder

In the year to date there have been two recorded public order incidents in respect of the street. Licensed premises in the immediate area are regularly visited and inspected by gardaí. Local Garda management is not aware of any complaints from residents regarding the non-attendance of gardaí at incidents reported.I am assured by the Garda authorities that the area will continue to receive regular attention from both mobile and foot patrols. Furthermore, a community garda is assigned to the area and gives the location regular and ongoing attention.

The Garda is targeting known offenders who are suspected to be engaging in the type of criminal activity referred to. Any breaches of the criminal law detected by the Garda are followed by swift action in dealing with offenders. I am assured that local Garda management is ensuring a concentrated and visible Garda presence is maintained in the area.

The personnel strength has since increased by an additional 16 officers and will further increase as a result of the current recruitment campaign.YearStrength31/12/198525631/12/198625631/12/198726231/12/198825231/12/198924831/12/199024431/12/199124931/12/199225831/12/199324831/12/199425031/12/199524231/12/199624131/12/199723231/12/199823831/12/199923731/12/200024131/12/200123531/12/200224031/12/200324331/12/200424328/10/2005248The overall strength of the Garda Síochána as at 31 December 1985 and 28 October 2005 was 11,182, all ranks, and 12,316, all ranks, respectively, representing an increase of 1,134, or 10%, in that period. The distribution of Garda personnel throughout the country, together with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy, are a matter for the Garda Commissioner and are continually monitored and reviewed, taking account of demographic and crime trends. Such monitoring ensures optimum use is made of Garda resources, and the best possible Garda service is provided to the general public.Several Garda national units have been established during the years such as the Garda national immigration bureau, the Garda bureau of fraud investigations, the criminal assets bureau and other specialist units. These units provide specialised policing services on a nationwide basis and augment the policing services provided at divisional level. The personnel strength of the national units is over and above the strength of the various operational Garda divisions.The accelerated recruitment campaign to reach a record force strength of 14,000, in line with the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government, is fully on target. This will lead to a combined strength, of both attested gardaí and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of 2006. The Garda Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources, and in this context the needs of the Longford-Westmeath division will be fully considered within the overall context of the needs of Garda divisions throughout the country.

I have been assured that the area has received increased Garda attention in the form of patrols. Garda management has been in touch with the proprietor of the premises in question regarding the residents' concerns which I share.I am informed that the enforcement of the liquor licensing laws and prevention of anti-social behaviour remains a top priority for the Garda. When breaches of the law are detected offenders are dealt with accordingly through the courts. Operation Encounter is a Garda initiative designed to provide high visibility policing in problematic areas. It was established with a view to dealing effectively with public order issues in the community which occur particularly late at night and the early hours of the morning, when social venues have closed. Garda management keep this initiative under review so as to tailor it to respond to changing circumstances.Because of my concerns about the abuse of alcohol and its contribution to public order offending and broader social problems, I brought forward tough new provisions to deal with alcohol abuse and its effect on public order in the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003. One of the provisions is the use of temporary closure orders. The Act broadened the application of the temporary closure order penalty, which had been introduced to combat under-age drinking, to cover also convictions for a series of public order offences, such as supplying intoxicating liquor to drunken persons and permitting disorderly conduct on licensed premises.The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003 has also been enacted, the main purpose of which is to provide the Garda Síochána with additional powers to deal with late night street violence and anti-social conduct attributable to excessive drinking. It does this by providing for the closure of premises such as pubs, off licenses, late night clubs and food premises, as well as the making of exclusion orders on individuals, in addition to any penalty they might receive under the 1994 Public Order Act.

It includes the Criminal Justice Act 1984, and its related Treatment of Persons in Custody Regulations 1987; the Child Care Act 1991; the Children Act 2001; lectures entitled, Offences within the Family. This lecture sets out the legal parameters within which children may be interviewed.Training is provided to the general membership of the Garda Síochána through continuous professional development. The training of members in the interviewing of children is provided by the Garda Síochána in liaison with the Health Service Executive and other relevant agencies in accordance with the children first guidelines of 1999. This training is ongoing and it is envisaged that all divisions will be completed shortly. In addition, members of the Garda Síochána participate in the postgraduate diploma course in child protection and welfare at Trinity College, Dublin.On 25 October the Government accepted in principle the recommendations in the report of the Ferns inquiry and gave a commitment to their implementation by line Departments and relevant agencies. With regard to the recommendations relating to Garda procedures, I have forwarded a copy of the report to the Garda Commissioner who is considering it and taking on board its recommendations in this regard. The Garda Síochána is constantly examining ways of establishing best practice in the area of child protection, in association with all other relevant agencies.

I am informed by the Registrar of Titles that, in general, original title documents are retained and filed in the Land Registry after registration and are not returned to the applicant or the lodging party. I am further advised that the policy in Land Registry is to return documents by registered post when applications for registration which are rejected, withdrawn, abandoned or refused; documents which relate to unregistered title; and original documents taken from a pending dealing and returned to the lodging party for amendment.In the case of Registry of Deeds applications, original deeds lodged by post are returned to the lodging party by ordinary post once the deed has been recorded in the registry. This system represents a cost effective method of transporting the large volumes of deeds processed and recorded by the Registry of Deeds. When an application is being queried by the Registry of Deeds, all documents are returned to the lodging party by registered post. It is not the general practice among solicitors to lodge original documents to the registries by registered post.

The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, in conjunction with the committee, has conducted a series of successful awareness raising campaigns dealing with various aspects of this issue in recent years. The steering committee is developing a strategic plan for its work over the next five to ten years, which will include the development of a long-term and wide ranging strategy for raising public awareness of the issue of violence against women. The strategic plan should be completed early next year and will be widely circulated at that time.This strategy is expected to address the information and awareness needs of relevant public officials and health professionals, in partnership with the training and education arrangements already in place for the groups in question. In the case of the Judiciary, which is independent in the exercise of its functions under the law and the Constitution, provision of training and education is a matter for the Judicial Studies Institute, established in 1996 for this purpose. My role in this regard is to support any programmes put in place by the institute through funding made available in the courts Vote which is administered by the Courts Service.

These are the vocational training opportunities scheme, VTOS, Youthreach and senior traveller training centre programmes.The administration of these grants is a matter for individual VECs. Students in the relevant programmes who feel entitled to such grants should apply to their VECs. The disbursement of the grants is a matter for each VEC. The funds provide for the direct provision of crèche facilities in centres, or in rented premises, including staff, equipment, refurbishment, rental, insurance and other overheads and the purchase of places in existing community or commercial crèches. This is subject to payment of a maximum of €63.50 per week per child for a full day session, with  pro rata adjustments for sessions of lesser duration. They also provide for the payment of childminders, subject to a maximum of €63.50 per child per week for a full session, with pro rata adjustments for part-time sessions.The grant is intended to be a contribution to costs. VECs determine the level of child care provision and have the discretion to bridge any gap between the Department's grant and actual costs they approve. Towards this end, the imposition of an age limit on children applying for child care is at the discretion of the VECs.

Where schools are unable to address all issues arising on an incremental basis it is open to the school authority to apply for funding from my Department under the appropriate scheme, in this instance the summer works scheme. The closing date for receipt of applications for the 2006 summer works scheme was 14 October 2006. However, the school will have an opportunity to apply under next year's scheme should this be necessary.The Department also sets aside a contingency sum each year to deal with emergency works in primary and post-primary schools, including health and safety works. If the school authority considers that wheelchair access is required as a matter of urgency to accommodate a particular pupil or staff member, then an application for funding should be submitted for consideration to my Department's school planning and building unit.

Buses serving primary schools which have seat belts fitted are also operating on a one child per adult seat basis. As I announced on 27 July 2005, my intention is that all school transport will be on a one child per seat basis by December 2006.

The pupil is availing of school transport from the catchment boundary of the centre being attended.Under the terms of the post primary school transport scheme, a pupil is eligible for transport is he or she resides 4.8 km or more from his or her local post-primary education centre, that is the centre serving the catchment area in which they live. In addition, an eligible pupil may be allowed the concession of transport, known as catchment boundary transport, to a centre other than his or her local centre, provided there is a seat on the bus to that centre after all eligible pupils have been catered for.

My Department communicated this to the schools concerned at the end of the last school year and is awaiting an update from each of the schools concerned on how their individual arrangements have progressed.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	1046	The closing date for receipt of applications for the summer works scheme 2006 was 14 October 2005. While the scheme was initially advertised on my Department's website on 18 August last, it was subsequently widely publicised in advertisements in the national newspapers on 7, 8 and 11 September. These dates were specifically chosen to allow schools a settling-in period at the commencement of the new school year. In addition, publication of the scheme was brought to the attention of education umbrella groups and representative bodies for the purposes of bringing it to the attention of their members.I am satisfied that, as the thrust of my Department's advertisement campaign took place after the appointment of the principal in question and that advertisements were addressed to school authorities, which includes boards of management, the school has not been disadvantaged relative to all other schools. In the circumstances and in the interest of maintaining the integrity and the openness and transparency of the scheme, I am not in a position to accede to the Deputy's request.It will, of course, be open to the school authority to apply for funding under the 2007 scheme when it is announced next year. In the meantime the school authority can use its devolved grant for minor works to address any minor works it might need.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	1047	I propose to take Questions Nos. 534 to 536, inclusive, together.My Department does not hold details on the number of children who have been identified as needing speech and language therapy services in each primary school in County Tipperary, the number who have been offered speech and language therapy services, the number of children awaiting the preparation of a speech and language report or the number of children on waiting lists for a speech and language service.The provision of therapy services for people with disabilities, including speech therapy, is a matter for the Health Services Executive and funding is provided to the HSE for such purposes. My Department does not employ speech therapists for the delivery of speech therapy services to schools or determine the children that should receive these services and therefore would not have details on the number of therapists responsible for schools in County Tipperary. The recruitment of therapists is a matter for the HSE.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	1048	As the Deputy will be aware, the provision of therapy services for people with disabilities, including speech therapy, is a matter for the Health Services Executive and funding is provided to the HSE for such purposes. My Department does not employ speech therapists for the delivery of speech therapy services to schools or determine the children that should receive these services.The number of national educational psychological service, NEPS, psychologists has increased almost threefold, from 43 on establishment to 123 at present. All schools in County Tipperary have access to psychological assessments for their pupils, either directly through NEPS psychologists or through the scheme for commissioning psychological assessments, SCPA, which is administered by NEPS. Schools that do not have NEPS psychologists assigned to them may avail of the SCPA, whereby the school can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly. Details of this process and the conditions that apply to the scheme are available on my Department's website. NEPS provides assistance to all schools that suffer from critical incidents, regardless of whether they have a NEPS psychologist assigned to them. In relation to all schools, NEPS processes applications for reasonable accommodation in certificate examinations.The Public Appointments Service has recently established new recruitment panels for NEPS. Regional panels are now in place and this will enable my Department to give priority to filling vacancies in areas of greatest need. Any increase in the number of psychologists in NEPS will depend on the availability of resources and must also take account of Government policy on public sector numbers.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	1050	The Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act was enacted in July 2004. On 14 July 2005 sections 1, 2, 14(1)(a), 14(1)(c), 14(2) to 14(4), 19 to 37, 40 to 44 and 50 to 53 of the Act were commenced. Separate establishment day orders were made in respect of the National Council for Special Education and the Special Education Appeals Board, setting their establishment dates as 1 October 2005 and 3 April 2006 respectively. A further commencement order was signed to commence sections 45 to 49 with effect from 1 October 2005 abolishing the council established under section 54 of the Education Act 1998 and replacing it with the council established under the 2004 Act. These sections could not come into effect prior to the establishment of the new council under section 19 of the 2004 Act.The remaining sections relate mainly to the statutory assessment and education plan process for which the Act provides. These cannot come into effect without the council having an opportunity to present an implementation report to the Minister which it must do before 1 October 2006. On 21 October 2005 the National Council for Special Education published a call for submissions in the national media on the implementation of the Act. The closing date for submissions is 13 January 2006 and should the Deputy wish to advise any interested groups on the suggested format in which submissions can be made, there is information available on this from the council.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	1052	The Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002 provides a statutory scheme of financial redress for persons who, as children, were abused while in residential institutional care. The scheme applies in respect of institutions specified in the Schedule to the Act. Section 4 of the Act provides that the Minister for Education and Science may, by order, provide for the insertion in the Schedule of additional institutions in which children were placed and resident and in respect of which a public body had a regulatory or inspection function. Since the enactment of the legislation, my Department has been contacted by individuals and solicitors in relation to various institutions not specified in the Schedule, including the facility mentioned by the Deputy.Following consideration of the matter and consultation with relevant public bodies, I signed an Order on 9 November 2004 which provided for the inclusion of 13 additional institutions in the Schedule. A further order was made on 1 July 2005 adding three institutions to the Schedule. The institution referred to by the Deputy did not qualify for consideration under the provisions of section 4 of the Act. The question of including additional institutions has now been fully considered by my Department in consultation with relevant Departments and it is not proposed to add further institutions to the Schedule at this point.

In considering this application, officials in school planning section are carrying out a review of all-Irish provision at primary level in the Ballymun area. This review will take into account current and future demographics, planned housing developments and the likely demand for all-Irish primary education in the area into the future. It will also take account of the most cost effective manner in which this can be delivered. The outcome of this review, which will be carried out as quickly as possible, will inform a decision on the school's application for capital grant aid.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	1054	I propose to take Questions Nos. 543 and 544 together.My Department received a response from the school in question on 1 November 2005 to its proposals for resourcing the proposed autism unit at the school. This response is now being considered within my Department. I also understand that the local special educational needs organiser, SENO, is continuing to liaise with the school authorities regarding the matter.As the Deputy is aware my officials have been liaising with the school authorities in relation to resources to be made available to facilitate the operation of the classes in the unit. My Department has confirmed that the classes will be capable of catering for up to 12 pupils with autism at a pupil teacher ratio of 6:1. In addition, two full-time special needs assistants, SNA, will be allocated to each class. The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, through the local SENO, will process the relevant application for resources following receipt of a formal application from the board of management of the school for the establishment of the classes. Additional SNAs for the classes may also be considered by the SENO on the basis of the individually assessed needs of the pupils enrolled.The Department is extremely anxious that this purpose-built facility for children with autism will become operational as soon as possible.

The application was assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria, which was revised last year following consultation with the education partners. In general a band three rating is applied to projects such as this one, where there is no deficit of mainstream classroom accommodation at the school. The project is being considered in the context of the 2005-09 school building and modernisation programme.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	1056	The levels of tuition fees for postgraduate courses are set by individual universities and not by my Department. The universities are autonomous institutions and, under the Universities Act 1997, may determine the amount of such fees they charge. I am not aware that there has been a general increase in postgraduate fees of the magnitude outlined by the Deputy. Section 473A, Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides for tax relief on tuition fees, at the standard rate in respect of approved courses at approved colleges of higher education including certain approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in EU and non-EU member states. The maximum level of qualifying fee for tax relief purposes in respect of the academic year 2005 to 2006 is €5,000. Further details and application forms, IT 31 form, to claim tax relief on tuition fees are available from the Revenue Commissioners.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	1057	I assure the Deputy that my Department is well aware of the urgent need for an accommodation solution for this school particularly given the limitations on the existing arrangement. The property management section of the Office of Public Works, which acts on behalf of my Department with regard to site acquisitions generally has identified a suitable site for the school referred to by the Deputy and the process of acquisition has been initiated. Due to commercial sensitivities I am unable to comment further on the specific site acquisition.Once the site acquisition is finalised, the building project required to provide a permanent building for the school will be progressed in the context of the 2005-09 school buildings and modernisation programme. As the board and patron are already aware, the provision of interim accommodation remains the responsibility of the board until such time as my Department is in a position to provide a permanent solution.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	1062	The level of funding my Department provides to Educate Together as a school management body is on a par with that provided to Foras Patrúnachta na Scoileanna Lánghaeilge, the Church of Ireland Board of Education, the Islamic Board of Education and the National Association of Boards of Management in Special Education. However, following discussions with Educate Together my Department has provided additional funding to Educate Together in 2005 to meet the immediate issues of concern to that body. The matter of the future funding to be provided to the primary management bodies, including Educate Together, in 2006 will be considered as part of the normal Estimates process.With regard to support for the establishment of new multi-denominational schools, it should be noted that my Department has supported the establishment of many new Educate Together schools in recent years. Of the 24 new schools granted provisional recognition in the past three years, 12 of them are under Educate Together patronage, 11 of which are open. My Department has made a number of changes in recent years which have made the provision of accommodation for new schools much easier. One of these changes, which was strongly welcomed by Educate Together, was the abolition of the local contribution to the building costs for state-owned school buildings, which had cost up to €63,500 per school. Other innovations include the development of the design and build model to provide permanent accommodation much faster, such as in the case of the new Educate Together school in Griffeen Valley, Lucan, which was designed and built in under 13 months.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	1063	Under the terms of my Department's third level maintenance grant schemes, a mature student is defined as a candidate who is at least 23 years of age on 1 January of the year of entry or re-entry to an approved course. Mature students are categorised as either independent mature students or mature students dependent on parents. An independent mature student is defined to mean a mature student who was not ordinarily resident at home with his or her parents from the October preceding their entry or re-entry to an approved course. Independent mature students are assessed without reference to either their parents' income or address.When assessing the means of students other than independent mature students, the schemes specify that the students' means and those of their parents or guardians must be below a prescribed limit. This provision requires that parental income be taken into account irrespective of the individual circumstances in any case where the student is not an independent mature student. Generally speaking, candidates continue to be assessed under the terms and conditions of the scheme appropriate to their year of entry. Accordingly, candidates who were not classified as independent mature students at the time of entry to an approved course may not generally be assessed as such for the duration of their courses.While the candidate in question is now 24 years of age she will continue to be assessed for her PhD under the terms and conditions of the scheme appropriate to her year of entry. There is, however, provision under the terms of the 2005 schemes for candidates who are re-entering as mature students, following a break in study of at least one year, to pursue or complete an approved course for the first time. Such candidates may be assessed under the terms of the scheme appropriate to the year in which they re-enter. The terms of my Department's schemes of student support must be applied impartially and it is not possible to make exceptions in individual cases. There are no plans at present to make changes to the existing arrangements.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	1087	The roll-out of broadband internet connectivity to all recognised primary and post-primary schools is being undertaken in partnership with industry, following the establishment of a three-year €18 million joint Government-IBEC telecommunications and internet federation, TIF, fund. The broadband connectivity is being provided via a schools national broadband network supported by HEAnet, which will provide managed Internet access, e-mail, security controls, content filtering and other services designed to enhance the educational process. A broadband support service is being provided by the NCTE to assist schools with advice and information relating to the roll-out and ongoing use of their broadband connectivity within the schools network.Following a public tendering process last year, contracts were awarded to six firms for the provision of access connectivity across the nearly 4,000 schools involved. These companies are Digiweb, Smart Telecom, Irish Broadband, BT Ireland, Last Mile and HS Data. The contract for the provision of a broadband router at school level, where appropriate, was awarded to Eircom. The roll-out process is now well under way and the schools national broadband network and the service desk have been established and are operational.As of 1 November 2005, the number of schools which have had their basic connectivity service installed was 1,801 and the number of schools which have had their router installed, either separately or as part of the basic connectivity service, was 784. In this regard, the satellite provision for 135 schools contains the necessary functionality and does not require the provision of a separate router. It is expected that the roll-out will be fully completed by March 2006.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	1088	I confirm for the Deputy that a total of 641 new appointee whole time equivalent special needs assistants, SNAs, were placed on my Department's SNA payroll from 1 September 2005. In addition, a total of 480 whole time equivalent SNAs were re-appointed on my Department's SNA payroll from 1 September 2005. In total, there are more than 6,600 whole time equivalent SNAs in our schools supporting children with special needs, more than 6,000 of whom are in primary schools and almost 600 in second level schools.Where the care needs of a pupil have been clearly identified in a professional report, and where the criteria for the allocation of such support as outlined in circular 07/02 is met, it is not the case that such support would be refused or disallowed but that the support may be granted on an individual or shared basis. The National Council for Special Education will undertake to review a decision on SNA support on foot of a request from a school or parents-guardians, when accompanied by relevant additional information, which may not have been to hand at the time of the decision.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	1089	I propose to take Questions Nos. 579 to 581, inclusive, together.The report of the action group on access to third level education, which was launched in July 2001, made detailed recommendations concerning the target group of "those most in need" which has been defined in terms of the child dependants of people receiving long-term welfare payments, where the necessary conditions are fulfilled.The action group recommended the introduction of special rates of maintenance grants for disadvantaged students, usually referred to as "top-up" grants and advised that an income limit should be fixed at a level which would, at a minimum, include persons on unemployment assistance, long-term, with a qualified adult allowance, full rate. The special rate of maintenance grant was introduced for the 2000 to 2001 academic year.Following a review in early 2002, the income thresholds for the award of the special rate of grant were increased. In addition, the criteria was broadened significantly and a number of additional social welfare payments were included as eligible payments for the purpose of the scheme. Since 2002 to 2003, the total reckonable income limit has been based on the maximum point of the old age contributory pension plus the maximum qualified adult allowance for a person over 66 years. This yielded an annual income threshold of €15,626 for the 2005 scheme.To qualify for the top-up grant in the academic year 2005-06 all candidates must satisfy the following conditions. They must qualify for the ordinary maintenance grant in respect of the academic year 2005 to 2006. Their total reckonable income limit in the tax year to 31 December 2004 must not exceed €15,626, net of standard exclusions, as set out in the 2005 maintenance grants schemes and net of CDA payments, where applicable. As at 31 December 2004, the reckonable income of parent or parents, guardian or guardians, the candidate himself or herself or the income of the spouse or partner as the case may be, must include one of the eligible social welfare payments prescribed under the scheme.Where the reckonable income exceeds the "top-up" income limit of €15,626 the candidate is ineligible for ‘top-up' grant assistance. The decision on eligibility for third level grants is a matter for the relevant local authority or VEC. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is desired.If an individual applicant considers that he or she has been unjustly refused a maintenance grant, or that the rate of grant awarded is not correct, she or he may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC.Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant local authority or VEC, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in his or her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. Alternatively, as already indicated, the local authority or VEC may, itself, in exceptional circumstances, seek clarification on issues from my Department. However, it is not open to me, or my Department, to depart from the terms of the maintenance grants schemes in individual cases.The following paragraphs outline the estimated number of persons who qualified for a top-up in the last five years based on information received from awarding authorities together with details of the rate of grant and the list of eligible payments in respect of the 2005 to 2006 scheme.As far as the award of a special rate of maintenance grant in respect of the 2005-06 academic year is concerned, a candidates reckonable income, for the period 1 January 2004 to 31 December 2004, the 2004 tax year, shall not exceed: €15,626 net of standard exclusions and net of child dependant increase paid by the Department of Social and Family Affairs.As of 31 December 2004, this reckonable income must include one of the social welfare payments listed as follows. First, the category of social assistance payments includes blind person's pension, carer's allowance, deserted wife's allowance, disability allowance, farm assist, lone parent's allowance, unemployment assistance where held for 391 days or more, old age non-contributory pension, one-parent family payment, orphans non-contributory pension, pre-retirement allowance, prisoner's wife's allowance and the widow's or widower's non-contributory pension.Second, the category of social insurance payments includes carer's benefit, deserted wife's benefit, invalidity pension, unemployability supplement, the orphan's pension associated with the occupational injuries death benefit, occupational injuries death benefit, that is, a pension for a widow or widower, old age contributory pension, orphan's contributory allowance, unemployment benefit which is continuous for at least 12 months, widow's or widower's contributory pension and the retirement pension.Third is the family income supplement, FIS. Fourth, the designated programmes include the back to education allowance, the back to work allowance for employees, the back to work enterprise allowance, the community employment scheme, FÁS training programmes including apprenticeships, Jobstart, the part time job incentive scheme and the vocational training opportunities scheme, VTOS. Fifth is the category of others, which includes those: in receipt of payments under the Fáilte Ireland skills programme equivalent to a social welfare payment; in receipt of payments under the FIT, Fastrack to IT, initiative equivalent to a social welfare payment; who are participants on a training course approved by a Department, State agency or area partnership and who were in receipt of an eligible payment prior to progressing to the programme; grant aided employees in social economy enterprises; and those in receipt of payments under the senior traveller training centre programmes.The following table gives details of the number of students who qualified for top-up grant.Scheme2000-012001-022002-032003-042004-05Top-Up Holders2,3163,4229,98411,50012,500 approximately.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	1091	As the Deputy is aware, in October 1999 Cork Institute of Technology and University College Cork made a joint proposal to establish a Cork college of higher education. A former city manager of Cork was appointed in January 2000 to undertake further analysis of the project and this report was presented to my Department in January 2001. A task force was then established to scope the detailed arrangements for the establishment of the college including site identification, proposed course mix, management structures, etc. A site for the proposed college was identified in the grounds of the diocesan college at Farranferris.However, the review and prioritisation of capital projects in the higher education sector of 2004, the Kelly report, considered the proposal and stated that the group considered that the policy framework for this project required further development before a meaningful review of the investment requirement could be undertaken. In light of the Kelly report, a re-examination of the proposal would be required before any capital funding, including capital funding to acquire a site, could be considered. Pending such an examination it would not be appropriate to proceed with the further development of the proposal.The Deputy should be aware that the number of third level places in Cork has increased dramatically since 1999, when the proposal to establish a Cork college of higher education was made, through a major expansion of both UCC and CIT.Student numbers in UCC increased by 28% between 1998 and 2004, while student numbers in CIT increased by 43% during the same period. Over €110 million has been invested in capital projects in these two instructions since 1997.The number of students from Cork going to third level in their home county or elsewhere in the country has also increased considerably, with an increase of more than 18% in the number of 17 to 19 year olds from Cork entering third level between 1998 and 2003. Indeed the third level participation rate in Cork is above the national average. Targeted measures are in place to assist students from disadvantaged areas in going to third level and these are helping more students from these areas to avail of a third level education than ever before.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	1094	It is the policy of my Department to provide all new schools with access for all facilities and special toilets for disabled teachers and students. In addition, new schools with two or more storeys are provided with lifts. My Department advises school authorities and their design teams of accessibility requirements during the architectural planning process of projects.Concerning access for all to existing school buildings, my Department will respond as promptly as possible to a request from a school authority for funding for adaptations necessary to allow any person with mobility problems to access the building.With regard to health and safety matters, individual school authorities are responsible, in the first instance, for ensuring the safety and welfare of children and others in their care. In accordance with the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 1989, it is the responsibility of school management authorities to have a safety statement in place in their schools. Schools are obliged to identify possible hazards, assess the risks to health and safety and put appropriate safeguards in place.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	1095	Enrolment decisions are the responsibility of the board of management of each individual school. My Department has no role in respect of processing applications for enrolment by schools.Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, provides parents with an appeal process where a board of management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the board refuses enrolment to a student. Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of my Department. Where an appeal under section 29 is upheld, the Secretary General of my Department may direct a school to enrol a pupil.The National Educational Welfare Board, NEWB is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child. The NEWB can be contacted at National Educational Welfare Board, National Headquarters, 16-22 Green Street, Dublin 7 or by telephone at 01-8738700.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	1096	My Department was recently informed of a proposal to amalgamate the two schools to which the Deputy refers. As a matter of course in amalgamation scenarios, technical inspections are carried out on existing buildings to determine which, if any, would be suitable to act as a host for the new school. My Department will be in direct contact with the school authorities in question when it is in a position to schedule a technical inspection of the buildings concerned.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	1097	Teacher allocations to second level schools and vocational education committees, VECs, are approved annually by my Department in accordance with established rules based on recognised pupil enrolment. Each school management authority is required to organise its timetable and subject options having regard to pupils needs within the limit of its approved teacher allocation. Apart from meeting requirements in respect of the provision of core subjects, the curriculum offered in individual second level schools is a matter for the authorities concerned having regard to its approved teacher allocation. My Department has approved some 410 VPT, PLC, places and an allocation of 25.63 wholetime teacher equivalents for the provision of VPT, PLC, courses at County Kilkenny VEC for the 2005-06 academic year. This allocation is based on a pupil teacher ratio of 16:1. The distribution of student places and the attendant teacher allocation across individual schools is an operational matter for County Kilkenny VEC.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	1098	The position is that the Government has decided that all members of the national teachers' and secondary teachers' superannuation schemes in service on 31 March 2004 should be given the option of joining the revised spouses' and children's contributory pension scheme. This decision was taken following a recommendation of the joint union and management working group which considered the introduction of pension reforms arising from the work of the Commission on Public Service Pensions.The revised scheme provides pension benefits for the spouse and children of the member and unlike the original scheme, includes provision for the spouse of a member who marries after retirement, for the children of a member which are born after the member's retirement and for non-marital children. Persons in pensionable service between 31 March 2004 and 31 August 2005 will have the option of joining the revised scheme or of retaining their existing status. This includes those teachers still in service who, on the introduction of the original scheme, opted not to join at that time.Membership of the revised scheme will be mandatory for persons who commence teaching in primary, secondary, community and comprehensive schools on or after 1 September 2005. Membership will also be mandatory for persons who return to teach on or after that date and who were not in pensionable teaching service at any time during the period from 31 March 2004 to 31 August 2005. The contribution rates for teachers who opt to join the revised scheme, having been members of the original scheme, will remain unchanged at 1.5% of ongoing pay, together with, where the teacher is married at retirement, 1% of pay at retirement in respect of pre-entry service, that is, service given before the introduction of the original scheme. Contributions at the 1% rate may also be payable at retirement by a teacher who is not married at that time but has been married at some stage since the introduction of the original scheme.In line with the recommendations of the joint union and management working group, increased contributions will be payable by teachers who join the revised scheme, having previously opted not to join the original scheme: the contribution rates will be 2% of ongoing pay, together with, where the teacher is married at retirement, 1.5% of pay at retirement in respect of pre-entry service, that is, service given before the introduction, from 1 April 2004, of the revised scheme. Contributions at the 1.5% rate may also be payable at retirement by a teacher who is not married at that time but has been married at some stage since the introduction, from 1 April 2004, of the revised scheme.A detailed circular setting out the arrangements for the introduction of the revised scheme, including the contribution conditions, issued to schools earlier this year, that is, to secondary schools in May and to primary schools in June. Arrangements are now being made to issue individual option forms to some 47,000 teachers and it is expected that the teachers concerned will receive the option forms before the end of November. Teachers will have until 31 March 2006 to exercise their options.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	1099	I am aware of the provisions of the National Archives Act 1986 and the general requirement relating to transfer to the National Archives of Department records which are more than 30 years old. However, the Act also provides for the retention of records that are in regular use by a particular Department and where their transfer to the National Archives would seriously interfere with the administration of that Department.The records to which the Deputy refers are in active use by officials of my Department in complying with current legislation relating to the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse and the Residential Institutions Redress Board. Their transfer to the National Archives at this time would seriously hinder my Department's ability to meet its statutory and administrative obligations in facilitating and assisting the work of the commission and the redress board. At this stage, it is anticipated that the work of the both will be completed in 2008 and, consequently, it is unlikely that my Department will be in a position to give consideration to the transfer of the relevant records to the National Archives until then.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	1100	My Department does not prescribe any special rules for the treatment of pregnant schoolgirls by school authorities. However, I expect that in dealing with any particular case, school management would have regard to the sensitivity of the situation and would have as its priority the well being of the pupil concerned. I would hope that pregnancy would cause no more than a temporary absence from school and each pupil would be in a position to resume her education following the birth of the child.It will be appreciated that no two sets of circumstances will be identical and, accordingly, management practice will vary from case to case. Generally, when it comes to the attention of the school that a pupil is pregnant, the school authorities check to ensure that the girl is receiving appropriate medical assistance and counselling advice. Schools endeavour to be sensitive and understanding to the girl's needs while trying to ensure that her education is not neglected. Home tuition is provided to pregnant schoolgirls. It is provided to pupils who are absent from school during the later stages of pregnancy or immediately following the birth of a baby when attendance may be impractical.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	1101	All recognised primary and post-primary schools are required to offer relationships and sexuality education, RSE. It is an integral part of the social, personal and health education, SPHE, curriculum at primary level and at junior cycle post-primary level. In addition, all schools are required to have an agreed school policy and a suitable relationships and sexuality education programme in place for senior cycle pupils. Comprehensive guidelines for junior cycle and senior cycle have also been published and distributed to schools by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, to support the RSE aspects of the curriculum. An integrated SPHE programme at senior cycle incorporating RSE is also being developed.The overall aims of the SPHE curricula are to foster the personal development, health and well being of students and help them to create supportive relationships and become responsible citizens, to develop a framework of values, attitudes, understanding and skills that will inform their actions and decision making and to establish and maintain healthy patterns of behaviour. The RSE programme at senior cycle deals further with these issues and addresses issues such as pregnancy, contraception, sexually transmitted diseases, sexual harassment, sexual assault and accepting sexual orientation.A national SPHE support service was established in September 2000 and provides a full-time support service in collaboration with the areas of the Health Service Executive to assist schools to deliver the programme. SPHE programmes are designed to enable children and young people to develop a framework of values, attitudes, understanding and life skills that will inform their decisions and actions both during their time in school and in their future lives.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	1102	As Minister for Education and Science, I am always concerned for the general welfare of children. Any experience that interferes with a child's potential for learning is of particular concern to me. The National Education Psychological Service, NEPS, of my Department provides an educational psychological service to primary and post-primary schools. The NEPS also supports all schools in the context of traumatic incidents arising from violence in the home or in community. When a case involving circumstances such as those mentioned by the Deputy comes to the attention of NEPS, guidance counsellors, teachers or principals, the child in question is always referred to the Health Service Executive at local level for appropriate investigative and therapeutic services. In addition, a guidance and counselling service is available in all post-primary schools.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	1103	My Department is in receipt of an application for an extension at the school to which the Deputy refers. The long-term accommodation needs of the school are under review and further information is awaited from its authority to finalise this matter. Progress on the proposed works will be considered in the context of the school building and modernisation programme from 2006 onwards. The school authority has also applied to my Department for additional temporary accommodation. The school planning section of my Department will be in contact with the school authority shortly in relation to this matter.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	1104	The building project for the school referred to by the Deputy is at an early stage of architectural planning. The school in question was listed in my announcement of April this year as a project to progress through architectural planning up to pre-tender stage, namely, up to and including advanced architectural planning. The letter referred to by the Deputy in January 2004 did give provision for the school in question to proceed to advanced architectural planning provided the sketch scheme at that time was approved by my Department. However, the project did not move to advanced architectural planning as the brief changed in August of 2004 to reflect an increase in enrolments at the school and it was necessary to request a revised sketch scheme to take account of this.My Department's officials are in the process of examining a recently received stage 2, developed sketch scheme, submission, which reflects the change in brief as of August 2004, and when this examination is completed will be in contact with the school authorities with regard to the next steps involved in progressing this building project. Progression of projects to construction will be considered in the context of the School Building and Modernisation Programme 2005-09.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	1106	My Department has implemented a rolling review, evaluation process and monitoring of the operation phase of the school bundle public private partnership project. This process takes the form of regular meetings with the school principals, both as a group and individually, regular meetings with Jarvis personnel and detailed reviews of the monthly reports for each school provided by Jarvis as provided for under the project agreement. An interim evaluation report is being undertaken on each of the five schools that covers the operation of the contract on the ground and any issues of concern that have arisen.In terms of educational impact, it is planned to include each of the schools in the rolling programme of whole school evaluation. From my Department's monitoring of the contract to date, it is clear that the output and service requirements contained in the project agreement are being complied with. While there were some problems in the early days, particularly around the delivery and quality of some items of equipment for specialist classrooms, these were ironed out between the Department, schools and the operator in accordance with the contract arrangements.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	1107	Ensuring the protection, health and welfare of children is a key concern for the Government, parents, agencies that work with children and society generally and I can assure the Deputy that the Government is determined to do all it can to keep our children and vulnerable adults safe.In the education sector, vetting is available in respect of prospective employees of children in detention schools as well as special needs assistants, SNAs, and bus escorts to children with special needs. My colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science with special responsibility for children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, announced a doubling of the number of staff employed in the unit to ensure that they can handle a greater volume of requests from employers. The unit will commence the augmentation of its existing vetting arrangements upon decentralisation targeted for mid-November this year. The provision of additional staff resources will enable the Garda Síochána's vetting services to be extended to all persons working with children and vulnerable adults, including teachers, caretakers, bus drivers and others working with children.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	1108	A national curriculum in social, personal and health education, SPHE, incorporating relationships and sexuality education, has been developed at junior cycle level and been made mandatory for all schools with effect from September 2003. All schools are required to have an agreed school policy and a suitable relationships and sexuality education programme in place for senior cycle pupils. Comprehensive guidelines for junior cycle and senior cycle have also been published and provided to schools by the NCCA to support the RSE aspects of the curriculum. An integrated SPHE programme at senior cycle incorporating RSE is being developed.The SPHE modules at junior cycle in post-primary schools deal specifically with belonging and integrating, handling conflict constructively, dealing with peer pressure, influences on decision making, relationships and sexuality in terms of values, reproductive system, tackling myths about sex and pregnancy, personal safety, substance use and the impact of teenage pregnancy. Child protection guidelines that were distributed to post-primary schools in November 2004 were produced in consultation with the partners in education to meet the needs for schools to have in place clear procedures which teachers and other school staff should follow where they suspect or are alerted to possible child abuse. The guidelines reflect the particular circumstances of the post-primary school setting and provide management authorities and staff with guidance in relation to recognising the signs and symptoms of child abuse and with procedures for dealing immediately with such concerns.A central facet of the guidelines is the requirement for each board of management to designate a senior member of staff as the designated liaison person for the school. This person will act as a liaison for the school in all dealings with the Health Service Executive, An Garda Síochána and other parties, in connection with allegations of and/or concerns about child abuse and as a resource person to staff who may have child protection concerns.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	1109	The issue of child protection and ensuring that all children in every primary school are aware of child protection issues are high priority areas for my Department. The Stay Safe programme is a personal safety programme for children. It is designed to give children the knowledge and necessary skills to help them deal with potentially abusive or threatening situations. However, it is also recognised that the programme must cover those individuals closely involved with children on a daily basis, namely, parents, guardians and teachers. To this end, professional in-service courses for teachers and parent awareness seminars have been put in place at individual school level. This is in addition to the teaching of a personal safety skills programme to pupils.The training of teachers, parents and boards of management in the Stay Safe programme and the development of guidelines and procedures for a school policy on child protection is provided by a network of 31 regionally based teachers who are available to the programme on a part-time basis. This support supplements the assistance provided by the Department of Health and Children, which maintains an administrative office for the Stay Safe Programme. An initial one day in-service training seminar on the Stay Safe programme has been provided for all primary schools. Since the programme was introduced, 99.7% of primary schools have participated in this training. At present, approximately, 80% to 85% of primary schools are teaching the programme to their students.Although it should be noted that the Stay Safe programme is not mandatory, the teaching of the overall issue of child protection is now an integral element of the subject of social, personal and health education, SPHE, which is part of the primary curriculum taught in every school. The introduction of SPHE as subject on the revised primary school curriculum combined with the implementation of the national child protection guidelines Children First gave an additional impetus to the Stay Safe programme. It is a priority of my Department to ensure that a high level of awareness and necessary skills to address child protection issues, which includes the implementation of the Stay Safe programme, is maintained in all schools. For this reason, my Department will continue to support the promotion of child protection within the context of the SPHE curriculum.

The military have costed the refurbishment of some buildings necessary to effect compliance with building, health and safety and fire regulations to provide permanent accommodation and catering facilities for RDF summer camps. The estimated cost of approximately €4 million raises value for money considerations. Therefore, there are no plans at present to carry out any major building or refurbishment works on the barracks.Western Brigade is well served with training facilities for RDF personnel at Finner Camp, Donegal, Dun Uí Mhaoilíosa, Galway; Custume Barracks, Athlone, Columb Barracks, Mullingar, Connolly Barracks, Longford and Dun Uí Néill, Cavan where accommodation and training facilities are of the highest standard. The military authorities have informed me that there is no evidence of overcrowding in RDF summer camps in the western brigade.

A detailed service level agreement for the provision of an air ambulance service by the Air Corps, prepared by my Department and the Department of Health and Children, in consultation with the Health Service Executive and the Defence Forces, which are all signatories to the agreement, has recently been finalised and signed. The agreement sets out the range of the service to be provided by the Air Corps, specifically interhospital transfers for spinal and serious injuries and illnesses, air transport of neonates requiring immediate medical intervention within Ireland, air transport of patients requiring organ transplants in the United Kingdom, air transport of organ harvest teams within Ireland and air transport of patients from offshore islands to mainland hospitals where the Irish Coast Guard service is not available.Both of the new helicopter types will have the capacity of being configured for the air ambulance role and an air ambulance kit is part of the additional equipment ordered with the helicopters. Both kits will be fully certified for airborne use and will enable the transfer of one patient with up to two medical personnel in the helicopter cabin. Both systems will incorporate basic medical facilities such as electrical power, oxygen supply and suction.

The pension entitlements of former members of the PDF arising from overseas service with the United Nations are entirely a matter for my Department and the UN does not grant any such pensions.The type of injuries for which disability pensions are granted is wide and varied and would include the likes of back injuries, noise induced hearing loss, injuries to limbs and gunshot wounds. Records are not maintained by my Department in a format that would enable the other specific information sought by the Deputy to be readily extracted. While precise details are not available, it is estimated that overall only a small proportion, less than 10%, of service pensioners were discharged on medical grounds and that approximately 70% of the disability pensions awarded since 1 January 2000 were either wholly or partly related to service at home.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	1113	I propose to take Questions Nos. 609 to 611, inclusive, and 614 and 615 together.I am informed by the military authorities that, since the publication of the Gleeson report in July 1990, 293 members of the Permanent Defence Force have been medically discharged. The average length of service of these personnel was 16.3 years. I am advised by the military authorities that the number of Permanent Defence Force enlisted personnel who have been discharged since the Gleeson report with less than 31 years service and less than 21 years service is 9,182 and 6,096, respectively.The number of Permanent Defence Force personnel who have left the Permanent Defence Force with more than three years service and less than 21 years service since the Gleeson report is 4,084. This figure includes 430 commissioned officers who retired or resigned in this period. The average length of service of all of these personnel was 12.7 years. The number of Permanent Defence Force personnel who have taken voluntary early retirement since the Gleeson report is 2,180. This figure includes officers who left the Permanent Defence Force before their mandatory age of retirement and those persons of all ranks who availed of the voluntary early retirement,  scheme in the period 1996-98. A total of 1,509 personnel availed of the scheme in the period 1996-98. All superannuation benefits of former members of the Permanent Defence Force are based on pensionable service and retiring rank, payable by way of pension and-or gratuity in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Defence Forces pensions schemes.The additional statistical information requested by the Deputy regarding the medical categories of those discharged and the pensions awarded is not readily available in either electronic or paper format. Such information could only be obtained from examining the personal and pension files of each member who left the Defence Forces over the past 15 years. This task would involve an inordinate amount of time and resources, which I do not consider warranted by the public interest.

The provision of housing is primarily a matter for the local authorities and married military personnel have an equal claim on such housing as other members of the community in the same income category. While details relating to 1990 are not readily available, in 1993 there were a total of 517 quarters, 61 for officers and 456 for enlisted personnel. At present, a total of 155 such quarters remain in service, 37 for officers and 118 for enlisted personnel.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	1117	The Government is committed to a policy of equal opportunity for men and women in the Defence Forces, Army, Air Corps and Naval Service, including the Reserve Defence Force, and to the full participation by women in all aspects of Defence Forces activities. In effect this means women are eligible on the same basis as men for participation in operational and ceremonial activities, for assignment to all military appointments and educational and training courses and for promotion. All female personnel undergo the same training and receive the same military education as their male counterparts.In order to encourage increased participation by women in the Defence Forces my predecessor decided in March 1998 to reduce the height requirement for all female recruits to 162.5 cm or 5 ft. 4 in. This height requirement now also applies to male recruits. As I indicated to the House on 29 September that requirement is kept under constant review. I have asked the military authorities to report to me on it. I will review the height requirement in the light of that report.The Defence Forces actively encourage female applicants in a number of ways. Where possible, all graphical advertisements and booklets produced for the Defence Forces show both male and female personnel and emphasise that all applicants are assessed on an equal basis. Stands at recruiting fairs are generally staffed by male and female personnel, and when the Defence Forces are invited to give talks at all female or mixed schools, every effort is made to have a female speaker.Over the past eight years, the strength of female personnel in the Permanent Defence Force has grown from 244 at the end of 1997 to 524 at the end of August 2005. This constitutes an increase of over 100% in the number of females serving over this period. On 5 August 2005 I wrote to both the Department of Education and Science and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform along with a number of outside organisations seeking their views and recommendations on how more women might be encouraged to enlist in the Defence Forces. While to date a number of replies have been received, a number are still outstanding. When these submissions have been received and examined, I propose that officials, both civil and military, of my Department will meet representatives of each of the organisations who made submissions along with the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, RACO, and the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association, PDFORRA, to consider the ideas and suggestions to see what, if any, improvements or changes can be made to the programme of recruitment so as to encourage more females to join the Defence Forces.

Meath County Council's proposals to prepare contract documents to extend one of the two rising mains to cater for additional development is under examination in my Department and is being dealt with as quickly as possible.The Slane and Stamullen, Gormanstown, Mosney sewerage schemes were 13th and 15th, respectively, in the list of water and sewerage schemes submitted by Meath County Council in response to my Department's request to all local authorities in 2003 to undertake assessments of the needs for capital works in their areas and to prioritise their proposals on the basis of the assessments. The priority lists were taken into account in the framing of the water services investment programme 2004-06, published in May 2004. Given the ratings afforded to the schemes by the council, it was not possible to include them in the programme. I envisage that local authorities will be afforded an opportunity in 2006 to undertake fresh assessments of their needs and priorities which can then be taken into account in subsequent phases of the programme.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	1125	In accordance with the EU water framework directive, the national water services pricing policy framework provides for the recovery by sanitary authorities of the cost of providing water services from the users of these services, with the exception of households using the services for domestic purposes. The policy framework requires full recovery of the cost of providing water services to the non-domestic sector by means of a meter based volumetric charge and the full metering of this sector by December 2006. The framework does not provide for the exemption of any classes of non-domestic users from the charging policy.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	1130	In accordance with the EU water framework directive, national water services pricing policy provides for the full recovery by sanitary authorities of the cost of providing water services from the users of these services, on the basis of average operational and marginal capital costs, with the exception of households using water services for domestic purposes. This recovery of the cost of providing water services to the non-domestic sector is to be mainly achieved by means of meter based volumetric charges; metering of the non-domestic sector for this purpose is to be completed by December 2006.All projects funded under my Department's water services investment programme now require that the marginal capital cost of servicing non-domestic consumers should be met by the non-domestic sector. Marginal capital cost is to be calculated on the basis of existing and future non-domestic capacity requirements which vary from scheme to scheme. Non-domestic marginal capital costs are recovered by a sanitary authority from all non-domestic consumers in its functional area, on a county-wide basis, through a combination of water charges on non-domestic customers and planning levies on future development. In general, the capital and operational costs of water services provision is charged to the non-domestic sector on the basis of metered use. The power for a local authority to charge for the supply of water is provided for in section 65A of the Public Health (Ireland) Act 1878, as amended by the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act 1962 and the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act 1997.

Until the tender process has been completed, it will not be possible to indicate when construction will commence.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	1136	The public private partnership, PPP, concerned is for a waste to energy plant which will be procured by Dublin City Council on behalf of the four Dublin local authorities, in accordance with their joint waste management plan. Under guidelines issued by the Department of Finance, my Department is required to monitor compliance by local authorities with public policy in regard to PPP procurement. Following submissions from Dublin City Council, and consultation with the National Development Finance Agency, my Department has now issued the necessary certification of this compliance to Dublin City Council in the present case. It is now a matter for Dublin City Council to enter into resulting contractual arrangements with the preferred private partner. Pending the conclusion of these contractual arrangements, it would not be appropriate for my Department to make available information which is commercially sensitive or which might prejudice the conclusion of the arrangements.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	1137	My Department submitted implementation plans to the Decentralisation Implementation Group on the decentralisation of the Department's Dublin operations to four locations in the south east, Wexford, Waterford, New Ross and Kilkenny. These plans are also published on my Department's website at www.environ.ie.The plans inter alia identify the risks attendant on the decentralisation process and measures which are proposed to address these. The main risks identified at this stage relate to loss of knowledge arising from the anticipated significant high turnover of staff in all Dublin based areas of the Department. A number of mitigation strategies are in place or are being developed to facilitate skills and knowledge transfer from existing staff to their replacements. These strategies include the recruitment of new staff as early as possible, the phased transfer of existing staff out of the Department, the implementation of a comprehensive training and development plan and making available updated work guidelines and process maps.Other strategies will provide for the greater use of communication technologies such as intranet, e-mail and video conferencing to deal with the requirements of communication in a decentralised environment. Further risks may be identified as the implementation plans proceed through further iterations and mitigation strategies will be developed as additional information emerges about people, property and business issues. The overall costs of the decentralisation programme to my Department cannot be quantified at this stage, but will be agreed with the Department of Finance in the context of the Estimates process over the lifetime of the programme. The more significant costs arising, which are being borne by the Office of Public Works, involve the acquisition and fit-out of office accommodation.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	1138	Bray Town Council adopted its development plan for 2005 to 2011 on 12 April 2005. The question of including objectives for the zoning of land for different uses is a matter for each planning authority to address in the context of its development plan. Under the Planning and Development Act 2000, planning authorities may also include in their development plans objectives regulating, restricting or controlling development in areas at risk of flooding. Development plan objectives may also included policies indicating that developers will be required to support funding of flood defences needed for particular developments, either partially or fully, depending on the circumstances involved.The Bray Town Council development plan includes a requirement to the effect that all development proposals must include appropriate measures for the protection of the subject site, and other lands in its vicinity, from flooding. In the case of the specific lands it is understood the question refers to, the development plan also provides that no development shall be permitted on any part of the lands until the town council and the Office of Public Works are satisfied that all lands throughout the town that are located in proximity to the riverbank, are not put at new or increased risk from potential flooding. The development plan also provides that before there is any development on the lands the council shall obtain its own expert advice from a competent hydrologist and other experts and from the Office of Public Works and permission on the lands shall not be granted unless all reports indicate that the land is suitable for development.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	1140	I understand the works referred to arose in the course of a road widening scheme carried out by Donegal County Council. My Department has investigated this matter, and considers that the impacts on wildlife and natural habitats are not significant.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-02 00:00:00	Prelude	1141	The low cost safety improvement works scheme of grants for non-national roads was introduced by my Department in 2000 as an extension of the scheme operated on national roads by the National Roads Authority, NRA. The NRA assesses applications for grant assistance under this non-national roads scheme on behalf of my Department. The criteria for grant approval are based on accident data, inspection of sites, locations showing demonstrable hazard and discussions between the relevant local authority and the NRA. I am satisfied with the criteria and I have no proposal to review the scheme at this stage.
