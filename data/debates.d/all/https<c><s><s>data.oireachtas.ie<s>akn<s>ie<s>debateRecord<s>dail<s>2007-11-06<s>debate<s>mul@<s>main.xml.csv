#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	0	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.  Since it was appointed on 14 June 2007, the Government has established six Cabinet committees on which I sit.  Details of these committees and the dates of their meetings, where appropriate, are as follows: the Cabinet committee on European affairs last met on 17 October 2007 and is due to meet again in December 2007; the Cabinet committee on health last met on 3 October 2007 and is due to meet again this week; the Cabinet committee on climate change and energy security last met on 12 September 2007 and is due to meet again later this month; the Cabinet committee on housing, infrastructure and public private partnerships last met on 10 October 2007 and is due to meet again in December; the Cabinet committee on social inclusion, children and integration last met on 24 October 2007 and no date has yet been set for the next meeting of the committee; and the Cabinet committee on science, technology and innovation is due to meet later this month.Cabinet committees are an integral part of the Cabinet process.  Questions as to the business conducted at Cabinet or Cabinet committee meetings have never been allowed in the House on the grounds that they are internal to Government.  The reasons for this approach are founded on sound policy principles and the need to avoid infringing the constitutional protection of Cabinet confidentiality.As always, questions on particular policy issues should be put down to the relevant Ministers.  I am circulating in the Official Report a list for the information of Deputies detailing the primary sub-committees and interdepartmental working groups on which my Department is represented.No.Interdepartmental groupSub-committees under interdepartmental groups (only applicable where shown)1inter-departmental co-ordinating committee on European affairs2senior officials group on European affairs3inter-departmental committee on Reform Treaty4external energy group5assistant secretary steering group on the review of the EU budget6inter-departmental co-ordinating committee on the Council of Europe7inter-departmental committee on the OECD8inter-departmental committee on development9high level group on the Asia strategy10inter-departmental working group on emergency planningtask force on emergency planning11freedom of information inter-departmental Working Groupfreedom of information Civil Service users network12inter-departmental emergency response co-ordinating committee [nuclear]13inter-departmental committee on public health emergency planning14national security committee15senior officials group on health and related sub groupworking group on long-term care16senior officials group on social inclusionsenior officials group on disability17dormant accounts — inter-departmental committees in respect of persons with a disability, economic and social disadvantage and educational disadvantage18high level group on Travellers19inter-departmental group on sustainable travel and transport action plan20inter-departmental group on drugs21high level group on activation22technical advisory group of the office of social inclusion23committee of the pilot project for the co-ordination of youth services in Waterford24ministerial task force on road safety25inter-departmental committee on science, technology and innovation26Lisbon Agenda national reform programme group27cross departmental Team, CDT, on housing, infrastructure and PPPs, HIPPPsCDT sub-committee on legal issues28inter-departmental group on PPPs29inter-departmental group on implementation of national spatial strategy30Transport 21 monitoring group31cross departmental group on unique business identifier and central business registry32data strategy liaison group33senior officials group on climate change and energy security34inter-departmental committee on climate change35high level group on sustainable development36inter-departmental committee on implementation of the national women’s strategy37tax strategy group38e-strategy group of secretaries general39assistant secretaries implementation group, ASIG, on information society and related sub groups40national payments implementation programme advisory group41SAFE, standard authentication framework environment, steering group42ICT statistics liaison group43implementation group of secretaries generalchange management network

He previously indicated to me that the Cabinet committee on health meets once a month.  From the list of six committees the Taoiseach has outlined to us, can I take it that he is a member of the Cabinet committee on health?  Does he attend these meetings every month and does the Cabinet committee on health receive reports from the HSE?I appreciate very well the point made by the Taoiseach about Cabinet confidentiality and how this precludes him from going into detail.  Can he give us some sense of the breadth of the deliberations of the Cabinet committee on health?  For instance, with the current——

I seek to establish the breadth of the deliberations of the committee.  I have acknowledged that, under Cabinet confidentiality rules, the Taoiseach cannot respond in respect of detail.  I take on board what the Ceann Comhairle has stated but I ask the Taoiseach to indicate the breadth of the deliberations of the Cabinet sub-committee on health rather than the specifics of any given matter.  Are current issues such as the cancer scandal in Portlaoise?  Is the wider policy approach, such as the implementation of the Teamwork and Hanly reports, addressed?  Are matters such as the budget shortfall, which is the hook upon which the HSE is hanging the excuse for the embargo on staff recruitment, addressed by the committee in the presence of the Taoiseach?
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	8	I must repeat myself because it is important in terms of precedent.  It is not possible for the Taoiseach to discuss those matters here.  The question submitted relates to statistical matters, dates and times of meetings.  This is all that is in order in terms of supplementary questions.  The Taoiseach would be out of order and wrong to respond to anything else.  Questions regarding the scope, content and the nature of the meetings cannot be asked or answered.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	9	Taking on board what the Ceann Comhairle has stated, I hope the Taoiseach can imaginatively respond to this Deputy's questions.  With regard to policy, matters regarding the health services are addressed by the Cabinet sub-committee on health.  In addressing policy, does the sub-committee also address contradictions in policy?
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	10	Deputy Ó Caoláin must listen.  This is my third interjection.  I hate interjecting and it is not my policy to do so.  Policy matters are matters for the line Minister and are not in order here.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	11	What type of democratic system do we have?

#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	13	I do not intend to do so.  With respect, I have prefaced my questioning by making it clear that I understand and appreciate that difficulty.  However, we do not live in a dictatorship; this is a democracy.  I am trying to establish something other than that the committee sits at all and that the Taoiseach is a member of it — big deal.  Let us have some light shone on what the committee is about.  It is important that the Taoiseach acknowledges its central role in the determination of Government health policy.  That is a valid area for any Deputy to tease out with the Taoiseach.  That is why he is here and I am here to ask questions.In defining policy — I am not referring to specific aspects — where there are contradictions between its presentation by the HSE and by the Minister, are these matters addressed by the sub-committee on health?  There are many examples, not least in the roll-out of radiotherapy centres.  Professor Drumm wishes to see these in the hands of the public health system and the Minister wishes to see them in the hands of public private partnerships.  Are issues such as this addressed by the Cabinet sub-committee?  In recognising that there is a need to have a greater understanding of the role and work of the committee, will the Taoiseach shed some light on what he is at?
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	14	For the fourth time, it is not open to the Taoiseach to answer the questions posed by the Deputy.  Under the principle of collective responsibility, health policy is a matter for the Minister for Health and Children.  These are statistical questions.  Questions relating to discussions that have been, are being or are due to be held may not be asked during Taoiseach's Question Time.  That is a long-standing precedent of the House and I must enforce it.  The only question the Taoiseach may answer is that relating to his own attendance.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	15	I was going to make the point that it is open to the Deputy to table any of the other questions he posed to the Minister for Health and Children.  In many cases I answer those questions in a different format during Leaders' Questions.  However, because Cabinet committees are an extension of the Cabinet itself, I cannot answer them here.The meetings to which the Deputy refers take place monthly and I attend them.  All relevant issues are discussed at these meetings.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	16	In light of the large amount of publicity it has received recently, has the Taoiseach attended a screening of Michael Moore's new film "Sicko"?  The film throws some light on the health system in the United States.  I recommend that the Taoiseach see it because it exposes some of the practices that obtain and the participants involved in the delivery of the so-called health service in the United States.  Some of the companies featured in the film have been invited to operate private for-profit health facilities in this country.  If the Taoiseach has already seen "Sicko", that is well and good.  If not, I recommend that he do so.In replies to questions I tabled on previous occasions, the Taoiseach referred to the high level interdepartmental committee on North-South matters and the North-South interdepartmental co-ordinating group.  Are these entities continuing to operate as they did in the past or has their work been stepped up or moved into another realm of engagement since the restoration of the Executive north of the Border?  Will the Taoiseach shed some light on what is happening with these two interdepartmental bodies?The Taoiseach, in his earlier reply, could have given a little bit more information regarding the Cabinet committee on health or any of the other committees without in any way breaching confidentiality from a Cabinet point of view.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	22	The work of the interdepartmental groups is continuing.  Work relating to the North-South bodies is moving from the previous agenda towards matters involving more economic co-operation.  I refer in this regard to work involving the North-South Ministerial Council and the other relevant councils that are now thankfully meeting either weekly or a number of times each week.  The work and input of my Department in respect of these bodies and in co-ordinating their activities is probably more intense now that all of them are up and running.  My Department is also involved, along with the Department of Foreign Affairs, in setting the agenda for the British-Irish Council.  It is hoped that we will soon be working on matters involving the Houses of the Oireachtas and the Assembly in Northern Ireland.The level of activity relating to the North-South bodies, particularly the Ministerial Council and the British-Irish Council, is growing on a weekly basis.  We are in the process of arranging meetings for 2008.  It is likely that there will be three sets of meetings in 2008 if we cannot — as a result of the important meetings to take place in the United States — arrange to hold meetings before Christmas.  The meetings will be held either just before or just after Christmas.  The activity, agenda and workload relating to these are being progressed.As the Deputy is aware, the all-island energy market came into effect last week and there are many other areas in respect of which there is cross-departmental co-operation.  The bodies are up and running again and are very active.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	23	Are all three Government parties represented on each Cabinet committee?  The dates of meetings were quickly mentioned by the Taoiseach and I did not get them all noted.  He indicated a date for the next meeting of the Cabinet committee on science, technology and innovation.  When did it last meet?I understand from the Taoiseach that the Cabinet committee on climate change and energy security last met eight weeks ago on 12 September.  How many meetings of this committee have been held since the Government was formed in June?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	24	The formats of Cabinet committees differ.  Some meet monthly, others quarterly and others every six weeks.  The Cabinet committee on science, technology and innovation meets quarterly.  The Cabinet committee on health normally meets monthly as does the Cabinet committee on housing, infrastructure and public private partnerships.  The Cabinet committee on social inclusion, children and integration meets every six weeks approximately.  The Cabinet committee on climate change and energy security meets every two months.  It is a new committee and the next meeting is due next week.  It last met in mid-September.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	25	The Taoiseach did not answer my question.  I wanted to know when the Cabinet committee on science, technology and innovation last met.  I will put the question another way.  Has it met since the Government was formed in June?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	26	I will have to check.  It normally meets quarterly.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	27	I am surprised the Taoiseach does not have an answer to the question he was asked on the dates the committees met.  I presume the Taoiseach knows whether this committee has met since the Government was formed in June.  This is also true of the Cabinet committee on climate change and energy security.  Am I to understand that in a country where we aspire to develop a new economy based on science and innovation the Cabinet committee on science, technology and innovation has not met at all since the Government was formed in June?  Has the Cabinet committee on climate change and energy security of a Government which professes to being committed to dealing effectively with climate change met only once since the Government was formed in June?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	28	Items are discussed at Cabinet committee if they cannot be discussed by the Government.  The climate change strategy and issues surrounding climate change have been discussed at most meetings of the Government.  The committee will carry forward its work but because it involves a new committee and a new agenda which is set out in the programme for Government it has been discussed at the Cabinet table and not at committee.The Cabinet committee on science, technology and innovation is to ensure that science, technology, development and innovation are conducive to maintaining our competitiveness and to build on it.  The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, normally reports to the Government on these issues.  When the Cabinet committee meets it is normally to bring a science adviser and officials before the committee.  Issues relevant to the brief of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, are discussed at full Cabinet.  It is not necessary to have Cabinet committee meetings unless we are bringing in individuals who would not attend meetings of the Cabinet and there probably was not one.  I recall going to several meetings but I cannot be sure it was since the summer.  Since no date is listed in the reply I imagine it was not.  The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, certainly reports on these issues, particularly with regard to companies, new initiatives and new involvements and this is a weekly occurrence.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	29	I thank the Taoiseach for telling us the frequency with which the committees are supposed to meet.  We are five months into the life of the Government.  It is surprising, to say the least, that the Cabinet committee which deals with the area of science and technology, with its importance for our economy, has not met since the Government was formed in June.  It seems to indicate that the foot is off the pedal as far as the agenda for science, technology and innovation in the economy is concerned.I am perplexed as to why the climate change committee has met on only one occasion.  I appreciate what the Taoiseach said in regard to the Cabinet regularly discussing the issue of climate change but in view of the priority the programme for Government appeared to give to the issue and the fact that we are to have carbon budgeting for the first time this year, it is incredible that the committee established to address issues of detail by a Government which is supposedly committed to dealing with climate change has met only once.  Who is responsible for the convening of that committee?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	30	Deputy Gilmore either misunderstands or seems to misunderstand.  The fact that the issue is being dealt with by the Cabinet instead of a sub-committee means that it is taking up more time and is given a higher priority.  Rather than being addressed in a sub-committee comprising four or five Ministers, the issue is being addressed by the full Cabinet.  That is what has been happening in respect of climate change and it is likely that it will continue to be addressed that way until the end of the year, even though a meeting will be held shortly to discuss certain issues.  The crucial point is that it is being dealt with by the full Cabinet.A different type of committee is involved in the area of science, technology and innovation.  The committee is more technical in nature and includes the director of science and other individuals.  It is not necessary for it to meet the Cabinet on a more regular basis.  When it is required to report, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, reports for it.The fact that matters are discussed by the Cabinet shows they receive higher priority and preference and more time than they would receive if they were dealt with by sub-committee.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	31	I was going to ask the Taoiseach whether any of the Cabinet sub-committees had dealt with the issue of ministerial pay but I suppose, under Cabinet confidentiality, we would be unable to find out.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	38	——unlike some predecessors from various parties.Does the Taoiseach chair the six committees or are they chaired by individual Ministers?  What is the role of the sub-committee once it arrives at a decision?  Does the decision go to the Cabinet as a recommendation from the sub-committee?  If, for example, the Cabinet sub-committee on infrastructure discusses a bridge across the Corrib and reaches agreement, is that taken as a motion or proposal that eventually goes before the Cabinet for adoption by the relevant Minister as part of the Government programme?A sub-committee was established to deal with the issue of Aer Lingus.  On 17 May, the Taoiseach indicated it had finished its work and was concluded.  Has that Cabinet sub-committee been wound up or is it still in existence?  Could it, for example, consider the rumpus over Shannon and the Heathrow slots?  I have an interest in deciphering the distinction between the State and the Government, in view of the fact that the Department of Transport was notified of the Aer Lingus decision whereas the Minister was not.  Under business law, all shareholders in major companies should be informed of decisions that are imminent.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	39	I chair most of the major Cabinet sub-committees, although not all of them.  There are others that I did not mention but I have mentioned the main ones.There are other Cabinet committees which meet from time to time, including the Cabinet committee on Northern Ireland.  The Cabinet committee on security also meets from time to time to get security briefings or to deal with issues relevant to Northern Ireland.  Those I already mentioned are the main ones, dealing with infrastructure, health, social exclusion and European affairs.  They meet on a monthly basis and they usually have very extensive agendas.  They do not deal with day to day issues but issues relevant to the Departments and agencies under their aegis.  If an issue was moved from the Cabinet table for more comprehensive discussion by the committee, obviously the committee would report back to the Cabinet.  That is the usual procedure.  A lot of the other committees deal with more time-consuming issues.  We spend several hours per week at Cabinet meetings where we tease out and follow through on issues.  The committee on Aer Lingus was centred around the privatisation issue.  That was its function and that function was completed.  As Deputy Kenny will know from experience, other issues of a current nature come up at the weekly Cabinet meeting.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	40	I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 to 5, inclusive, together.I was pleased to launch the report of the task force on active citizenship on 28 March last.  The report was prepared following extensive consultation and research carried out by the task force since its establishment in April 2006.  Copies of the report have been placed in the Oireachtas Library.I believe that the task force stimulated a very worthwhile public debate about the nature of citizenship in a fast-changing country.  It has produced an excellent report which includes recommendations to Government, as well as proposals for how individuals, community and voluntary organisations, the business sector and the media can each make a contribution.The recommendations to Government come under the following thematic areas: participation in the democratic process, the public service and citizens, community engagement and promoting a sense of community, education for citizenship and ethnic and cultural diversity and the challenge of engaging newcomers and local civic participation.  The report also makes recommendations about implementation and proposes some targets by which to monitor progress.The Government has accepted the task force's recommendations in principle and agreed to establish a non-statutory active citizenship office as proposed in its report.  The office is developing an implementation plan in consultation with several Departments and other relevant stakeholders.  I am pleased that Ms Mary Davis has agreed to chair a steering group to oversee the work of the office.I take this opportunity to congratulate the task force on producing a clear and concise report within a tight timeframe.  It provides a sound basis for strengthening civic participation in Ireland over the next few years.

Many once-thriving activities, particularly during the summer periods, outdoor and sporting activities for young people, especially out of school, have not continued due to the excessive cost.  This is very demoralising for many communities and it stifles the active citizenship that we are all trying to encourage.  Has the Taoiseach noted that the task force on active citizenship has examined this issue?  Does he agree with the task force that continued efforts to reduce insurance costs and minimise litigation is absolutely essential?The task force has also highlighted the work done by the national Irish community and voluntary fora in developing a group insurance scheme.  This is open to membership for all community and voluntary fora throughout the country.  Does the Taoiseach share my concern that there is an inadequate awareness of this initiative?  Has he come across it in his role as a Deputy, quite apart from his role as Taoiseach, that local groups are simply not informed of the alternative of coming together under this umbrella group insurance scheme?  Does the Taoiseach agree that a much more proactive promotional effort of the alternative means of funding public liability insurance would be a worthwhile initiative in helping to resurrect many fine community initiatives and to encourage people to overcome the difficulties public liability insurance has presented time and again?  Will he act on the recommendation of the task force that the group insurance scheme open to members of all local community and voluntary fora should be widely promoted?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	42	I accept what Deputy Ó Caoláin said that in times past, and perhaps at present, public liability costs and premiums regarding difficulties around claims in playgrounds, halls and parish halls and boards of management not making facilities available have created a lot of problems for organisations.  Given the efforts over the past four or five years, thankfully premiums are substantially down in this area.  However, they still create another level of administration for people who simply want to generate community activities.I note the recommendation in the report.  The task force came across this issue in its consultations.  The point was made that where a group comes together, whether a group of local authorities, schools or organisations, it makes it far less difficult to get a group insurance scheme.  It is a point with which the Deputy, Members and I would agree.  If it could be done in areas, regions, schools or scout halls, it could make a huge impact.The Deputy made a good suggestion in regard to highlighting what is possible with these group schemes.  On  a positive note, perhaps I will ask the office which is being set up arising out of the task force to find some way to communicate this to voluntary groups.  I have seen examples of premiums being dramatically reduced where groups have pulled together, whether in regard to council playgrounds or otherwise, and where there has been enforcement of some health and safety issues.  I will ask the office how that information can be promoted in the community and voluntary sector.

Again, I highlight the National Irish Community and Voluntary Forum as a means to address that need.  I would welcome any initiative to promote awareness to overcome that difficulty.My final question is on a related issue.  The task force also highlighted the critical need for the system of Garda vetting of people involved in community and voluntary effort with young people to be speeded up.  We are all very well aware that people, in good faith, volunteer their services to young people.  The overwhelming majority are citizens of good standing with bona fide intent.  There is an inordinate delay in having these clearance certificates, for the want of a better description, processed.  Is the Taoiseach aware that it takes several months for this process to be completed in each case?  It is a dissuasion.  It can put people off and it is denying the community and voluntary sector the valued input of energetic people who have a very positive contribution to make in this area.  Does the Taoiseach envisage taking any steps to have this matter addressed and the process expedited?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	44	I accept that there can be delays in the vetting process.  Full-time public servants get priority.  Applicants for positions in the Garda, the Army, the teaching sector and the public service get precedence.  Even then there can be delays in the system.  Community activists are not given the same level of priority.  Many of the delays which are encountered can be attributed to the lack of availability of records and people changing their addresses when they move.  Members will be aware of the difficulties which arise.  Gardaí are reluctant to sign off on the vetting process until they have completed what they consider to be a comprehensive check.  Gardaí tend to hold off if they find that people have moved or changed address.  I will raise the issue.I have seen a number of examples of full-time staff encountering delays in this regard.  Such difficulties have been raised in the House in the context of other positions and posts.  As gardaí are aware of modern-day problems, they feel they have to do these comprehensive searches and cross-checks.  I will raise the issue.  While we want to help those who are anxious to get involved in the voluntary sector, we all believe there has to be adequate protection so there are no difficulties, particularly where children are involved.  Workers in this sector often deal with very young children, or people who are 15 or 16 years of age.  I will raise this issue with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	45	In March of this year, the Taoiseach accepted the report of the Taskforce on Active Citizenship, which set out a number of ambitious and realisable targets.  The report set a target, to be achieved by the end of this decade, of reaching 60% turn-out among voters between the ages of 18 and 24.  Less than 50% of such voters have turned out in recent elections.  The report also set a target of increasing the level of voter participation, estimated by the CSO to have been 75.5% at the 2002 general election, to at least 80% in all future general elections.  The report recommended that areas where turn-out is particularly low should be specifically targeted.  It is laudable that attempts are being made to achieve such ambitious targets.The turn-out in the 1997 general election was 66%.  The turn-out in the 1997 presidential election was 48%.  The turn-out in the 1999 European and local elections, which were held on a Friday, was 51%.  The turn-out in the 2001 referendum on the Nice treaty was 35%, but that increased to 50% for the second referendum on the treaty, which was held in 2002.  When the local and European elections were held on a Friday in 2004, there was a 61% turn-out.  It is obvious that my party got a good response on that occasion.If the Taoiseach thinks the target set by the task force — a turn-out of 80% in all future general elections — is achievable and realistic, does that mean all such elections should be held on a Friday, a Saturday or a Sunday?  I would support such a proposal in the interests of giving as many people as possible an opportunity to cast their votes.  Many young people expressed concern, anxiety and criticism when it emerged that this year's general election was to be held during exam time.  They felt they would not have an opportunity to vote on the day of the election.  If the Taoiseach accepts that it is possible to increase voter participation and turn-out from 75% to 80%, as outlined in the document published last March, does he agree that the target is more likely to be achieved if general elections are held on a Friday, a Saturday or a Sunday?  Perhaps he will comment on that matter.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	46	We all agree that we should try to increase the level of voter participation.  It is interesting to compare Ireland's record over the last few elections to that of other countries.  Our figures are good, when compared to other countries, over the last three polls — the local elections of 2004, the referendum of the same year and the general election of 2007.  A number of issues need to be considered in this regard.  Like the authorities in other countries, we need to do as much as possible to improve the register of electors.  The improvements in the register which were made in advance of this year's general election were quite significant and certainly helped.  I have an open mind.  It depends where one is, I suppose.  A Saturday or Sunday election would be a disaster in a constituency like the constituency I represent.  People leave the city in large numbers on Fridays, and the best of luck to them, but that is the reality.  Many surveys have been carried out which show that people go here, there and everywhere — they are certainly not at their base.  The opposite may be the case in rural Ireland but speaking about where I am in the heart of Dublin, it seems that they all come to Dublin at weekends.  I suppose it is the world we live in.I was in Dublin Airport the other night when people were coming back from the premiership matches and I thought I was in Heathrow Airport because of the football colours——

I am in favour of everything that can be done to improve participation in elections and to educate and explain the matter to people by means of civic education programmes.  It is important that we do everything we can to achieve a democratic buy-in.  The task force on active citizenship believes it is important to persuade people to care about the democratic system and their participation in it.  The active citizenship office will work hard with the relevant Departments and agencies to follow up on these recommendations.

The recommendation of the task force was that an effort should be made to try to increase this number to 65% by 2010, which would be a desirable achievement.  I question whether the problem is not so much the willingness of people to participate as active citizens as it is the opaque systems with which they must deal.  I constantly meet people who are more than willing to participate in their local community and to become involved in issues.  However, having gone to an oral hearing of An Bord Pleanála about an issue where the inspector agrees with them and writes up a report to that effect, it is then overturned by the board because it is pursuing some Government policy on infrastructure.  If such people want to pursue some issue at local level they go to the local authority and local councillors but they cannot do anything about it because it is down to the county manager or some other unelected personage who makes the decisions.Is part of the trick in getting more people involved as active citizens in their local communities not a case of changing the bureaucracy they must deal with?  People who are busy in their lives and who go once around the track with regard to an issue and find they are getting nowhere, are unlikely to go around it again.  Are there plans in place to approach this matter from a different angle, not just from the angle of encouraging people to participate, but from the angle of changing and reforming the local government structures in particular so that when people participate they receive a response?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	57	There are many ways in which people can be encouraged to become involved.  I share the Deputy's views on An Bord Pleanála's oral hearings.  The engagement of local authorities is very important but in fairness to them they have moved into regional and local offices and decentralised their staff, and that has helped.  The system is far better now than it was ten or 20 years ago when everything was centralised in centrally-located offices.  The more local offices the better because residents' groups and civic action groups will be more inclined to engage with people who have a feel for and are working in their own communities and the more that happens, the better.  Part of the problem over the years has been that we have handed over far more of our decision making to the expert bodies and expert groups on the basis that they are in a more independent position and it is the politically correct thing to do.  Every time we do that, for all its laudable reasons, we are taking away our own involvement.  I have raised this many times with colleagues and I have sat around the Cabinet table arguing about that but that is what we continue to do.The main point is that the more civics education there is in our schools and colleges and the more enticement to people to volunteer to engage in community activities the better it is for society.  I agree with the Deputy that where there is undue bureaucracy it militates against people playing an active role.  I agree with the point that if one goes through something and one is not being listened to one will not become actively involved.  For my own part, not a day goes by when I meet some of the statutory bodies and I ask them to advertise and promote what they do and ask people to give their views.  The Internet makes it easier for people to do that.  While some do it, others seem to ignore the point.  The more we force and encourage people to do that the better and the more interest there will be from our local people.The figures for involvement and participation here are not bad but they could be far better.  Various community development plans are contained in the agreed programme for Government for which we have provided extra resources for the next five years.  Some €300 million has been spent by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs directly on community activities.  Given that much funding has been provided it is a matter of trying to co-ordinate the funds into organisations.  I hope the active citizenship office and the work and commissions it has done can help to drive that forward.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	58	The sheep sector is a hugely important part of the overall Irish agri-food sector and I believe it has a very good future.  The sector's future depends on its ability to meet the needs of the market.  The downward trend in production and an ageing consumer profile point to both supply and demand issues.  I am confident, however, that a framework is being put in place to address these issues.The basis of that framework is the 2006 sheep strategy report and the subsequent implementation report, which was presented to me last April.  The strategy report addressed the current position of the industry and the options for ongoing development.  It sets out a series of recommendations covering areas such as production, research, advice, processing and marketing.  The goal is to facilitate the development of a more profitable sheep sector covering lambproduction, lamb processing and marketing sectors of the industry.  Most of the recommendations in the strategy report fall to be implemented by the industry itself and it is too early at this stage to assess their impact.  The recommendations are supported by my Department through assistance for breeding and management, processing facilities, mechanical grading and quality assurance.In addition and in line with the group's report, sheep farmers are major beneficiaries of various schemes being operated by my Department.  Under REPS 4, a new supplementary measure aimed at sheep farmers has been introduced.  A budget of €28 million a year has been allocated to fund the proposed new supplementary measure at an overall cost of over €170 million for the period to 2013.In addition to the measures being taken at producer and processor level, Bord Bia's marketing and promotional efforts will be critical.  Bord Bia will continue to organise strategic marketing campaigns in selected European markets.  France will continue to be a priority and its promotions there are run in conjunction with the major retailers and cover over 1,200 outlets.  The downward trend in lamb consumption within the EU presents a real challenge.  To address this challenge, Bord Bia is collaborating with its French and British counterparts to develop a three-year generic lamb promotion on the French market to promote lamb to younger consumers.  This campaign, which amounts to a major new initiative on the European lamb market, is due to commence early next year.With the co-operation of all stakeholders and in line with the approach set out above, the sheep sector can continue to make an extremely valuable contribution to the agri-food sector and to the economy as a whole.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	59	I thank the Minister for her reply.  Does she agree we are witnessing a mass exodus of sheep farmers from the industry accompanied by a very significant drop in sheep numbers, and that if this trend continues there is a real danger that the industry will lose its critical mass to enable it to survive and prosper because of economies of scale?  If she accepts that contention does she not agree that while the sheep strategy review takes a long-term strategic view of the industry, it fails to take cognisance of one significant issue, which is that if we do not protect the number of farmers in the industry by way of meaningful financial input directly into the sector, we will not have the basis of an industry to protect and allow to prosper in a few years' time?  As a result, will the Minister consider a similar scheme to the suckler cow grant scheme she introduced in the beef sector?  Will she consider a ewe grant to stabilise sheep numbers now so that we can safeguard the industry?I accept that Question No. 46 addresses this subject specifically.  The suspension of the farm investment scheme grant, which had a specific fencing grants section targeted at the sheep sector for handling facilities etc., will seriously undermine the on-farm viability of a number of these enterprises.  Will the Minister consider, even in a targeted way, restoring the grant scheme specifically for that sector?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	60	Perhaps we should consider one of today's publications which contains an article regarding the sheep sector this week with the headline "Buyers are plentiful and prices are holding", which is good to see.  The Deputy is right in pointing to a reduction in the number of sheep kept on the land, which is mainly because we are now in a decoupled era.  However, I have taken a personal interest and invested considerable time and energy in the implementation of the sheep strategy.  I provided funding and we considered many aspects.  I agreed to the full implementation of the report, on the basis of which, in conjunction with the strategy group, we considered how it could be targeted.  Under the state aid rules and because we are in a decoupled era, we were not in a position to introduce a specific scheme.  However, in doing so we have targeted two types of approach, one within REPS and the other specific to hill sheep farmers under a special national reserve measure.  Those were the two targeted investment programmes.If we are to produce quality lamb and be in a position to be competitive in the market, we must consider the consumer.  The consumer profile is not good and we need to address that issue.  This is why we are working with the initiative to which I have spoken.  A number of Members of the European Parliament, including some Irish parliamentarians, have also been working on a sheep strategy group that we are considering tying into.  As the Deputy is probably aware, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has been invited to participate in that promotion at the beginning of December.  We have targeted specific sectors.On the farm improvement scheme, I introduced a scheme and, according to figures available at present, approximately 8% of applicants so far have looked towards the fencing grant and the mobile units.  I will evaluate the scheme on the basis of the closure and will ascertain, arising from an enormous number of applications to the Department — approximately 6,000 to 7,000 over five days — the Department's priorities.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	61	I cannot disagree with much of what the Minister has said.  However, much of it relates to the long term.  To ensure its survival the industry needs a direct cash injection into the hands of those at the coalface.  The Minister is not offering any ray of hope to those in the sheep industry who have seen their incomes plummet.  The Minister may well pluck a headline from the newspapers relating to sheep prices this week — I will not dispute the figures she quotes — but based on confirmed figures, incomes from sheep farming have plummeted.  If we want to keep people in the industry and attract young blood to it, we must show that it can deliver a tangible financial reward for their commitment and investment of time, which is not the case today.  If it is important to protect the industry and if it were possible to introduce a €100 suckler cow grant, why is it not possible with a political will to introduce a similar ewe grant scheme to stabilise sheep numbers?  I am not prescriptive about it, the Minister can dress it up and call it whatever she likes, but we need a proposal to stabilise sheep numbers, which are in freefall.  Talking about encouraging consumption in the future——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	62	Can we have a question from the Deputy?
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	63	——is laudable, but without something tangible in these farmers' pockets they will not be there to reap the benefit of the turnaround when it comes in the long term.  The farm income scheme had a targeted grant for facilities and fencing, which with one fell swoop the Minister has removed.  That grant was of real practical benefit to sheep farmers many of whom were interested in the grant which is now gone.  Will the Minister consider reintroducing it, specifically focused on the sheep sector?  This is something concrete the Minister can do with a political will.  Will she also consider for the sheep sector a similar scheme to the suckler cow scheme?

I will not rise to the opposition.  Through REPS 4 €28 million is available to farmers in a specific mixed grazing scheme.  Hill sheep farming applications are in and are being reviewed.  They are happening now.  ICBF is working at present with the sheep breeding industry.  Some time ago I established a Teagasc centre of excellence, which is working with farming enterprises to consider all the issues, including the processing sector.  The investment has been made and the closing date is Friday, so investment will be made in the processing side.  Further discussions on clarification are needed for the processing sector.  That all represents ongoing work.  At the moment REPS 4 farmers will receive specific targeted funding towards the sheep sector in addition to that for the hill sheep sector.  That is the existing financial aspect.  The rest is ongoing work done in consultation with all those involved in the sheep sector as well as a targeted marketing approach to encourage people under 45 years of age to eat sheep meat.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	89	Reviews of the operation of milk quotas and implementation of single payment scheme due in 2008 will be amalgamated into an overall "Health Check" of the Common Agricultural Policy.  A Commission communication in preparation for the Health Check is expected to be tabled towards the end of this month and formal legislative proposals are expected to be published in May 2008.  Agreement on the proposals is anticipated for the latter half of 2008 during the French Presidency of the EU.  I await with interest the Commission communication due later this month and I will participate actively in the ensuing negotiations.  I have urged the Commission to take this opportunity to consider further possibilities for the simplification of the single payment and cross-compliance requirements to reduce the administrative burden on farmers.  The Health Check will have a particular focus on dairy aspects, given the Commissioner has intimated that the opportunity will be taken to secure a "soft landing" towards the ending of the quota regime in 2015.  I want to ensure, in the negotiating position I adopt, that I have direct access to the broadest views, particularly those of key stakeholders in the industry to assist me in that process.  I, therefore, recently established a broadly representative dairy consultative committee, which will advise me on this key aspect of the Health Check.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	12753	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	90	I thank the Minister for her reply.  The timelines are as we anticipated and I welcome the establishment of the consultative committee.  I refer the Minister to a speech given by Commissioner Fischer Boel in Paris last month.  She referred to the Health Check, the strengthening of competitiveness, supporting rural society and so on.  It was all very aspirational in its aims.  Farmers are worried about the issues of cross-compliance and modulation under the single payment scheme and, particularly, whether the Commission will place upper or lower limits on payments to them under the scheme in the context of the Health Check.  They are worried about the nature of cross compliance and the stringent controls under which they are placed.  Has the Government defined a clear negotiating position on those issues because farmers have strong views on them?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	91	The Deputy is correct that those are pertinent issues and when the committee is established, a number of them will be considered.  That approach will be more than beneficial as we will hear what Members have to say.  I have grave concerns about a number of issues, particularly compulsory modulation.  Farmers need political stability to proceed in the decoupled era and I expressed that concern to the Commissioner during recent discussions.  Our ideas will not be firmed up until we receive the communications but I have laid out the parameters within which I wish to work.I have to be convinced about the standardisation of the single payment model because the EU has 21 such models and Ireland has developed an historical model, which is more beneficial.  It is very unclear what the Commission is seeking regarding thresholds and they may not be necessarily where we want to be in the future under the single payment scheme.  The Deputy is correct that I would like changes to be made regarding cross compliance so that there are more flexibilities.  Checks and balances are in place under the single payment scheme.  While inspections are provided for, strict rules and regulations are applied to the transfer of animals and products entering the food chain.  Greater simplification is needed on the cross compliance issue.  I have grave concerns about modulation but few member states have such concerns.  Many of the new member states are more anxious to move from the first to the second phase into rural development because they do not have a significant investment in the single farm payment scheme and rural development is more important to them.  Equally, our colleagues in the UK, who are anxious to implement compulsory modulation, are not prepared to move on many other aspects of the single payment scheme.  The Deputy is correct that we do not have firm parameters within which to work but we have set down a number of issues which will be pertinent to the discussions.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	92	The farm improvement scheme was launched by my Department in July 2007 and funding for the scheme was agreed under the partnership agreement, Towards 2016, as part of an overall programme of investment in the agri-food sector.  A total of €350 million was provided for farm waste and other on-farm investment measures, of which €79 million was provided for investments in farm improvements.  I had indicated, at the time of the launch of the scheme, that the scheme would be terminated when this financial ceiling had been reached.  Accordingly, I announced last week that, as applications under the farm scheme had reached this level of funding, it would close to new applications for now.  Funding for the scheme is provided as part of the overall package of measures amounting to €8.6 billion of funding for the agri-food sector which was agreed under the partnership agreement and is set out in the National Development Plan 2007-2013.The scheme has proved to be extremely popular to farmers, as evidenced by the number of applications received, particularly in the last few weeks.  More than 12,600 applications were received up to the closing date of the scheme and my Department will process these applications up to the level of funding available.  This is in addition to 48,000 applications received under the farm waste management scheme.  Payment of grant aid will issue in respect of all approved projects in due course when the work involved has been completed.My Department is committed to expenditure substantially in excess of the €350 million provided for on-farm investment as a result of the large number of approvals under the farm waste management scheme.  While there will not be an underspend in respect of my Department's on-farm investment schemes in 2007, I expect savings will arise on other demand or market-led schemes, expenditure on which is subject to a variety of external factors, including the pace of approval of state aids and rural development programmes at EU level, the completion of approved projects in the marketing and processing scheme within the year and a reduced reliance on intervention at EU level as a market management tool.  Funding for the farm improvement scheme is provided under partnership, which provides for a review in 2008.  In accordance with the terms of that agreement, the review will take stock of the outcomes achieved in the overall goals and will consider opportunities to refocus and reprioritise.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	93	I am clutching at straws.  The Minister stated the scheme was closed "for now".  Is she holding out the prospect that the scheme may be reopened in 2008?  Is she not embarrassed that a scheme launched less than six months ago had to be suspended last Friday?  That reflects an appalling inability in her Department to predict the pent up demand for capital investment on farms.  I acknowledge the investment provided under the farm waste management scheme but I refer the Minister to farm gates.  Many farmers are in a scheme that was supposed to provide grant assistance under both the farm waste management and farm improvement schemes but, having gone through the regulatory and planning process, they find the door has been closed on them by the Department because it has run out of funding for the latter scheme.  The Minister stated there will be an underspend in a number of schemes administered by her Department and she raised the possibility of a refund to the Exchequer this year.  Is she aware of the comments of the Tánaiste and Minister for Finance in recent times regarding the downturn of the economy?  He stated it is important in the context of competitiveness and efficiency to retain capital investment as an engine to drive the economy.  The farming sector is a major employer.  It plays on a world stage and needs to be efficient and competitive.  Maintaining on-farm capital investment is as important as and comparable to maintaining investment in the national development plan and in Transport 21.  Will the Minister consider informing the Minister for Finance that her Department has underspent in certain areas and ask whether this scheme may be reopened so that farmers may be allowed to get on with the works they had envisaged doing?

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	98	There are 48,000 applications under the farm waste management scheme.  That is the largest capital investment in the sector in the history of the State and is very flaithiúlach in the context of encouraging people to address the issues of the nitrates directive.  That has been and will remain the priority of the Department.

Overall, there are almost 60,000 applications and people to be supported.  Deputy Creed likes to remind me of my job so I shall remind him of what his crowd did in April 1995.  I have 60,000 applications to deal with.  His party in government had control of the farmyard pollution scheme, which closed at 17,000.  That means there is an investment in respect of 60,000 on one side and 17,000 on the other.  We need to look at the issues as they exist.  We had a massive influx of applications to this scheme over five days.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	103	The Minister should have seen the underinvestment.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	104	It was part of the partnership agreement and, as I said, we shall be reviewing this and the priorities with all the farming organisations in 2008.  I am reviewing all the applications on hand and those which have been sanctioned will be paid.  We will then work towards payment of the rest when we see the different categories and know when people are going to invest etc.  When all this has been done and an evaluation has taken place I may be able to reprioritise this scheme.  The scheme has been massively expanded and covered a plethora of new ideas that presented.  Until such time as I can evaluate what is on hand I cannot give commitments as to whether there will be any transfer of funds.  However, it will be up for review in 2008 as per the partnership agreement.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	105	I want to ask the Minster two brief supplementary questions and the possibility of an answer would be greatly appreciated.  Specifically, as regards those now being denied grant aid under this scheme, will the Minister consider a derogation from their compliance obligations under the nitrates directive and REPS because very many of them had programmes in place and investment targeted to address shortcomings on their farms to enable them to comply with these regulations?  Is the Minister aware of the assertion being made by social partners, and the farming organisations in particular, that this was a demand-led scheme for which there was no set budget?  Will the issue be referred for adjudication to the machinery involved in resolving disputes under social partnership, whether the National Implementation Body or some such forum because farmers feel very aggrieved by this?  There is a pent-up demand for capital investment on farms.  The proof of this is that the scheme was so over-subscribed and nonetheless the Department could not programme a scheme of investment to last from 2007 to 2013.  The fact that it collapsed within six months because of over-subscription smacks of desperate bad planning within the Department.In view of that and the willingness of farmers to respond——

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	109	The answer is that when I negotiated the partnership agreement, we had a finite amount of resources, €350 million, of which €79 million was for the farm improvement scheme.  The agreement provided that this was the amount to be spent until the money ran out.  Moving on from the agreement there was to be a review in 2008 on the basis of ascertaining how these programmes were manifesting.  If we needed to reprioritise we would do this within the budget as set down under the national development plan.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	12753	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	110	The Government is now discriminating against those people who got their applications in on time and who will now be cut off as a result of this action.

As matters stand I have to ascertain the timeframe as regards a number of applications on hand that might have been hopefully shoved in, but which might be unfair to people with a natural and genuine need.  All that has to be ascertained.On the issue of the nitrates directive——

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	118	Yes, but the farm waste management scheme was moved ahead.
#JohnBrowne2	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-party	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-dob	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	119	The Cawley report recommended that a review of the existing procedures and processes used to administer and implement the current licensing and regulatory regime for the aquaculture sector should take place with a view to strengthening current systems and procedures and delivering an improved service to customers.  My Department has prepared a detailed strategic plan to give effect to this recommendation.  This plan is undergoing urgent internal consultation with a view to eliminating the backlog within a defined timeframe and delivering enhanced customer service to the industry.Responsibility for the Aquaculture Acts 1997 to 2006 and the associated functions transferred to my Department on 19 October 2007.  Prior to that date, 12 aquaculture licences were issued by my predecessors, including three issued by the Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board, from 1 January 2007.  This figure does not refer to the assignments of licences from one operator to another which are also processed by the Department.It is important however, that I place the number of new licences issued in context.  The licensing procedure is lengthy and complex, involving a range of intermediate measures before a recommendation and decision can be made in any one case.  The process has become considerably more complex in recent years due to increased activity and demands in the coastal zone and the knock-on need to take an ever greater account of: the potential impacts on safety and navigation; the ecological impacts on wild fisheries, natural habitats, flora and fauna; the suitability of the waters; the other beneficial uses and the likely effects on the economy; and the statutory status of the area.The low number of licences issued this year to date provides a good indicator of the need to dramatically improve the process and procedures involved in aquaculture licensing.  Records available in the Department indicate that 254 are being processed as new applications, licence renewals or licences undergoing review.  As regards the substantial backlog, I am confident that the detailed measures under consideration by the Department will successfully address this issue on a sustainable basis.I assure the Deputy that the difficulty with the backlog of licence applications is of huge importance to the Department.  As Minister of State with responsibility for the marine, I am totally committed to the elimination of this backlog as a matter of urgency.
#TomSheahan	unknown-#TomSheahan-party	unknown-#TomSheahan-dob	unknown-#TomSheahan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	120	I thank the Minister of State for his answer, or rather the lack of one.  I asked a specific question, namely, the number of licences issued since January 2007.  The answer I got was 12 and three, or 15.  I asked about the number of applications for new licences, renewals or reviews being processed and he said 254, when the figure is 260.  When will the backlog be cleared?  The Minister of State said it would be achieved as soon as possible.At present, there are 20 companies in the Irish Salmon Growers' Association and their turnover amounts to €60 million.  They produce 12,000 tonnes but it is not very long since they were producing 25,000 tonnes.  The main reason for the decline is inaction regarding licences in the Minister of State's Department.  On the Irish Trout Producers' Group and freshwater fisheries, the main issues of concern are licences, capital investment and research and development.

#JohnBrowne2	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-party	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-dob	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	123	In the past few weeks, since responsibility for marine matters was transferred to what is now the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Minister and I met the IFA aquaculture groups and worked out a plan together.  Obviously we had to have discussions with the stakeholders on how we would deal with the licensing backlog.  The coastal zone management division in my Department has prepared a detailed strategic plan that takes into account the issues raised by the stakeholders, including the elimination of the applications backlog, the systematic monitoring and enforcement regime, the development of customer service delivery and the implementation of the EU directive on habitats and fish health.  We expect to be in a position to roll out the new regime on 1 January and I am quietly confident that we will eliminate the backlog by the end of 2008.

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	125	Within the horticulture sector, there has already been significant capital investment in new glass technology and more efficient growing tunnels.  Grant aid has been provided by my Department for investments to maximise energy-efficient production.  Investment in more efficient technologies will continue to be a priority as energy costs continue to exert pressure on margins.  Under the new scheme of grant aid for commercial horticulture announced last month, priority will be given to projects that are environmentally sustainable.  Proposals for investment in improved production structures and equipment for energy conservation will be welcomed.  It is essential that horticultural producers bring their operations to a level of energy efficiency that can sustain them into the future.Initiatives are being taken at both EU and national levels to develop alternative energy sources.  The Government is committed to maximising the potential of non-food crops to benefit our indigenous renewable energy sector.  Support is being given for research in the biofuel and biomass areas to enable us to respond to new opportunities quickly.  The development of bio-energy should be of significant benefit to Irish farmers, including the horticulture sector, in which the rising cost of energy has been a major concern for many years.  Teagasc is monitoring energy developments in the horticulture sector abroad and experiments are being conducted in Oakpark on alternative fuels, including woodchips.I would like to speak about Sustainable Energy Ireland and other initiatives, including the Power of One campaign, but they are the responsibility of another Department.
#AndrewDoyle	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-party	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-dob	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	126	The Minister of State must have known what I was going to ask.  The one area of Irish agriculture that our climate does not generally favour is horticulture, particularly in respect of protected crops.  While I welcome the grants the Minister of State announced last month, I asked whether there is a direct, targeted energy policy.  Given that the Minister of State ruled out Sustainable Energy Ireland, is it possible to link up with it through Teagasc?  The most recent study, which became available in England in August, suggested that 28% of the costs incurred by the horticulture industry in that country are energy based.  This is significant considering that Ireland enjoys practically the same climate as England and has the same cost base.While I welcome the capital investment and the fact that the Minister of State is trying to encourage the development of improved mechanisms for energy efficiency, is there not an avenue that could be explored to prioritise energy?  Energy costs will probably increase by 40% in the horticulture sector.  If the cost of home heating oil is to increase by €60 per fill from today, one can only imagine the impact on horticulture, particularly in respect of protected crops.  This would disadvantage us further competitively in a sector that is probably worth €300 million to €400 million.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	127	I would like to give the Deputy a wide-ranging answer as if I were the Green Party leader and allowed talk about every Department.  However, I am Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and must therefore confine my remarks to matters for which that Department is responsible.  Notwithstanding this, I take on board the Deputy's suggestion to consider how Teagasc might extend its remit to the greatest extent possible to address crippling energy costs in agriculture, particularly horticulture.  These costs will continue to rise and this explains why we are not growing as many tomatoes as we used to and why the cost of protected crops is growing accordingly in Ireland.We must focus on other areas concerning energy, as I discussed with the Deputy when visiting the good Dominicans in Wicklow town.  Organic production is and has been shown scientifically to be less energy intense than other forms of production and this creates a competitive advantage that needs to be developed.  This is a focus of my work in the Department.  In Wicklow, we also discussed the fact that the use of local abattoirs is much more energy efficient than taking animals to the factories, which incurs high transport costs.I am interested in biogas in terms of anaerobic digestion and geothermal energy in terms of producing protected crops, and I have studied experiments on wind energy for heating water for protected crops.  Not all these areas fall within my remit, but the clear need to address rising energy costs in horticulture is such that I will be pushing for advances in them as part of a Government with collective responsibility.

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	131	Support for the development of farmers' markets is included under the village renewal and development measure in Axis 3 of Rural Development Programme, Ireland, 2007-2013, which programme is operated by the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív.  The aim of this measure is to provide appropriate small-scale infrastructure to enhance the economic and social attractiveness of villages, small towns and the surrounding countryside.  The development of farmers' markets has received support across the country from the local action groups delivering the Leader programmes for 2000 to 2006 and is provided for under the new programme.  The selection process for the local action groups to deliver the Leader-type measures under the new programme will commence shortly.  I understand that funding to networks of producers to market, promote and advertise themselves and their markets at local level is currently provided under the Leader programme.There are now something like under 130 markets in Ireland today, a number that has grown from a very small base over the past five years.  Bord Bia estimates that the farmers' market system has an annual turnover of €28 million and, clearly, there is potential for the system to grow its share of the Irish food market in coming years.The Government is committed to supporting local and regional food and both Towards 2016 and my Department's Agri-Vision 2015 action plan include measures in this regard.  One of our commitments under the programme for Government is the encouragement of more direct selling from farmer to customer by restoring and promoting a national network of farmers' markets.  In this context, my ministerial colleagues and I have participated at events such as launches of new markets to champion the scope of this route to market for the overall benefit of our food industry and our local communities.Bord Bia, which operates under the aegis of my Department, works closely with other State and local agencies to exploit the growing opportunities for farmers' markets, recognising their current and future importance as an opportunity for direct selling by farmers and food entrepreneurs.Bord Bia has supported and will continue to support these markets through relevant advice and information, which is now available on its new small business website, www.bordbiavantage.ie, and through the development and implementation of nationwide marketing campaigns.The main vehicle for farmers' market marketing in Ireland this year was Bord Bia's sponsorship of "Fresh from the Farmer's Market", an eight-part television series shown on RTE 1 between April and June 2007.  This programme featured markets and producers throughout the country and achieved strong viewer ratings throughout the series.  The programme has now been sold to other television networks overseas, including the UK, Australia and New Zealand, and has been shown on flights inbound from the US.  This has helped to showcase the strong and vibrant farmers' market network in Ireland and indeed highlights one of the many wonderful food tourism attractions of Ireland, the food island.  In addition, it has assisted in driving consumer traffic into farmers' markets — both domestic traffic and traffic from tourists.  Given the positive response to the first series, a second series is currently in production and will be shown in April 2008.  Bord Bia is the main sponsor of the show, strengthening this marketing platform.My Department is also currently surveying every known farmers' market in the country to ascertain and compile a detailed database of statistics.  This information will then be used to guide Government policy at both local and national level for farmers' markets going forward.  We are also looking at international examples in order to import some strong ideas and structures that will work for the already blossoming farmers' market system in Ireland.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	12753	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	133	I thank the Minister of State for his verbose answer and his advertising blurb for RTE.  I appreciate the fact that Bord Bia and the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs through the Leader programme are doing much to encourage farmers' markets.  However, on the ground, many farmers' markets are striving — I will not say they are struggling — to boost their popularity locally.  Much of this work is done through voluntary effort.  While programmes are in place through Leader to help them, if some sort of direct support was made available to them for advertising through local media, it would be of great assistance to them.Judging from the Minister of State's answer, he is not telling me that his Department necessarily will be directly responsible for that and I accept this point.  I also accept the fact that there is serious potential within this country for the growth of local markets.  Will the Minister of State consider the idea of direct finance for marketing and advertising?

That said, I am conscious of the need to co-operate with, for example, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, which has overall responsibility for local government.  I am promoting the remit of local government in respect of food.  With this in mind, I am working with officials in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government so that we can jointly financially sponsor measures, for example, to ensure that running water and electricity are provided and that sufficiently central locations with parking and other necessary nuts and bolts are in place to give the market every necessary advantage to be successful.On 13 November 2007, I will attend a local food conference in the Park Hotel in Mullingar, at which Deputy Sherlock might be present.  I look forward to seeing him there.  I will deal with that issue on the ground.

That is all part of the help which is both practical and legal for me to give.I will look at other areas, for example, indirect payments such as the organic farming grants, which, again, are of major assistance to people on many of those stalls, and REPS financing.  Indirectly, hopefully, we can show that we have the financial as well as political commitment to developing farmers' markets.
#JohnBrowne2	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-party	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-dob	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	138	The regulations governing the single payment scheme provide that farmers for whom single payment entitlements were established had to activate those entitlements in 2005 by submitting a single payment application in that year.  Entitlements not activated in 2005 are surrendered to the national reserve.  Additionally, having activated their entitlements in 2005, farmers are required to use their single payment entitlements within three years and any entitlements not used for three years are surrendered to the national reserve.  In order to use entitlements each year, farmers are required to declare one hectare of eligible land for each entitlement held.  The total value of entitlements not activated in 2005 is €4.5 million.In March 2007, my Department wrote to farmers who had not used their entitlements in 2005 or 2006 reminding them that, if they did not use them in 2007, these unused entitlements would be surrendered to the national reserve.  The final figure for the value of entitlements unused for the three years will not be known until processing of the 2007 single payment scheme is completed.My Department will again write to all farmers who hold entitlements and have not used them in either 2005, 2006 or 2007 to give them an opportunity to submit any observations they may wish to make.  Any observations made can be taken into account before a final decision is taken to permanently surrender the entitlements to the national reserve.  It is possible that some farmers were not in a position to use the entitlements for reasons of force majeure — exceptional circumstances — and in such cases, the entitlements in question will not be forfeited to the national reserve.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	139	I accept the point made by the Minister of State that there may be legitimate reasons that someone could not activate them in any of the three years.  After the Department goes through this subsequent process and a fund of between €4 million and €5 million, as is probable at this stage, is still left there, this money should be ring-fenced for hardship cases.A young farmer who applied under the national reserve was given the princely sum of €6.58 per entitlement.  This young farmer has spent a significant amount of money on reclamation and this is his entitlement, which is virtually worthless, particularly when indexation is taken into account.  Where genuine cases of hardship and cases where people have got a raw deal exist, will the Minister consider ring-fencing those moneys to help give those people a decent single farm payment?

This will not encourage anyone to work full time in agriculture.  Will the Minister of State examine these situations?  A force majeure programme existed in the past to deal with these issues.  In the case of people who have suffered a raw deal, will the Minister of State consider their cases sympathetically and ring-fence that element?

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	144	In the context of the thematic strategy on the sustainable use of pesticides, the Commission has proposed legislation on the marketing and use of plant protection products.  These proposals include a number of initiatives aimed at reducing the risks to the environment and human health associated with use of plant protection products.This proposed legislation is subject to the co-decision process, involving both the EU Council and the EU Parliament working in parallel.  The EU Parliament adopted a position on these proposals at its plenary session on 23 October which refers to use reduction, prohibitions or severe restrictions, etc.  However, the Council has not yet completed a first reading of the legislative texts concerned.  Consequently, there is no agreed EU position at this time.The Department is participating in the ongoing discussions at Council.  The current Commission proposals do not contain any plans to impose severe restrictions except where deemed absolutely necessary following scientifically sound risk assessment.  Since the Department already carries out such risk assessments during the authorisation process for pesticides, the current proposals from the Commission present no significant additional negative implications for Irish farming.

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	150	During the last European elections we had many farmers' meetings at which concerns were expressed about restrictions on pesticide use.  Having been in the European Parliament, I know that Ireland is at a disadvantage as a large agricultural producer.  Most views and legislation in the European Parliament are led by the consumer.  We must ensure Ireland communicates its perspective as an agricultural producer so that we take commercial farming into account.  There is a concern that, because the Minister of State has expressed views on a GM-free Ireland, we are moving towards an organic Ireland.  This would make commercial farming a thing of the past in respect of responsible pesticide use, herbicide use and so on.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	151	Where is that coming from?  It is GM propaganda.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	152	I wish to raise this matter at an early stage to ensure farmers and farming representatives are kept in the loop on this issue.  Concern, particularly among arable farmers, is growing.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	153	I am aware of those concerns because I speak to farmers, as does Deputy Coveney.  Sometimes it is not the fault of farmers that they are given incorrect information.  The GM lobby is strong in Brussels and I understand that Deputy Coveney hears them regularly communicating the message that GM crops are a way of not using chemicals.  The opposite is the case, as held by objective studies.  I do not buy the idea that GM crops are a way of avoiding chemicals.Many farmers are minimising pesticide use for reasons of cost as well as human health and environmental reasons and consumer pressure.  I have visited a number of farms where biological controls are tested and are working quite well.  This issue does not relate to what was proposed, namely a 50% cut in pesticide use.  It refers to reduced risk, a far more complex issue that must be worked on through consultation with farmers, agronomists and those who have a scientific base for what they are advocating.  I give a commitment that no decision I will stand over will be made in the dark, without consultation with farmers.  It is vital that farmers recognise that consumer pressure is in favour of less pesticides and that scientific means, which do not involve GM, allow for far better plant protection with less pesticide through breeding various strains.  For example, part of the directive deals with integrated pest management, the prohibition on aerial spraying, the designation of areas of greatly reduced or zero pesticide use and measures of risk reduction through harmonised indicators.  It is quite complex and involves training and certification for professional users of pesticides.

The directive does not refer to levels of use but of reduced risk.  This is far more important to bear in mind and will not be implemented without consultation with farmers.  I assure the Deputy of that.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	164	Yesterday we heard of the tragic case of a woman given the all-clear and then diagnosed as having breast cancer.  I have listened to the Taoiseach for long enough and on many occasions he stated that the people of Ireland should thank him for the health service.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Health and Children have repeatedly referred to the sum of €14 billion spent on the health service.When was the Minister for Health and Children first notified of difficulties with the breast cancer service in Portlaoise hospital?  How can the Taoiseach, after ten and a half years in office, stand over a systems failure in Portlaoise whereby only one radiologist signed off on each mammogram?  By any standards, those of a centre of excellence or elsewhere, mammograms are signed off by more than one radiologist.  This is a systems failure over which the Taoiseach presides, yet he says people should thank him for the state of the health service.Eight women, as far as we know, in the midlands were misdiagnosed because of that systems failure.  Despite the repeated assertions of Minister after Minister, that is where the blame lies.  Government policy is outlined by the Government, namely, Fianna Fáil, the Progressive Democrats, the Green Party and the Independents.  The Taoiseach has allowed a situation to arise whereby people are leaderless in terms of integrity in the health service.  What people who are not trained in the medical area want is integrity of system and trust in that system so that if they are obliged to seek treatment, it will give them the very best chance of survival.I will ask my two questions again.  When was the Minister for Health and Children first notified of difficulties in respect of the system at Portlaoise hospital?  How can the Taoiseach stand over a systems failure as blatant as that which arose at Portlaoise and under which only one radiologist signed off on each mammogram?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	165	The HSE has apologised to all of the women involved for the delay in diagnosis.  Everyone is concerned about these eight women and it is important that the requisite treatment and counselling services have been put in place in respect of them.The Minister for Health and Children was informed on 29 August last that following concerns raised by the relevant staff, the HSE had established a review of all breast radiology diagnoses at the Midland Regional Hospital in Portlaoise made in the period from November 2003 to August 2007.  That review is being led by Dr. Ann O'Doherty, consultant radiologist at St. Vincent's University Hospital who also works with BreastCheck.  The HSE advised the Department that 3,026 mammograms — representing the total number involved — had been reviewed, that this led to 234 women having their diagnosis status and clinical notes reviewed and that, as a result, 54 individuals were called to clinics at St. Vincent's University Hospital.  Of the 54 recalled, to date seven have been identified — another person was also identified but not under this review — as having a diagnosis of cancer.  All seven women have been offered the appropriate treatment and counselling.At the beginning of this week, the cases of 19 women were still to be reviewed.  Of these, six have been referred to the special clinic at St. Vincent's.  Four of them attended the clinic yesterday and two are scheduled to attend on Thursday.  The review will be completed this week and a full report will be published by the end of November.I understand that a consultant radiologist whose practice gave rise to this review remains on administrative leave.  I also understand that a helpline has been put in place.As Deputy Kenny is aware, until recently there were 35 different hospitals throughout the country at which treatment was available.  The HSE has for some time — in line with the practice in other jurisdictions, including Northern Ireland — been reducing that number and establishing centres of excellence at which different standards apply.  The latter information is separate from the matter under discussion but it outlines what the HSE has been endeavouring to do in providing a service.  The eminent person charged with driving the reform programme will be commencing work in a few weeks and will be bringing the cancer service into line with the review carried out by the HSE.   We look forward to that happening during 2008 and 2009.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	166	The Taoiseach did not answer the question I asked.  How can he stand over a systems failure under which only one radiologist signed off on these women's mammograms?  At Mayo General Hospital, double signing has been in place since 1990.  I understand there is a letter, written on 13 December 2006, on RTE's website, which indicates that in order to avoid the possibility of serious litigation, it would be necessary to replace the equipment in Portlaoise hospital as a matter of extreme urgency.  As the Taoiseach is aware, this was identified by Professor O'Higgins in his report relating to 12 centres.  However, neither funding nor resources were ever provided in respect of Portlaoise.The Taoiseach stated that the Minister for Health and Children was first informed about this matter on 29 August last.  However, it is clear that there is another letter, dated December 2006, on the file which indicates the necessity for major investment to be made in respect of equipment.As the leader of the Government for the past ten and a half years, how can the Taoiseach justify presiding — along with successive Ministers for Health and Children — over a situation where, in respect of the system designed to deliver the best service to the women of the midlands regarding symptomatic breast disease, only one radiologist signed off on mammograms?On RTE this morning, Mr. O'Brien, CEO of the national cancer screening service, stated that in order to deliver the type of service to which he was referring, one must first set out clearly one's intent and then engage in a clear process of planning how one should proceed.  Will the Taoiseach outline this clear process?  When will we be informed that this will form part of the critical infrastructure Bill?  Where is the money that has been allocated?  What buildings, facilities and personnel will be used to deliver the service to which the Taoiseach refers?I am of the view that the HSE is but a tool of the Government.

I will, however, outline to the Deputy the advice I received.  I am informed that there was no systems failure involved.  When the recruitment process took place, one person applied for the post.  That individual was taken on to fill the position but is now on administrative leave.Those who run the 35 hospitals to which I referred earlier would argue that we should have state-of-the-art equipment.  That is precisely why we are moving away from that position.  We are following best international practice by having fewer centres.  Northern Ireland used to have 19 centres but it now only has five.

We need to maximise investment in state-of-the-art facilities, with full multidisciplinary teams.  Professor Keane is due to take up his post on 19 November.  He is expected to quickly designate national clinical leaders in the areas of radiation, surgical and medical oncology.  Arrangements are in hand to enable him to take control of all the new developments relating to cancer services from 1 January and, progressively, to assume responsibility for all existing cancer services and related funding and staffing.  He intends to designate the locations for a range of cancer specialties from among the eight centres in early January.  I hope he will be allowed to do so, particularly because everyone will be seeking these specialties for their facility.  He will, therefore, be changing, as soon as he arrives, into detailed planning to facilitate these designations.  On the orderly phased transfer of services between locations, the HSE plans to have completed 50% of the transition of services next year and to complete up to 90% of it by the end of 2009.As Deputy Kenny is aware, the Minister for Health and Children approved a national quality standard in respect of systematic breast disease services under last year's Health Act.  That standard requires significant reorganisation of breast cancer services to ensure that each centre providing such services serves a population of approximately 300,000 to 350,000; manages a minimum of 150 new cases each year; allows for a minimum number of new cases, 50 per year, to be managed by specialists — breast surgeons; ensures that such care is provided by a team made up of a surgeon, a radiologist and a pathologist; and has a minimum of two nominated consultants in each of these specialties.  All of the other initiatives in this area were set out last year.

It was all published last year and Deputies can look at it.What we should do in this House is try to make the necessary reforms to ensure these issues do not happen.  The best way to do so is to make sure we have state-of-the-art, well-organised and well-focused multidisciplinary teams in a limited number of locations where we can give people the best service possible.  This is what is set out clearly for us, what is being implemented and it is the right thing to do.

What happened in Portlaoise is the worst in a recent series of misdiagnoses including a woman in Galway who was misdiagnosed twice, the case of Rebecca O'Malley in Cork and the cases in Barringtons Hospital about which we were supposed to have had an inquiry but which has not yet got underway fully.What happened in Portlaoise?  I do not want to hear about system failures or the Taoiseach to tell me he cannot talk about somebody being on administrative leave.  Why not?  A serious misdiagnosis occurred in Portlaoise and I want to know what happened.  The Taoiseach should tell the House in plain language.  What went wrong?  Why were the checks not carried out?  The women concerned at least deserve the courtesy of having it explained.  When was it discovered in the hospital in Portlaoise and what was done about it at that time?  We were told it was made public at the end of August and we are now told the Minister for Health and Children was informed on 20 August.The Minister for Health and Children is reported to have stated she is considering a review of mammograms throughout the country.  Is such a review being contemplated?  I expect many women who have had mammograms during recent years must now be concerned about whether the results they received were accurate.  Is a review being carried out elsewhere?  Is there any reason to believe the type of problem which arose in Portlaoise might present in other hospitals?

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	191	The reason was that one of the senior consultants had concerns about the diagnoses and as I understand it — I want to be fair to people and due process — the mammograms being read by one consultant showed different results to another consultant's reading of them.  As I stated, a consultant is on administrative leave because of this.  Consultant Ann O'Doherty of St. Vincent's Hospital and BreastCheck is preparing a report which will be published this month.  She will cover all aspects of the case.On Deputy Gilmore's more general question, I understand from what I have read and from previous briefings on setting up national centres that we have more consultants than we need.  We have 70 consultants.  People ask what have we done during recent years.  We have taken on more than 70 senior breast cancer consultants.  For our size, population and geographical and regional base it is more than we require.  The fact is that we do not follow best international practice because we use 35 locations.  This is not the way to do things.  The best thing is to get multidisciplinary teams working together on oncology in centralised locations.  Of course they can outsource and use modern technology.When one has 35 hospitals, and as the letter mentioned by Deputy Kenny, they will always look for more equipment.  I am not denying that.  In this case they were looking for digital technology.

She is actively engaged in putting that report together.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	203	During recent days and during the course of exchanges here today we have been asked to accept that this will improve when centres of excellence are established and that they are the answer to all of this.  The problem I have with this and the Government's problem of credibility is that centres of excellence were recommended seven years ago in the O'Higgins report and it still has not happened.  According to the Minister for Health and Children it will happen by 2009.  According to Mr. O'Brien, who is in charge of the strategy, it will not happen for a further three years after that and it will be well into 2012 or 2013 before they are established.In the meantime, the Government proposes to close local centres and 13 of them are targeted for closure.  What will happen to cancer services after local services are closed and before the Government gets around to establishing the centres of excellence?  According to Professor Crown in his radio interview with Pat Kenny today, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health and Children have been going around the country cutting the ribbons on private cancer facilities which are smaller than the facilities being closed to make way for the centres of excellence.Cancer treatment and services have been dogged by delay over recent years and the Taoiseach has presided over it.  BreastCheck was to have rolled out completely by 2003.  It is still not completed.  The centres of excellence are seven years coming.  We have nothing but continuing delay on the services being provided.  The Taoiseach, the Minister for Health and Children and the Government speak as though they are starting from day one and not as people who have been in charge of the dilapidation of the service for the past ten years.With regard to the Portlaoise issue, what exactly is "administrative leave"?  Is it suspension with pay?  Who authorised it and who made the decision to put the consultant on administrative leave?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	204	On the final question, it was a decision of the section of the HSE which appoints consultants.  I presume it is pending Ann O'Doherty's inquiry.The 70 consultants taken on in recent years are all in place as are their departments.  The problem is that they are too scattered.  The Deputy is correct that the provision of centres of excellence has not worked and we are all aware of why that is so.The national BreastCheck screening programme last year alone screened 64,000 people.  Every year there have been substantial increases in the number.  It is fully rolled out and is commencing a process——

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	209	At present, it is being rolled out in counties Cork, Galway and Roscommon.  We have provided additional funding this year, as we did over the past number of years, so the national cancer screening service can meet its additional costs.  The full complement of 111 staff for the roll-out has been approved and the Minister has made almost €30 million available this year for capital funding.  We have provided for the construction of two new clinical units, seven mobile units and state-of-the-art digital equipment.  Screening in individual counties is dictated by BreastCheck management operation considerations.  We have gone from the position of seven years ago, when there was little or nothing.  I was present at the launch of BreastCheck, when we had practically nothing.  We are progressively rolling it out, resourcing it and putting the staff in place.  The published national cancer control programme shows the absolute necessity of implementing the national control programme without delay.  The HSE has designated the four managed cancer control networks and the eight cancer centres, and Professor Keane is in place.Deputy Gilmore asked a fair question in respect of the 13 centres, the operations of which were stopped following the report published last year or the year before.  The 13 centres dealt with less than 55 cases between them.  I am neither a radiographer nor a radiologist and I do not know anything about mammography but every report, including references to other countries, states that centres which deal with small numbers of cases are not safe and not what we should be doing.  It is not that we have any bright ideas; it is international best practice.  That is why we brought Professor Keane here, as someone who has done this successfully in Canada.  He is Irish but has worked for the Canadian system.  He can do this over a two-year period and we have put significant resources into the area.  I am not saying that if we had all the digital equipment, the Professor Keanes, the 70 consultants and everything else we need we would prevent somebody from misreading a mammogram or another person reading it in a different way.  However, we are progressively putting in place the necessary resources and people for BreastCheck and the national screening programme, as we have done for at least seven or eight years.The most important aspect of this matter is that seven or eight people have been badly let down by the service and it is our obligation to do everything we can for them.

We need clarity because €16 million has been incurred by the State with the first instalment made and no report seems to have been made to the Dáil in any shape or form.  The House should debate this important issue and decide to postpone it until matching changes which will deliver service at the frontline are made and that it is yielding value for money.

The Tánaiste stated that there was a small group of people that could have been disenfranchised.  As I understand it, it is the other way around.

#ThomasByrne	unknown-#ThomasByrne-party	unknown-#ThomasByrne-dob	unknown-#ThomasByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	261	As a former solicitor for eight years, until the general election relieved me of my duties, I practised a large amount of conveyancing and I am glad to see the reforms that are being introduced in the Bill before the House.  The legislation is a comprehensive reform of the land and conveyancing law with which solicitors and purchasers must deal when buying houses, mortgaging properties or conducting any transactions relating to land and property.  I pay tribute to all the people who have been involved in this process.  The theory is that enacting legislation is a matter for Members but in areas such as this, we are completely reliant on the experts.  The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Law Reform Commission, other interested bodies and Professor Wiley, about whom and from whom we learned so much, have played a huge part in this Bill.The system of land law which has existed in this country since the foundation of the State has been in some ways an insult to the idea of a republic where we still have vestiges of the feudal system of tenure in the law of the land and where property, in some cases, can be held under a feudal system which really does not apply to a republic.  I am glad to see that being repealed.I would make one general criticism of the Bill but it should not be taken personally by anyone and should really be seen as constructive.  Much of the Bill is very theoretical and I do not see the input of solicitors who deal with property law on a daily basis.  A number of welcome measures have been introduced.  I refer, in particular, to section 62 relating to seals on deeds.  Although a minor one, it is an issue which has annoyed me.  Section 62 states: "(1) Any rule of law which requires — (a) a seal for the valid execution of a deed by an individual, or (b) authority to deliver a deed to be given by deed, is abolished."  I would go a lot further than the drafters of this legislation have gone and would ban the use of seals because the ordinary purchaser or mortgager does not have seals.  The use of seals on any kind of deed is an anachronism.  A section such as this in the Bill will not prevent the use of seals which will continue because solicitors and lawyers are generally loath to end traditional ways of their craft even where it is not necessary.  This section permits the use of seals.The Land Registry rules have a similar provision in them where the use of a seal is not required but we still see solicitors and, in some cases, the Land Registry insisting that seals are used on deeds.  That is wrong because it is a complete anachronism dating from a time when the local lord or whoever conveyed his property and used his seal as a symbol of power and importance.  That has no relevance to modern day life.An important provision in this Bill which will have huge practical effect for many purchasers, people who own freehold land and people who live in housing estates that have been completed in the past few years is the issue of the enforceability of freehold covenants.  That has long been an out of date provision of law where freehold covenants cannot be enforced in certain circumstances.  This has caused problems because many of the drafters of conveyances of houses did not seem to be aware of it.  In creating management companies in housing estates using freehold conveyances and imposing obligations and conditions on covenants, the issue of the subsequent enforceability of those covenants in regard to the second or subsequent purchasers of a property has never been addressed.  I do not think it has been addressed by this Bill either because I do not believe it applies retrospectively in regard to housing estates which already have these covenants in them, although I can be corrected on that.I can think of one particular estate in which my wife owned a house before we got married.  The management company fees were simply not enforceable and the estate did not operate in a satisfactory manner because the local authority did not want to take over common areas.  The first purchasers had covenants with the management company but these were not enforceable by subsequent purchasers of the properties who could get away scot free without paying their management fees.  This is a welcome change but perhaps we will have to look at it on Committee Stage to see how enforceable it is and what this change means in respect of covenants already in deeds.I am disappointed by the abolition of the rule of lost modern grant in section 32 and the requirement for a court order in respect of this.  What this meant was that if an easement — for example, a right of way — had been in use for 20 years, a vendor of a property could certify that by signing the appropriate statutory declaration.  Perhaps two or three owners of a property might swear an affidavit that such a right of way or whatever was in use for 20 years.  That removed a lot of uncertainty from property transactions in which there might have been issues of right of way.  This will have a negative effect in that we will have to wait for a court order to have such a right of way recognised.  That will add costs, hassle and time and perhaps it should be looked at again.  I know there are good reasons for it because an affidavit is open to abuse.  However, swearing a false affidavit is a criminal offence and solicitors do not condone it.In a way I am glad to see the fee tail and fee farm grant being abolished.  The legal practice in which I worked drafted fee farm grants until relatively recently but that is not required now with the freehold covenants now being enforceable.  That is an old system and it worked in some cases in some housing estates and industrial lands where leases many not have been appropriate or not allowed as in the case of houses.  It is probably right to abolish the fee tail, although there are properties which are affected by it.  A client of mine owned a property in fee tail female.  That property can only pass down to female members of the family as things stands.The issue of conveyancing costs is being addressed and this will help.  However, when we move towards e-conveyancing, it will help even more.  A major issue which is not addressed by the Bill, and probably should not be, is the higher charges in the Land Registry versus the lower charges in the Registry of Deeds.  There is a reason for that in that the Land Registry is like an insurance policy and gives a State guarantee over the title to one's property.  On the higher scale of Land Registry fees, it can cost €625 to register the ownership or transfer of a property plus €125 to register the mortgage deed whereas in the Registry of Deeds, one can register the deed for €44 and the mortgage deed for another €44.  There is a reason for that in that the Land Registry does a different job from the Registry of Deeds but clients do not understand that.  It is an issue which should be looked at possibly in the context of this Bill in an effort to bring down conveyancing fees and perhaps level the playing pitch.That leads on to the other issue of compulsory registration of property.  Some 85% of property is registered in the Land Registry.  It is mainly rural as opposed to city property.  I would like the system of compulsory registration broadened to other counties and to new housing estates.  There are new housing estates in which houses are being sold where purchasers' solicitors are being provided with boxes of title deeds.  There should be an obligation on builders' solicitors to register the property in the Land Registry as part of preparing booklets of title for purchasers.  It is only fair to purchasers and it would mean more efficiency in the system and in solicitors' offices because they would not have to read through boxes of title deeds.  In the case of apartments in Dublin, in particular, there are literally three boxes of title deeds and the solicitor must go through all of them if he or she is to comply with his or her obligations.I am glad the issue of mortgage enforcement is dealt with in section 94.  As it happens, I spent a lot of time during the general election campaign in and out of court in respect of a couple of clients who were in difficulty with their mortgages and on whom court orders were threatened.  One certainly could not abandon someone who was going to lose his or her house or property just because there was a general election coming up.  Section 94(3) codifies in law what actually happens in court where the judge or, in some cases, the county registrar uses his or her discretion.  It states "where it appears to the court that the mortgagor is likely to be able within a reasonable period to pay any arrears, including interest, due under the mortgage or to remedy any other breach of obligation arising under it", the judge can adjourn the proceedings, can stay the enforcement of a court order by a bank or can postpone the bank taking possession.  We need to look carefully at this issue of banks taking possession of properties.  There is an increasing number of repossessions.  I am particularly worried by the sub-prime market in which we see what I would call the sharks.  I got a leaflet in my door today offering me a fantastic mortgage at a rate of 8%, which is significantly higher than normal.In regard to banks taking possession of properties and the court's discretion to delay orders or adjourn proceedings, the court should be able to take into account the fact the borrower has been obligated to pay a super normal rate of interest.  Such a provision would take some of the wind out of the sails of the sub-prime lenders, which tend to go to court quickly when borrowers miss a payment or two.  Some of the more traditional banks take a more reasonable approach, as long as borrowers are honest and open with them.  That is not happening in all cases, however.  This is not just an issue of financial services regulation, it is a conveyancing issue too.I would like to comment on the final section of the Bill, section 122, which contains an obscure provision.  I am delighted that this section, which states "the power of the sheriff, or of other persons entitled to exercise the sheriff's powers, to seize a tenancy under a writ of fieri facias or other process of execution is abolished” has been included in the legislation.  This measure will mean that when purchasers are buying leasehold property, their solicitors will no longer be obliged to conduct searches in the sheriff’s office and the revenue sheriff’s office.  Given that such searches currently add up to €200 to the cost of a leasehold property transaction, this proposal represents a positive step for purchasers.While I like the Bill's co-ownership provisions, they could go a lot further.  When practising solicitors deal with co-ownership, they often deal with the division of property after people have fallen out.  This issue relates to the issue of civil unions as well.  It is also a question of family law, although there are separate rules in relation to divorce and separation.  The law is very vague on what should happen when unmarried parties, such as couples or brothers and sisters, decide to sell jointly owned properties.  I am not sure that this legislation adds very much to the existing provisions in this area.  As solicitors, we often sit in our offices going through electricity bills, gas bills and other utility bills, trying to work out who owns what.  Perhaps it is something we should look at.  These cases have been arising much more regularly in my practice and I am sure the same is the case in other practices.I am glad that this new law has been introduced.  The sooner it is enacted, the better.  The next issue we will have to deal with is e-conveyancing.  This Bill does not deal with the issue of solicitors' undertakings, which I raised on the Adjournment.  More work has to be done on this matter, which is the subject of some public disquiet.  Solicitors have to instil confidence in the public that they are doing a good job.  I am reminded of the old adage that "most people think that most solicitors are crooks, but that their own solicitor is fantastic" because it applies in this instance and is what people generally think.  It is important for the legal profession that legislators deal with the loss of confidence in solicitors.  As I do not have any more to say on the issue, I will not use the rest of my time.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	262	I welcome this Bill, which is a few decades late in a historic and practical sense.  I accept the need to take legislative action to bring the ownership of land, and everything that pertains to it, up to date.  I pay tribute to the invaluable work of the Law Reform Commission in preparing the Bill and clearing the cobwebs that surround much land registry and conveyancing legislation.  As a farmer, I am familiar with the legal problems associated with the ownership of small portions of land.  I am annoyed and concerned about the long delays encountered during the conveyancing process.  I hope this legislation will clear up the uncertainty in this area.One of the greatest barriers to the full take-up by citizens of their rights is the use of expert or archaic language.  The proposal in this Bill to remove this obstacle is welcome.  The exclusive language used by many professions is designed to exclude lay people and to mystify relatively simple processes.  As Mrs. Justice Laffoy pointed out, it is crucial that we get rid of the historical and irrelevant baggage which engulfs the day-to-day work of conveyancers so they can concentrate on what is important.  I hope that will lead to more efficient and cost-effective practice.The land law and conveyancing law code consists of a complex mixture of statutory provisions, common law and equity.  It can be unnecessarily complicated and is sometimes difficult to apply to modern conditions.  Land law, broadly speaking, deals with the multiple types of ownership of land and the rights pertaining to each of them.  Conveyancing law is concerned with the transfer and disposal of land and the rights pertaining to it.  I welcome this Bill because it provides for the repeal, in whole or in part, of approximately 150 pre-1922 statutes, some of which go back to the 11th and 12th centuries and for their replacement, where appropriate, with statutory provisions which are more suited to 21st century circumstances.  The Bill also repeals certain provisions in Acts of the Oireachtas which will no longer be required following its enactment.The average waiting time for the completion of certain land registry transactions is well over a year in some parts of the State, which is untenable.  These delays result from staff shortages and the huge increase in land and property dealings in recent years.  The Government did not meet these new challenges by increasing staffing levels in the Land Registry.  As a result, people have had to wait for considerable periods of time.  Many sales collapsed as a result of the long delays in the Land Registry.  At the end of January of this year, the total number of current dealings in the Property Registration Authority, which replaced the old Land Registry and Registry of Deeds Office last November, was 175,790.  I remind the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that his Department is responsible for the failure to increase staffing levels over the past five years.  The Minister did not acknowledge such problems in his speech.The average waiting time for each county is calculated by dividing the number of dealings in the county by the average number of dealings completed there each month in 2006.  My home county of Longford has one of the most advanced land registration systems in the country.  It was to the fore in participating in the Irish Spatial Data Infrastructure project.  As Deputies are aware, Land Registry delays are one of the biggest problems we face on a daily basis.  I witnessed such difficulties on several occasions when I was a Member of the Seanad.  Such delays impact adversely on our beleaguered farming community, which faces undue delays in selling sites or land.  They are particularly annoying for elderly people who want to sell their land as quickly as possible.  I hope this problem will be rectified.There are a number of major faults with the conveyancing process — it is too complex, for example, and it lacks transparency across processes and groups.  Lenders do not provide any universal standard documentation.  The system is overly paper-based.  It inherited its propensity for delays from old legislation, as I have said.  Under the current conveyancing process, information is spread over wide groups.  There is no uniform or standard usage of information technology.  When I visited the Land Registry offices in recent months, I noticed that the system has improved to some extent.  While the legislation in this field is complex and outdated, the legislation before the House proposes to address that.  The conservative nature of the culture and tradition in this sector means that delays are easily accepted.Some of our land ownership and transaction laws and practices are based on the feudal notion of land tenure.  This Bill abolishes the surviving traces of feudal tenure, which was the system under which the king was lord of all land and granted land to his lords in return for military and other services.  While such practices are no longer found in this country, we all remember the landlords who granted portions of land to tenants etc. in a manner that complicated matters for many farmers throughout the country.  That landlords used to give tenants a field here and a field there, often in separate townlands, but not the fields in between, continues to cause friction.Some amending legislation has been brought forward but more is required to facilitate those who wish to have their portions of land in close proximity to where they live.The Bill also abolishes various common law rules resulting from court decisions and conveyancing practices.  The abolition of the feudal system will lead to the repeal of 130 pre-1922 statutes without amendment.  It will ensure that in future landowners will own their land in the normal sense of the word.  This is to be welcomed as a system of feudalism has no place in the modern world.  People want ownership of land for which they may have paid a high price and they want to have clear title to what they have paid for.Our now rapidly fading economic growth was not matched by modernisation or improvement of the processes of Government to business and Government to citizen.  I am pleased that members of the Government parties will table amendments to this Bill as they are not happy with it.  It is to be hoped that this Bill, with the necessary amendments, will bring the system to an acceptable 21st century level of standards.  I wait with bated breath for the amendments from the Government side.  I have no doubt there will be plenty of amendments from this side of the House.
#MJNolan	unknown-#MJNolan-party	unknown-#MJNolan-dob	unknown-#MJNolan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	263	I welcome the introduction of this Bill.  The Bill is a comprehensive, radical and far-reaching reform of our land and conveyancing laws.  I wish to speak on the subject of the archaic laws under which conveyancing of land is operated.  The Oireachtas has not adequately examined the area of e-conveyancing.  This country has shown the world it is capable of being a modern economy and has proved beyond doubt over the past 15 years that it can hold its own with any other country.  We are selling ourselves short by not embracing computing and e-conveyancing.  Some other countries, such as Canada, have perfected this system and I suggest the Minister consider it.  Members of this House and the Seanad have been contacted by constituents who are frustrated by the legal process concerned with the change of ownership of land and houses.  The house building programme has been at the level of 70,000 units per year, although this number will decrease this year.  Action must be taken to make it easier for individuals to deal with the transfer of property.  At a time when the legal profession is under the spotlight, it should be proactive in ensuring that it is seen to be putting in place more effective and efficient conveyancing legislation.This Bill is welcome because it will remove some of the archaic language and simplify and update the language used.  Some solicitors and other members of the legal profession tend to use legalistic language in an effort to buy time when problems arise in conveyancing of property.  Like any other profession, it has good practitioners and some very poor practitioners.  The work being carried out by efficient solicitors' offices can be frustrated by them being forced to deal with legal practitioners who may not be as efficient and as effective.  This is a source of great frustration to the solicitors involved and to the public.It is timely to be discussing this Bill.  This House should be more proactive in ensuring that the conveyancing system and its laws are updated.  It does not take rocket scientists to put in place legislation to deal with e-conveyancing, if that is what is needed.  The vested interests should be seen to support the Minister, the Department and the public, in ensuring that this Bill is given an easy passage.The role of the Law Reform Commission in supporting this Bill should be acknowledged and commended.  Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness is to be commended.  She was president of the Law Reform Commission during the debate on the drafting of this legislation.The Bill is a joint project that was launched in 2003, four years ago, which shows how slow the progress has been in bringing forward legislation.  It is a joint initiative between the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Law Reform Commission, the primary purpose of which is to comprehensively reform and modernise all the land conveyancing laws that required updating.  The Bill will repeal many of the pre-1922 statutes and this is to be welcomed.  The Bill will find support on all sides of the House.The role of the Land Registry should be acknowledged.  It worked for many years under dreadful conditions, as I was informed by a number of members of its staff who were frustrated in dealing with the avalanche of work.  Resources have been made available and conditions of work and the efficiency of the office have improved.  I hope this Bill will be enacted as soon as possible and I ask the Minister to bring forward legislation to ensure that this country holds its premier place in international circles by having good e-conveyancing legislation on the Statute Book.  This should be user-friendly so that where there are no problems attending title, conveyancing can take place within a matter of days rather than months.  I know of cases where conveyancing can take years.  A mechanism in law should be in place to clean up titles that require it.  It is hoped that by the end of this Dáil term, e-conveyancing legislation will be in place in keeping with the first rate economy.  I wish this Bill a speedy passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas.
#TerenceFlanagan	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-party	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-dob	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	264	I welcome the opportunity to debate this Bill.  As we are all aware land registration is very complex in Ireland.  It reflects the various changes in our country's history.  For example, the bulk of the deeds that still form the day-to-day practice of conveyancing describe lands as being  in situ or in the King’s or Queen’s county.  Had the compulsory registration of the Registration of Title Act been extended from 1970 onwards, the Minister’s task in introducing electronic conveyancing would have been far simpler.  Because of the various transactions and changes in ownership during that time unfortunately, significant easing of the system might have taken place.  However, it was not.  It is only in the compulsory registration counties that the registration of the title is incorporated in the issue of a single land certificate.  This has resulted in significant changes and has eased the burdensome nature of conveyancing by having just title incorporated in the Land Registry.  Changes in the law in this area are long overdue.  Many old Acts are being binned into history because of this legislation which I welcome.  There are still older statutes and the sooner we deal with them the better for clarity and expediency.I pay a particular tribute to the Law Reform Commission for all the great work it has carried out on this issue.  It has successfully implemented a programme of research and investigation into the law that is second to none.  It is infinitely valuable to us as Members of the Oireachtas and it is important that we place on the record our thanks for its great work.  This Bill will make the process of conveyancing simpler and more straightforward so it might be clearly understood by the consumer.  To achieve this goal much of the old terminology must be replaced by concepts that are more easily understood.  The staff of the Land Registry office should be commended on their great work also.  Some of the pieces of paper that pass across the desks of examiners of title are complex.In essence, the Bill reduces the number of estates of varying degrees of ownership to two which I welcome.  This will provide a more definite and certain concept of land ownership.  The two basic types of ownership will remain freehold or fee simple interest and estate with absolute freehold interest with or without incumbrances and leasehold type of tenancy with covenants and conditions restricting absolute freedom to enjoy the benefit of ownership.  There will be no more fee farm rents or fee farm grants, no more leases for life renewable forever and other lesser known but very complex degrees of ownership.The process of change and simplification will reduce some of the mystique attaching to title and ownership.  This will make matters clearer for the consumer and save money as the time involved in the conveyancing transaction will be considerably less.  Only a few years ago we were told that three solicitors were necessary to complete an independent house transaction, one for a vendor, one for the purchaser and one for the financial institution, which was ridiculous.  I am glad this Bill will make that a thing of the past.The Bill also deals with many different areas of land law.  It represents a major comprehensive review of the law concerning property in Ireland.  Currently there is no such thing as absolute ownership of land or property in the State.  The Bill will finally redress that issue.  The State will be enshrined as the alternative to the British Crown in such matters.  The amendment and repeal of aspects of the Partition Acts of 1868 and 1872 are welcome because the uncertainty and confusion that surrounds the current interpretations of these Acts can cause difficulties.  There will be a wider discretion vested in the courts to interpret the law and apply modern conditions and everyday eventualities to the concept of ownership.It is important to move towards the eventual registration of all lands in this country.  This is the most important goal and with the enactment of this Bill the Minister might consider focusing his attention on it.  He mentioned that the system has been extended to three more counties but there is a long way to go to ensuring that this long overdue measure of ownership can be taken into consideration in a consumer friendly way.Section 47 of the Bill represents an important change.  Similarly in light of recent examples of fraud and questionable practices the new protections for purchasers as laid down in section 57 are significant.  The contractual position relating to the conduct of public auction awaits new legislation and a regulatory framework to cover auctioneers.  Will the Minister update the House on the steps being taken towards regulating estate agents?  Will the introduction of e-conveyancing reduce fees for the purchaser?I avail of this opportunity to raise the Michael Lynn case which was recently reported in the media.  A report by the Law Society's regulation of practice committee disclosed acts of dishonesty on the part of Mr. Lynn in regard to clients' money.  Mr. Lynn has been investigated by the Law Society due to concerns about his property dealings.  He has a multi-million euro portfolio of more than 100 properties in a number of different countries.  The High Court has been told that since January 2007 Mr. Lynn has drawn down loans totalling more than €26 million and has purchased approximately 40 properties, all financed by loans.  It is alleged that he took out multiple mortgages on a number of his properties with several banks.  The Law Society went to the High Court and has froze Mr. Lynn's assets, obviously to protect clients' money and to prevent further misappropriation.  What measures will he take to review the legal profession in light of this case and the fact that solicitors can draw down loans without security?I welcome this Bill which will provide for a comprehensive reform and modernisation of land law and conveyancing law.

Anybody who has had dealings with property will be aware that the area of conveyancing and registering of property is a complex one which most people leave with their solicitor and do not get into the detail.  We all know from acting as public representatives that our desks are full of requests to expedite dealings and registrations of properties.  We attempt at all times to progress those requests in order that people will not be left on bridging finance and to establish title for them.This Bill is a serious attempt to modernise and update the law on conveyancing, registration of land and property and the vast amounts of unregistered property.  To date there has been no compulsion on anybody to register a property.  This has caused difficulties.  Can the Minister inform the House how many land holdings and properties are not registered?  It has been indicated to me that there could be hundreds of thousands and perhaps up to half a million of such properties.  As I am not sure if that figure is correct, perhaps the Minister would indicate the factual position.We are prisoners of our past.  We have heard at first hand from our grandparents of the great battles for the right to tenure and from our history books of Davitt and Parnell and great groups of people who fought for the right of people to own their own land.  It is interesting that in eastern European countries people are now trying to re-establish the rights to lands taken from them in the 1920s up to the time of the Iron Curtain.  If we were to go back far enough, we could discover people here who were disinherited and, in my case, driven west — to Hell or to Connacht.  Are the people who acquired and took ownership of those lands the true owners?  If we were to go back far enough, others could be established as the true owners.While I am not sure if the legislation covers this matter, I know that much of the land was redistributed under the auspices of the Irish Land Commission.  While it was distributed to individual farmers who have owned and farmed it legally since, many of them have never vested or registered it in their names.  Thousands of portions of land allocated by the Irish Land Commission have still not been registered in the name of the recipient.  In many cases it has been passed on to the next or subsequent generations.  On a daily basis I come across such cases.  If a member of the landowner's family wishes to build a house on a site on the land, it may be discovered that the land is not registered and consolidated into the family holding.  It will then be necessary to search the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to try to resurrect documents from the Irish Land Commission dealings and refer it on to the Property Registration Authority in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  It is all part and parcel of a public representative's work in liaising between our constituents and the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Property Registration Authority.  Compulsory registration would eliminate such difficulties.  I ask the Minister to confirm that we will have a system of compulsory registration.The Property Registration Authority will decentralise to Roscommon town.  Some 230 civil servants are to be relocated with an advance party of 60 already in place.  It is expected that 90 will be in place by the end of January.  A site was purchased for approximately €3.5 million.  It is intended that a purpose-built 50,000 sq. ft. building will be constructed.  I ask the Minister to indicate when construction will take place.  Much of the registration work we are discussing will be done by the civil servants concerned.I am not sure whether the legislation addresses the issue of absolute title.  Some believe people from towns and cities and visitors to the country have a right to roam the agricultural land of Ireland.  This has been a matter of major dispute with the representative groups of farmers, including the IFA, ICMSA and others, claiming this is not an entitlement without prior agreement, a position I absolutely support.  Any right to roam must be established by a solid agreement that will protect the interests of the landlord against claim and damage.  If his or her property is to be used for amenity purposes, he or she should receive compensation.Recently we have had the phenomenon of management companies becoming involved in properties, particularly blocks of apartments in towns and cities.  This has been a feature for many years in other countries, particularly the United States, where their operation seems to have been fine-tuned but it certainly has not been fine-tuned here.  The tenants of many such properties have major issues regarding the responsibility of such companies.  This area needs to be regularised and if legislation is needed, so be it, but I cannot find any mention of them in the Bill.  Is there an intention to address this matter?In recent weeks something we have taken as a given, the relationship and trust between a lending institution and a solicitor, has broken down.  For many years undertakings given by a solicitor have been accepted wholeheartedly by lending institutions.  We have all gone through that process when purchasing the family home or other properties but that trust has now broken down, which is sad.  It may involve just a few individuals who are wrong.  They have been mentioned in the press, but I will not name them here.  Does the Minister have any proposals to restore the trust that has been broken?  Can we get back to a situation where the financial institutions can depend on undertakings given or is legislation also needed in this area?  It is sad that people who hold such a high position and work on our behalf in the courts and elsewhere would, through abuse, interfere with that trust.  I fail to understand how they were offered overdraft facilities on clients' accounts but such things have been allowed to happen.

As legislators, we must address the issue.  If not resolved, the matter could slow down the process of purchase, denying people the opportunity to deal in the way in which they have dealt in the past, whereby their solicitor would give an undertaking to the financial institution concerned to allow the process to go ahead.  Money was always drawn down on that basis, but that trust has broken down, which is unfortunate.We are tidying up hundreds of pieces of legislation dealing with land registration and ownership, including various titles from the days of landlord and tenant.  While I may identify more with rural rather than urban Ireland, I do not mean to do so because there are even more complicated issues in urban settings which will require considerable teasing out.  The legislation introduced by the Minister is to be welcomed.  In many ways it is overdue.  It shows that we will now be in a position as a modern nation not to feel, as was the case, that many of our ownership arrangements indicated subservience to the Crown.  That is not the case today, although it may be regarding some urban properties.  I hope the legislation will be passed.  I understand there is, rightly, broad agreement among the parties in the House.  I also hope when the legislation is enacted the necessary support will be provided to implement its provisions.  This will be a costly exercise and the staff of the Land Registry will face a significant workload as a result.  They should have the necessary back-up to implement the new changes and to ensure the legislation is in place to upgrade existing arrangements and to facilitate those who seek new titles for properties they purchase.  I commend the legislation to the House and I thank the Chair for the opportunity to contribute.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	270	In general, I am supportive of the modernisation of legislation and, hopefully, this Bill will be helpful and modernising.  Unfortunately, since I became a Member, I have frequently heard mention of modernisation of legislation or "promoting the simplification of the law and its language to make it more easily understood and accessible".  If I have heard that statement once, I have heard it 100,000 times but I have never witnessed its manifestation.  Any Member who has studied a legal document in recent times, notwithstanding the modernisation and simplification that has taken place, will know it is something to behold.  I hope the legislation has more depth to it than previous Bills that purported to address this important issue.Deputy Finneran raised a number of important issues.  When modernising legislation, it should be improved.  We should not create more pitfalls and obstacles and we should not make it easier for those who abuse systems to practise their craft in an uncontrolled and unsupervised way.  The Bill is intended to update the law so that it is in accord with the changes in society, which is positive.  It should address all changes in society.  For example, all Members have dealt with cases involving a search going back 100 years to unravel somebody's will to ascertain whether it had been discharged or when it had been discharged and who should benefit now if it has not been discharged.  I am not a legal practitioner but, notwithstanding the proposal to modernise the legislation, on countless occasions I have had to help unfortunate constituents unravel legal documents.I hope the Bill will prevent multiple registrations of the same property.  This has become alarmingly common in recent times and two or three people could have title to the same land and have a house built on it.  Will it be possible under the legislation to ensure certification of clean titles, which do not have encumbrances?  I do not know whether that will be achieved.Many of us have served on local authorities.  A number of local authorities in respect of planning permission in rural areas used to apply a condition whereby sterilisation of the property with the Land Registry was a burden on the title.  It was an interesting practice, which should have carried the authorisation of the local authority since only local authority members have the power to do this.  However, numerous such burdens were placed on properties without the authorisation of local authority members and, as a result, they are illegal and do not carry any weight.  Direction was given to local authorities that this practice should cease.  As the Minister of State will recall, Kildare County Council pursued that practice for a number of years without the authorisation of members.  The interpretation of planning by an administrator has no relevance in this instance.The Bill proposes to promote simplification of the conveyancing process, especially the procedures involved and the taking of security over land.  I do not know whether the simplification of the procedures will be of major benefit but the simplification of the language could be of colossal benefit.  Hopefully, that will be the case if the proposal is put into practice.  Invariably, with the best will in the world, people say the rules will change to ensure a totally smooth and level playing pitch by simplifying the language but the first and second letter issued afterwards includes language that must be read four or five times to be understood.  It could well be that people are not well versed enough in these matters but to protect the public, it is important that such language is comprehensible at all times by those of reasonable intelligence and competence and not only a chosen few.The registration of commonages should also be evaluated under this legislation.  Interesting practices were pursued in the past in this area.  The theory is that a person who has an interest in common with others in a property cannot have it taken from them without their authorisation or co-operation.  That is not true, as people have found out on a number of occasions when others who wanted to acquire the land decided to secure the support and goodwill of a majority of those who were deemed to be tenants in common and were able to acquire full title and ownership of the property, with obvious beneficial consequences for themselves.  I hope the legislation will address such scenarios to ensure tenants in common are not disinherited by virtue of the speed and slickness of others in these circumstances.The number of properties held by or transferred to people who have acquired their wealth through various dubious means is another issue.  In other words, they use property to launder money.  If a person or an entity wishes to purchase a property for which a loan is required from a financial institution, the presumption is a thorough examination of the title will ensue and it will be certified in the normal way to ensure it is clean.  However, if the purchaser has sufficient resources to acquire the property without a loan, the issue of registration of title falls by the wayside.  I have come across this practice in a number of cases.  If this issue is not addressed by the legislation, it should be because there has never been a greater need in the history of the State to deal with the issue of purchasing property to launder money.  Never in the history of the State has there been more need to deal up-front with that whole question of money laundering, and the purchase of property as houses, lands etc, in order to hide funds the source of which could not be publicly disclosed.  Such an initiative would dramatically ease the difficulties the Garda may have as regards some properties that are put on the market from time to time.  An alternative would be to have a requirement as regards all property transactions stipulating that the usage must be in line with the current planning permission.  As regards conveyancing, I am sure our legal friends would not be too enthusiastic about embarking on such a course.  However, a property might come on the market and be purchased by a person or group who do not need to get a loan.  They may buy the property regardless of whether there is planning permission or if its usage had been established by virtue of what went on in it over a number of years.  Five, ten, or 20 years later the property could be sold to somebody else who may well have to show whether permission exists for the use to which it is being put at that time.  In the event, the property's usage must be regularised.  Whatever use it had for money laundering purposes, for example, will have been washed away and things can proceed with impunity on a level playing pitch.  This is an area that bears careful scrutiny.  It would be foolish to allow a Bill to pass without checking that area to make absolutely certain that nobody can transfer a property that does not have a clean bill of planning health to be conveyed through the system.  The only people who can buy a property without such a clean bill of planning health are those with resources they want to hide, because if one has to get a loan or mortgage there must be certification of title.The previous speaker, Deputy Michael Finneran, made reference to the right to roam, which has become very popular in recent times.  Nobody has any problem with the right to roam.  The only reservation in this regard is to appreciate that if a person has the right to roam over another's property, then he or she has the right to reciprocate.  That is where the fun arises and it should be applicable to all.  In other words nowhere can a property exist that is absolutely excluded from such a right.  Otherwise it is only done by agreement.  If it is by agreement, there is no problem, but it should not be done on any other basis.  Many landowners believe it should be on foot of a charge, but I am not so sure, because with that goes responsibility, liability and the potential for insurance claims and claims where there is no insurance.  For those who argue there must always be insurance, sadly, that does not always apply.  We have all dealt with cases where there are people who were deemed to be insured, or who had gone through the motions for such purposes, but who were not insured.  We could all write books about that.  If we need any inspiration in that regard we need just look at our records to find ample examples.Another aspect of the Bill is the definition of property.  It makes clear that land includes both the air space above and the substratum below the surface and layers of these, however the division is made.  There is going to be great fun if we believe this is a simplification of conveyancing of land or property.  We can imagine what it will be like in terms of air space above and the sub-stratum below.  By the time our good friends in the legal profession have argued over all the possibilities and the potential in each of those areas, there will be great fun and entertainment for all.  Those who will not be entertained will pay a price.  I am somewhat worried over the description and how it is settled in the proposed legislation because I am not sure we fully appreciate the degree and extent to which variations are likely to occur in the future.  I can assure the House there will be many.  Perhaps the Minister of State might note that, as well as the previous issue I referred to as regards money laundering.  If the proposed legislation is not sufficiently strong in that regard, this is the time to deal with it and it should be done as a matter or urgency.The Bill retains the concept of an estate in land, which is part of the feudal system.  I welcome the proposal to abolish the feudal system, although I thought it had been abolished for years.  I am delighted to be reminded, in the context of this proposal, that the feudal system is about to be abolished again.  Various politicians indicated many years ago that it was abolished and had set about achieving this in various ways.I am particularly worried about e-registration.  I know information technology has become very popular.  It is the way forward and has enormous potential in terms of speeding access to information, records etc.  It is of great benefit to the country, the economy and individuals.  However, as we know from recent reports as regards other areas where the law is being blatantly broken through abuse of IT, and where international communications has leant itself to criminality, I hope there is sufficient provision in the legislation to ensure that those who want to hack into, adjust, amend or interfere in any way with somebody else's property registration, rights and entitlements will be prevented from so doing.  I do not know whether that is possible.  We use technology to access bank accounts, tax and social welfare affairs and a whole range of areas specific to each person.  With the growth in technology, however, so-called computer hackers appear to be able to get information which was not intended for them and to access data regardless of pin numbers or anything else.  This is not a good thing, so the Minister should bear in mind the security of the system and the need to ensure that in any proliferation of e-registration or e-conveyancing, there is ample protection for the individual.  If there is not, we are likely to witness unprecedented growth in crime, whereby the unscrupulous might decide to acquire for themselves the substratum below or airspace above a property or properties.  This could lead to complications and have serious implications for the rights of individuals to the properties concerned.The Bill is substantial.  Unusually, its explanatory memorandum is voluminous also, which makes me uneasy.  In that regard I hope the debate so far has been of help to the Parliamentary Counsel.  I hope the Bill will lead to improvement and make a positive difference.  I hope it will not create obstacles and problems that are worse than those already encountered.
#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	271	I thank Deputies for their contributions and broad support for the reform proposals set out in the Bill.  While it undoubtedly contains many technical proposals and measures, its aim is to update our land and conveyancing laws to meet the changed needs of the 21st century.  The Government recognises the need for an up-to-date and streamlined conveyancing code that will reduce the time taken to buy and sell property and improve economic efficiency.  In short, an up-to-date code is needed to protect consumers and facilitate economic activity in a vibrant market economy.Many of the points raised in Deputies' contributions were of a detailed nature and are, therefore, more appropriate for discussion on Committee Stage.  I would, however, like to respond on some of the more general policy issues raised during the debate.Deputy Rabbitte asked whether there were plans to modernise the landlord and tenant code.  In that regard I am happy to state work on such a project is already well under way in the Law Reform Commission.  I look forward to the conclusion of that project and proposals for updating the law in this important area.A number of Deputies referred to issues relating to the registration of title and the relative lack of progress made in recent years in extending compulsory registration of land.  While I agree that perhaps more could and should have been done, the current position is that the specific function of promoting and extending registration of ownership of land has been given to the Property Registration Authority.  It would perhaps be helpful to Deputies if I put this in an historical context.  The first attempt to introduce registration of title in Ireland was made in the Record of Title (Ireland) Act 1865 but its scope was limited to land sales sanctioned by the Landed Estates Court under the Landed Estates Court (Ireland) Act 1858.  This Act marked an attempt to free up large estates burdened with family settlements by permitting the sale of the land and using the proceeds to discharge the debts.  In this way, purchasers were able to acquire clear title to the land in question.  The Act also made provision for registering such titles but did not establish a dedicated land registry.  As a result, little use was made of the registration option.

#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	282	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this very important Bill which deals with land registration and conveyancing.  We have some reservations about the Bill and the manner in which it deals with complex and important areas of law.  The law in this area has long been in need of reform.  Solicitors deal with complex and confusing matters in standard land registration and conveyancing every day such as loopholes in current law.  I am very glad the House is making an attempt to bring existing legislation up to date to reflect modern social circumstances which no longer require land law based on a feudal system.  This is one of the matters that causes Deputies great frustration as they deal regularly with constituents' cases pertaining to the Land Registry and the registration of titles.  Constituents who visit our offices or clinics are very frustrated about deals being held up and I hope the Bill will go some way towards helping them.  The staff in the Property Registration Authority have in recent years been very helpful in dealing with clients when presented with the relevant reference numbers.  The staff in the Waterford office have been particularly responsive to our individual representations.My first point relates to the Government's stated aim of introducing a comprehensive system of electronic conveyancing, namely, e-conveyancing.  Approximately 85% of land in the State, including almost all farmland, is registered with the Property Registration Authority.  This is a sound foundation on which to complete the process of registering titles.  The Minister wishes to make this compulsory and the Fine Gael Party supports him entirely.Registration of land enables solicitors and prospective buyers, not to mention current land purchasers, to know more about the property to be purchased and will solve problems regarding boundaries, fences and rights of way.  Arguments over rights of way have caused great division in many parishes and among many people and families.  I hope the Bill will help in this regard.  Divisions over rights of way lead to additional work, expenses and delays for all parties and the Bill represents a huge step forward in that regard.The compulsory purchase of land titles applies in only six counties, namely, Carlow, Laois and Meath since 1970, and Longford, Roscommon and Westmeath since 2006.  Fine Gael stresses that this process is vital to the legal profession and the economy.  We will push strongly for sufficient funding and expertise in order that the registration process can be extended to the rest of the country.  It is important to remember that in difficult times it will certainly be worth having the type of registration system we can look forward to on foot of e-conveyancing.  Our only concern about moving to this system relates to the security of records.  We all remember the public confusion and fear over electronic voting.  In some Departments there could be breaches of a criminal nature, about which I am worried.  The Minister certainly needs to address this issue.The Minister emphasised recently the importance to economic growth of an efficient system of title registration and property transfer, one of the essential factors in the development of prosperous modern economies. The Chambers of Commerce of Ireland recently made this point.  They reckon that straightforward and easy planning, conveyancing and land registration are key to future economic growth.  This alone is a very strong argument for ensuring we are able to process matters relating to these three areas.  I know this is not in the Bill but I make the point that the processes of planning, conveyancing and land registration must be speeded up so that ordinary businesses can develop and expand and that people coming into this country are not held up.  People who are prepared to put their neck on the line in respect of investments or whatever they wish to do to boost this economy should not be held up in these three areas.  As the economy faces into possibly a more difficult period, it is very important that we streamline all those areas.  The Bill certainly goes some way towards doing this.  We need to put this in place in respect of the other areas I have mentioned, particularly planning.  It is in the country's interest and that of the people who have the nerve to stand up and say they will spend their money.  These people need the proper procedures and planning and I hope this Bill will help in respect of this.While we accept the Bill does not set out to codify all our land and conveyancing laws in statutory form, they are related concerns.  This attempt would mean distilling and converting all relevant judicial or legislative principles into common legislative code.  Apart from the efforts involved, such a project would have taken a considerable number of years.  Such a codification would inevitably increase the rigidity of the law and remove the flexibility and adaptability which is such a positive feature of our system.This would take a number of years to complete and would be a marathon endeavour.  However, it would also have its merits as recent cases have made Irish people more wary of land purchase.  This is terrible for solicitors and clients alike.  Since the Bill we are discussing is not an entire revamp, I emphasise that it needs to ensure that Irish land purchasers' rights are looked after and that regulation of the industry is critical.Almost everybody discussing this Bill has mentioned how complex and confusing language is in this area of law.  The onus is on the Government to produce a document for those wishing to purchase land so they can adequately understand the issues they come up against.  This would further enable consumers to know their rights and recognise what anomalies arise when dealing with land law.  I would welcome such a document as many people in my constituency are often confused and concerned about questioning their solicitor at a time when they make purchases or inherit.  They are going through a big change in their lives and I find that many people have real difficulty with the language involved.  I encourage the Government to use this legislation as an opportunity to educate the public in this regard now that many outdated items are moving from the law.In respect of the right to roam, which was dealt with by many people earlier, as a person with much respect for the country way of life, I wonder about charging for access to land.  The most important thing that people who are allowed to roam our countryside must do is to respect the land or property they are walking over.  This is very important from the point of view of the goodwill of the people who own the land because there is huge potential for tourism, the development of walkways, what people would like to do in their spare time and the natural beauty of our country being used for everyone's benefit.  However, the most important thing is to respect property.

He stated:it is difficult in practice to draw a clear distinction between land law and conveyancing law.  Therefore, it makes sense to deal with these separate but connected areas of law in one set of proposals.As previous speakers have said, this is a very complex area of law.  We are still very much influenced by laws going back to Norman times.  Certainly, it is at times very formidable for the ordinary individual who sometimes cannot come to terms with it.  This is why it is so important that the law be simplified and made much clearer.  This is part of the general objective of this Bill which, hopefully, will be achieved.I know people are using the Bill to speak about related subjects.  Most speakers spoke about the right to roam, about which there is considerable confusion, and what is happening at the moment is not helping matters.  I know the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs set up a forum.  Despite recent comments that progress was made, I do not believe this is so.  As someone who likes walking along mountains in particular and the seashore, I know that on most occasions when one goes walking, one sees the obstacles.  National pronouncements are not reflected on the ground.I understand fully why people would be very wary of allowing people on to their property.  On the other hand, there are people who will see an advantage in leading people on to their property.  The mention of money got people thinking about closing traditional walkways because they may get some compensation for it.  Whatever it takes, it should be rectified as soon as possible.Mention was made of the amount of land that is properly registered in this country.  I suggest introducing a national programme involving the proper registration of all land in this country because older people possess land who are not just concerned about the registration of title.  It leads to major confusion among families or where land is being passed on.  There is also the question of land such as commonage that seems impossible to register and divide even among communities which are prepared to co-operate and divide up commonage for community use.  It seems to be impossible to do this because of the complexity of existing law.  I hope this Bill will, in some way, address that issue.   I am familiar with a number of commonages where no one objects to the division but as those with rights to the land cannot be found, it cannot be subdivided among local communities.  That is a major issue which is creating problems and should be addressed.Ownership of fishing rights in rivers should also be addressed.  Efforts were made to address the issue when fishing clubs were set up.  Major disputes between local people, angling clubs and those who claim rights to rivers lead to confusion.The Bill provides for future interests in land.  Members come across cases where land is earmarked for a person on reaching a certain age.  Cases become very complicated.  I hope the rules that led to this situation will be changed in the Bill.  Future interests for very young people can be protected by trustees when appointed but this was not the case in the past.  Trusts relating to land are becoming more popular.  The provision in the Bill governing their establishment to pass on land is very important.Another development concerns land held in partnership and co-ownership.  The European Union is encouraging partnership in farming.  I can see cases that will arise where farmers will work in partnership and those who acquire partnership rights will seek partnership arrangements to hold property in common.  I hope Part VI of the Bill which seeks to modernise and simplify the law relating to co-ownership of land where groups of individuals own property will bring clarity to the law and avoid the current problems in court.  There is a total lack of clarity and it is up to a judge to decide what the law is.  The Bill will provide more guarantees and stability for co-owners.  Contracts relating to land is an important subject.  E-conveyancing makes this very important.  In the future contracts will have to be very clear and properly registered.Ownership of land reaches to the soul of Irish people and the heart of how we deal with matters.  Most agitation centre on land.  This reform is a significant departure but there is some way to go.  The area should be continually reviewed.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	284	With the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who has legal expertise present, I will not address legal issues.  This has been done by Deputy Flanagan and others.  I will instead refer to difficult issues with which politicians and the public must deal.I welcome the update of the law, in accordance with modern society, for which the Bill provides.  I hope it will promote simplification because complication is one of the issues that can arise in the conveyancing of land.  We need the process and language to be simpler.  Recently a young lady sought to have land for a site transferred from her father.  She had to comply with various regulations and deal with problems over a six month period in order that she could acquire title to obtain a loan for her house.  That should not happen nowadays, the process should be simpler.  The land was in the ownership of the family for a long period.  The Bill should simplify matters.Regarding the transfer of land, there are historic landlord and tenant deals, free land and other legal jargon terms.  Some ten years ago a man sought to build on the family farm.  The neighbour's son had built on the land without a problem.  In those days the bank would accept lodgement of deeds.  When the man in question sought to obtain a mortgage, the title was not correct.  In the end, the solicitor had to find 19 people across the island of Ireland, England, Scotland and Wales before the man in question could acquire the title.  This caused major complications.  How can one particular farmer use the land for 12 years, pay no rent and then take it over because of the time he spent on it?  On the other hand, land in the hands of one family for years can lead to this difficulty.  I hope the Bill deals with the serious difficulties encountered in the past.I refer to the rights of tenants.  In Carrickmacross tenants are under severe pressure.  Legal actions have been taken but nothing has been solved.  Other speakers have referred to the right to roam, an issue which must be dealt with in an amicable manner.  Discussions relating to this matter have been taking place between farming organisations and the Government for some time.  Farmers must be careful, particularly in this era of the compensation culture.  If a person slips or has an accident on a farmer's land, the latter might experience a great deal of trouble as a result.  Most people involved in farming have full insurance.  However, the position in this regard must be made quite clear and all difficulties relating to it resolved.While it is important to ensure that tourism is allowed to thrive and that people are encouraged to give others the freedom to walk over their land to access special scenic areas, the rights of landowners, property owners, farmers etc., must be taken into consideration and upheld.  Where necessary and justified, some level of compensation should be paid.There is also the issue of extra rights.  Some time ago I raised a particular matter and requested that solicitors be notified and informed in respect of it, particularly in light of the problems that can arise.  I refer to situations where someone may have made his or her will in the late 1990s when single farm premia did not exist.  Another person who comes into possession of that individual's land may be of the view that the right to the single farm premium transferred to him or her with the land and that he or she is entitled to it.  I understand that the latter is not the case if there are other relatives alive who may have a claim to pursue.  The position in this regard must be made clear to solicitors and to people in general in order that there will not be a great deal of fighting and rows among the members of a family following a person's death.Single farm premia form a large part of farm incomes and this is a major issue.  I recently came across a case in which a farm was sold, as were the rights to the premium.  It was advertised and agreed by everyone that the rights were of a certain value.  However, when the farmer tried to transfer the rights he discovered a number of technicalities that had not been clarified by the solicitors, auctioneers or anyone else.  The case to which I refer is quite complex and I do not wish to make any more comments in respect of it because there is a possibility that it may be taken further.  However, solicitors must be informed about the new issues that must be dealt with in this area.A number of years ago, the use of bogland or commonage was not really an issue.  Now, however, given that money is allocated towards overall acreage via REPS and other schemes, such land has become extremely valuable and is giving rise to difficulties.Clarification must be provided in respect of problems relating to partnerships.  There is no doubt that partnerships between fathers and sons, between neighbours etc., can give rise to difficulties, particularly if they are not well dealt with by solicitors.  In my view, many solicitors do not fully understand what is involved.  For example, a leasee can cause problems if he or she so wishes.  If a farmer leases land to his son and takes the EU farm retirement grant, under existing laws he subsequently cannot give the land to his son unless the latter pays an enormous amount of stamp duty.  This comes about because in legal terms the owner of the land, having taken the farm retirement grant, is no longer a farmer.  I would like to see technicalities of this nature changed.In the past, solicitors were among the most trusted people in the country.  What has happened in recent weeks regarding dodgy transfers — I do not wish to say too much before further legal action may be pursued in this area — has damaged the trust that exists between solicitors and their clients.  It is important that these matters be dealt with in the strongest possible way.  If there is a need to introduce legislation, then so be it.  If legislation is not required, we must ensure that the individuals involved are dealt with because the trust to which I refer must continue to exist.  If, for example, a person has a need to seek an immediate loan, the position vis-à-vis his or her solicitor’s guarantee to the bank that the legal situation will be resolved in the future must be clarified.  If that does not happen, there will be major delays in many areas, including the construction of private homes.In the past solicitors provided undertakings or guarantees to lending institutions that when all matters relating to titles were resolved, they would, as promised, be presented with clear deeds.  Recent events have undermined that clear understanding and could damage some young people's future prospects.  I hope the position in this regard can be resolved.  Regardless of whether it is in politics or the legal profession, one or two bad eggs can spoil matters for everyone.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	285	I thank Deputies for their contributions and for their broad support for the reform proposals set out in the Bill.  While it undoubtedly contains many technical proposals and measures, the aim of the Bill is to update our land and conveyancing laws in order to meet the changed needs of the 21st century.  The Government recognises the need for an up-to-date and streamlined conveyancing code that will reduce the time taken to buy and sell property and improve economic efficiency.  In short, an up-to-date code is needed to protect consumers and facilitate economic activity in a vibrant market economy.Many of the points made by Deputies were detailed in nature and may be discussed on Committee Stage.  However, I wish to reply to some of the more general issues raised.Deputy Rabbitte asked whether there are plans to modernise the landlord and tenant code.  I am happy to say that work on such a project is already well under way within the Law Reform Commission.  I look forward to the conclusion of that project and to proposals for updating the law in this important area.Deputies Flanagan and Rabbitte referred to issues relating to registration of title and the relative lack of progress in recent years in extending compulsory registration of land.  While I agree that perhaps more could and should have been done, the position is that the specific function of promoting and extending registration of ownership of land has been given to the Property Registration Authority.  I discussed the matter with the chairman of the authority and it is important to progress the compulsory registration of land.Towards the end of the 19th century, various land purchase acts, with which many of us are familiar, were enacted.  These provided loans for tenant farmers to purchase their holdings from landlords, subject to annual repayments in the form of land purchase annuities.  As these schemes involved public funds, it was considered that title to the lands should be secured by means of registration.  As a result, the Local Registration of Title (Ireland) Act 1891 made provision for establishment of the Land Registry and provided that the registration of title was compulsory in all cases where land was purchased under the land purchase schemes.  All of this land has remained within the registration of title system and approximately 85% of land in the State, including almost all farmland, is registered with the Land Registry.The Registration of Title Act 1964 repealed the 1891 Act and made provision for the gradual extension of compulsory registration to complete the land register.  Compulsory registration was introduced in counties Carlow, Laois and Meath in 1970.  Last year, counties Longford, Westmeath and Roscommon were added to the list.  Since most of the farmland in these counties was already registered, the main impact has been on transactions involving urban land.While urban land outside compulsory areas may be registered under existing provisions on a voluntary basis, much of it remains unregistered because of the time and effort which may be required to register it and because of the problems which may arise in sorting out complex "pyramid" titles.  It is difficult to say how many of these unregistered titles remain and it could be as many as 350,000.  In the case of these titles, the transactions must be registered at the registry of deeds.  However, the underlying root of title must be evidenced by a sequence of transactions in respect of the land.  A major challenge for the Property Registration Authority is to devise a strategy to promote and extend the registration of urban land throughout the country.  I understand the authority is in discussions with the Law Society with a view to drawing up its future strategy for extending title registration as required by the legislation under which it was established.Deputies Rabbitte and Terence Flanagan queried the present position regarding adverse possession of land.  I will respond in light of the recent judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in Pye v. UK.  The statutory position is that applications for title based on adverse possession are made to the Property Registration Authority under section 49 of the Registration of Title Act 1964.  In such cases, the applicant claims that the rights of the registered owner have been extinguished under the Statute of Limitations and that the applicant is now entitled to be registered as owner.  For obvious reasons, the authority considers all applications for registration based on adverse possession with particular care and attention.Some applications are withdrawn on receipt of correspondence from the authority outlining the legal conditions necessary to acquire title by means of adverse possession.  Where it appears to the authority that an application does not meet the stringent requirements of section 49, the application will be refused.  It is open to any party to appeal a decision to the courts but in practice such appeals are rare.The recent judgment of the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights reversed an earlier ruling which held a system which provided for adverse possession of land without any possibility of financial compensation infringed property rights safeguarded under the European Convention on Human Rights.  My Department is still examining the full implications of the judgment.I understand the Law Reform Commission intends to examine issues surrounding adverse possession in its next law reform programme and I welcome this development.  I am sure the commission's future work will provide a sound foundation on which to base future reforms in this area.  The threat emerging from the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights that our system of adverse possession was contrary to our international obligations has receded.Deputy Rabbitte raised the important issue of recreational use of land and the rights to access to land for that purpose.  Deputy Crawford also touched on this matter when he mentioned the right to roam.  The matter is being handled by my colleague, the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, and I have no wish to roam into his areas of responsibility.With regard to solicitors' undertakings in respect of mortgage lending I want to stress that I cannot comment on individual cases, particularly as the issues raised are linked to matters which are before the courts at present.  I am glad Deputy Crawford raised this issue in his contribution because it is of great public concern.The process whereby a purchaser's solicitor may act for both the purchaser and a lending institution was agreed between the legal profession and the banking sector and has been in operation for approximately 20 years.  The process is designed to benefit those transacting residential conveyancing in that it permits the purchaser's solicitor to act on behalf of the lending institution.  This has reduced costs to the benefit of consumers and reduced the length of time taken to complete the conveyance.  It was never intended that the process would be used for commercial purposes nor was it intended that the process should be used where the applicant was the lodging solicitor.As part of the process, in so far as it applies, the purchaser's solicitor will usually give an undertaking to a financial institution to the effect that he or she will ensure that the purchaser has a good marketable title to the property, that the documents are executed and that all the title deeds are stamped, registered and lodged with the relevant institution.  In addition, pending lodgement of the title deeds with the bank or building society, generally the solicitor will undertake to hold the deeds in trust for the lending institution.  In this context, it is important to note that where a solicitor fails to honour an undertaking given, it is considered to be professional misconduct and as a result the solicitor is rendered liable to the Law Society's disciplinary procedures and to investigation by the solicitors' disciplinary tribunal.  Depending on the particular circumstances of a case the criminal law may also apply.Mortgage lending is primarily a matter for the financial institutions involved and Deputies will appreciate that I have no function in the system of banking and making loans available to clients.  The Financial Regulator is responsible for the prudential supervision of Irish-licensed financial institutions and is independent in matters of day-to-day supervision.  The regulator has consistently conveyed to lending institutions that mortgage lending policies and practices should be prudent and responsible.  I have indicated to the House that it is in everybody's interest that the best practices which clearly exist in the area of solicitors' undertakings are followed.  I also stated that in so far as any matters are to be reviewed or issues to be addressed by the Government, Deputies can be assured that the responsible Ministers will do so.The matter of multi-unit developments were raised by several Deputies and they are a major issue of property law in the public mind.  Together with auctioneers and estate agents, property management agents will be covered by the licensing system to be operated by the national property services regulatory authority.  Deputy Terence Flanagan raised the matter of the timescale for the legislation establishing the authority.  It is being drafted in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.Property management companies, which are the owners of units within multi-unit developments, are regulated under company law and are subject to its enforcement mechanisms, including the Companies Registration Office and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.  In recognition of the complex nature of the difficulties arising in regard to the structure and governance of these companies, and the cross-cutting nature of many of them, the Government has established a high-level interdepartmental committee to assist in the development of a coherent and comprehensive legislative response.The key task facing the committee is to identify the legislative and administrative actions to be taken on receipt of the Law Reform Commission's definitive recommendations for legislative reforms in its forthcoming report on multi-unit developments.  The commission will publish the report later this year following completion of a consultation process.Deputy Durkan raised the matter of property held in common.  Section 28 of this Bill will prohibit the unilateral severance of a joint tenancy without the written consent of the other joint tenants.  This should help deal with the problem described by Deputy Durkan.  He also raised the question of airspace and its connection with property law.  The inclusion of airspace in the definition of property reflects the existing law on this issue as determined by the courts.

#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	292	The issue before us does not only affect the 50,000 undocumented Irish in the United States or impact on the families and friends we met earlier who are clearly so worried about the plight of their loved ones.  It is an issue that affects us all because it is our responsibility not to turn our backs on the people who were forced to leave this country during a darker time in our economic history.The situation facing undocumented Irish in the US has become more precarious since 11 September 2001.  Many Irish people are unable to obtain driving licences or even travel to Ireland at the most upsetting of times, such as when they need to attend a family funeral.  However, the situation is now reaching a crisis point.  There are reports of Irish people being targeted, arrested and deported and the matter is growing ever more grave.  In recent weeks, six undocumented Irish people, one woman and five men, were arrested.  One of those arrested had been in the United States for 12 years and, like many others, had built a life there before seeing it swept from under his feet in a matter of days.  Another individual was forced to return to Ireland and was barred from re-entering the United States.  As a result, he was unable to bring home the remains of a brother who had died in the US.  The Irish community is living in greater fear than ever and is near desperation point, yet the Government demonstrates little or no understanding of their situation.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs has dropped the ball on this issue.  It is not good enough that Irish people anywhere should be allowed to live in such conditions.  There is little hope that any of those people will receive working visas at any point in the future.In 2006, Irish people received a mere 54 lottery visas out of a global total of 50,000 and only 1,906 green cards.  There is little option for these people other than a new agreement which will help them out of this predicament.  I do not need to stress the urgency of this issue.  The window of opportunity for these people is closing rapidly and will soon be firmly shut.  The US Government's momentum is faltering and the issue is unlikely to be progressed by the current administration.  If we wait until after the forthcoming presidential election it will be too late.  The topic of immigration reform is so charged in the United States that it is regarded as a third rate issue which nobody will touch for fear of political electrocution.  Senior US Senators are willing to progress it but their hands are tied unless the Irish Government steps up to campaign for these people.  It is almost certain that under the next administration there will be no movement on the immigration issue, so we have to act while limited time is still available to solve the crisis facing Irish people in the US.There is no doubt that the Irish-American connection has always been strong, both culturally and economically.  At this time of economic growth in Ireland, well-educated and highly skilled Americans are expressing a growing interest in working in Ireland.  When the former Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Killeen, visited a FÁS exhibition in New York last October, he noted huge interest in Americans wishing to travel to Ireland to work and a queue outside the exhibition venue which stretched more than two and a half blocks.  He stated there was clear evidence to support the establishment of some sort of bilateral agreement between the US and Irish Governments.  In addition, the Aisling Irish Community Centre in New York has indicated they are dealing with increasing numbers of Irish people.  This kind of labour activity in Ireland and the United States is proof that a bilateral agreement providing for a renewable visa system is the way to capture the interest in the Irish economy and solve the problem Irish emigrants face in America.The opportunity now presents itself of harnessing the goodwill that has been developed during the peace process to secure a bilateral agreement between Ireland and the United States.  Precedence has been set for this kind of agreement by Australia's arrangement which allows 10,000 Australians to work in the US on a special E-3 visa, while Americans are given the same number of visas in return.  This two-year visa can be renewed indefinitely, allows immigrants to bring spouses and children to the US and permits spouses to work legally.  A similar agreement could be developed for Irish workers, including an amnesty clause to allow undocumented Irish to gain access to the visa programme.  It has been suggested that by arguing that many of the undocumented in the US were victims of high unemployment caused by the Troubles, the Government could make a unique case for a new visa regime.  The upcoming economic conference in Belfast sponsored by the Americans is the perfect opportunity to launch such an agreement and would provide a forum for officially recognising the American contribution to peace on the island of Ireland while marking the tenth anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement.Last April, the Minister indicated his intention to do all in his power to help these people.  He stated that since becoming Minister for Foreign Affairs, he made the search for a resolution to the situation facing the undocumented a key priority for his Department, that the nation cannot turn its back on the undocumented Irish living in a twilight world in the United States and that we must do all we can to reunite these families.  When he visited Washington last month, he again indicated his interest in reaching a reciprocal agreement with the United States that would be linked to the political settlement in the North.  Has this been political rhetoric designed to impress while he was on tour in Washington or is he genuinely committed to resolving this issue?  What communications has he had with US representatives in past weeks regarding this issue and what exactly has been done to find a resolution?I am not speaking for the people in this country but for the undocumented in the United States, some of whom I met last week.  It was not the first time I visited the USA.  On many occasions, my colleagues, Deputies McGinley, Coveney, Connaughton and I have travelled there at our own cost to lobby for these people.  I am saying to the Minister, the Taoiseach and the Government backbenchers that we owe it to Irish citizens to reach an agreement.  America preaches that it will look after its people wherever in the world they may be.  We have to look after the Irish people who find themselves in this situation.  The taxpayer will not mind if the Taoiseach, the Minister and, perhaps, the Leader of the Opposition and other of our colleagues use the Government jet to travel to America to lobby Irish-American politicians.  They want to support us but political will is needed to reach out to them.  I urge the Taoiseach to personally visit the USA before the weekend to reach a deal for our Irish illegals.  That is not an impossible task because Ted Kennedy and other US Senators are prepared to support the Irish families who are affected by this issue.I do not want to see another situation like the one involving a woman in my constituency who, five years ago, came to my clinic in Ballinrobe, and that is when I got involved in this issue.  Until the day I die I will never forget what she said to me.  At that time I did not know much about undocumented Irish people in America.  She said:Michael, I have gone to America for the last five years.  My son is there.  He is married and has two children.  I go to see them whenever I can.  Last week I got bad news.  I have cancer.  I know that my son, his wife and my grandchildren will not be able to come to my funeral in Ireland.I said:That is not right.  We have to do something for these people that are undocumented in America.  We have to put the pressure on the Irish Government.That woman died and her son could not come home for her funeral.  If he had come to his mother's funeral he faced the possibility of not being able to get back into the United States of America, to his wife and two children.  We must do something about that.  It is our duty as legislators to act.  I call on the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs to act.  I accept, because I am not one of those people who does not give credit where it is due, that the Government has made an effort, but what we want now is a bigger effort.  This is an all-Ireland problem and, if necessary, Mr. Paisley, Mr. McGuinness and the Tánaiste should lobby on behalf of our Irish citizens.  I call on them to go to the United States and do what has to be done.I have been contacted by people from all parts of the country.  We are coming into a very lonely time again — Christmas.  Many of these people in the United States will not be able to come home for Christmas, family weddings or funerals.  It is important that the Taoiseach and the Government are committed to going there to resolve this very serious problem.I thank Mr. Niall O'Dowd, Mr. Ciaran Staunton and others involved in the Irish immigration group on behalf of the Irish people.  I thank them on behalf of the undocumented in America because they are in the United States legally, running their own businesses and they could be doing other things.  Instead, they are committed to Ireland, to our citizens and to striking a deal.  People such as Mr. O'Dowd and Mr. Staunton have gone to a lot of trouble.Mr. Niall O'Dowd went to a very important committee meeting in the United States.  It is very difficult to get into a Senate meeting and be given time to speak.  The meeting was broadcast by American television.  RTE should have been there as well, covering the case that Mr. O'Dowd made on behalf of the undocumented Irish.  RTE has done a good job on this issue but it is important to keep up the momentum.  The broadcaster should send people to America to show the kind of situations in which our people are trapped.The Government has accepted the motion and I hope the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs will immediately head for Washington.  We must remember that Mr. Albert Reynolds did it when it was important for the peace process.  He picked up the telephone and rang President Clinton.  I urge the Taoiseach to pick up the telephone and ring President Bush.  American politicians are facing a presidential election and every single one of them will be telling us about their great Irish ancestors.  If they have great Irish ancestors, let them prove it.  Let us complete a bilateral agreement for our Irish citizens who are trapped in the United States of America.  Please God, between now and Christmas, a Bill will be rushed through Congress and something will be done for our undocumented Irish.  Something must be done.  I want something to be done.  I want the Irish Government to immediately head for Washington.

I compliment my colleague, Deputy Ring, on tabling the motion and welcome the Government's decision to support an agreed motion on this very important issue.  By adopting that stance, the Government will have the mandate of this House to go to America to negotiate on behalf of the 40,000 or 50,000 undocumented Irish men and women who are in the United States without status.By adopting this agreed motion, we are changing our approach to this problem.  For a significant number of years our approach has been to go to America and meet politicians from various parties.  As Deputy Ring said, in the summer of 2006, Deputies Ring, Coveney, Connaughton and I went to America.  At that time, all of the talk was about the McCain-Kennedy Bill.  That was a serious Bill, tabled by two senior politicians, one a Republican, the other a Democrat.  We had the pleasure and honour of meeting them in their offices, with other senior politicians.  We came home with great hopes that this was the solution to the problem of the undocumented Irish.  Unfortunately, the Bill ran into difficulties vis-à-vis American domestic politics.  Parties fell out, squabbles set in and the Irish were, once again, left sitting high and dry.This motion represents a new approach to the situation whereby we will adopt what is known as the Australian solution.  Australia, on a bilateral basis, has negotiated a deal whereby 10,000 Australians are entitled to enter the United States of America annually and the same number of Americans are entitled to enter Australia.I do not know of any other people who have contributed more to the making of America than the Irish.  For two centuries, our people have been going to the United States as a destination of opportunity.  They have grabbed the opportunities there and Irish people are now involved in every aspect of American life.  It is no wonder that more than 40 million Americans claim to have Irish ancestors.  The bonds between the two countries have developed over the centuries.  I do not know of any other European country in which the Americans have invested more than in Ireland.  There is probably more American investment and employment here than in any other European country.  I do not know of any other country whose representatives have regular access to the highest echelons of Government in the United States.  Those doors are open to us and we are seen by the United States as one of their foremost and dependable allies.  No matter what they do, they know they have our goodwill and that our facilities are at their disposal.This is a window of opportunity for us, to invoke the goodwill of America on behalf of the Irish people over there, many of whom we met last year.  I will not go into their individual stories.  Deputy Ring mentioned people who are not able to come home for family occasions, both joyous and sad.  These people are not a burden on the American economy.  Rather, America's gain is our loss.  Many have settled in America, established businesses, married, had families and have a stake in the American economy, but they are living in fear and danger.I suggest we emulate the Australians.  The Australian Prime Minister, Mr. Howard went to the United States, spent two days in Washington negotiating at President to Prime Minister level and succeeded in striking a deal.  That is what we must do.  I believe that the only person in this House to do it is the Taoiseach and he certainly has a mandate from this House this evening.  He always goes to Washington for St. Patrick's Day but I urge him to enter negotiations before then.  It should be done before the end of this year.  I implore the Minister of State to convey that message to the Taoiseach, to urge him to do as Deputy Ring has suggested and go to America with the sole mission of sorting out this running sore between our two countries that has been there for many years.  I have absolutely no doubt that will be done given the goodwill and co-operation between us.Many Irish parents are listening to this debate.  They will be reassured there is cross-party agreement on this motion instigated by Deputy Ring.  I very much welcome that because it will give them hope.  The US presidential election is coming up shortly and the focus will once again be on domestic politics.  If we do not grab this opportunity between now and the end of this month, or certainly the end of this year, we will lose it for many years to come until the political situation settles again.I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak.  The time is ripe for action.  We are changing tactics and are opting for a new method, namely, the Australian one.  If we go about it the right way and if we show the Americans we are serious about it at Taoiseach and President level, we will solve this long running problem.What better gift could Members of this House give these Irish people in America — our kith and kin — than a green card as a result of this motion and negotiations which will take place?  It would be a great Christmas present.  I can only imagine the number of people who would come home again to their parents and relations after five to 15 years in America and the welcome they would receive.  We can do something definite and positive and this motion is the instrument by which we can do so.  I implore the Minister of State to adopt this motion and for the Taoiseach to make it a priority between now and the end of the year.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	294	I very much welcome this motion and compliment Deputy Ring on tabling it.  I welcome it not only because it has been proposed by Fine Gael but because it proposes the basis for a much needed solution to the problem of the undocumented Irish in the US.  The undocumented Irish make a valuable contribution to the economic and social life of the United States.  They have chosen to make their life there yet within the US, their lifestyles are marked by a permanent state of anxiety.  They face significant hardship and their plight gets harder by the day.  They are seriously restricted in their options for working and earning a living.  They cannot return home to see their families, attend funerals or weddings or to visit their elderly parents or seriously ill family members.  That has a huge impact on a large number of people who cannot come home for important family occasions often following tragedy.I look forward to the day when the many undocumented Irish, having established some form of legal status in the US, have the legal right to live there, to work in any job of their choice and to travel freely to visit parents, family and friends.  I spoke to Mayor Bloomberg, New York's first citizen, when he visited Ireland.  He spoke very openly and was one of the first politicians to call for this situation to be resolved.  As Deputy Ring stated, there are 40 million members of the diaspora in the United States.  In the next 12 months, there will be a change of president and there is a possibility that Mayor Bloomberg could be a candidate in that race.  This will be an election issue.   This motion should be well received by the US authorities because of the opportunity it offers to young US citizens to visit and work in Ireland.The motion refers to an estimated 25,000 to 50,000 undocumented Irish people living and working in the US which is an appalling situation, the difficulties the undocumented face of which I know, the contribution Irish emigrants make to the US economy which is evident everywhere one goes, the strong economic ties between the island of Ireland and the United States and the growing level of social, political and economic co-operation on the island of Ireland following the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  It also refers to the existing bilateral agreement between Australia and the USA which allows 10,000 Australians to work in the US annually while US citizens are granted the same number of Australian visas in return.  These are critical points.Formal educational institutions are part of the process of developing capable and responsible citizens and thus building a successful country.  However, in an era of globalisation of trade in goods and services, students must also learn about other cultures and people.  The university of life is the best place to get this particular experience.  Living abroad will give US students a depth of personal experience that cannot be matched by reading, studying, e-mails or the Internet.  Typical overseas study programmes are too short and too organised for students to really learn about other countries, people, traditions and cultures.  For third level students, it is a time for freedom, openness and curiosity about other people and places and for embracing new experiences.Spending a year in Ireland, being thrust into the unfamiliar and living as the locals do will give them knowledge, experience and an understanding of people which will last them a lifetime.  By living and working independently, they will emerge with a much richer understanding and a more open-minded view of the world than anything taught in a classroom.Young US citizens living and working in Ireland would also have the opportunity to visit other parts of Europe thus expanding their horizons to a much wider range of countries and cultures.  Living and working abroad is not only about understanding a new culture, it is also about getting a new perspective on one's home country.  Seeing things from a distance gives an opportunity to appreciate all the good things at home.  The mix of ideas and experiences will help foster the imagination to see new opportunities and provide an inspiration for fresh ideas and creativity.  This is a win-win result for both our countries.The bilateral agreement proposed in this motion provides an important opportunity to enhance and strengthen ties of understanding and friendship between the US and Ireland.  I look forward to the conclusion of such an agreement at the earliest possible date.
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	295	I commend Deputy Ring on tabling this motion and, along with Deputy McGinley and others who travelled to the United States, for being so forthright in fighting for this cause.  I welcome the opportunity to speak on the plight of Irish emigrants living in the United States.  This is an issue about which I feel very strongly and about which many of my constituents are deeply concerned.  At present we have no way of knowing how many Irish emigrants live in the United States.  Many left when Ireland's growth was not as strong as it is at present.  I worry that since our economy has improved, we have become less aware of the problems they face.  I strongly recommend that the Minister for Foreign Affairs makes this issue a priority over the coming months.  The Australian system, whereby a bilateral agreement was reached between Australia and America, would be incredibly effective in regard to this country.  I urge the Minister to look at it and to see it as a positive way to move forward because it is has been tried and it works.The recent figures speak for themselves.  Ireland received 10% fewer green cards in 2006 than in 2005 and 28% fewer lottery visas in 2006 than in 2005.  This is not because Irish people are not anxious to go to America but we have not been successful in getting there legally.  There are still thousands of young Irish people who would like to follow the Irish tradition of leaving for America to make their life in that exciting country.  We no longer view emigration as a tragedy.  It is of great benefit to the many young people who travel there and a great education to them.Driving licences for these emigrants is a major issue.  Anybody who knows anything about American life knows that one can barely function there without having a car and being able to drive yet driving licences are being taken from Irish emigrants making their lives in America extremely difficult.There is a rule whereby if one goes to America to start a business and invest a certain amount of money, one can get a visa.  The Irish people contribute to the economy there just as American people in Ireland contribute to the Irish economy.  The connection between both countries can be seen in their respective labour forces.  The United States has had a profound cultural influence on this country, as exemplified by its role in the peace process in Northern Ireland.  The duty of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the priority of the Government should be to make things happen to ensure that the undocumented Irish can live contentedly.  We have all heard stories from our constituents about people who have genuine cases to make.  I beg the Government to help these vulnerable people by heeding their calls.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	296	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion.  I congratulate my colleague, Deputy Ring, on introducing it.  I also congratulate the Government on agreeing to accept Deputy Ring's proposal.  I would like to ask the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Kitt, about the green cards of people who have returned to Ireland.  I refer to people who intend to stay here — they may have new careers here, for example.  Can an agreement be reached with the US Government for the green cards of such people to be given to those who have applied for residency?  Perhaps the system could be voluntary.  Some people with green cards have established very good careers in Ireland and will never return to the US.  As they still have their green cards, they have retained the ability to return to live in the US.  I ask the Minister of State to consider this approach, under which those who have returned to Ireland could identify themselves and make their green cards available.  If a system of exchange could be agreed with the US Government, those cards could be transferred to people who have applied for residency in that country.  This mechanism would meet a small proportion of the need that exists among the 25,000 to 50,000 Irish immigrants who are living and working in the US without documentation.A great deal of pain is being endured by the undocumented Irish and their families.  I regularly hear from constituents of mine who are sad because their sons or daughters in the US are unable to return to Ireland to attend a family wedding, for example.  It is even sadder when Irish people living in the US cannot come home for the funerals of their parents.  The pain felt by the families involved, especially by the undocumented person who has to stay in the US while these events take place, is very intense.  The human aspect of this issue is often lost during the debate on it.  We must impress on the US Government the contribution that has been made to that country's economy by emigrants who went there from Ireland centuries ago.  Some of my grandparents' siblings went to the US to contribute to the development of that country.  It should be recognised that all families in Ireland have similar stories.  We should remind the 40 million Irish-Americans who comprise the Irish diaspora in the US that they have a role to play as well.  Irish-Americans should remind their fellow Americans of the special relationship the US has enjoyed with Ireland and the Irish people since the 18th century, well before the Famine.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	297	I congratulate my colleague, Deputy Ring, on introducing this timely motion.  I also congratulate the Government on accepting the need for consensus on this issue.  This is a difficult time for the friends and family of Irish people who are living in the United States, in places like Dorchester and Brighton in Boston; and Yonkers and The Bronx in New York.  I have spent time in Upper Darby in Philadelphia.  Undocumented Irish are also found on the west coast, in places like San Francisco, and as far north as Chicago.  For the first time, these people are living in fear.  In the 1980s, they saw the cities I have mentioned as places of affluence and opportunity, but they have told me they now associate them with fear.  I receive text messages and e-mails to that effect on a daily basis.I heard today that ten undocumented Irish people are being kept in detention centres after being lifted by US security personnel at train stations 150 miles from the Canadian border.  The people in question did not even go near the border.  Legislators on both sides of this House have to stand up and be counted as we try to assist Irish people who are living in fear.  As Deputy Ring said, if a deputation is to be sent to the US, it should include Dr. Ian Paisley and Mr. Martin McGuinness so we can demonstrate our collective opinion that this is a serious problem.We all heard about the good stories and the opportunities which were available in the US between the 1950s and the 1980s.  The stories we are hearing now should make us sick.  The undocumented Irish in the US are afraid to be part of this campaign.  Their fear of being deported is making them afraid to show their hand.  This is something we should not allow to happen.  If a new visa programme is to be established, our immediate concern should be for the people to whom I have referred.  We have to find a means of ensuring they are not prevented from coming forward by their fear of being deported.  I encounter that sentiment frequently when I communicate with people throughout the US.Ireland has a rich experience of mutual co-operation with the US on serious problems like Northern Ireland.  When consensus was reached on the Good Friday Agreement, there was collective goodwill on both sides of the Border.  In this instance, there is collective goodwill on both sides of the Atlantic.  My Fine Gael colleagues have spent time in the US talking to Senators, Congressmen and legislators who have an equal desire to do something about this problem.  We do not have to play hardball.  The Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Tánaiste do not have to play hardball on this issue.  They have to show goodwill, courage and short-term thinking so that progress can be made sooner rather than later.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	298	I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate.  I congratulate Deputy Ring on introducing this timely motion.  We all know what has happened in the US since the tragic events of 11 September 2001 and the introduction of the REAL ID Act.  The US Government now requires one in all states to produce driving licences which prove that one has US citizenship or the right to stay in the US.  The new laws affect many Irish people, including my constituents from County Clare, some of whom are afraid to show off their saffron and blue county colours in case they draw attention to themselves.  That is how serious the situation is at the moment.  When I pass through Shannon Airport, I often see a picture of John F. Kennedy waving goodbye as he left Ireland in 1963.  If the current US immigration laws had been in force when his great-grandfather, Patrick Kennedy, left Ireland, John F. Kennedy would never have been President of the United States — that is the funny thing about it.Anyone who has been to the US recently will have seen signs calling on the US Administration to legislate in support of the undocumented Irish.  When I see such signs, I am reminded that most of those who went from Ireland to the US many generations ago never came back.  The same thing could happen again.  Deputy Ring spoke about men and women who cannot come back to Ireland for funerals.  I have heard of a case of a man who had to listen to his father's funeral on a mobile telephone because he could not return to this country.  It is unacceptable that well educated young men and women have to hide in US cities.  Irish people are being treated badly even though the Irish heritage of many American people is paraded annually on St. Patrick's Day, when the biggest parades take place in the US.  The talk now in Gaelic Park in New York is not about hurling, camogie or football; it is about the crackdown on the illegal Irish.  They stay illegally in America because they cannot get a long-term visa or a green card — which is virtually impossible to get.  As Deputy Hayes stated, in 2006 only 54 lottery visas and 1,906 green cards out of a total of 50,000 were given to the Irish.  People such as Niall O'Dowd must be congratulated for their Trojan work ensuring that the Irish voice is heard in the immigration debate in the United States.  The comprehensive immigration reform Act 2007 would have provided legal status to many of the illegal Irish residing in America and the Bill was supported by many high profile Senators but unfortunately it did not go through.I am delighted the Government has accepted this motion.  I urge the Government to include these proposals to extend the US customs and border protection facility for Shannon Airport as it would require the adoption of a US-Irish intergovernmental treaty.  I urge the Government to work towards this treaty as soon as possible because it would allow passengers travelling to the United States to be regarded as domestic passengers once they leave the Irish base.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	299	With the agreement of the House I wish to share time with Deputy Scanlon.I am delivering this statement on behalf of the Minister for Foreign Affairs Deputy Dermot Ahern.  This debate provides a welcome opportunity for this House to highlight the difficulties facing the undocumented Irish in the United States, the Government's strong record of engagement on their behalf and our continued determination to work for a solution.  I am pleased, therefore, to commend this motion to the House.Members of the Oireachtas from all parties have taken an active interest in this issue.  By travelling to Washington to lobby on behalf of the undocumented, many Members of this House have sent an important message of solidarity to this marginalised group.  The Government deeply appreciates the added value that these visits have brought to its own intense lobbying campaign.In October 2005, the Dáil and Seanad passed all-party motions expressing strong support for efforts to find a solution which would enable the undocumented to regularise their status and travel freely between the United States and Ireland.  A strong bipartisan spirit was evident during those debates.  There was a coming together of politicians from all sides to support a group of our people living lives of great fear and uncertainty abroad and I welcome in particular Deputy Ring's comments in this regard.I regret some recent efforts to politicise this sensitive issue.  Last week's suggestion by Deputy Kenny that Senator Edward Kennedy was waiting for a phone call from the Taoiseach simply misrepresented the position.  Indeed, just a few short weeks ago, the Senator and the Minister for Foreign Affairs had a detailed strategy session on possible options to move the immigration issue forward.  This shows clearly how wrong the Deputy's remark was but I do not wish to dwell on this aspect.The tradition in this House, for which I pay warm tribute to all sides, has been not to play politics in any way with the hopes and aspirations of the thousands of undocumented Irish.  I hope that over the next two days we can re-emphasise this traditional bipartisan approach.  I particularly welcome therefore this agreed motion.  I know the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, intends holding a briefing session with the members of the relevant Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.  I will bring Deputy Neville's remarks on the subject of green cards to the attention of the Minister.  Green cards are given on an individual basis and not on the basis of nationality so I do not believe they are transferable.For the past decade the Government has attached the highest priority to assisting our emigrant communities abroad.  For far too long our national psyche was scarred by the loss of generations of young people to emigration.  Shattered communities throughout Ireland were left bereft of the energy and creativity of so many young people who had gone abroad to find the sort of opportunities this country could not provide or who were disadvantaged as a result of the troubles of the past 30 years.While our recent prosperity should be celebrated by all Irish people, we must never forget the searing pain of loss and loneliness suffered by those who were forced to leave our shores and those they left behind.  Without the sacrifices and achievements of our emigrants and their willingness to remain engaged with this country, the confident and successful modern Ireland of today would not exist.We are especially proud of the vital contribution made by Irish communities abroad, in particular Irish-Americans, to the development of the peace process and the growth of our economy.  Reaching out to and assisting our emigrant communities is a cornerstone of Government policy.  We have added real substance to this commitment.  The establishment of the Irish abroad unit within the Department of Foreign Affairs has greatly enhanced our capacity to develop and implement policies aimed at building relations and providing practical and financial assistance to our communities overseas.Funding to groups working with our vulnerable emigrants has never been higher.  In 2007, the Department's financial support for emigrant services has reached over €15 million.  This is the highest amount ever allocated by any Government and represents an increase of 26% over last year and a 15-fold increase since 1997.  This engagement with the Irish communities abroad will continue in the years to come.Irish people have a special connection with the United States.  The last US census recorded that 36 million people consider themselves to be Irish-American.  The enormous contribution made by generations of Irish emigrants to the development of that great nation is something all Irish people should take pride in.  Their achievements are an integral part of the American story and touch communities in every state.Today our relationship is evolving and it is no longer defined solely by the emigrant experience.  Fortunately, Irish people no longer have to move to the US in search of work and thousands of our citizens who have lived in America for many years have now returned here.  Almost half a million visits are made by Irish people to the US each year, putting us within the top ten countries providing visitors.  The phenomenon of thousands of Irish people travelling to New York at this time of year for Christmas shopping is very revealing about the nature of our relationship and the distance we have come since the depressing days of mass emigration.Our two countries are building a mutually beneficial partnership in the 21st century.  This is particularly true in the economic field where our ties are stronger than ever before.  The United States is our second largest trading partner and is the largest source of our inward investment.  This investment is increasingly two way as Irish direct investment in the US is now very significant and is estimated at about $17 billion.  Irish companies are also employing tens of thousands of American workers.However, our undocumented community in the United States is largely removed and marginalised from these exciting developments.  A precise figure for the number caught in this situation is impossible to ascertain.  Official US Government estimates put the figure at only 3,000 while others suggest it could be as high as 50,000.  Based on assessments by our embassy and consulates, the Government believes the true figure is probably closer to 25,000.  However, we have never spent much time dwelling on the numbers: we take the firm view that where there are Irish people in difficulty abroad, we have a duty to offer support and assistance, regardless of the number.The majority of the undocumented Irish have lived in the US for many years.  Like generations of previous Irish emigrants, they work hard, raise families and make an important contribution to the economic and social life of their communities.  Yet, they live in the shadows of society and fear and uncertainty are their constant companions.  Most also suffer greatly from the pain of not being able to travel to Ireland without being denied re-entry to the United States.  As a result, they are forced to miss the funerals, weddings and other significant events in the lives of loved ones back in Ireland.  This in turn imposes a considerable burden on their families here, often including elderly parents.A few in this country would pass harsh judgment on this community.  They argue that the undocumented do not deserve our support and sympathy and that they should simply return to Ireland.  Such analysis is callous and shallow.  Many of the undocumented Irish moved to the US at a time when Ireland's economy was not so successful and when US border security and enforcement was not as high a priority as it is now in this post 9/11 world.  They began to work, to settle down and to raise families.  While they remain fiercely proud of the land of their birth, most now regard America as their home.  The undocumented Irish also help to keep long-standing Irish communities in parts of New York, Boston and San Francisco vibrant and successful.  Without their presence, the sense of Irishness in these places will begin to fade.The Government has been steadfast in its commitment to these people.  The Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and other Ministers, have used every possible opportunity to advocate on their behalf.  In his meetings with President Bush, the Taoiseach has stressed the importance of this issue to the Government and made it a central theme of his St. Patrick's week Washington visits.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs has made the plight of the undocumented one of his key priorities and has visited the United States almost 20 times during the past three years to lobby for reform.Ultimately, of course, we cannot dictate US legislation.  However, the Government is determined to continue to use all its influence to ensure that the undocumented can live in the US free from fear.  At the same time, we are deeply aware that immigration is a sensitive and divisive issue in the US.  Post the events of 11 September 2001, governments have an absolute obligation to protect and preserve the integrity and security of their borders.The presence in the US of 11 million undocumented persons presents enormous social, economic and security challenges.  Intense political debate has raged for many years on how to deal with the consequences of this reality.  There are those in America who feel strongly that any legislation which seeks to legalise the undocumented is tantamount to rewarding law-breaking and will only encourage a further influx of illegal immigrants.  Others maintain that these 11 million people are doing jobs that American workers are not prepared to do and that it would be neither logistically possible nor morally correct to deport so many people.Regardless of their position on the issue, the vast majority of Americans and their politicians agree that the US immigration system is broken and needs remedy.  The Government strongly supported the comprehensive and bipartisan solution proposed by Senators Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts and John McCain of Arizona.  Their legislation, if enacted, would have enabled the vast majority of the undocumented, including our citizens, to regularise their status, travel freely to and from the US and, ultimately, secure a path to permanent residence.  It would also have provided extensive opportunities for new immigrants to work in the country.  This broad approach was strongly supported by President Bush.Various versions of this legislation were considered in Congress over the past two years.  One such version passed the US Senate in 2006, but did not achieve sufficient support in the House of Representatives and could not, therefore, become law.  Further efforts earlier this year by the US Senate to pass similar legislation ended in failure.  It is now widely accepted that no further serious effort will be made to pass comprehensive reform until after the 2008 US presidential election.During the past two years, we worked closely with Senators Kennedy and McCain and the Bush Administration to advance their comprehensive approach to immigration reform.  We strongly believe that their legislation represented the best opportunity to resolve the situation facing the undocumented Irish.The Government was deeply disappointed by this failure to make progress; it represented a serious setback.  I place on record the Government's deep appreciation to Senators Kennedy and McCain and Ireland's many friends in Congress for their leadership on this issue and for their support of the Irish community.  The Government has consistently made clear that if efforts to pass comprehensive reform legislation were unsuccessful, we would explore all possible alternative options.  These options include a bilateral solution.Last month the Minister for Foreign Affairs travelled to Washington for an extensive round of discussions with key players involved in immigration.  During the visit, he explored the possibility of a bilateral approach in meetings with Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice, Secretary for Homeland Security, Michael Chertoff, Senator Edward Kennedy, Senator Charles Schumer, Senator Patrick Leahy, Senator Lindsey Graham and the Friends of Ireland Group in the House of Representatives.  There remains a strong sense in Washington that immigration reform will remain a highly divisive and difficult issue for the foreseeable future.  While US political leaders fully acknowledge that the number of undocumented Irish is extremely small in the overall context, there is a reluctance to single out one particular group of undocumented for preferential treatment.However, some important progress was made during the Minister's visit and our ambassador in Washington has been asked to take forward a number of bilateral possibilities in his contacts with the US Administration and Congress.  These include possible reciprocal initiatives for young people; long-term non-immigrant opportunities for Irish people interested in working on a non-immigrant basis in the US and for Americans interested in employment here; and, most important, solutions for the situation facing the undocumented.Deputies will appreciate that the details of these proposals and discussions will have a better prospect of success if taken forward in private.  The Minister will of course keep the House informed of any progress made.There is no doubt that improved immigration arrangements between Ireland and the United States would more accurately reflect and further enhance the dynamic nature of our modern relationship. New arrangements would provide much needed opportunities for future flows of migration between our countries and would help prevent the emergence of future generations of undocumented Irish.  In a very real way, it would also help to foster a culture of compliance with current immigration laws.The traffic would certainly not be all one way.  A FÁS jobs event in New York in 2006 attracted thousands of young Americans keen to explore the possibility of working and travelling in Ireland.  Achieving bilateral immigration arrangements between the two countries is not an easy task.  US immigration law is extremely complex and attempts to amend it in favour of one particular group are politically very sensitive.  No matter how well disposed US politicians are towards Ireland, passing immigration legislation in Congress is highly fraught and watched very closely by other immigrants groups.  However, the Government will make every effort to succeed. Some Members of this House make frequent reference to the current visa arrangements between the US and Australia which permit Australian citizens with certain qualifications to work in the US.  It is suggested that a similar arrangement should be made available to Irish citizens.  I remind Deputies that this visa scheme is not available to undocumented Australian citizens and would do nothing to alleviate the suffering of our undocumented community if passed for all Irish citizens.  When commenting on this sensitive issue, it is vital that we do not raise false expectations among the undocumented and their families.It is important during this debate that we pay a special tribute to those undocumented who have campaigned so hard and effectively for reform.  They have not sat back and bemoaned their fate. They have not waited for a leg up or a hand out.  They have remained positive and hopeful.  Despite the risks, they decided to mobilise, to come out of the shadows and make their voice heard.In December 2005, the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform was formed in New York and was quickly embraced by the undocumented as an effective tool for change.  With tremendous energy and determination, they raised awareness of their plight by organising rallies throughout the US.  In March 2006, thousands of undocumented Irish climbed into buses in New York, Boston, Philadelphia and elsewhere.  After travelling through the night, they arrived in Washington DC wearing t-shirts bearing the slogan "Legalise the Irish".  The undocumented made a powerful and lasting impression on Capitol Hill.  This remarkable act of lobbying earned the attention and respect of many of the most powerful political figures in America.  So effective was the campaign, that the t-shirts became one of the most sought after items in Congress.By organising all over the US, by travelling to Washington and by making their case with sensitivity and respect, these remarkable people changed the nature of the debate.  Some key political figures in the US Congress maintain that lobbying by the Government and the Irish community was directly responsible for bringing Congress closer to enacting comprehensive reform than it had been for many years.  The Government has been proud to work closely with the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform, including during the visit of the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, to New York and Washington last month, and has contributed more than $185,000 to the organisation.Of course, the undocumented feel frustrated that despite all our collective efforts, the ultimate prize of legalisation remains elusive.  This community is no longer alone.  It has found renewed hope and pride from within; its voice and concerns have been heard clearly in Ireland and America; it has formed an important and lasting bond with this Government and, working together, we have brought forward the day when its sought after prize of reform will be achieved.

Deputies are aware that immigration reform is one of the most contentious and high profile political issues in the US.  There are strong views on both sides of the argument not only in Congress and state legislatures but also in business, the trade union movement and US society in general.On 17 May a bipartisan coalition of US Senators, including Senator Kennedy, reached what was characterised as a grand compromise on comprehensive immigration reform.   However, regrettably it did not prove possible to move the Bill to a final vote on that occasion.  Subsequently President Bush went to the Congress on 12 June to meet the Republican senators.  Following that meeting he announced his support for a $4.4 billion initiative to strengthen border security.  The Democratic leader in the Senate and his Republican counterpart then announced that the reform Bill would be brought back to the Senate floor.  On 26 June the Senate voted to proceed with a debate on the Bill.  We welcomed this as an encouraging advance.  However, securing the necessary bipartisan consensus to deliver on this complex and diverse matter always constituted a considerable challenge.  Unfortunately, as we now know, the compromise Bill failed to attract sufficient support.This was a major disappointment and a setback for the thousands of undocumented Irish people in the United States and their families in Ireland.  Given the present difficult and divided environment in Congress on immigration, it is now widely considered that such comprehensive legislation is unlikely to return to Congress in a meaningful way in advance of the next US presidential and congressional elections.  In the aftermath of this disappointment, the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, made clear his determination to actively review the situation and explore possible alternative options, including bilateral arrangements.In the months since the collapse of the comprehensive reform Bill the Department of Foreign Affairs and the embassy in Washington have been engaged in a wide range of consultations with congressional, administration and Irish community figures to assess how best to proceed.  The Minister recently visited the United States to discuss the situation with senior members of the Administration and some of the key players in Congress.  In this regard among those with whom he had meetings were the Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice, the Under Secretary for Democracy and Global Affairs, Paula Dobriansky, and Senators Edward Kennedy, Charles Schumer, Patrick Leahy and Lindsey Graham as well as the House of Representatives Friends of Ireland group.  While they all emphasised the present difficult environment for making progress on immigration reform in Congress, they were very willing to work with us to explore further possible ways to resolve the position of our undocumented citizens.  This work is being pursued by the ambassador and his staff in Washington and will be reviewed by the Minister on an ongoing basis.The Minister had a detailed discussion on the matter with the Secretary of Homeland Security, Michael Chertoff, and he had a meeting with members of our undocumented community in New York.  Unfortunately Senator Kennedy has been ill and the meeting between the two Senators has yet to take place.  While our embassy in Washington is in close contact with both offices, it reports it is too early to ascertain whether the proposal will gain traction.Our sustained political contacts have been further strengthened by the mobilisation of the Irish community behind the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform, a highly effective group which we are pleased to support, including financially.  Senator Chuck Schumer of New York told Niall O'Dowd a number of weeks ago that he might be prepared to support legislation that would set aside several thousand working visas each year for Irish citizens, including the undocumented.  He suggested the scheme also be made available to citizens of one or two Hispanic countries to avoid accusations that it was a deal for white Europeans only.  Senator Schumer agreed to discuss the proposal with Senator Kennedy before deciding how best to proceed.Since 11 September 2001, there has been a dramatic change in the security climate in the US.  Tighter border security measures, being unable to travel home for fear of being refused re-entry and difficulties in obtaining licences all serve to increase the pressure on undocumented Irish who are effectively living in a kind of twilight zone.  We do not want our people marginalised further.  Together with their families here at home they are increasingly feeling the strain.  Emigration always had a central place in the Irish experience and as a result we are so far removed from our past that we are willing to turn a blind eye to our young ones and emigrants who now find themselves in unfortunate and difficult circumstances.  We have established a dedicated unit in the Department of Foreign Affairs focused entirely on matters related to the Irish abroad.  It is helping to drive progress on this range of issues.  A further reflection of the Government's commitment is clear from the substantially increased funding to groups supporting our vulnerable community abroad.  Funding is now more than eight times greater than it was in 1997.I wish to comment on what Deputy Breen said about President John F. Kennedy.  If the same laws were in place when his ancestors moved to America many years ago as exist now he would never have become President of the United States and his brother would not be a Senator.

#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	302	I welcome the opportunity to discuss this extremely important issue.  It is an issue that can regularly be forgotten in today's economic climate.  As there is such a change in economic circumstances, people are no longer forced to leave the country to find gainful employment, to rear a family and to have an outlook on life to allow them to live out their lives with dignity.  We need to lobby extensively to ensure the problem is resolved once and for all.  It is critical to remember not just those who were forced to travel to the United States, but also their families who are separated from them in such a painful way.  As many of us are starting to plan for Christmas, many families here will not be able to see their loved ones as a result of the situation that prevails in the United States.I welcome the fact that this is an agreed motion.  No party, politician or individual has a monopoly on good ideas or on the process to resolve this issue.  There has been a very good bipartisan approach to the lobbying that has taken place.  I am delighted that it will continue in this session.  While there are difficulties in the United States, it is primarily a problem that the Oireachtas through the Minister and the Taoiseach will need to continue to pursue with the legislature in the United States to ensure resolution of the situation once and for all.There is a particular genesis to tonight's motion and its bilateral approach.  In his speech the Minister of State clearly identified that following the Australian model does not guarantee that the undocumented problem will be solved, as the Australian model does not account for the undocumented Irish.  Anything we do now should reflect clearly on those affected rather than on those who might wish to travel to the United States in the future.  It is important to reach a comprehensive agreement or deal that caters for the people currently affected and their families.  We need to be careful not to create a false sense of hope by giving priority to this bilateral approach.  The effect of our support for this element should not give false hope to the people directly affected on the ground in the United States or their families here at home.  We must strive to resolve the problem in the most comprehensive way possible.I compliment the efforts of many people directly involved in this House and in the US Congress.  I also compliment the many people who have been involved in lobbying in Ireland and the United States.  There are many small groupings of people directly affected.  The parents and siblings of the undocumented in the United States have sought to encourage debate here and have made efforts to lobby us all.  There are many people from my constituency in County Clare who are directly affected by the issue.  While it is a problem across the country it is particularly so in the west.  The pain these people continue to suffer spurs us all on to find a resolution.  I also recognise the efforts of the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform, in particular Niall O'Dowd, Grant Lally and Jeff Cleary.  Those three people have been in this country on many occasions and have met various political groupings and other people who have an interest and are involved.  They keep in regular contact with the Minister for Foreign Affairs as the Minister with direct responsibility in this regard.  They continue to work with their own politicians in the United States.  Both Grant Lally and Jeff Cleary are Irish-American.  They could quickly put their hands in their pockets and walk away from this.  They have other activities in which to be engaged but they are committed to their efforts.It is disappointing that this problem has persisted for so long but I hope a comprehensive solution will be found.  Given that 11 million immigrants are undocumented in the US of who between 25,000 and 50,000 are Irish, the Irish element is very small.  For that reason, the US Administration should demonstrate goodwill to find a resolution to this problem.  The undocumented Irish are by their nature hard working and they have contributed to the society in which they live and which they have helped to create.  It is only right that a comprehensive approach be taken to this issue.  Comprehensive immigration reform legislation is needed to ensure these people will have a right to reside in the country they have helped build.

When we last discussed it in October 2005, I believed there was cross party support for a motion that could be presented as the view of the Oireachtas at the time when there seemed to be the prospect of the McCain-Kennedy Bill having success.  I was also pleased to travel as part of a delegation of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs to lobby Senators in support of the emerging legislation, complex though it was.  I am pleased to support a motion on an all-party basis on behalf of the Labour Party.  I am not party to the text of the Fine Gael motion or the Government adaptation of it but I am happy to contribute to something that can be issued as a statement on behalf of all Members.  I hope my sharing of time will enable another party to indicate its support.It is very important that we bear in mind continually the pain of those families who are divided.  When I spoke in October 2005, I referred to the experience of emigration.  Between 1955 and 1960, 250,000 people left Ireland, mostly bound for England, and, in one year, 58,000 emigrated.  The major difference in US emigration, which began in the 1980s in its present volumes, was it was circulatory migration.  Those who leave Ireland today have the prospect, because of many different circumstances, of returning to their families.  The most painful aspect for families is that those who emigrate are cut off by the illegality of their presence in the US.  The Government and its representatives must follow all the available paths.  The motion suggests that a bilateral strategy be used in the short term.  I support advantage being taken of the forthcoming Belfast meeting, as it would be silly not to do so.  When the Kennedy-McCain proposals failed due to complex factors, magnificent rallies were held.  I too pay tribute to Niall O'Dowd, Ciaran Staunton and others who organised campaigns that went on past that point.It is important that we retain our emphasis on a comprehensive solution because dealing with new entrants into the US would not be sufficient.  Some people have been out of status since the 1980s with all the perils that brings.  I will not repeat all that has been said but it includes health risks, risks of not being protected under labour law and people cannot join their families for funerals and so on.  It also does not include protection against one's own.  Some of the cases have involved Irish people exploiting out of status Irish people.As we approach the Belfast meeting, it will be possible to make gains on a reciprocal basis.  It is important that the House accepts that we do not have to make an either-or choice.  By deciding to make the best use of a reciprocal atmosphere in preparation for the Belfast meeting, one does not have to say it is being done at the cost of another strategy.  The strategy should be flexible and multidimensional and that includes bearing in mind the complexity of the relationship between, for example, the proposals from Senator Schumer's office and those of Senator Kennedy.  It is possible to take advantage of Senator Schumer's proposals and, at the same time, maintain the best possible relationship with Senator Kennedy, one of the most long-standing friends of Ireland.  That would not be an either-or solution.In approaching the issue of the 11 million undocumented immigrants, I do not agree with those who suggest a special case should be pursued.  Advantage should be taken of the reciprocal opportunities available but it is important to bear in mind the 11 million out of status immigrants in the US have contributed to the economy and paid taxes and their labour has been used.  It is a matter of right that they would be recognised.  I refer to the atmosphere during the transition of the legislation from the US Senate to the House of Representatives.  The view of several members of the House of Representatives was that they would take the labour of the 11 million without according rights to them.  I do not support any departure from condemnation of that view.  It is wrong to have any person whose labour has been used or abused in any way.When this issue is resolved, I look forward in the short term to all-party agreement on a resolution in the House that would recognise the rights of workers, wherever they are, including those who have come here and whom we have kept for three or four years in hostel accommodation in receipt of €19 a week from the State while refusing them the right to work, and those, for example, who are sheltering in the shadows of the economy and who have said they want to participate fully in our society.  I am not impressed by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who said implementing arrangements similar to those in Holland or Spain would send the right message.  We have a difficulty whereby if we behave totally inconsistently and send the wrong message from the Oireachtas regarding the rights of workers, it will damage our moral position abroad.I will not dwell on this because I want a consensus in favour of those who are out of status in the US but I would be entirely inconsistent if I did not say it.  Of the 11 million out of status people in the America, approximately 25,000 are Irish when one takes the figure presented by immigration drop in centres and adjusting it downwards.  When I last contributed on this issue in October 2005, the prospect of dealing with it through a lottery system was ridiculous.  Ireland would have had 290 successes out of 9.5 million applicants.  Something needs to be done.  Opportunities exist in limited circumstances for Ireland to take advantage of what is on offer through a negotiation on Senator Schumer's proposals.  It is very important that we continue our efforts.  We need assurance in reply to this debate.  What is being asked for is an approach that is flexible and will include and be able to take advantage of every initiative, regardless of where it originates.  It is worth recalling something else as regards those great marches that took place after events in October and November 2005.  What is important is the pressure on the House of Representatives.  We have to think of a way of dislodging the narrow opinion that suggests people from outside the boundary of the United States can arrive, work, contribute, pay taxes, form businesses and so forth but be required to live in the shadows without rights.  It is important we recognise there is pressure to be put on the House of Representatives, that there are decent people in the United State who are neither Irish nor Irish-American but who support the point I am making.  That means there must be a multifaceted effort that is able to handle different opportunities within the Senate, but also one that can turn into a practical campaigning issue which will put pressure on the House of Representatives and be effective not alone on behalf of our own Irish, but also others.I hope we will be successful but we should not wait for that moment before beginning to operate with some consistency here at home and remove the blotch in all our names as regards the way we treat people who have come to this country and who are capable of working and making a contribution.
#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	304	I thank the Labour Party for the time allocated to me tonight and I commend the motion tabled by Fine Gael.Emigration has been a feature of Irish life for generations.  Very few Irish families have not been affected by emigration, with estimates indicating that more than 1.2 million people born in Ireland are living abroad.  As the motion points out, there are thousands of Irish emigrants at present in the United States who have no legal status there.  It is estimated that somewhere in the region of 50,000 Irish people in the US do not have legal status.  That amounts to one third of all Irish-born persons living there.  I do not believe there is a Deputy in the House who does not know someone who is affected by being undocumented in the US.  While being undocumented may not, at first, be an issue, especially if a person only intends to stay for a short period, once roots are set down then he or she will run into enormous difficulties.  This may relate to anything from a driving licence to getting married and having children.  How many Irish go to America during the summer holidays?  Young lads, in particular, go there to play football and stay.  All those lads are at present undocumented.  As a result, many people enter a twilight zone.  Although they may be hard working and law abiding, in every other respect they are forced to live their lives as outlaws.Families have been affected, where members living and settled in the United States have been unable to return to Ireland at times of serious family difficulty.  The emigrants face the dilemma of damaging either the original family in Ireland or the new one in the US.  Often two people without legal status are in a relationship which exacerbates the problem.  For many years it appeared that the American authorities were prepared to be fairly lax in their approach to Irish immigrants.  Often people were not only working, but paying tax.  Of late, however, there have been several arrests.  Some within Irish communities believe there is a deliberate campaign to target Irish immigrants and this has led to a good deal of fear.Irish groups have also noted that while the numbers of young Irish arriving in the United States has fallen over the past decade and more, of late there have been signs that this trend is changing.  This is possibly due to the less favourable economic climate in Ireland now compared to previous years.  It is ironic that many of those leaving are taking up traditional work in construction and the bar trade that are increasingly being filled in this country by immigrants, many of who are exploited and forced to work for less than what Irish people consider to be a viable wage.   All of us have experienced the displacement of Irish labour as a consequence, both internally in Ireland and as regards those forced to emigrate.  Despite the numbers involved, there appears to be no sense of urgency on the issue from the Government.Senator Schumer has come up with proposals on the issue that are supported by Irish groups in the US — which the Irish Government needs to be seen to support.  I stress the Government needs to be seen to be actively behind this initiative.  Unfortunately, some Irish in the US believe the Government here has been less than aggressive in pushing for this and has not put the necessary pressure on Capitol Hill.  That contrasts with the attitude of the Australian Prime Minister John Howard, who came to Washington to lobby on behalf of his citizens in the same position.  On today's news I picked up the fact that this initiative has been successful.  He went to Washington and lobbied hard on their behalf, with some success.   That contrasts to the Government here which has not been forcefully exercising its prerogative in this regard.The Government needs to ensure this becomes a priority and that the status of Irish people in the United States is secured.  That can be linked to positive developments in the peace process here and the enormous fund of goodwill that exists towards Irish people in the US because of the significant contribution they have made to their adopted country, in every sphere.  That is only part of the issue, however.  The Government, by lobbying the US Administration to recognise the status of undocumented Irish immigrants, in a hypocritical fashion is still not addressing the issues in this State as regards the status of Irish citizens and their descendants who want to return to their homeland.  That is despite the fact that Article 2 of the Constitution states:...the Irish nation cherishes a special affinity with people of Irish ancestry living abroad who share its cultural identity and heritage.Those who emigrated and their family members are being treated very shabbily when they want to return.  The issue of returning emigrants being refused benefits under the habitual residency condition and the refusal to allow American spouses of Irish citizens the right to work and residency are creating severe hardship.  There is even evidence that returning Irish are leaving this State in disgust at the treatment they and their families are receiving.  Between May 2004 and April 2006, some 880 Irish people were refused social welfare payments because they did not meet the habitual residency condition.  I have experienced many times the situation where returning emigrants have applied for planning permission on their family lands and been refused because they had not been resident here for a specified period of time.  That is another form of discrimination which needs to be looked at and addressed.The proposal to establish a new system governing visas between this country and the US is to be welcomed.  Hopefully, this initiative will not only go a long way towards solving the dilemma faced by Irish people in the US, but also make it easier for US citizens to live and work in Ireland.  This type of reciprocal action shows a measure of goodwill and is welcomed by the many Americans living in Ireland, many of whom have faced hardship because of the long waiting periods of residency and naturalisation.The irony of all this is the refusal by the Government, while demanding regularisation and status for undocumented Irish, to consider a similar amnesty for undocumented migrants in Ireland.  The Minister of State with responsibility for integration, Deputy Conor Lenihan, reiterated that position in his recent speech in the US: "You won't be seeing an amnesty in the near future.  I believe it would possibly send the wrong signal."  Does he not see the contradiction and hypocrisy in what he is saying?  Does he not understand the message he is sending out in the United States as regards what he is prepared to do here and he expects the US to do in return?It is about time the Government in Ireland stopped talking out of both sides of its mouth.  If we are asking that Irish citizens be treated with respect in other states, which is only right and proper, then we must be prepared to treat immigrants with the same respect in this State and offer them parity of esteem.On the question of families in limbo, national radio reported the case of a sister and brother living in New York who could not return home to Listowel for the funeral of one of their brothers who died tragically.  The mother of the deceased was therefore unable to seek comfort from them.  Such circumstances arise in many counties and not just in Kerry.We need to mobilise all Irish Americans, of whom I am told there are up to 50 million, including people of influence, to work in conjunction with the Government to exert pressure and use their collective influence on the relevant authorities to resolve this problem.  The onus is on the Government, in particular, to show leadership, grasp the nettle and make progress.  I urge it to do so.
#ChrisAndrews	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-party	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-dob	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	305	I am delighted with the opportunity to speak on this issue, which is important not only to society but also to the health system.  A delicate situation has arisen involving the Health Service Executive and the Irish Pharmaceutical Union, IPU.  On 14 October, up to 140 pharmacists withdrew methadone services from approximately 3,000 patients as a protest against the changes due to come into force on 1 December 2007.  A pharmacy is currently paid the cost price of the drugs under the general medical card scheme in addition to a fee of €3.26.  There is no mark-up on the cost of these medicines and all the costs of operating the pharmacies' GMS medications are paid for from the €3.26.  It has been said the pharmacists receive fees of up to €18 on occasion, as indicated recently by the Minister, but three out of every four chemists to whom I have spoken claim they never received this payment.  One chemist indicated today that he has been in business for 15 years but has never received it.In practice, the GMS scheme is loss making for the pharmacy but is cross-subsidised by other products.  From 1 December, the HSE intends to pay pharmacies 8% less than the cost price of the medicines.  Pharmacists have described this as a breach of their contract with the HSE.  Drugs payment scheme customers will also be affected because the HSE said it no longer intends to pay pharmacies based on the cost price of medicine.The pharmacists have been more than willing to negotiate, they have come to the table with a very open mind and are willing to discuss virtually any issue with the HSE.  In February 2007, the Minister for Health and Children and the chief executive of the HSE both indicated the need for an independent process for the setting of pharmacy fees.  Discussions were held under the independent chairmanship of Mr. Bill Shipsey but he has since suspended his efforts to find a resolution.  We are thus in limbo and will end up with two unhappy parties and a crisis on 1 December.I understand Mr. Shipsey met the IPU and HSE representatives last Wednesday but nothing has happened since.  It appears to me, having spoken to pharmacists around the country, that the process is really only a smokescreen and that the HSE will continue to force through its proposals without any really meaningful talks.  The HSE has argued that the IPU, as a collection of business undertakings, is precluded under the Competition Act 2002 from negotiating fee-related matters with the HSE.  It is not in a position to negotiate directly with the IPU.  I accept that the HSE has difficulties but do not accept the complete lack of flexibility regarding its unwillingness to discuss the issue with local pharmacists.  It will not engage with the pharmacists as a group or as individuals and this is very unfair.Pharmacists provide a vital service to the community and work long hours.  In many ways, they represent the last bastion of local retail outlets and are genuinely local.  More often than not, they are involved in the local community and provide what the old corner shops used to provide some years ago, namely, a means of interaction with members of the community.  Pharmacies are now part of the social infrastructure and provide medicine to GMS scheme patients and those who are eligible under the drugs payment scheme.  They provide this service on behalf of the HSE and this should be recognised rather than punished.It is simply not realistic to demand that pharmacists dispense medicine at a loss.  In many cases, they are small businesses with high overheads and must compete with new entrants to the market.  A pharmacy with a high GMS turnover will be particularly affected if the proposed change comes about.  Pharmacies should be supported and, in order to increase competition, pressure should be put on the wholesalers rather than the retailers.  The HSE has not been able to negotiate sufficiently good terms with the wholesalers but the retailers and customers should not suffer as a consequence.The HSE has not carried out an economic assessment of its proposals on the retail sector or heeded the recommendations of the Indecon report, which recommended consultation and dialogue.  Why has the report not been published?  I ask that this be done as soon as possible.  It is not enough to hide behind the Competition Act 2002 and it is imperative that the HSE and IPU, on behalf of small pharmacists and those with a high GMS turnover, find a way to reach a mutually beneficial conclusion that avoids further action and does not put patients in further danger.
#MarieHoctorFF	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-party	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-dob	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	306	I thank Deputy Chris Andrews for raising this matter.  I am responding on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.The changes to the wholesaler arrangements for the supply of drugs and medicines to community pharmacists for dispensing under the relevant schemes, as announced by the Health Service Executive, were informed by a comprehensive consultation process.  On foot of this, it became clear that the HSE could not negotiate with pharmacists or wholesalers for legal reasons.  Under section 4 of the Competition Act 2002, the Pharmaceutical Distributors Federation, PDF, representing wholesalers, and the Irish Pharmaceutical Union, IPU, representing pharmacists, may not negotiate fees, prices or margins collectively on behalf of their members since both bodies constitute undertakings under the Act.  Accordingly, it is not possible for the State to negotiate with the PDF or IPU on fees or margins as such negotiation would place these bodies at risk of prosecution.  The Minister for Health and Children has already outlined in detail how the legal issues evolved in recent replies to several Deputies and in her remarks in the Seanad.Following the completion of public consultation by a HSE-led negotiating team, and informed by independent economic analysis carried out by Indecon Economic Consultants, new reimbursement arrangements were announced by the HSE on 17 September 2007.  The new price arrangements involve revised rates for community and hospital supply.  On community supply, the reimbursement of the cost of drugs and medicines to pharmacy contractors is to be reduced from the ex-factory price plus 17.66% for wholesale supply — this is the previous mark-up — to the ex-factory price plus 8% from 1 January 2008 and 7% from 1 January 2009.  On hospital supply, there is to be a new interim mark-up of 5% for wholesale supply from 1 January 2008, with further discounts for efficient ordering and supply in that sector.In its examination of the issues involved and in determining the new arrangements, the negotiating team considered a re-imbursement level that reflects the market value of pharmaceutical wholesale services and security and continuity of supply at current levels to patients.  The evidence on which the decision is based, following examination of the issues, direct consultation and independent economic analysis, all indicates that the State is currently paying a premium for the services in question.  It is possible and necessary for revised arrangements to be put in place without a substantial impact on the delivery of such services.I also point out that pharmacists' arrangements with wholesalers for the supply of drugs and medicines is a private commercial arrangement and that the HSE's role is confined to setting the most appropriate re-imbursement rates for community pharmacies. The basis for the new re-imbursement arrangements was set out in detail by the CEO of the HSE on 17 September 2007.To address concerns expressed by the IPU on behalf of community pharmacists about the implications of the legal advice on competition law on their right to negotiate fees through the union, a process of dialogue was established chaired by Bill Shipsey, SC, to explore ways in which these concerns could be addressed, having regard to the legal position.  Following a recent suspension of the process due to the withdrawal of methadone dispensing by certain pharmacists, there is renewed engagement between the IPU and the HSE under the auspices of Mr. Shipsey.The Department of Health and Children and the HSE continue to recognise the IPU as the representative body for its members.  There is, and will continue to be, ongoing dialogue with the IPU, in compliance with competition legislation, and the HSE will consider all available options for advancing the process for the review of the pharmaceutical supply chain.  The next stage of this process will involve separation of the price of drugs and medicines dispensed in community pharmacies from re-imbursement for professional services through the introduction of a flat fee arrangement across all the GMS and community drugs schemes.  The HSE aims to ensure that such an arrangement will be a fair and transparent reflection of the service provided and will be arrived at following further consultation with all stakeholders.  I also point out that the service provided by community pharmacists is highly valued by the Government and I hope that it will be possible for pharmacists and the HSE to continue to engage in matters of mutual concern in a positive and forward looking manner.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	307	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for affording me the opportunity to raise this important matter.  It was with deep regret that I learned of the content of a recent planning brief drawn up on behalf of the management and board of St. Michael's Hospital in Dún Laoghaire.  This hospital has been part of the fabric of the greater Dún Laoghaire area for many years and has provided, and continues to provide, a wonderful service for thousands of people, including myself, over that period.It appears that this report was carried out as a result of a recent inquest being told that there had been instances in St. Michael's of a virulent new strain of a hospital-acquired bug which is fatal in one in 12 cases.  I will outline some of the disturbing facts stated in this report.  The hospital building is at the end of its useful life.  The operating theatres, their direct support and the day ward are functionally, spatially and technically obsolete.  They offer patients and staff an inappropriate environment for the delivery of contemporary elective surgery and other investigations and treatments.  The physical layout is inefficient.  Existing space is grossly inadequate and environmental control systems are either absent, inadequately provided or obsolete.A recent decontamination review observed that processing facilities incorporate no physical barrier between areas in which soiled instruments are received and washed and those in which clean and sterilised material are handled.  There is no clear system to dispose of contaminated material.  The scrub area attached to the main theatre can only be approached through the theatre or via a staff rest room.  Room surfaces are finished in materials now considered inappropriate.  The second floor day ward is not directly adjacent to either operating theatre which creates difficulties because of a lack of a bed lift.  These are only some of the items specified in this recent report.I am aware that the management and board have plans to upgrade this very important facility, which carries out just under 6,000 mainly routine surgical procedures annually.  They plan to expand on the services currently offered, including an increase in the capacity of the day ward so that day cases can account for 70% of all surgery instead of the current 50%.  This target is consistent with trends in Ireland and health systems in most advanced countries.In light of the disturbing facts contained in this report, I am looking for a commitment that the Minister for Health and Children and the HSE will provide the financial support to allow the management of this hospital to proceed immediately with the upgrading and construction works.  Unfortunately, the Minister is not here.  It is not acceptable that these necessary works are put on the long finger and that we will have to wait a number of years before this hospital is restored to its rightful place as one of the leaders in the provision of first-class medical services.The Acting Chairman and I have been Members of this House for a long time.  Important issues are raised on the Adjournment.  I wish to put a protest on record.  I have nothing against the Minister for State, who is not responsible for the Department of Health and Children, but the preceding speaker also raised a very important matter in the health area when no Minister from the Department of Health and Children was present.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	309	In terms of the items that are being raised, I do not blame the Minister of State for having to take this Adjournment debate but, as I said to my colleague, Deputy Ring, this is becoming a bit of a joke.  One wishes to raise serious matters and, in my constituency, this is a very serious problem.  As I said at the outset, this hospital is an essential part of the fabric of the greater Dún Laoghaire area and complements the very worthwhile services provided at St. Vincent's Hospital.  As I also stated, over 6,000 operations are carried out in St. Michael's each year.  The fact that it is increasingly moving towards day ward services is an essential part of the infrastructure in our health service.If anything happens to this hospital, it will be a very serious matter in respect of the proper advancement of St. Vincent's as one of the key centres of excellence for the Dublin area so I appeal through the Minister of State.  The funds are necessary.  I understand that the board is in a position to go to tender in the very near future.  There is talk about work commencing in October but given the current mess in the finances of this country, I am afraid that this matter will be put on the long finger.  Having listed some of the matters contained in the report, everybody would agree that, in the interests of patient care and to prevent further illnesses arising from the lack of facilities, it is vitally important that this matter is dealt with urgently.
#MarieHoctorFF	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-party	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-dob	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	310	I will be taking the Adjournment on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children.  The Department has been advised by the HSE that the report to which the Deputy refers was prepared by management at St. Michael's Hospital.  In order to address the issues outlined in the report, the HSE, as part of its ongoing capital programme, has recently approved in principle a capital project which will allow for the development of facilities at St. Michael's.  It will involve new operating theatres and recovery facilities, a new theatre sterile supply unit and a new day procedures unit, including facilities for day surgery, endoscopy and minor surgical and medical proceduresThe HSE has indicated that the selection of a design team for the project will commence shortly and it is expected that design and detailed planning will commence in early 2008.  The decontamination review and hygiene audit referred to in the newspaper article are national initiatives to address quality and risk issues in service delivery.A decontamination review and assessment took place in St. Michael's Hospital in November 2006.  The HSE has advised that the hospital has taken steps to address the issues raised and this is reflected in the planning brief.  Similarly, an assessment of hygiene services took place in the hospital during August 2007.  Measures have now been put in place to address concerns that were identified.  The HSE has assured the Department that patient care is not being adversely affected in the interim.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	311	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing time to discuss the important unfolding political crisis in Pakistan.  Pakistan and Ireland are connected through bonds of history.  Both countries once formed part of the British Empire, both were born out of partition, both made a rapid transition from dominion status to a republic, both have struggled to escape from the uncomfortable embrace of a larger neighbour and both share a common language, English, while preserving languages of their own.However, the similarities stop there.  Ireland has embarked on the path of democracy, economic progress and peaceful relations with our neighbours.  Pakistan has not been so fortunate, its democracy and economy have been held back by military coup and military rule.  Given our shared history, Ireland should not be silent about the events that are taking place in Pakistan.  We must be forthright in our opposition to President Musharraf's declaration of martial law and the crackdown on the free press and we must demand a rapid return to civilian rule, free elections and a return to democracy.  I call on the Minister of State to encourage the Minister for Foreign Affairs to use his bilateral contacts and multilateral contact through the European Union to ensure that maximum political and economic pressure is put on the Musharraf regime.The future of the world may well be linked to the future of Pakistan rather than Iran, Israel or Afghanistan.  Pakistan is probably the most dangerous country in the world.  It is a large country of 150 million people, most of whom are Muslim.  It is located at the geopolitical fault line of India, China and the Muslim world.  It is a nuclear power, a military power and its tribal areas are a haven for terrorists including al-Qaeda and perhaps even Osama bin Laden.  Democracy is the right course for Pakistan's people.  It will bring about a more secure world and will set a good example for other Muslim countries struggling with modernity.Moreover, the suppression of democracy, the press and civil society will have the inevitable effect of making radical Islam the only viable opposition to the current regime and the only political outlet for younger people.  We have allowed this to happen in the past in Iran by supporting the Shah against Mosaddeq and also in Egypt.  This cannot be allowed to happen again.I call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs to make our support for democracy clearly known to the Pakistani ambassador and use our multilateral contact through the General Affairs and External Relations Council to ensure that maximum political and economic pressure is put on the Musharraf regime without delay.
#MarieHoctorFF	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-party	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-dob	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	312	The Government is deeply concerned about the situation in Pakistan.  We join those in the international community, including the EU, the US and the UN Secretary General, who have expressed similar concerns and demands for an end to the emergency provisions at the earliest possible time.Yesterday, following the events over the weekend in Pakistan, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, issued a statement expressing serious concern about the declaration of a state of emergency by President Musharraf on 3 November, the suspension of Pakistan's constitution and fundamental freedoms and the imposition of wide-ranging restrictions on the media and the Supreme Court.  The Minister also stated that it was essential that every effort be made to reinstate the constitution, to lift restrictions on the media and the judiciary, and to return to the democratic process and hold early elections in order to pave the way for a peaceful transition to democratic government in Pakistan.  The widespread arrests and detention of opposition members, human rights defenders, journalists and lawyers are deeply disturbing.In our contact with the Government of Pakistan, we have long expressed our strong hope for a return to democracy and civilian rule through free and fair elections.  Pakistan is a country of real strategic importance and, particularly if it can return to civilian rule and democracy, a country with which we are interested in further strengthening our relationship.  Indeed, the promise by General Musharraf to withdraw from his military role and the work of the Pakistani elections commission to set up systems for free and fair elections had raised hopes that Pakistan would finally return to this path.  This makes the events of the past few days all the more disturbing.The Irish Government's position is clear.  We recognize the real threats to peace and security in Pakistan from the subversion and havoc that militants and extremists can create.  We have already seen this in the appalling massacre that greeted Benazir Bhutto's return to her country, which sought not just to assassinate her but also to undermine the democratic process.  In responding to this, the authorities must accept that stability and development can only be achieved through democracy and the rule of law.It is only through accountable representative government, which carries the support of the people of Pakistan, that the real challenges that Pakistan and its people face can properly be addressed.  These challenges include the very poor conditions that exist in some remote rural and tribal areas, and the corruption at various levels which affects almost every aspect of life, including the political system.We urgently call on the Government of Pakistan to take urgent action in the following areas: to restore the constitution; to ensure that the commitments made, and restated yesterday, that free and fair elections will be held on schedule in January are respected in full and the necessary conditions to ensure these are put in place; and to release without delay all political prisoners, including members of the judiciary, lawyers, journalists and human rights defenders.  In particular, we appeal for the immediate release of the distinguished human rights defender, and UN special rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, Asma Jahangir, whose detention is totally unacceptable.  We call on the Government of Pakistan to honour the President's commitment to step down as army chief of staff by 15 November, to pursue energetically reconciliation with the political opposition and to relax restrictions on the media.All parties must exercise the utmost restraint and work together for a peaceful and democratic solution.  The Minister has conveyed these views and the Government's deep concerns about recent developments to the ambassador of Pakistan in Dublin, making clear his personal interest in the situation.  The Government and the EU will keep the situation under review and will discuss developments further at the next General Affairs and External Relations Council meeting on 19 November.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	313	On 29 November 2006, the Minister for Education and Science announced 54 major primary schools building projects.  She promised they could proceed to tender and construction and that many would be constructed over the next 12 to 15 months and that most would be started in that time.  The tender process for Gaelscoil na Cruaiche, Westport, has not yet been completed.  The promise was made before and during the general election.  Gaelscoil na Cruaiche was the only school project announced for Mayo in 2006 but to date the tender process has not been completed.The school opened in 1996 with provisional recognition and was granted permanent recognition in 2000.  It has 206 pupils and 11 full-time teachers.  It has a waiting list for admission for the next four years.  The school is operating from rented premises, the third rented premises since the school started.  The contract expires in June 2008.A site has been purchased for the school and planning permission was granted.  What is causing the delay?  Why has the project not gone to tender?  Will the tender process be completed before Christmas?  We were told the sod turning would take place before Christmas.  The premises will no longer be available in June 2008.  It is an excellent school with excellent teachers but it needs a new building.Is funding available or must this project wait until after the budget?  Does the recent chaos in Dublin, where the authorities could not plan how many schools would be needed in the future, mean that the west must wait?  Will the five or six schools promised for the west be built in Dublin and schools in the west left behind?I hope the Minister of State, who is here in the absence of the Minister for Education and Science, will indicate that the construction project relating to the school will go for tender either next week or the week after and that the sod-turning ceremony will take place before Christmas.  Most importantly, however, I hope she will indicate that a contractor will be appointed immediately and that construction will proceed.The pupils and teachers at the school are obliged to endure terrible conditions.  Had someone not obliged the school in a particular regard earlier in the year, it would not be open and that would be a disgrace.  When will the project go to tender?  Is the funding in place?  Will the Minister of State indicate that there is good news for the people of Mayo?
#MarieHoctorFF	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-party	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-dob	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	314	I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity of outlining to the House the Department of Education and Science's position regarding the provision of new premises for a gaelscoil in County Mayo.  It is proposed to build a new ten-classroom school, based on an existing design that was previously used in the provision of a gaelscoil elsewhere.  Initially, there were problems with the site acquisition and this delayed the progress of the project in applying for planning permission.  The latter and a fire certificate have been obtained and the tender documentation is being finalised.Under the national development plan, €4.5 billion is assigned to the capital requirements of the primary and post-primary sectors.  Over €540 million will be spent this year on school buildings.  The level of construction alone in the primary and post-primary sectors in 2007 is such that it will deliver more than 700 classrooms to provide permanent accommodation for approximately 17,500 pupils.The progression of all large-scale building projects from initial design stage through to construction phase is considered on an ongoing basis in the context of the Department's multi-annual school building and modernisation programme, the main focus of which is to deliver school places within rapidly developing areas.  As with all large-scale projects, the progression of a gaelscoil in County Mayo will be considered in this context.  I assure the Deputy that the Department is committed to providing suitable high quality accommodation for a gaelscoil in County Mayo at the earliest possible date.

This does not take into account work-sharing activities.One member of staff previously working in this area has transferred to the Clonakilty Office.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	318	My Department is very aware of the need to conserve native rare breeds of cattle and sheep and actively participates in conservation programmes at National, EU and International levels.  Conservation of rare breeds of farm animals is crucial in achieving sustainability of livestock production.My Department supports on-farm conservation of genetics resources in a number of ways.The REPS 4 Scheme contains a voluntary Supplementary Measure which rewards farmers who keep native cattle and sheep breeds (Cattle — Kerry, Irish Moiled, Dexter; Sheep — Galway).  A payment of €234 per livestock unit is paid to farmers under the scheme.My Department also operates the Kerry Cattle Preservation Grant Scheme, whereby a grant of €76 is paid per live eligible calf.  The objective of the scheme is to encourage the maintenance and development of Kerry Cattle in Ireland.National conservation of endangered genetic resources is also supported in other ways.  Approximately €200,000 of Exchequer funding has been allocated to projects that assist with the conservation of Kerry cattle and Galway sheep.  Examples of this work includes the collection of semen from Kerry bulls and Galway rams, the development of websites for the Galway and Kerry Cattle breed societies (to provide information and increase awareness of the breeds), and the development of a long-term conservation strategy for Kerry Cattle and Galway Sheep.  More recently, funding has been provided for the collection of semen from Irish Moiled bulls.Ireland has also availed of funding from two EU Programmes to assist with the conservation of genetic resources — the 1994 and 2004 programmes.  Under the most recent programme my Department secured approximately €20,000 to assist in the development of a national inventory of animal genetic resources.  This web-based database contains important population and breed data on all of Ireland's domestic animal genetic resources, including native cattle and sheep breeds.Internationally my Department also participates in conservation activities for animal genetic resources, particularly through the Food and Agriculture Organisation.  In September 2007 Ireland, along with 109 countries, adopted a Global Plan of Action for Animal Genetic Resources, the first internationally agreed framework to halt the erosion of livestock diversity and support the sustainable use, development and conservation of animal genetic resources.  Development of national conservation policies to preserve our native animal breeds will take full cognisance of the policies in this Global Plan.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	319	The bluetongue virus (serotype 8), which emerged in northern Europe in 2006, re-emerged this year and, in September, an outbreak of the disease was confirmed in Britain for the very first time.  Cases of the serotype 8 strain have now been confirmed in nine European countries.Since the disease was first confirmed in August 2006, my Department has been developing contingency arrangements, in the first instance, to minimise the possible introduction of the disease to Ireland and, secondly, to deal with an outbreak in this country.  In both regards my Department is working very closely with the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development in Northern Ireland in the development of an all-island approach.As part of my Department's contingency arrangements, we have produced a comprehensive Bluetongue Contingency Plan for Ireland.  My Department's contingency arrangements are kept under constant review and revised as appropriate by reference to the developing disease situation or in the light of legal or other developments, particularly at EU level.In terms of minimising the risk of the disease being introduced to Ireland, my Department has had in place a ban on the importation of live susceptible animals from bluetongue-restricted areas in Europe.  Since 1 November, however, a new Commission Regulation allows for the possibility of movement of susceptible animals from bluetongue-restricted areas under defined conditions that are detailed in the Regulation.  However, imports of such animals from Great Britain remain banned under FMD-related measures.My Department has advised importers of live animals to assess carefully the risks involved in importing animals from bluetongue-restricted areas and to import animals from such areas only where absolutely necessary.  My Department is also finalising a risk analysis on other possible routes of introduction of the disease.  Arising from that risk analysis, I will consider whether any additional mitigating controls ought to be put in place.As regards vaccination, there is no vaccine yet available for the particular strain of the disease that is present in Britain and across northern Europe.  Three pharmaceutical companies are currently involved in the development of an inactivated vaccine.  I understand that such a vaccine may become available by the summer of 2008 though, even then, there will be production issues and a huge demand for the vaccine given the cattle and sheep populations of the countries affected to date.My Department has been in contact with the three companies involved in relation to the timeframe for the availability of a vaccine and the provision of an adequate supply to ensure that we can put in place a comprehensive and effective vaccination programme.  The logistical arrangements associated with securing and administering the vaccine are currently being actively considered within my Department.  In the absence, to date, of a vaccine, the Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible, at this stage, to predict what the cost of the vaccine or of a comprehensive vaccination programme will be.Furthermore, my Department is actively involved with the European Commission and the other Member States in relation to the possibility of developing an overall Community-wide vaccination strategy.  The Commission has scheduled a bluetongue symposium to be held in Brussels on 16th January 2008 and, in preparation for that, the first in a series of working group meetings took place yesterday, at which my Department was represented.I have also discussed the current disease situation in continental Europe and in Britain with my colleagues in the European Agriculture Council and have also discussed it, and will again later this week, with Minister Gildernew, in the context of the development and maintenance of an all-island approach.  Indeed, at the September Agricultural Council, a number of Ministers called on the Commission to develop a bluetongue control strategy and I strongly support this approach.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	320	I met the Chief Executive of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland on 11 September 2007.  We discussed the importance of ensuring compliance with food labelling requirements especially in relation to the country of origin to beef sold in the retail and catering sector.My Department is in regular contact with the FSAI.  We established the Food Safety Liaison Unit in my Department in 2001 to coordinate the relationship between the various line Divisions in the Department and the Authority.  A high level Steering Group which is jointly chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and the Chief Executive of the FSAI meets twice a year to oversee the working arrangements between the Department and the Authority, the last such meeting took place on 5th October 2007.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	321	Under the Government Decentralisation Programme the Fisheries Divisions of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food as well as an Bord Iascaigh Mhara are to be co-located in Clonakilty.  The Department opened an interim decentralised office in Clonakilty in July 2006 and there are currently 80 civil servants from the fisheries Division of the Department working in that office.In addition, some of the former staff of the fisheries divisions of the Department now work in the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority, which was established on the 1st January 2007.  There are 28 public servants working in the Clonakilty headquarters of the Authority at present.  To date none of the (90) posts due to relocate to Clonakilty have moved, pending resolution of a range of matters that have arisen in the context of the decentralisation of the State Agencies.The Minister for Finance has asked his Department to engage at central level with the unions representing staff in State Agencies on the full range of industrial relations issues relating to the decentralisation of State Agencies.  Once the central issues are resolved, meaningful negotiations can occur with BIM staff and Trade Unions towards implementing the decentralisation of BIM's Head Office to Clonakilty.A contract has been placed by OPW in August of this year for the construction of the new decentralized offices for the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and BIM.  Construction commenced in September 2007 with an anticipated construction period of eighteen months.

The proposed legislation will address many of the issues raised during the extensive consultation process undertaken by my Department. As I stated in May, allowing a change of land use in certain limited circumstances will be one such issue.In drawing up the new Bill it is proposed to take a more flexible approach regarding the question of replanting after harvesting.  The general principle of replanting after felling will remain in order to ensure that the national forest estate is not progressively eliminated.  The draft Scheme of the new Forestry Bill will be submitted to Government shortly for approval to send to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel for drafting.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	324	I am aware of the position recently adopted by the European Parliament regarding the proposed legislation on the marketing and use of Plant Protection Products.This area is subject to Co-decision procedures and, while the EU Parliament has adopted a position, Council has not yet completed a first reading of the legislative texts concerned.  Consequently there is no agreed EU position at this time.My Department is actively participating in the discussions at Council, and is acutely aware of the possible negative consequences for Irish farming of the EU Parliament's agreed position.We are negotiating to ensure:that any additional controls proposed are justified,that any use restrictions are based on scientifically valid risk assessments andthat environmentally sensitive agricultural production is sustainable.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	325	Detailed EU legislation lays down the conditions that Member States must apply to the production of and trade in products of animal origin as well as to imports of these products from third countries.It is a requirement that animal products imported from third countries meet standards at least equivalent to those required for production in, and trade between, Member States.  All such imports must come from third countries or areas of third countries approved for export to the EU.My Department has responsibility for the operation of public and animal health control in the area of third country import of food of animal origin, including meat.  These are carried out in co-operation with Customs Service.  Import control forms a part of the EU's integrated policy of guaranteeing that the food produced and placed on to the market is safe and that animal and public health is not put at risk.  They are a part of the EU's hygiene package the implementation and monitoring of which is carried out by the relevant competent agencies under Service Contracts by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland since 1999.The EU Food and Veterinary Office (FVO) carries out inspections to ensure that only establishments that meet hygiene and health standards equivalent to those operating within the EU are approved.  Where the FVO considers that public health requirements are not being met, an establishment may be removed from the EU approved list.  If outbreaks of animal diseases occur in a third country, approval to export to the EU is suspended for the infected regions of the country, or the whole country, as appropriate, until the disease risk has been eliminated.I have consistently pointed out at EU level that produce imported from third countries must meet standards equivalent to those required of Community producers.  In this context I have been in regular contact with the EU Commissioner for Health, Mr. Markos Kyprianou.  The Commissioner has assured me that the Commission will not hesitate to take the appropriate protection measures if a product, imported from a third country or produced in the domestic market, represents a risk for the health of EC consumers, livestock or plants.I should add that in WTO discussions in the Council, I have always emphasized the need to take account of the non-trade aspect of market access, which I regard as a crucial element in the overall negotiations.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	326	The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) signed an agreement, last July, designed to facilitate the sharing of information in relation to food safety.  This marks the first formal step to promote cooperation between the two agencies aimed at facilitating the sharing of scientific information and setting the tone for future cooperation.  It is hoped that the difficulties associated with the lack of synchronization in the GM authorization processes between the EU and the US can be addressed as part of this agreement.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	327	I would welcome the publication of this report at the earliest possible date.  However it is important to note that the FVO have procedures which can involve protracted correspondence on their draft report with the national authorities in the Member State or Third country concerned.  The time taken for the publication of this report is above the average but there are instances where up to 8 months elapsed between the FVO mission and the date of publication of the final report.The Food and Veterinary Office is part of the EU Directorate-General for Health and Consumer Protection.  It conducts missions to Member States and third countries to check on compliance with the requirements of EU food safety and quality, animal health and welfare and plant health within the EU and on compliance with EU import requirements in third countries.  The Commission report on their findings to the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health.  I would remind the Deputy again that the Commissioner has personally assured me that he will not hesitate to take appropriate protection measures if a product, imported from a third country represents a risk for the health of EU consumers, livestock or plants.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	328	There is, currently, no vaccine yet available for the particular strain of the disease (serotype 8) that is present in Britain and across northern Europe.  Three pharmaceutical companies are currently involved in the development of an inactivated vaccine. I understand that such a vaccine may become available by the summer of 2008 though, even then, there will be production issues and a huge demand for the vaccine given the cattle and sheep populations of the countries affected to date.My Department has been in contact with the three companies involved in relation to the timeframe for the availability of a vaccine and the provision of an adequate supply to ensure that we can put in place a comprehensive and effective vaccination programme.  The logistical arrangements associated with securing and administering the vaccine are currently being actively considered within my Department.  In the absence, to date, of a vaccine, the Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible, at this stage, to predict what the cost of the vaccine or of a comprehensive vaccination programme will be.Furthermore, my Department is actively involved with the European Commission and the other Member States in relation to the possibility of developing an overall Community-wide vaccination strategy.  The Commission has scheduled a bluetongue symposium to be held in Brussels on 16th January 2008 and, in preparation for that, the first in a series of working group meetings took place yesterday, at which my Department was represented.I have also discussed the current disease situation in continental Europe and in Britain with my colleagues in the European Agriculture Council and have also discussed it, and will again later this week, with Minister Gildernew, in the context of the development and maintenance of an all-island approach.  Indeed, at the September Agricultural Council, a number of Ministers called on the Commission to develop a bluetongue control strategy and I strongly support this approach.Apart from the political contacts, my officials are in regular contact with colleagues in the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development in Northern Ireland in the context of maintaining an all-island approach to the threat posed by the spread of the disease, particularly following the recent outbreaks in Britain.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	329	Ensuring the viability of the maximum number of family dairy farms means improving efficiency and competitiveness right across the sector, at both producer and processor level, at a time of increasing exposure to global market forces.At producer level, greater efficiency and competitiveness can only be achieved through the attainment of increased economies of scale and the reduction of costs.  This quite simply means getting more milk quota into the hands of active, committed dairy farmers.  The Report of the Agri Vision 2015 Committee highlighted the need for greater flexibility in the movement of quota from those exiting milk production to those who needed to expand in order to maintain viability and withstand competitive pressures.  I acted on this at the end of last year by bringing a more open-market approach to the transfer of quotas through the introduction of a new Milk Quota Trading Scheme.Replacing the old Restructuring Scheme, the new Trading Scheme has been responsible in its first year for the transfer of 200 million litres of quota, and we have seen that much greater volumes of quota have made their way into the hands of active milk producers than would ever have been possible under the Restructuring Scheme.  The Trading Scheme is currently under way in respect of the 2008/2009 milk quota year, and my intention is to continue to build on its success to the maximum extent possible.From a processing perspective, in April of this year I announced details of 19 capital investment projects that were awarded Government grant assistance of over €114 million under the Dairy Investment Fund, which will in turn generate an overall spend of nearly €300 million in the sector.  I am confident that this will assist in particular the production of added value products and the delivery of cost efficiency programmes, which will in turn help to achieve my objective of developing a modern, competitive food sector in Ireland, as envisaged in the Agri Vision 2015 Action Plan.

The role of Bord Bia,  which is fulfilled by its staff, is to provide market development, promotion and information services to the Irish food, drink and horticulture industry.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	331	The Farm Improvement Scheme was introduced by my Department in July 2007 and funding of €79 million for the Scheme was agreed under the Partnership agreement, Towards 2016, as part of an overall programme of investment in the agri-food sector.I announced last week that as applications had reached the level of funding available for the Scheme, the Scheme was closed to new applications for now.  Over 12,600 applications were received up to the closing date of the Scheme and my Department will process these applications up to the level of funding available.  Payment of grant-aid will issue in respect of all approved projects in due course when the work involved has been completed and I expect that a substantial number of payments will therefore issue to farmers under the Scheme in 2008.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	333	Commonage land must be farmed to the farming conditions set out in the relevant Commonage Framework Plan and attracts an enhanced payment rate of €282 per hectare on up to 40 hectares in REPS 4.The mixed grazing supplementary measure is available to farmers who engage in a mixed cattle/sheep livestock farm enterprise in which at least 20% of the livestock units (on average) grazing the holding must be made up of the second livestock type.  The livestock must graze the same sward either together or in a leader–follower grazing system.It is not possible to undertake this measure on land which is not under the sole control of the farmer, which excludes commonage.  A farmer with commonage and non-commonage land may however apply for the measure on his or her non-commonage land.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	334	I am aware of the recent FAPRI analysis concerning projected sheep production between now and 2016.  The Deputy will be aware that likely production and market trends were taken into account in the Sheep Strategy Report of 2006 and its subsequent Implementation Report that I received last April.  The Implementation Report sets out a number of measures to improve the performance of the sector and to ensure that we remain competitive on export markets.  Whereas most of the recommendations fall to the industry itself to implement, my Department is providing assistance in a number of areas including sheep breeding, processing facilities and quality assurance.  Teagasc is also providing support to the sector through technology evaluation and transfer.Sheep farmers are also eligible for various schemes operated by my Department.  A new supplementary measure aimed at sheep farmers has been introduced under REPS 4.  A budget of €28 million per annum has been allocated to fund the new measure at an overall cost of €170 million up to 2013.  The sheep sector is also the beneficiary of on-going work to promote Irish lamb on home and export markets, which is undertaken by Bord Bia.The implementation of the Sheep Strategy Report and the other measures outlined above will provide a sound basis for the future development of the sector.

The estimated quantity exported in an unprocessed state, including high value whitefish and some shellfish which command their highest value in fresh form, amounted to some 36,000 tonnes.The Report of the Seafood Industry Strategy Review Group —Steering A New Course — Strategy for a Restructured, Sustainable and profitable Irish Seafood Industry 2007 -2013 sets out a range of measures to deliver a  restructured seafood processing sector with appropriate scale and operational efficiency to compete in the international market.  The strategy focuses on R&D and value-added development to meet customer demands and take advantage of new market opportunities.  The Government is committed to the efficient and effective implementation of this strategy and an Implementation Committee has been established under the independent chair of Dr Noel Cawley and comprising industry representatives, State Agencies and the Department to oversee its implementation..
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	336	The issue of high levels of discards in commercial sea fisheries is a global problem and is on the agenda of all major international organisations who deal with the development of sustainable sea fisheries and protection of marine ecosystems.At a European level, Community legislation allows the discarding of fish in certain circumstances.  Fish discards are a complex problem and are a feature of most fisheries particularly in mixed fisheries such as those which prevail in Irish waters.  Fish are discarded mainly because they are not the target species, are undersized, are not a commercially viable catch or are over quota.Ireland has been to the forefront in pressing for action on this issue at European level.  The Irish Presidency in 2004, chose as its theme in relation to the fishing sector "fast tracking the development of environmentally friendly fishing methods" as its key focus.  A major international conference was held in Dundalk involving EU member states, Norway and Iceland with the key focus on how to reduce discards in commercial fisheries.Following further consideration, a Commission Communication on "a policy to reduce unwanted by-catches and discards in European fisheries" was presented to Council in June 2007.  The Council adapted a range of conclusions on the Commission proposal and these will determine the agenda at European level on this issue for the immediate future.I will continue to press for progress on this issue and am confident that significant improvements can be achieved in this area.  The current Programme for Government commits to increasing supports to assist fishermen make the change over to more environmentally friendly fishing gear, and I am confident that this will assist in reducing the incidence of discarding in key fisheries.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	337	The Government decision on the decentralisation of my Department is that the headquarters will move to Portlaoise, involving some 600 staff; the local offices in Cork city will move to Fermoy, involving up to 100 staff; and the laboratories in Cork and Limerick will move to Macroom, again involving up to 100 staff.The Department's Decentralisation Implementation Plan allowed for a phased movement to Portlaoise, i.e. the transfer of functions and posts over a number of years.  The 2005 and 2006 phases of decentralisation to Portlaoise are now complete and the 2007 phase is in progress.  Also, to facilitate the Government decision on decentralisation all new activities within the Department, particularly work relating to the Single Payment Scheme (SPS), are being focused in Portlaoise.  In total there has been an increase of some 200 full-time posts in Portlaoise to some 400 since early 2004. Therefore, to date, the decentralisation of my Department is ahead of schedule.The original estimate for completion of my Department's new headquarters in Portlaoise was 2008.  As the OPW has revised this estimate to the end of 2009, an additional advance move of staff is now being prepared for 2008.  When the 2008 phase is complete it is envisaged that, in advance of the final move, up to 50% of the original target will be in Portlaoise.Implementation plans for Fermoy and Macroom are in place and the Department is liaising with the OPW regarding specifications for the offices and identification of sites.  The recruitment process for Fermoy has begun.

The objective of the Regulations is to provide statutory support for good farming practices to protect waters from potential pollution from agricultural sources.  The prohibited periods vary slightly depending on the type of fertilizer in question and the part of the country, or zone, in which a holding is located.The zones and prohibited periods are based on scientific research and advice, taking account of factors such as growing seasons, climate and Irish farming systems.  These issues were finalised following wide-ranging consultation with interested parties and submitted to the European Commission by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government as part of Ireland's Nitrates Action Programme in 2005.

These include:An Early Retirement Scheme pension of up to €15,000 for a period of up to 10 years on farms transferred by gift, sale or lease.An installation aid grant of €15,000 for young trained farmers.Capital Gains Tax — Retirement Relief for farmers over 55 years.A rental income tax exemption of up to €15,000 for farmers over 40 years who lease out land for a period of 7 years or more.A rental income tax exemption of up to €12,000 for farmers over 40 years who lease out land for a period of 5 to 7 years.A 90% Agricultural Relief from Capital Acquisitions Tax.The provision of full Stamp Duty relief for young trained farmers.Stamp Duty relief for land swap for the purpose of farm consolidation between two farmers.Budget 2007 included a number of provisions to further encourage land mobility and farm consolidation.  The measures include a third rental income exemption threshold of €20,000 for leases of 10 years or over; stamp duty relief for farm consolidation where only one farmer is consolidating his holding; and a provision whereby farmers who are leasing out land can still, subject to certain conditions, qualify for Capital Gains Tax retirement relief.  With regard to Stamp Duty, further reform by way of relief for land swap for the purpose of farm consolidation, which would facilitate consolidation between more than two farmers, is awaiting EU State Aid approval.All these measures help to improve land mobility through early farm transfer or by encouraging greater levels of leasing, land swaps or farm consolidation.

It is represented on the inter-Departmental team established to oversee implementation of the National Climate Change Strategy.There is no evidence to suggest that there is any major threat to our staple fruit and vegetable crops here due to the warming climate at this time.  Indeed the impact on horticulture crops generally is likely to be positive in the short to medium term.There are no plans to encourage the growth of new crops such as grasses, soyabeans or grapes.  However, research is ongoing to identify possible new crops and varieties of existing crops which might be suited to drier and warmer conditions.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	343	This Government is committed to supporting local and regional food and both Towards 2016 and my Department's Agri-Vision 2015 Action Plan include measures in this regard.Bord Bia, which operates under the aegis of my Department has worked closely with other State and local agencies to exploit the growing opportunities for markets, providing a guide to farmers markets, advice and mentoring assistance.A comprehensive "Guide to Selling Through Farmers' Markets, Farm Shops and Box Schemes in Ireland" will be launched this month to assist local producers wishing to sell their produce in the local area.I believe it is crucial to raise general awareness of the local concept.  In that regard my Department in co-operation with Bord Bia organised a series of regional food fora which took place over an eighteen month period from late 2005 to early 2007.  These events brought together regional, speciality and artisan producers along with relevant state agencies.  The aim was to increase awareness of emerging market opportunities and encourage best practice in developing regional and local excellence in food.  It also provided a forum for these producers to raise issues of particular concern.As a follow up to the regional food fora my Department in conjunction with Bord Bia is holding a conference on the topic of Local Food, exploring the opportunities, in Mullingar on the 13th November at which my colleague Trevor Sargent will be presiding.  This event aims to raise awareness of local food and to highlight the benefits of local food initiatives for both the consumer and the producer.  It will also provide relevant information and support for those involved in local food production.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	344	Farmers may apply to join the REPS 4 scheme at any time of the year by submitting an application and farm plan to my Department's Local AES Office.  I have recently introduced more flexible rules for farmers in REPS 3 who may wish to transform to REPS 4 before finishing their five-year contracts in REPS 3.  Previously, such farmers would have had to get their REPS 4 applications in before their anniversary dates, but they now have two months after the anniversary to do so.While farmers may continue to apply to join REPS at any time of the year, changes in EU regulations which take effect in January 2008 will mean that applications for payment under the Scheme must be made within the same period allowed for the submission of the Single Payment Scheme application.  In practical terms this means that first-time applicants for REPS will need to submit their REPS 4 plans before the Single Payment application deadline to ensure that they get their first REPS payment within the same calendar year.  First-time REPS applications received after the closing date for SPS applications will be given a REPS commencement date in the normal way but the first REPS payment backdated to that commencement date will not issue until the following calendar year.  Second and subsequent payments under REPS will not be affected and payment will issue in the normal course.  These changes will have no impact on farmers remaining in REPS 3.Applications for REPS 4 are already being processed and I expect the first payments to be made shortly.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	346	Details of support for the International Year of the Potato (IYP) were announced by my colleague Minister Sargent on 18 October.  My Department will provide significant funding to support the activities of the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), which is the lead United Nations' agency for the IYP.   I have already made an initial payment of $150,000 to FAO and the total contribution from my Department will be $300,000.  Throughout the world, governments, scientists, farmers and others will focus on the potential of the potato to improve food security and nutrition and to reduce hunger and poverty.  The FAO activities will include information generation and dissemination through conferences and symposia to review research policies and chart the future direction of the sector.  It is hoped to encourage action throughout the developing world to focus on potato systems including crop yields, extension training on improved varieties and production systems.To mark the IYP at home, a national programme of events is being organised for 2008 by a committee comprising representatives of the trade, an Bord Bia, Teagasc and my Department.  The emphasis of the programme will be on nutrition.  The programme will include activities for schools and in particular a primary school competition that aims to promote both the awareness and the growing of the potato.  In addition there will be a website devoted to the potato and throughout the year agricultural show and heritage centres will feature the potato.  The programme, which has not yet been finalised, will primarily be funded by the industry and an Bord Bia.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	347	A farmer who has lost a land and quota lease is treated as a priority category in the allocation of quota under my Department's Temporary Leasing Scheme.  The allocation takes place according to certain criteria, which for example in the case of a producer whose lease expired on 31 March 2007 meant that quota would have been allocated under the first phase of the 2007/2008 scheme on the following basis: 80% of the milk quota leased with land, less(i)any additional quota granted under the Agenda 2000 Schemes,(ii)any permanent quota granted by the Milk Quota Appeals Tribunal since the 2001/2002 milk quota year,(iii)any quantity purchased under the 2007/2008 Milk Quota Trading Schemes.Some concern has been expressed that because all quota bought in the Trading Schemes, and not just that bought from the priority pool, is being taken into account, the total amount deducted from the 80% entitlement may leave some applicants with effectively no entitlement at all.  While I think that these cases are few in number, and notwithstanding the fact that the current practice is the same as that operated in previous years when the amount purchased under the Restructuring Schemes rather than the Trading Schemes was deducted, my Department is reviewing the matter ahead of the second phase of this year's Temporary Leasing Scheme.

The Scheme provides an opportunity for REPS farmers to plant high nature-value woodlands on their farm with the support of a very attractive grant and premium package.   To date, my Department has granted Preplanting Approvals for nearly 2,500 hectares with a further 1,500 hectares currently at application stage.My Department has carried out a review of the Scheme and arising out of this, certain adjustments are being examined.

Among those commitments is one to consolidate responsibility for the welfare of all animals (including non-farm animals) within my Department.At present, a number of other Departments/Agencies have animal welfare responsibilities and work is progressing on identifying the actions required to effect the transfer of those responsibilities to my Department.  My Department is also drafting a comprehensive Animal Welfare Bill, which will update existing legislation and ensure that the welfare of animals is properly protected and that the penalties for offenders are increased significantly.  Where it is necessary to transfer statutory responsibility for animal welfare to my Department, the necessary statutory provision will be made in the forthcoming Bill.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	350	Modulated funds of €225.5m are an integral part of the overall funding available for Ireland's 2007-2013 Rural Development Programme.  The total funding for this programme amounts to €5.778bn from three sources: EU co-funding €2.114bn, Modulation €0.225bn, and Exchequer €3.439bn.  The programme addresses three priorities, competitiveness, the environment and the wider rural economy, and encompasses the following main measures: REPS, compensatory allowances, early retirement, installation aid, and farm modernisation.  The funding provided for these farmer payment schemes took full account of the amount available from modulation and was agreed with the farm organisations in the social partnership agreement.  The Programme was approved by the EU Commission in July of this year.It should be noted that the Rural Development Programme includes only those measures that are co-funded by the EU.  The National Development Plan includes additional measures which are funded entirely by the Exchequer.  The total value of the NDP agri-food package is €8.7 billion.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	351	For the meat sector and the agri-food industry as a whole, I subscribe to the vision set out in the Agri-Vision 2015 Action Plan.  That foresees an industry obtaining optimal levels of efficiency, competitiveness and responsiveness to the demands of the market while respecting and enhancing the physical environment.  The Action Plan points out that the short-to-medium term goal of the meat sector, especially beef, is to ensure that high market penetration in the EU is consolidated and developed, while also recognising the importance of access to commercially attractive third country markets.The challenges facing the meat sector are varied.  They include increased competition for beef and sheepmeat on the EU market to the higher costs of feed for the pig and poultry sectors.  I am committed to assisting the industry to address these issues and I have already taken a series of actions with that in mind.  I am glad to summarise these on a sector-by-sector basis.Beef:Firstly, I was delighted to recently announce the €250 million Suckler Cow Scheme.  The suckler herd is the source of much of our high-quality beef and this measure is consistent with the aims outlined in the Agri-Vision 2015 Action Plan.  I anticipate that over 60,000 herdowners will participate in this scheme.  While the measure is primarily aimed at improved animal welfare, it will also contribute to the improved viability of suckler holdings.Secondly, I announced in April a Capital Investment Aid Scheme for the beef and sheepmeat sector designed to support capital investment, which will increase added value at the processing level and improve efficiencies.  This investment package will, I am confident, ensure the strategic and coherent development of the sector into the future and ultimately position our producers to avail of export opportunities.  This also complements and underpins the existing quality assurance schemes and the advances in breed improvement programmes being developed by ICBF.Thirdly, in order to publicise the response of the beef industry to an ever-evolving market, Bord Bia is intensifying its efforts to promote beef over the coming months.  The aim is to build on the already well-established marketing and promotional activities being undertaken by Bord Bia and the industry.  An extensive promotional campaign commenced in September involving 30 supermarkets across 13 European countries in 10,000 individual outlets.  In addition Bord Bia is completing a new Irish beef marketing strategy.  This follows consultation with industry as to how to best use the promotional resources available over the period 2008 to 2013.I have also established a Market Access Group to focus efforts on the re-opening of markets for Irish beef and other meats.  The recent re-opening of the Saudi Arabian and South African markets are welcome developments in this respect.Pigmeat:By far the main difficulty facing the pig sector is the very high cost of feed.  The rise in feed prices can be attributed to a number of factors such as (i) heavy demand for cereals in Asia (ii) the increased demand for feed materials from the biofuel industry and (iii) unfavourable weather conditions which affected many of the major cereal growing countries.The EU Council of Agriculture Ministers has, in response to the pressures on the international cereal and feed markets, agreed to suspend the obligation to set 10% of arable land aside.  This will ensure that more arable land is available for cereal cultivation in 2008.A scheme of financial assistance for the private storage of pigmeat has been in place since October 29.  This was adopted by the European Commission in response to a request from me and some other Member States.  I have also impressed on the Commission the desirability of export refunds for fresh and frozen pigmeat and this will be kept under consideration.Pigmeat features prominently in Bord Bia's programme of promotion on the home and export markets.  I have asked the Bord to intensify its Autumn pork and bacon promotion campaign in order to ensure that the market remains firm over the coming months.  Additional funding is being made available for this.  The Bord Bia quality assurance schemes are also a good tool in maintaining consumer confidence and, in this context; the pigmeat scheme is well established and managed.On the export front, Irish pork has access to important markets worldwide and pork is included in overseas promotion drives and market access initiatives.I am working with the Minister for Health and Children towards the introduction of legislation to provide better information to consumers on the origin of pigmeat and other meats.Other initiatives aimed at sustaining the pig industry that I have introduced include the extension of the farm waste management scheme to the pig sector and my Department's programme of financial assistance for the transition to welfare-friendly sow housing.Within the framework of the EU common agricultural policy, I will continue to ensure that pig producers' problems are highlighted with a view to suitable action.Poultry:The Irish poultry industry is an extremely important element within our domestic agri food sector. It is worth in excess of €150 million to producers and is an important contributor to economic and social development, particularly in certain areas.  Overall, it is my policy that this industry should develop to its full potential and be in a position to meet the demands of today's consumers and withstand the very strong competition from abroad.An Expert Group to advise on steps to ensure the future success of the industry will finalise its work shortly and I look forward to receiving its report.  That report is likely to cover areas such as production, marketing and promotion, environmental protection and animal welfare.I should also point out that Bord Bia, working in conjunction with the poultry industry and my Department, have in operation the very successful Chicken and Egg Quality Assurance Schemes which are viewed by consumers as a guarantee of quality and I am confident that the market position of our poultry will be enhanced as a result.  It is important that consumer confidence is maintained and I believe that the Quality Assurance Schemes will be a valuable tool in this regard.Sheepmeat:The Sheep Industry Development Strategy Group issued its report in June 2006.  This is a comprehensive study of the sheep industry that sets out a Development Plan for the sector.  I decided that the best way to implement these recommendations was to set up an Implementation Group comprised of representatives of all sectors in the industry, including the relevant state bodies.  This Group reported to me in April this year.  Most of the recommendations in the Strategy Report fall to be implemented by the industry itself and it is too early at this stage to assess their impact.  The recommendations are supported by my Department through assistance for breeding and management, processing facilities, mechanical grading and quality assurance.  Sheep farmers are major beneficiaries of various schemes being operated by the Department such as REPS.I believe that all these measures, combined with our high levels of food safety standards, will contribute to underpinning the viability of the meat sector and best position it to maintain and improve its competitiveness on EU and international markets.

Arrangements for dealing with animal diseases continue to be kept under review and the contingency arrangements and the legislative basis for dealing with possible outbreaks of exotic disease are updated where required.  For the most part, EU legislation provides the framework for dealing with such diseases.Close monitoring for possible new crop and forest pests resulting from climate change is carried out by plant health control officers.  The existing EU phytosanitary regime which covers all of Europe provides an adequate framework for dealing with potential threats.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	353	There are significant financial supports in place to encourage producers to convert to and remain in organic production.  The new Organic Farming Scheme was launched in August 2007 as part of the new Rural Development Programme, which will run from 2007 to 2013.  The objective of this Scheme is to deliver enhanced environmental and animal welfare benefits and to encourage producers to respond to the market demand for organically produced food.  Payment rates have increased by approximately 17% compared to comparative rates under the Supplementary Measure in the Rural Environment Protection Scheme (REPS).  Under the new Organic Farming Scheme, it is now possible for organic farmers to obtain organic support payments without having to be in the REPS Scheme as was previously the case.  This is designed to encourage small-scale horticultural producers to convert to organic production and conventional tillage producers to convert part or even all of their holdings.  Both of these areas are very much in deficit production-wise and there is a readymade market for the organic product.  Organic producers will still, of course, be able to join REPS as well, and I would encourage them to do so.As a further incentive to encourage non-REPS farmers solely involved in tillage production to convert to organic farming, there is an additional payment of €240 per hectare available in the in-conversion period, up to a maximum of 40 hectares, provided they grow green cover crops during that period.My Department also offers significant development grants both to farmers and to processors under the Schemes of Grant Aid for the Development of the Organic Sector.  Grant aid is available for investments by farmers and processors in equipment and facilities.  The Schemes provide grant aid of 40% of the cost up to a maximum grant of €60,000 in the case of on-farm investments and €500,000 for investments off-farm.  I am pleased to note that applicants are showing significant interest in these Schemes.Other initiatives include the recent appointment by Teagasc of three additional specialist organic advisor posts, an enhanced demonstration programme and the extension of agronomist expertise to include the pig and poultry sectors this year.We will continue to raise awareness among consumers about the benefits of organic food and the third National Organic Week took place recently with that specific purpose in mind.It is clear that all stakeholders will have to play a proactive role to enable the challenging target of 5% of agricultural land under organic production by 2012 to be realised.  To this end I have asked for and received submissions from the organic farming bodies with their proposals for the development of the sector.  I have also asked the National Steering Group for the Organic Sector and its two sub-groups, the Partnership Expert Working Group and the Organic Marketing and Development Group, to give me their considered views on the best ways to move towards the Programme for Government target.My Department also recently arranged two training seminars for REPS Planners who wished to expand their expertise to include the preparation of organic conversion plans.  Officials from my own Department, as well as staff from the Organic Certification Bodies conducted these courses.  Almost 50 planners attended these courses and hopefully the knowledge and detail imparted will help these planners identify potential clients for future conversion to organic production methods.

The disability criteria for these concessions are set out in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994. To get a Primary Medical Certificate, an applicant must be permanently and severely disabled within the terms of these Regulations.As the Deputy will be aware, there was an interdepartmental review of the Scheme. However, given the scale and the scope of the scheme, any possible changes can only be made after careful consideration and with regard to the existing and prospective cost of the scheme and the available resources.  In this context, I consider any possible changes within the framework of the annual Budgetary process.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	380	The Finance Act 2007 introduced a new scheme to allow the operation of DIRT free savings accounts. To qualify, there are two conditions: be aged 65 years of age or over and total income must not exceed the relevant exemption threshold, i.e. €19,000 (for an individual) or €38,000 (for a married couple).  I have no plans to introduce a similar exemption for any other category of taxpayer.  Information is not available that would provide an estimate of the cost of introducing such an exemption.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	381	I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the most recent year for which complete information on the cost of rent relief to the Exchequer is available is for the income tax year 2004. Using that data, the full year cost to the Exchequer of rent relief for those aged under 55 years is projected at €67 million in 2007 terms. On this basis, a doubling of the allowance could cost in the region of an additional €67 million but could be less, depending on the extent to which the additional tax relief could be absorbed by claimants and assuming no significant increase in the level of take up by taxpayers.All income tax provisions are reviewed regularly, particularly in the context of the annual Budget. The Budget is less than a month away. It has been the practice of successive Ministers for Finance not to comment on tax changes in the run up to the annual Budget and I do not propose to depart from that approach.

I am informed by the Commissioners that based on the information available to them on the current proposals for the payment of such aid the payments will be subject to income tax.As regards Budget 2008, it is a long-standing practice of the Minister for Finance not to comment in advance of the Budget on any tax or expenditure matters that might be the subject of Budget decisions.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	385	I assume that the Deputy has in mind the re-introduction of roll-over relief.It was announced in the 2003 Budget that no roll-over relief would be allowed for any purpose on gains arising from disposals on or after 4 December 2002.  This relief was introduced when CGT rates were much higher than current levels.  The abolition of this relief was in accordance with the overall taxation policy of widening the tax base in order to keep direct tax rates low.Changes to the tax system are considered in the context of the annual Budget and Finance Bill cycle.As the Deputy will be aware, there is already in place a generous package of reliefs that continue to be available exclusively to the farming sector.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	386	I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No. 1383/2003, controls on the movement of counterfeit goods apply at the point of importation into the European Communities.  Revenue has responsibility for enforcing this legislation where counterfeit goods are imported into Ireland from outside the EC.  The legislation works on the basis that Rights Holders seeking protection for their goods apply to Revenue. (Currently, there are 297 such requests).  When suspect goods are identified at importation, the Right Holder is contacted in order to verify the validity of the goods.  If the goods are found to be counterfeit, they are liable to seizure and the persons involved are liable to prosecution.  Revenue has appointed a specific coordinator in relation to intellectual property rights (IPR) to bring greater focus to these issues and to enhance liaison with traders.Revenue Customs officials engaged in controlling goods at points of entry (ports, airports and mail centres) have primary responsibility in ensuring enforcement of legislation relating to a wide range of prohibited goods including counterfeit goods.  In addition, where illegally imported counterfeit goods, or counterfeit goods on which the appropriate excise duties have not been paid, are detected elsewhere within the jurisdiction, they are liable to seizure.The precise number of staff engaged in this activity will vary from time to time having regard to different risk priorities and the resources available, but generally in excess of 300 officers are involved in the enforcement of such controls, as part of their regular duties.There have been 191 seizures of counterfeit goods by Customs officials so far this year (to end September) involving 24,550 items with a value of €983,980.It should be noted that matters relating to the sale of counterfeit goods (other than excisable goods) which are not illegally imported into the EC is primarily a matter for An Garda Síochána.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	389	While there is no specific provision in Irish statute law which makes forced marriage an offence, there are a number of measures which aim to ensure that marriage is entered into voluntarily and with full knowledge and consent.The statutory provisions governing notice of intention to marry, solemnisation and registration of marriage are contained in the Civil Registration Act 2004.  Section 2(2) of the Act provides that there is an impediment to a marriage if one, or both of the parties is already married; or if one or both of the parties is under 18 years of age, unless an exemption from the age requirement has been granted by the Circuit or High Court under Section 33 of the Family Law Act 1995.  Section 47 of the Civil Registration Act provides that such an exemption may only be granted by a court if the applicants show that it is justified by serious reasons and is in their interests.  A marriage would be void if the parties are within the prohibited degrees of relationship (i.e. if they are closely related by blood or marriage).Section 46 of the Civil Registration Act requires parties to an intended marriage to attend at a registrar's office to give three months notice of intention to marry and to make a written declaration that there is no impediment to the marriage.  This provision also gives the registrar authority to request evidence as to the names, addresses, marital status, age and nationality of the parties to an intended marriage.  Notices of intention to marry may be published and are available for inspection at the registrar's office.Section 48 of the Civil Registration Act provides for the issue of a Marriage Registration Form (MRF), without which no marriage may be legally solemnised.  An MRF will only be issued if the registrar is satisfied that all of the statutory requirements for a valid marriage have been met.  In addition, a marriage may not be solemnised unless one of the parties to the marriage gives the MRF to the person solemnising the marriage for examination by him or her, prior to the marriage.Section 51 of the Act governs the manner in which a marriage shall be solemnised.  A marriage may only be solemnised by a registered solemniser.  A solemniser shall not solemnise a marriage unless both parties are present, two witnesses over 18 years of age are present, the place where the marriage is solemnised is open to the public and he or she is satisfied that the parties to the marriage understand the nature of the marriage ceremony and the declarations that must be made as part of the ceremony.  These declarations are to the effect that (a) there is no impediment to the marriage and (b) they accept each other as husband and wife.  This section also makes provision for interpretation where the solemniser, the parties to the marriage, or the witnesses do not have a sufficient knowledge of the language of the ceremony.Section 53 of the Act provides for the establishment and maintenance of a register of solemnisers, which is open to inspection by members of the public.  Religious bodies may apply to the Registrar General to have members registered in the register of solemnisers.  In order to be registered, a person must be nominated by a religious body whose form of ceremony includes the required declarations referred to above.  Section 55 provides for the cancellation of a registration in certain circumstances.Section 58 of the Civil Registration Act provides for the making of objections to a marriage prior to solemnisation.Offences in relation to the solemnisation of marriage are set out in Section 69(10) of the Civil Registration Act.  An offence is committed if: a registered solemniser solemnises a marriage other than in accordance with the requirements of Section 51; a person who is not a registered solemniser solemnises a marriage; the solemniser fails to examine the MRF prior to the ceremony; a solemniser or a party to a marriage engage in a marriage ceremony where the notice required under Section 46 was not given; a party to a marriage makes a false declaration that there is no impediment to the marriage.A person guilty of an offence under Section 69(10) shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding €2,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months, or both.By its very nature, a forced marriage is going to involve some form of coercion, threat, intimidation, physical assault or restraint, abduction or unlawful detention. These matters fall to be dealt with under the criminal law.There is a well established legal principle in common law that a full, free and informed consent is essential for a valid marriage.  Full, free and informed consent would not be present in cases of insanity or unsoundness of mind, intoxication, mistake, misrepresentation, fear, duress, intimidation or undue influence.In view of the above, I am satisfied that all reasonable measures are in place to prevent forced marriages and to provide a remedy where full, free and informed consent is absent.

#JimmyDevinsFF	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-party	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-dob	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	391	I propose to take Questions Nos. 132 and 213 together.The Report of the Expert Group on Mental Health Policy, "A Vision for Change" was launched in  January 2006 and has been accepted by Government as the basis for the future development of mental health services.  This policy envisions an active, flexible and community-based mental health service where the need for hospital admission will be greatly reduced.  It will require substantial funding, but there is considerable equity in buildings and lands within the current mental health system, which could be realised to fund this plan.  "A Vision for Change" recommends that steps be taken to bring about the closure of all psychiatric hospitals and to re-invest the resources released by these closures in the mental health service.The closure of mental hospitals and the reinvestment of the proceeds will take place on a phased basis.  Hospitals can only close when the clinical needs of the remaining patients have been addressed in more appropriate settings such as additional community residences, day hospitals and day centres together with a substantial increase in the number of well trained, fully staffed, community-based multi-disciplinary Community Mental Health Teams as is recommended in a "A Vision for Change".The assessment and realisation of the full economic value of psychiatric hospital buildings and lands is the responsibility of the HSE.
#JimmyDevinsFF	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-party	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-dob	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	392	I propose to take Questions Nos. 133 and 209 together.In February 2003 the Department of Health and Children established a Project Team to progress the redevelopment of the Central Mental Hospital.  The Project Team, which comprised key stakeholders, including representatives from the Central Mental Hospital,  the then health boards, the Irish Prison Service and the Department of Health and Children, recommended that the hospital be relocated to a new purpose built facility in the greater Dublin area, with ready access to the M50.In February 2004, the Government decided that the Ministers for Health and Children and Justice, Equality and Law Reform should consult on the future of the CMH in the context of the plans to replace Mountjoy Prison.  In November 2004 the Government decided that in principle, and subject to further study, the CMH should be transferred to the same site as the proposed new prison.  It later agreed the purchase of Thornton Hall for the provision of the prison.In May 2006, the Government formally approved the development of a new national forensic mental health facility at Thornton Hall, County Dublin and that the cost of developing the new facility would be met from the proceeds of the sale of the existing site in Dundrum.  This decision was consistent with a recommendation contained in "A Vision for Change" — the report of the expert Group on Mental Health Policy which recommended that the CMH should be replaced or remodelled to allow it to provide care and treatment in a modern, up-to-date humane setting and that the capacity of the CMH should be maximised.The redevelopment of the CMH will constitute a separate capital development project independent of the prison complex to replace Mountjoy Prison, and will be owned and managed by the Health Service Executive (HSE).  The new hospital will be built on its own campus and will retain its identity as a distinct, separate, therapeutic health facility.  The new hospital will also have its own grounds with a separate entrance and address to the prison complex.

Following the assessment of the application, a recommendation will be made by the Programme Appraisal Committee (PAC), prior to a decision being made by the Secretary General of the Department of Health and Children.As the Deputy will be aware the NCIP came into effect from 1 January 2006, with an allocation of €357 million for capital projects during the 5 year period of 2006-2010.  This funding is allocated for each year subject to the rules governing capital expenditure and the multi-annual investment framework, which are also conditions of the sanction given by the Department of Finance each year for capital expenditure including the NCIP.  Due to the success of the scheme to date, the existing capital commitments under the programme has reached the approved ceiling of €132 million for this year and it is not possible for this Office to enter into further capital commitments under the NCIP before January 2008 when the ceiling will adjust.  However, should the application in question be assessed by Pobal and recommended by the PAC before the end of this year, it will be submitted for consideration and approval by the Secretary General of the Department of Health and Children at the earliest opportunity in January 2008.To date no application for staffing assistance has been submitted by this Group.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	398	At present, medical cards are granted primarily on the basis of means and individual circumstances.  Under the Health Act, 2004, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive.  Persons aged seventy years and over are automatically entitled to a medical card, irrespective of means.  The HSE has discretion, in cases of exceptional need, to provide assistance to individuals where undue hardship would otherwise be caused.Medical cards are made available to persons and their dependants who would otherwise experience undue hardship in meeting the cost of General Practitioner (GP) services.  In 2005 the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who do not qualify for a medical card would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.Since the beginning of 2005 substantial changes have been made to the way in which people's eligibility for a medical card is assessed and these apply equally to the assessment process for a GP visit card.  The income guidelines have been increased by a cumulative 29% and in addition allowance is now made for reasonable expenses incurred in respect of mortgage/rent, childcare and travel to work costs.  In June 2006 I agreed with the Health Service Executive a further adjustment to the assessment guidelines for GP visit cards and these are now 50% higher than those in respect of medical cards.  For medical card and GP Visit Card applications, the HSE now considers an applicant's income after tax and PRSI are deducted, rather than total income.  Allowances are also made for expenses on childcare, rent and mortgage costs and the cost of travel to work.Currently, my Department is preparing legislation to clarify and update existing  legislation on eligibility for health and personal social services.  The Bill will define specific health and personal services more clearly; define who should be eligible for what services; set out clear criteria for eligibility; establish when and in what circumstances charges may be made and provide for an appeals framework.  My Department is currently examining the range of services that will be defined in legislation.  It is expected that the legislation will be published in 2008.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	400	I have previously outlined in detail to the Oireachtas the legal provisions under competition law which prevent the HSE from negotiating with the Irish Pharmaceutical Union (IPU) on fees, prices or margins for their members.  When it became clear that the HSE could not negotiate with pharmacists or wholesalers on fees or margins, a detailed, fair and transparent consultation process, including independent economic analysis and public consultation, was carried out to inform the final determination of the new reimbursement pricing arrangements for drugs and medicines under the GMS and community drugs schemes.  These new arrangements were announced by the HSE on 17 September 2007.In regard to the new reimbursement prices, the main wholesaler companies have confirmed to the HSE they will charge community pharmacists the same price for these drugs and medicines as pharmacists will be reimbursed by the HSE for these products.  The HSE has been provided with no evidence to indicate that the impact on individual pharmacies will be detrimental, having regard to the totality of fees and mark-ups under the GMS and community drugs schemes.All the evidence available to the joint HSE/Department of Health and Children team dealing with this issue indicated that the State was paying a premium for this service and that the new arrangements will save the HSE about €100 million in 2008.To address concerns expressed by the IPU, on behalf of community pharmacists, about the implications of the legal advice on competition law on their right to negotiate fees through the Union, a process of dialogue was established, chaired by Bill Shipsey SC, to explore ways in which concerns raised by the IPU about the implications of this legal advice might be addressed.Despite suspension of this process during the recent withdrawal by individual pharmacists of methadone services, there is now renewed engagement between the Irish Pharmaceutical Union and the HSE under the auspices of Mr. Shipsey.

This ensures that the privacy and the rights of applicants are maintained in a scheme where not divulging information to third parties is at the core of their processes.The HSE have informed me that they will endeavour to provide public representatives with as much individual information where possible within the requirements of the Data Protection Legislation.

There are a variety of reasons for applications being rejected and these include instances where the relevant person died prior to 9 December 1998, where the relevant person resided in an institution not within the scope of the scheme and where duplicate applications were received on behalf of the relevant person.The Scheme Administrator and the HSE are confident that all claims submitted by eligible applicants by 31 December 2007 will be processed within the 2 year time frame allotted for the Scheme which is due to end on 30 June 2008.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	405	Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) has the responsibility to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.  This includes responsibility for arranging for the provision of general practitioner services to persons covered by the General Medical Services (GMS) Scheme and persons who qualify for a GP visit card.  The award of contracts for these services is normally through open competition and interview, following advertisements in national and medical newspapers. All suitably qualified medical practitioners may apply for these contracts.Under the terms of further agreements reached in the context of the extension of medical card coverage to all persons aged 70 and over, and the introduction of the GP visit card, arrangements were made permitting GPs who at that time did not hold a GMS contract to obtain a contract in respect of providing a service to such patients, with an option to become eligible for a full GMS contract in due course.At present the HSE is required, under the terms of the agreement negotiated with the Irish Medical Organisation (IMO), when deciding to fill a vacant GP patient panel or to create a new patient panel, to take account of the potential viability of such a panel under a range of headings.I regard the existing arrangements in this regard as unnecessarily restrictive and it is my wish, therefore, that new contractual arrangements, which are to be developed for the provision of publicly funded general practitioner services, should ensure that HSE contracts for GP services are open to all suitably qualified and equipped providers.

This requirement falls within the remit of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.In making arrangements for the provision of publicly funded General Practitioner (GP) services, under the General Medical Services (GMS) Scheme, an agreement was negotiated between the Department of Health and Children and the GP representative body, the Irish Medical Organisation (IMO). The provisions of this agreement took the form of the current GMS GP Capitation Contract. This contract is a diagnosis and treatment contract and gives effect to the statutory requirement to provide GP medical and surgical services without charge to eligible persons; this includes persons aged 70 and over, who are automatically entitled to a medical card.The contract stipulates that the fees paid to GMS GPs are not made in respect  of certain certificates which may be required, for example, "under the Social Welfare Acts or for the purposes of insurance or assurance policies or for the issue of driving licences". As these non-treatment type services are outside the scope of the GMS GP contract, the question of a fee is a matter between the GP and the person seeking the particular service.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	421	Under the 1970 Health Act, the Health Service Executive may arrange for the supply, without charge, of drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances to people with a specified condition, for the treatment of that condition, through the Long Term Illness Scheme (LTI).  The LTI does not cover GP fees or hospital co-payments. The conditions are: mental handicap, mental illness (for people under 16 only), phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, haemophilia, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophies, parkinsonism, conditions arising from thalidomide and acute leukaemia.  There are currently no plans to extend the list of eligible conditions.Products which are necessary for the management of the specified illness are available to LTI patients.  Other products are available according to the patient's eligibility.People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card.  In the assessment process, the Health Service Executive can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.   Those who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card, which covers the cost of general practice consultations.Non-medical card holders and people whose illness is not covered by the LTI can use the Drug Payment Scheme, which protects against excessive medicines costs.  Under this scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than €85 per calendar month, or approximately  €20 per week, towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.  The scheme is easy to use and significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.In addition, the Deputy will be aware that non-reimbursed medical expenses above a set threshold may be offset against tax.

It provides a framework for action to develop a modern, high quality mental health service over a 7 to 10 year period.  "A Vision for Change" acknowledges gaps in the current provision of services for people with eating disorders and makes several recommendations for the further improvement of these services.Recommendations include support for health promotion initiatives that encourage greater community and family awareness of eating disorders, training on eating disorders for undergraduate and postgraduate training of health professionals, the further development of primary and community care services including the management of eating disorders in children and adolescents by the child and adolescent community mental health teams, the creation of specialist multi-disciplinary adult teams and the provision of a full multi-disciplinary team in a National Centre for Eating Disorders for complex cases that cannot be managed by local child and adolescent community mental health teams.  Responsibility for the implementation of these recommendations rests with the HSE.In 2006, €26.2 million was allocated for the development of mental health services in line with "A Vision for Change".  An additional €25 million has been provided to the HSE in 2007,  €750,000 of which is for developing services for eating disorders. €500,000 of this funding was provided to enhance the service in the Elm Mount Unit, St. Vincent's Hospital, Dublin which will provide a national service to support local services in addressing eating disorders.

I fully support the appointment by the Health Service Executive (HSE) of Prof. Tom Keane as Interim National Cancer Control Director.  The delivery of cancer services on a programmatic basis will serve to ensure equity of access to services and equality of patient outcome irrespective of geography.  The decisions of the HSE in relation to four managed cancer control networks and eight cancer centres will be implemented on a managed and phased basis.  The HSE plans to have completed 50% of the transition of services to the cancer centres by end 2008 and 80-90% by end 2009.The HSE has designated University College Hospital Galway (UCHG) and Limerick Regional Hospital as the two cancer centres in the Managed Cancer Control Network for the HSE Western Region which includes Mayo.  The designation of cancer centres aims to ensure that patients receive the highest quality care while at the same time allowing local access to services, where appropriate.  Where diagnosis and treatment planning is directed and managed by multidisciplinary teams based at the cancer centres, then much of the treatment (other than surgery) can be delivered in local hospitals, such as Mayo General Hospital.I have met with the person referred to by the Deputy on a number of occasions but none of our discussions have related specifically to oncology services at Mayo General Hospital.

This list is reviewed and amended monthly, as new products become available and deletions are notified.For an item to be reimbursed, it must comply with published criteria, including authorisation status as appropriate, price and, in certain cases, the intended use of the product.  In addition, the product should ordinarily be supplied to the public only by medical prescription and should not be advertised or promoted to the public.  Products are considered for reimbursement on application by a supplier.  Only drugs and medicines which are licensed for dispensing in a community pharmacy, on foot of a doctor's prescription, would qualify for reimbursement under the scheme.  As the cervical cancer vaccine would require a clinical administration, it would not meet the criteria for reimbursement.The most effective strategy for the prevention of cervical cancer requires decisions based on an assessment of the relative contributions of Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) vaccination and cervical screening in reducing the burden of both existing and projected cervical pre-cancerous changes and cervical cancer.  Issues to be examined include the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of the vaccine for different age groups and for differing levels of screening provision and uptake.As is being done in other jurisdictions, Ireland is now considering the potential role of HPV vaccination in addressing the problem of cervical cancer prevention.  The National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) has recently undertaken a scientific assessment of the public health value of HPV following a request from my Department.  NIAC and the National Cancer Screening Service (NCSS) agreed that this work needed to be complemented by a study of the cost effectiveness of the vaccine in the current Irish context.  Accordingly, both organisations requested that the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) undertake this study.One of the key functions of the Authority is the assessment of health technology, drugs and health promotion activities.  When I have received the policy advice from HIQA and NCSS I will make the necessary decisions that arise from the advice.  A quality assured population based cervical screening programme aims to reduce cervical cancer in Ireland by approximately 80%.  The NCSS has confirmed that it will have such a programme in place from January next year.  A national cervical screening programme will still be required regardless of a decision on a HPV vaccination programme.

However, the Health Protection Surveillance Centre of the HSE collects data on MRSA.  The data is collected on the first episode of blood stream infection of MRSA per patient per quarter.  This system shows that there were 445 cases in 2002, 480 cases in 2003, 553 cases in 2004, 592 cases on 2005 and 588 in 2006.  Figures for the first six months of 2007 show that there were 292 cases.A National Surveillance System recently has been established to collect data and provide information on a quarterly basis on four key areas, to monitor Healthcare Associated Infections (HCAIs) in our healthcare system: Staphylococcus bacteraemia; Antibiotic consumption; Alcohol gel use; MRSA surveillance in Intensive Care Units.  The first report is expected shortly and eventually 52 hospitals and 30 local health offices will report into the system.Tackling HCAIs, including MRSA is a priority for the government and for the Health Service Executive (HSE).  The HSE has established a National Infection Control Action Plan.  The Infection Control Steering Group is Chaired by Dr. Pat Doorley, National Director (Population Health) and is responsible for reducing infection levels in Ireland's healthcare facilities.  Over the next three to five years, the HSE aims to reduce HCAIs by 20%, MRSA infection by 30% and antibiotic consumption by 20%.  Achievement of these targets will benefit all patients who are at risk.These targets will be achieved through the development of national and local level action plans to reduce the potential for spread of infections between persons in healthcare settings, and, in addition, will focus on reducing antibiotic use in Ireland.  The Steering Group is supported by eight Local Implementation Teams which will ensure that all local facilities are focused on achieving the national targets.The HSE has issued hygiene and infection control standards for all hospitals and has begun initiatives on reducing antibiotic consumption.  In addition, the HSE has appointed a number of new infection control nurses, surveillance scientists and antibiotic pharmacists.  These staff will strengthen specialist support for infection control and facilitate the development of the national surveillance system.Each hospital has been mandated to carry out hand hygiene audits at least annually.  The Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) has completed its first Hygiene Services Assessment Scheme incorporating unannounced hospital hygiene inspections.  Its report is expected shortly.  HIQA is currently working with the HSE to produce national infection control standards.  When these are introduced they will have the status of approved standards under the Health Act 2007 and their implementation will be monitored by HIQA.I have instructed the HSE that designated private beds should be used where isolation facilities are required for patients who contact MRSA.  While accepting that not all HCAIs are preventable, I am satisfied that significant steps are being taken to reduce the rates of infection and to treat them promptly when they occur.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	454	The Department of Health and Children is currently drafting legislation to ratify the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption.  Considerable progress has been made in drafting this legislation and it is expected that the Bill will be published around the end of this year.Once the new legislation has been enacted it will be possible for Irish applicants to adopt from other countries which have ratified the Convention; or from countries with whom Ireland has a bilateral agreement based on Hague principles. Adoptions from some countries are likely to cease as a result. This situation has been anticipated and it has been agreed by my Office and the Adoption Board that bilateral agreements will be actively pursued with a number of countries.In negotiating agreements, priority is being given to those countries with which Ireland has an existing bilateral agreement, or administrative arrangements in place which reflect the ethos and standards of the Hague Convention and from which Irish applicants have a recent history of adopting.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	455	Adoption in Ireland is regulated by the Adoption Board, which is an independent, statutory body. The Board must make decisions regarding adoptions in line with its assessment of the situation in each country, and its responsibility to ensure that all activities are undertaken with the best interests of the child as a paramount consideration.The Adoption Board has discontinued the issuing of declarations of eligibility and suitability in respect of the adoption of children from Guatemala. There are a number of documents already in the public domain regarding concerns over the trafficking of children from Guatemala. These reports cover a long period of time in which the issue of trafficking and sale of children in the context of international adoption has continued to be raised.I should point out that a number of other countries entered reservations regarding Guatemala's accession to the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption. These countries include Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom. These reservations date from 2003 and remain extant. This means that these countries do not accept that procedures in Guatemala reach Hague Standards regarding intercountry adoption, and therefore, have objected to or suspended acceptance of Guatemala's accession to the Convention and will not treat them as party to the Convention. This effectively means that these countries have a ban on adoptions from Guatemala.In light of the long-standing and continuing international concern with regard to adoption practices in Guatemala, which have shown little sign of improvement, despite international comment and support, over the last ten years, I am of the view that the position taken by the Adoption Board is reasonable and measured. I have been assured by the Adoption Board that it is satisfied with regard to the validity of adoptions of Guatemalan children to date.The Adoption Board is also currently examining the adoption laws of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia and the Republic of Rwanda to determine if they meet the requirements for recognition in Ireland. This examination was undertaken as part of the preparations to ratify the Hague Convention, and it has highlighted a number of important legal issues which require further investigation.  In the circumstances, and in order to protect the adoption process, the Adoption Board has decided, as a precautionary measure, to suspend the granting of Declarations of Eligibility and Suitability in respect of these two countries until the investigations are complete.  Following the receipt of legal advice, the Adoption Board has been able to assure parents who have previously adopted from Ethiopia, and whose adoptions are already entered in the Register of Foreign Adoptions, that these adoptions are valid and secure.  I have been assured by the Board that this issue is being dealt with as a matter of priority. I feel that the Board's decision is an appropriate one in the circumstances.

#MarieHoctorFF	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-party	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-dob	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	457	I presume the Deputy is referring to the new Nursing Home Support Scheme, A Fair Deal, which was announced by the Minister on 11 December 2006.The proposed new scheme aims to remedy the inequities that exist in the current system.  At present, people face greatly different costs depending on whether they are in public or private nursing homes. In addition, individual contributions in public places are based on a flat rate regardless of an individual's wealth, whereas State support for individuals in private places is based on means-testing. This means that many people in private nursing homes get no support, and even with subvention, people can face costs they cannot afford.  The result is that some people are forced to sell or mortgage their homes to pay for care costs.In contrast, the new Nursing Home Support Scheme will ensure that long-term residential care is affordable for all who need it. Contributions during a person's life will be affordable and they will not have to sell or mortgage their house to meet the contribution. Furthermore, a person's family will not have to contribute towards the cost of their care.Under the new Nursing Home Support Scheme, people who require long-term residential care will contribute up to 80% of their assessable income, whether for public or private nursing home care. Depending on the amount of a person's assessable income, there will also be a contribution of up to 5% of a person's assets.The portion of the contribution relating to assets, such as a person's house, may be deferred. This means that it does not have to be met during the person's lifetime and can be payable on settlement of the person's estate instead. The deferred contribution will be based on the actual number of weeks spent in residential care and on the cost of care and, consequently, may be less than 5% per annum. I would take this opportunity to emphasise that no one will pay more than the cost of their care.In addition, where the deferred contribution applies to the principal private residence, it will be capped at a maximum of 15%, or 7.5% in the case of one spouse remaining in the home while the other enters long-term residential care. This means that after three years in care, a person will not be liable for any further deferred charge on the principal residence. It also means that 85% of the value of the principal residence will be maintained for the beneficiaries of the person's estate. This is not something that can be guaranteed at the moment.A person or his/her family can also choose to pay the charge at the time when care is being received instead of allowing it to be levied upon the estate if they so wish.  Where a spouse or certain dependants are living in the principal residence, the charge can be further deferred until after the death of that spouse or dependant, or until such time as a person previously qualifying as a dependant ceases to qualify as such.The Department is currently preparing a Bill for the new Nursing Home Support Scheme. It is intended to publish the Bill for the scheme in November, and to have the legislation in place by 1 January 2008.

The National Development Plan 2007-2013 — Transforming Ireland, commits some Euro 90 million to the Rural Transport Programme over its full term.Some Euro 9 million is being provided for the RTP in 2007 which it is envisaged will lead to an increase in the frequency of existing services, extended coverage, and additional groups of customers accessing rural transport.

Taking into account the different starting points and traditions the European Council invites Member States to set their own national targets of comparable ambition within their spheres of competence by 2008."Prior to the Taoiseach's departure for the Spring European Council, the Government agreed that I should lead the cross-Departmental and agency drive, and put in place a mechanism under the Secretary General of my Department, to drive this agenda at national level.Before setting a definitive target, I intend to consult with other Departments and Agencies on the extent of administrative burdens and on measures that have been undertaken or are planned to reduce that burden.As part of the effort at national level, earlier this year, I established the High-level Group on Business Regulation, under the chairmanship of the Secretary General of my Department. The High-level Group comprises representatives of Government Departments and Agencies, the business sector and a representative of ICTU. The members are:Sean Gorman (Chairman)Secretary GeneralDepartment of Enterprise, Trade and EmploymentLiam BerneyUnion Services OfficerIrish Congress of Trade UnionsPatricia CallanDirector, SFASmall Firms AssociationMarie DalyHead of Legal and Regulatory AffairsIrish Business and Employers’ ConfederationPat DelaneyDirector of Business SectorsIrish Business and Employers’ ConfederationGearoid DoyleFounderKinsale CapitalPat FarrellChief Executive OfficerIrish Bankers’ FederationMark FieldingChief Executive OfficerIrish Small and Medium EnterprisesLiam IrwinDeputy Secretary, Strategic Planning DivisionRevenue CommissionersPhilip KellyAssistant SecretaryDepartment of the TaoiseachIrene Lynch FannonProfessor of LawFaculty and Department of Law, UCCSteve MacFeelyDirector, Business StatisticsCentral Statistics OfficeJohn O’ConnellAssistant SecretaryDepartment of FinanceTom O’MahonyAssistant SecretaryDepartment of the Environment and Local GovernmentBreda PowerAssistant SecretaryDepartment of Enterprise, Trade and EmploymentThe High-level Group has decided to focus initially on ways to reduce, simplify and eliminate unnecessary administrative burdens and associated costs in five priority areas and will capture the savings arising from their work on a case by case basis. The five priority areas are:Taxation,Statistical ReportingEnvironmental RegulationsHealth and Safety Regulations, andCompany and Employment Law.The five priority areas are those identified in the report of the Business Regulation Forum (BRF), published in April 2007. The approach being taken is in line with the BRF's recommendation that "given the resource implications associated with undertaking a full baseline measurement exercise, a prioritised and selective approach is the most realistic way forward for Ireland".The High Level Group has met twice so far in 2007, on the 26th of July and the 2nd of October.I expect the Group to submit an initial report to me by July 2008.

CE helps unemployed people to re-enter the open labour market by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to a work routine and to assist them to enhance/develop both their technical and personal skills.The upper age limit for CE participants is 65 years.With effect from 10 November 2004 those aged 55 years of age and over are eligible to participate on CE for a maximum period of 6 years, based on participation since 3rd April 2000.   In June 2006 the participation limit for people with a disability was increased by 1 year.

While I may give general policy directives to the development agencies, I am precluded under the Industrial Development Acts from giving directives regarding individual industrial undertakings, or from giving preference to one area over others.Through its range of overseas offices, IDA Ireland is actively promoting Co. Wexford for new and expansion investments.  In line with the National Spatial Strategy, the Agency is concentrating its resources on the hub town of Wexford, as the location with the greatest potential to develop first class facilities for attracting overseas industry.  At present in County Wexford, there are over 1,900 people working in 11 IDA supported companies.  The Agency is actively engaged with its existing base of manufacturing companies in the County highlighting the importance of upskilling/reskilling and the need to add high-value activities in order to ensure their development and sustainability for the long-term.Enterprise Ireland is committed to delivering on its regional mandate and continues to support the development of entrepreneurship in the region in collaboration with other State agencies and educational establishments.  In terms of job creation, the Agency's activity is focused on the creation of new jobs through supporting entrepreneurs, setting up new High Potential Start-Up companies, the retention and creation of new jobs in existing companies and in enhancing the innovation capability of Ireland at a national and regional level through support of research in companies and third level institutions.  Enterprise Ireland has 163 client companies in County Wexford, which employ a total of 3,603 people.The Wexford County Enterprise Board (CEB) assists micro enterprises in the county and, during 2006, the Board grant-aided 28 projects resulting in the creation of 36 jobs.I am satisfied that the co-operation between the State agencies, together with the roll out of the National Development Plan 2007-2013, will continue to bear fruit in terms of job creation and investment for the people of Wexford.

People with disabilities are encouraged to apply for training and the appropriate supports are put in place to meet their particular individual needs.  If people with disabilities cannot meet the requirements of mainline vocational training, with training supports, then the individual is referred to Specialist Training Provision contracted by FÁS.  This is done on the basis of an occupational guidance interview with a FÁS Employment Services Officer as Employment Services are the "Gateway" for all FÁS services.As of 1st November 2007, all clients with a disability presenting to FÁS will be registered with Employment Services.  This will enable FÁS to track and support clients with a disability in a more systematic way with the objective of providing better labour market outcomes.  Accordingly they will deal with a named Employment Support Officer/Local Employment Service mediator in all their contacts with FÁS.  Their applications are considered priority for FÁS training courses, access to additional supports under the High Support Process and under FÁS's Technical Employment Support Grants.A working group has been established to oversee the implementation of the recommendations of the Indecon Report.  It relates specifically to services contracted out to specialist training providers by FÁS.  The focus of this working group is on achieving greater efficiencies and value for money in relation to the significant levels of public funding being allocated to such training providers each year.The recommendations in the recently published "Framework for the Training and Employment of People with Mental Health Difficulties", published by the Mental Health Forum, are being considered for implementation.  In this regard FÁS will be giving particular attention to:The introduction of new supports, or the adaptation of existing ones, with a view to further improving training options available to people with disabilities.Introducing bridging programmes to assist the transition between rehabilitative and open vocational training andEnhancing the prospects for the placement of people with disabilities in the open labour market.

The European Council has imposed a new deficit target of 1% to apply from 2009.Ireland's transposition deficits since the first Internal Market Scoreboard was published in November 1997 are set out in the table below.  It is anticipated that Ireland's deficit rating for the December 2007 Scoreboard will be under the 1.5% target.DateDeficit RatingDateDeficit Rating%%Nov 19975.4May 19985.4Nov 19985.8May 19993.9Nov 19994.4May 20004Nov 20003.6May 20013.3Nov 20012.4May 20022.4Nov 20022.6May 20033.5No ScoreboardJuly 20041.2No ScoreboardJuly 20051.6Dec 20051.8July 20062.0Dec 20061.2July 20071.7Dec 2007
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	482	The Internal (or Single) Market is one of the European Union's most significant achievements. It has created jobs and stimulated growth. It has created an agreed set of rules for businesses that now have access to a market of 500 million consumers. It has generated high quality safety standards and has offered consumers (including business consumers) a wider choice of goods and services at lower prices. Despite its achievements, however, it is still not a fully functioning entity.The Commission's Interim Report on the Single Market, entitled A Single Market for Citizens, was presented to the March 2007 European Council. It stressed that the Single Market must be a market for consumers and citizens; for an integrated European economy; for a knowledge society; for a well-regulated Europe; for a sustainable Europe; and for a Europe that must be open to the world.The Commission's Final Report is likely to state that the internal market should focus on issues that affect the everyday lives of consumers and businesses, such as telecommunications, energy and retail financial services. It is likely to refer to the need to support SMEs due to the difficulties that small businesses often experience in negotiating the Single Market. It is also likely to refer to the need for more progress in the area of services, including the transposition of the Services Directive. It is likely to make reference to the social and environmental dimension of internal market policy. In that regard, new approaches are necessary (for example, transition towards a low-carbon economy) if the EU's citizens are to be able to meet the challenges of the future. The Report is also likely to refer to the international dimension of the Single Market, which would make Europe more attractive for foreign investors and allow Europe to take a leading role when global rules and standards are being defined.Ireland has contributed to the Review through our participation in the various European fora at which it was discussed. In addition, my Department asked Forfas to undertake a critical assessment of the Single Market from an Irish perspective. The study addresses where the real barriers are and what is preventing Irish businesses and consumers from exploiting the Single Market to its full potential. The study, which will be available to my Department shortly, will contribute to Ireland's position in the discussions following the publication of the Report.I look forward to the publication of the Commission's Final Report, which is expected to be published later this month. As a trading nation, we can only benefit from a fully functioning Single Market that addresses the remaining areas that need to be tackled and whose rules are applied in a fair, transparent and timely fashion. A fully functioning Single Market will also increase the confidence of citizens, consumers and businesses in the institutions of the EU generally and in its future.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	483	The Government has approved the drafting by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel of the Companies Consolidation and Reform Bill along the lines of the General Scheme prepared by the Company Law Review Group.The General Scheme was designed to provide an appropriate framework for the formation and operation of companies and is framed primarily with private, commercially operating, companies in mind. The underlying philosophy behind the proposals in the General Scheme is to simplify company law for the benefit of business operators and company law practitioners.Recognising the role that company law could play in relation to property management companies, the Company Law Review Group consulted widely on its proposals and gave specific consideration to that aspect. As a result, the General Scheme contains a number of provisions with the express intention of facilitating the use of the company structure by multi-unit developments. For example, the membership limit of 99 which will ordinarily apply to the most common company type, the private company limited by shares, will not apply in the case of a residential management company. Also, the membership of a residential management company will be deemed to transfer from the vendor to the purchaser upon the sale of the underlying property to which the membership relates. These proposals represent very specific carve-outs from the general provisions concerning the standard private company limited by shares.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	484	As indicated by my colleague, Minister McGuinness, in the Dáil debate on 4 October on the Control of Exports Bill, my Department has acted on the non-legislative recommendations of the Forfás review on the export licensing of military and dual-use goods in Ireland.The export licensing function has remained with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, as recommended by the review.  However, much has been done to improve coordination with the other Government Departments and state agencies in particular the Department of Foreign Affairs which is consulted on all licence applications with foreign policy considerations and the Customs authorities of the Revenue Commissioners.  In this regard, an official has been seconded by the Department of Foreign Affairs to a senior managerial role in the Licensing Unit of my Department.It is my intention to transform the Inter Departmental Group established to oversee production of the Report this group into a standing Inter Departmental Committee which will take forward responsibility for coordinating the work of the Departments and agencies in the area of export control.  A priority of the Inter Departmental Group is the establishment of a Technical Advisory Panel to act as a specialist resource for my Department on technical questions related to the licensing process.Acting on the recommendation of the Forfás Review, a project to develop an online export licensing system has been underway for the past year and the system, OELAS, will be released to exporters in the next few weeks.  My Department has developed an outreach to industry programme for export control.  A good working relationship has been established with individual companies and with appropriate umbrella organisations and they are regularly briefed on the latest developments in this sector.  My Department organised the first ever export control seminar for exporters of controlled goods in June 2006 in Farmleigh, at which a Users Guide and Customers Charter to Export Licensing was launched.In conclusion, I would like to reassure the House that I remain committed to implementing the recommendations of the Forfás report.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	485	The Directive on Services in the internal market (Directive 2006/123/EC) is a major piece of internal market legislation. It creates a "single market" for commercial services and is a key provision of the Lisbon Agenda. It provides a framework for service providers to become established in another Member State or to provide services there on a temporary basis. It strengthens the rights of consumers as users of services. It establishes legally binding obligations for administrative co-operation between Member States in connection with the activities of service providers availing of the Single Market outside their own Member State.The Directive has significant implications for the development of the services sector in Ireland. Trade-related services, other business services and recreational services will benefit from the opening up of the European market. Some services sectors will face competition from abroad, which will spur greater innovation and productivity in those sectors. Indeed, much of the benefit of the Directive will result from increased competition in the European services market, which will create new export opportunities for Irish service providers and make services available to Irish consumers (including business consumers) at lower prices. The overall effect will be beneficial for the Irish economy, including its competitiveness.Transposition of the Directive is currently underway in my Department. There will be extensive consultations with stakeholders, including the social partners, over the next twelve months. A Regulatory Impact Assessment is also being prepared on the Directive.  The target date for the transposition of the Directive is 28th December 2009.

In so doing, the Section draws on the Regulatory Impact Analysis Guidelines published by the Department of the Taoiseach in October 2005, which includes guidelines on cost/benefit analysis.  Within my own Department a dedicated toolkit has also been prepared to help Sections to undertake the RIA process.

Ireland expects to complete the necessary transposition process ahead of this deadline by the end of 2007.  The earlier UCITS directives have already been transposed into Irish law.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	494	I propose to take Questions Nos. 262 and 263 together.Community Employment (CE) is an active labour market programme designed to provide eligible long term unemployed people and other disadvantaged persons with an opportunity to engage in useful work within their communities on a fixed term basis. CE helps unemployed people to re-enter the open labour market by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to a work routine and to assist them to enhance/develop both their technical and personal skills.The criteria for participating on the Community Employment programme are based on age and length of time in receipt of various social welfare payments. In general, the Part-time Integration Option is for people of 25 or over who are receiving social welfare payments for 1 year or more, and people of 18 years or over in receipt of disability-related payments. The Part-time Job Option is for people who are 35 or over and in receipt of social welfare payments for 3 years or longer.Certain groups such as travellers and refugees aged 18 or over are eligible for both options. If you qualify under the criteria but do not wish to take up the option yourself, there are certain conditions under which you can do a spousal swap.To cater for older workers in particular, in November 2004 I revised the 3 year CE cap to allow those of 55 years of age and over to avail of a 6-year period on CE (based on participation since 3rd April 2000).  Subsequently, the participation limit for persons eligible for CE based on a Social Welfare disability linked payment was increased by one year.  These measures were introduced in recognition of the fact that older participants and participants with a disability may find it more difficult to progress into the open labour market.

The Employment Equality Acts 1998 and 2004, among other things, protect against discrimination on the ground of age in relation to access to employment.  However, Section 34(4) of the Employment Equality Act 1998 allows an employer to include a specific retirement age in a contract of employment without being in breach of the age-discrimination provisions of the above-mentioned equality legislation.The upper age limit of 66 years for bringing claims under the Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977 to 2007 was removed by the Equality Act 2004.  However, the Unfair Dismissals Acts continue to exclude from their jurisdiction employees who have reached the "normal retiring age" for the particular employment in which they are employed.  The "normal retiring age" in this context tends to be the age at which there has been a custom and practice for employees to retire at in a particular employment.In some employments, a "normal retiring age" will exist for that particular employment only, in order to give flexibility to employers and employees, having due regard to the nature of the work being performed.I should also mention that the upper age limit of 66 for receipt of statutory redundancy payments was removed earlier this year by the Protection of Employment (Exceptional Collective Redundancies and Related Matters) Act 2007.With effect from 1 April, 2004, it is not compulsory for most new entrants to the public service to retire at a particular age if they are fit and willing to remain in employment. The existing retirement conditions, in agreement with the relevant unions, have been retained for existing employees.The recently-published Green Paper on Pensions examines issues surrounding retirement age and work flexibility in the context of developing a framework for future pensions policy.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	508	In the most recent pension coverage statistics, from the Quarter 4 2005 CSO Quarterly National Household Survey, coverage of persons in employment aged 20-29 was 38.9 per cent. This represents an increase of 3.4 percentage points since the previous detailed coverage survey in Quarter 1 2002, and is above the ultimate target level for the age group set out in the National Pensions Policy Initiative in 1998 (35 per cent). However, improving coverage among younger workers is one of the key priorities for pensions policy. This is reinforced by the increasing importance of defined contribution pension arrangements, where early contributions are particularly important in securing an adequate retirement income. Recent research suggests that people without pension coverage in older age categories mainly ‘never got around' to taking out a pension, so establishing a savings habit at an early stage is essential to promote pensions coverage and adequacy. To date, efforts in this area have focussed on promoting pension awareness and take up, with young people being a particular target of initiatives under the National Pensions Awareness Campaign. This promotional work will continue.The Green Paper on Pensions, published on October 17th, puts forward four reform options which are largely focussed on categories with low coverage at present, including younger people. As the House is aware, the Green Paper is now open for consultation and when this process is completed the Government will decide on a framework for long-term pensions policy.

Following a review of entitlement in September 2006 it was found that the income derived from her spouse's earnings from insurable employment was in excess of the statutory limit for entitlement to Disability Allowance and accordingly the claim was stopped from 27 September 2006.She appealed the decision to the Social Welfare Appeals Office. Following an examination of the facts the Appeals Officer disallowed the appeal. In giving his decision on 5 December 2006 the Appeals Officer indicated that the weekly means were derived from spouse's earnings from insurable employment and that a correct means assessment was made in this case.An Appeals Officer's decision is final and conclusive in the absence of new evidence or new facts or any change of circumstances.  My Department has issued a new application that should be completed and returned if this persons circumstances have changed.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	510	Further to my reply of 24 October 2007, there are two basic rates of child benefit; the lower rate which is payable in respect of each of the first two qualifying children, and the higher rate, payable in respect of the third and subsequent qualifying children.A qualified child is one who is under 16 years of age, or aged 16 to 18 and attending full-time education.  In the case of twins, an amount equal to 150% of the appropriate rate, i.e. one and a half times the lower or higher rate as applicable, is paid in respect of each child.  In the extract quoted from my previous reply, the salient terms are ‘qualified' and ‘qualifying', as the basic rate of child benefit payable is determined solely on the basis of the number of eligible, or qualifying, children in the family.  It is not determined on the basis of the place of each individual child within the family.  This is an important distinction where, for instance, there are non-qualifying children such as children over the age of eighteen, or over the age of sixteen and not in full-time education.Accordingly, where twins are involved, rates could vary as follows: (a) As the higher CB rate is payable in respect of a third and subsequent qualified child, 150% of the higher rate is payable for each of a set of twins where they both fall into this category,   (b) A set of twins may constitute the second and third of three qualifying children, e.g. in three-child families or where older children in the family cease to qualify for child benefit.  In this scenario, one would receive 150% of the lower rate, the other 150% of the higher rate.  (c) Where a set of twins are the only qualified children in a family, both receive 150% of the lower CB rate.

An amendment of this requirement was introduced for the self-employed in April 1999 whereby they could qualify for a partial State Pension Contributory if they were aged over 56 on the 6th April 1988, when PRSI for the self-employed was first introduced.As the person concerned first entered insurable self-employment on 6th April 1988 aged 59, he satisfied the conditions to receive the partial State Pension Contributory from 9 April 1999, the date of its introduction. He is also in receipt of an increase for a qualified adult.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	514	The school meals programme operated by my Department gives funding towards provision of food services for disadvantaged school children through two schemes.  The first is the long-standing statutory urban school meals scheme, currently operated by 36 local authorities.  The second is the school meals (local projects) programme through which funding is provided by my Department to participating schools in both urban and rural areas who are running specific school meals projects.The school meals programme has expanded significantly in recent years to include a large number of disadvantaged school children and this trend will continue throughout 2007 and in future years.  The number of meals being provided on a daily basis to disadvantaged children through the school meals local projects scheme doubled from 89,915 in the school year 2005/2006 to 179,660 in the school year 2006/2007.  In 2006, some 1,394 schools with over 145,000 pupils benefited under the scheme and this is expected to increase to 165,000 plus pupils in over 1,800 schools in 2007.As demand on the School Meals Local Projects Scheme has increased dramatically in 2007, and due to budget constraints, a number of schools were informed that their applications for funding under the scheme could not be processed in 2007.However, I have now secured additional funding for the school meals scheme to cater for the continuation of the scheme in 2007.  A number of schools whose applications were refused requested a review of this decision on the basis that they were given verbal agreement that the school was eligible to apply for funding as they are part of the Department of Education & Science's initiative for disadvantaged schools, ‘Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools' (DEIS).  These schools have now had their applications reconsidered and, subject to meeting the normal criteria of the scheme, their applications can be processed in 2007.In relation to further new applications, demand for the scheme remains high and priority will be given to schools which have DEIS status.  However, schools must submit the relevant application form and receive written approval prior to establishing their food clubs.  There is no automatic entitlement to funding under the School Meals Scheme.  Each application will be considered in the context of the overall budget available for the scheme.  I will be requesting additional funding for Budget 2008 to allow the scheme to expand in 2008 to include additional DEIS schools.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	515	I propose to take Questions Nos. 289 and 290 together.In order to qualify for a contributory pension a person must satisfy a range of conditions which include commencing payment of contributions 10 years before pension age, payment of a minimum of 260 contributions at an appropriate rate and reaching a minimum average annual contribution rate of at least 10 contributions paid or credited.  An average of 48 contributions is needed for a full pension.The average contribution test is a key qualifying condition and ensures that those receiving a pension have demonstrated an adequate and ongoing attachment to the social insurance system over their working lives.  A concession in this regard was made to self-employed persons who became compulsorily insured on the 6th April 1988 in that any previous PRSI record they may have can be disregarded, if that is to their advantage, when eligibility for pension is being assessed.The issue of gaps in a person's insurance record impacts on a number of different groups, not just the self-employed, and any changes would therefore have to be looked at in the context of the system as a whole.  These issues are discussed in the Green Paper on Pensions, which I published on the 17th October, and changes to the system will be considered in the context of the framework for long-term pension's policy, which will be developed after the consultation process is completed.Eligibility to contribute to the system of social insurance is based on a person's income and employment status.  There is no legislative basis, and none is planned, under which retrospective contributions, which were not due in the first place, can be accepted.  It is, of course open to those who fail to qualify for a contributory pension, or who qualify for a reduced payment, to apply for the means tested state pension (non-contributory).
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	516	The Government is anxious to ensure that as many people as possible can be accommodated within the social welfare pensions system, with due regard being paid to the contributory principle underlying entitlement to contributory payments and, in the case of non-contributory payments, the need to ensure that resources are directed to those who are most in need.  Over the last 10 years, means tests have been improved and qualifying conditions for contributory payments made easier.As the House is aware, I published the Green Paper on Pensions on 17th October and this includes a full discussion on the social welfare pension position of women who had to resign due to the marriage bar.  In this context, the Green Paper sets out a range of reforms including the use of universal entitlements and back-dating the homemakers scheme.A consultation process on the Green Paper is now underway and will remain open until mid 2008.  The Government will respond to the process by publishing a framework for future pension's policy and I expect that this will happen towards the end of next year. Decisions in relation to those who are not at present receiving support through the social welfare system, including those who had to leave employment on marriage, will be considered in that context.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	517	There are six investigations currently underway in my Department in relation to alleged unauthorised access to and disclosure of personal data.  The investigations relate to the records of eleven individuals, as follows;The Department launched an investigation into possible data protection violations following articles in a national newspaper in April 2007 alleging that private investigators working for insurance companies had access to social welfare records.  When contacted by the Department, the journalist provided the names of five individuals whose personal data is alleged to be on the private investigators' files.The Data Protection Commissioner wrote to the Department in late June 2007 to advise that personal data was discovered on private investigator files during the course of his Office's audit of an insurance company.  He supplied details of two individuals whose personal data was available.In July 2007 The Office of the Data Protection Commissioner referred complaints to the Department from two members of the public who suspected that their personal data had been accessed and passed on to third parties.  Each case is the subject of a separate investigation.Two complaints have recently been received from members of the public who are concerned that their personal data may have been disclosed to third parties.  Each complaint is the subject of a separate investigation.All of these investigations are on-going and some are at an advanced stage.  No sanction has been advised by the Data Protection Commissioner.  The Department has fully co-operated with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner in relation to the issues raised, and welcomes notification of his intention to carry out an audit of the Department's procedures for processing personal data in the near future.No civil proceedings have been initiated against the Department in relation to information security breaches.

While there are, in the more developed rural areas, either hackney or taxi services, these are at the discretion of the providers of these services and do not provide a guaranteed service to rural people.It was against this background, therefore, that earlier this year I introduced a new evening transport service, on a pilot basis, to allow rural people to fully participate in the various activities — community, sporting and social — that take place in their areas.  The new Scheme also aims to address the market failure that currently exists in this area.The 34 groups currently delivering the Rural Transport Programme — operated by the Department of Transport — were invited to submit applications to be considered under my Department's new scheme.  Following the appraisal of the proposals submitted, seven groups were selected to run the pilot Scheme, namely:West Cork Rural Transport;Avondhu Development Group in East Cork;Meath Accessible/Kilnaleck Community Cavan;County Sligo LEADER Partnership;Tumna Shannon Development Company Roscommon;Síob Teoranta Donegal; andLaois Trip.The annual budget for the pilot is €500,000.  The first service commenced in June and service numbers and passenger numbers are expected to continue to increase throughout the remainder of the year.Although still in the early stages, I understand that the services are being very well received by communities and passengers alike.  Early indications are that older people, people with a disability and young people are particularly enthusiastic about the new services and new activities are being planned around the availability of services.  My intention is to review the scheme after it has been in operation for 12 months and to consider its future in the context of the findings of that evaluation.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	524	The EU Reform Treaty was agreed by EU Heads of State and Government at a meeting in Lisbon on 18 and 19 October last.  It will be finally adopted in December and, thereafter, it needs to be ratified by all 27 Member States.The Reform Treaty is a carefully balanced agreement that will allow the Union to meet the challenges of the 21st century and at the same time ensure that the interests of individual Member States, both large and small, are adequately protected.  The new system of double-majority voting, for example, will give proportionate weight to overall population while retaining important influence for the small and medium-sized Member States.  This will be achieved by specifying that a qualified majority would require 55% of the Member States and 65% of the Union's population.  This means that only those measures that genuinely command majority support can be adopted at EU level.In so far as agriculture is concerned, the principle of qualified majority voting is already enshrined in this sector for some time.  Provision is also made in the Reform Treaty for wider use of co-decision procedures in the Agriculture sector.  While there will be some alterations to the thresholds for reaching a qualified majority under the new arrangements, I would point out that these alterations are unlikely to have significant implications for decision making in the agriculture sector given that it is unusual to have close voting margins in this sector.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	525	The Minister for Health & Children has overall responsibility for the general food labelling legislation.  Responsibility for enforcement of labelling legislation rests with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) through its service contracts with my Department, the Sea Fisheries Protection Agency, the Health Services Executive, the Local Authorities and the National Consumer Agency.The particular issue referred to in this question is where a primary product can enter Ireland and processed in some way thereby allowing it to be branded as an Irish product is known as "substantial transformation".  This terminology originates in WTO, Codex and EU legislation governing the EU Customs Code and therefore can only be amended at EU level.  I have been concerned that this arrangement could, in certain circumstances, be used to mislead the consumers as to the origin of the raw materials used in certain products.  I am not satisfied with the current legal position and have raised my concerns at EU Council level.The EU Commission is currently reviewing the whole area of food labelling and in that context my Department contributed to Ireland's submission which was co-ordinated by the Department of Health & Children.  Within this submission Ireland again raised the matter of the unsatisfactory nature of the concept of substantial transformation and the possibility of it being used to disguise the origin of products from the public.  I believe that the concept of substantial transformation needs to be more clearly defined and I will continue to urge the Commission to address this problem.In the meantime my Department has been involved in consultations with the Department of Health and Children on drafting new regulations to require operators in the retail and catering sectors to provide country of origin information on poultrymeat, pigmeat and sheepmeat as is the case with beef.A public consultation on the proposed regulations took place during the past month via the website of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland with the final date for receipt of comments being the 19th October.  These comments will now be examined and the proposed legislation will be reviewed in the light of comments received.  Thereafter the draft legislation will be forwarded to the European Commission. The commencement date for the legislation will depend on the Commission's response and possibly that of other Member States.In the proposed legislation ‘origin' will be defined as the country where the animal was reared and, if different, the country of slaughter.  This will have to be indicated on meat and meat products containing over 70% meat.  Regardless of the nature, extent or location of processing or packaging that has gone into the manufacture of the product the requirement to show actual country of rearing and slaughter of the animal will remain in place and this will not be superseded by any ‘substantial transformation'.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	536	I  am pleased to inform the Deputy that my Department is currently actively engaged in a range of activities aimed at enforcement of the equine identification regulations. This is an incremental process. Officials from my Department have been working closely with the industry in 2007 with a view to achieving compliance with the legislation.Letters have issued from my Department to all of the relevant bodies in the equine sector outlining the requirements regarding the identification of equidae. A series of advertisements were placed in the press to inform the general public of the requirements. Officials from my Department are making direct contact with the owners / managers of major equine venues to remind them of their responsibilities in this regard. In recent weeks Inspectors from my Department have attended at horse sales and carried out checks of animals presented for sale, reminding  people that all equines must be identified before being moved from a holding and that failure to comply with the regulations may result in prosecution.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	538	I am satisfied that the necessary action is being taken to allow the sheep sector to continue to compete on international markets. The 2006 Sheep Industry Development Strategy and its subsequent implementation report provide the framework for an efficient and competitive response to market demands. While most of the recommendations are for the industry itself to address, my Department assists in a number of areas such as sheep breeding, processing facilities and quality assurance. Sheep farmers also benefit from a number of schemes operated by my Department. A new REPS supplementary measure is particularly aimed at sheep farmers. It has an annual budget of €28 million and a projected overall cost of €170 million up to 2013.An Bord Bia will continue to promote Irish lamb on international markets. It organises several strategic marketing campaigns annually. Bord Bia's summer promotions are aimed to highlight the availability and improve awareness of Irish lamb at a time when it is at its optimum quality. In France, our main market, its promotions are run in conjunction with eight major retailers throughout the country covering over 1,200 outlets.Aside from its comprehensive lamb marketing programmes in key European markets, Bord Bia is collaborating with its French and British counterparts to develop a 3 year generic lamb promotion on the French market to promote lamb to younger consumers. This campaign, which amounts to a major new initiative on the European lamb market, is due to commence early in 2008.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	539	Under the 2007 Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, 105,706 potentially eligible claims have been identified.  Payments under the Scheme commenced on 20 September 2007, and so far 96,658 (nearly 92%) of cases have been fully paid a total of €240.2 million.  Payments continue to issue twice weekly, as further cases subsequently become clear.Under EU legislation, Member States may commence payment under the Single Payment Scheme on 1 December of the year of application.  In exceptional circumstances, a Member State may apply to the European Commission to be allowed to make an advance payment on 16th October. Taking account of the exceptionally bad weather conditions throughout Ireland this summer I applied to the European Commission to allow an advance of the Single Farm Payment on 16th October. The European Commission accepted the case I put forward and legislated for a 50% advance payment to eligible applicants clear for payment on 16th October.Advance payments to applicants with clear applications commenced on that date. The position now is that €557.8 million has been paid to over 117,078 applicants (over 92% of total eligible applicants). The remainder are not as yet clear for payment. Delays in processing the unclear cases can be caused by many factors, including incomplete application forms, errors on applications and discrepancies highlighted following computer validation, which include dual claims/over-claims etc. and are generally resolved via correspondence with the applicant.The on-going objective of my Department is to make payments to all of those farmers, who have yet to receive their advance payment as soon as their cases are cleared for payment. In many cases, my Department is still awaiting documentation that will facilitate the processing of applications for payment. A number of payment runs continue to be made each week as cases are cleared.In accordance with EU legislation balancing payments to eligible applicants with clear applications will commence on 1st December.  In so far as administrative procedures are concerned, it is certainly the case that these are less onerous than was the case under the schemes in place prior to the Single Payment. Scheme. Nevertheless I have been keenly aware of the need to minimise the administrative burden on applicants for the Single Payment Scheme and to make the Single Payment application process as straight forward as possible within the constraints of the provisions of EU Legislation. Each year my Department provides applicants for the Single Payment Scheme with pre printed application forms containing the most up to date information available at the time of issue. The pre printed information is taken from the applicant's application for the previous year and takes account of updates to that application during the year. Applicants are requested to carefully check the information provided and made any amendments necessary before returning their application forms.My Department is committed to easing administrative procedures for applicants under the Single  Payment Scheme and undertook a major pilot project for on-line applications in 2007. Farmers may apply directly themselves or via Teagasc or other approved agents. The response was encouraging and in excess of 7,000 applications were received on-line. A major advantage from the applicant's point of view is that the validation procedure in place reduces the number of queries arising in relation to on-line applications compared to paper applications thereby facilitating the processing of such applications for payment. I am anxious that as many applicants as possible will avail of the on-line facility in 2008 and my Department will mount a major promotional and information campaign early in the new year to encourage farmers to submit their 2008 applications on-line. There is no doubt that administrative procedures are eased for those who avail of the on-line application facility and I would urge as many farmers as possible to use it in 2008.At EU level discussions are ongoing in respect of European Commission proposals aimed at simplifying the Single Payment Scheme. Ireland supports elements of the proposals including the reduction of set-aside to zero in 2008 and the abolition of the 10 month retention period for land which if adopted will result in a simplification of administrative procedures for Single Payment Scheme applicants in 2008. My Department has made a number of submissions to the EU Commission suggesting additional alterations, which, if accepted, would further simplify the operation of the Single Payment Scheme for farmers.

Details of these applications are given, by Member State, in the table below.Recently the Council of Ministers adopted a regulation making the restructuring scheme more attractive with a view to reducing the EU sugar quota by a further 3.8m tonnes. The effect that this will have on sugar beet production in individual Member States remains to be seen.Member State(1)

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	542	The area of oilseed rape, which is used to produce liquid biofuel, increased from 5,000 hectares in 2006 to 7,500 hectares in 2007. A further 800 hectares of willow and miscanthus were planted in 2007. The increase in area planted can be attributed to the developing Bioenergy market and the introduction of incentives at farm level to stimulate production of energy crops. The incentives include a new national energy crops payment of €80 per hectare. This will be paid as a top-up to the EU premium available under the EU Energy Crops Scheme, subject to certain conditions. Establishment grants of up to €1,450 per hectare are available under the new Bioenergy Scheme to encourage farmers to plant willow and miscanthus.The future outlook for energy crops depends on a number of factors, not least profitability at farm level. In the short-term, the soaring world demand for grain is likely to lead to an increase in the area devoted to conventional cereal crops in Ireland and elsewhere in response to the current high grain prices. More long-term projections are difficult to forecast at this stage. Much will depend on the rate of development of production and consumption patterns for biofuels over the next number of years.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	543	The Irish beef industry is worth €1.5 billion in foreign earnings to the national economy annually. Ireland produced over half a million tonnes of beef in 2006, with exports reaching a seven-year high of 516,000 tonnes, or 93% of total production. Irish companies are major suppliers across Europe and have gained a top-class portfolio of retail accounts there.  In 2006, Ireland exported 250,000 tonnes to the UK and almost 230,000 tonnes to Continental EU countries, which together represents in excess of 90% of our total beef exports.The Agri-Vision 2015 Action Plan points out that our aim is to consolidate and further develop our position in the EU market. Bord Bia is responsible for the promotion of our beef and I take every opportunity to support them in their efforts in this regard.  In order to publicise the response of the beef industry to an ever-evolving market, Bord Bia is intensifying its efforts to promote beef over the coming months. The aim is to build on the already well-established marketing and promotional activities in place. An extensive promotional campaign commenced in September involving 30 supermarkets across 13 European countries in 10,000 individual outlets. In addition, Bord Bia is currently finalising a new Irish beef marketing strategy. This follows consultation with the industry as to how best use the promotional resources available over the period 2008 to 2013.I have also recently established a Market Access Group to focus efforts on the re-opening of 3rd Country markets for Irish beef and other meats. The recent re-opening of the Saudi Arabian and South African markets are welcome developments in this respect.Another key element in our strategy for developing and sustaining our presence in EU and international beef markets must be the continued emphasis on the quality of our product. The support, both financial and otherwise, I have given to quality assurance schemes is an indication of the importance I place on these as key features of our future marketing strategies. In addition, I have introduced measures to assist the sector in further enhancing the quality of Irish beef.Firstly, I was delighted to recently announce the €250 million Suckler Cow Welfare Scheme. This measure is fully in keeping with the aims outlined in the Agri-Vision 2015 Action Plan. While the measure is primarily aimed at improving animal welfare, it will also contribute to the improved quality and the viability of suckler holdings.Secondly, I announced in April a Capital Investment Aid Scheme for the beef and sheepmeat sector, which will increase added value at processing level and improve efficiencies.  The advances in breed improvement programmes being developed by ICBF will also be of considerable long-term benefit to the industry.  These combined measures will, I am confident, allow us to promote Irish beef successfully in international markets based on all its attributes, including its environmentally sustainable and welfare friendly aspects.

The necessary inspection and control procedures are in place to check on such compliance.In the case of small quantities of poultry slaughtered on farm for direct supply to the final consumer or local retail establishments, there is an exemption from the EU requirements regarding approval and control of slaughtering establishments. The general requirements regarding food safety and hygiene remain, however, applicable to those supplies.

I do not have available to me details of the various systems that apply in each Member State.The annual EU Total Allowable catch and quotas regulation sets out for each Member State the maximum catch which may be taken for certain species in specific areas of the sea. There are three categories of species to which quotas apply. These are:—Whitefish Species;Deep Sea Species; andPelagic SpeciesIn Ireland, representatives from my Department, the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority and Industry meet at least once a month to agree the quotas for whitefish and deep-sea species for the following month.  Industry recommendations on management arrangements are accepted as far as possible.In 2007, I have established particular management arrangements, in agreement with industry, setting catch restrictions for some 10 whitefish species, 4 pelagic species and 8 deep sea species. Of the particular stocks available to Ireland i.e. a particular species in a particular area, there are management arrangements in place for 17 of the 36 whitefish stocks, 11 of the 13 deep sea stocks and 7 of the 8 pelagic stocks.  This would also be typical of previous years.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	546	I remain committed to a balanced outcome to the negotiations. As an open economy dependent on trade Ireland has much to gain from a successful deal. However, I am determined that agriculture must not be sacrificed for the sake of an overall agreement and that, in accordance with the agreed EU negotiating mandate, a new WTO agreement will not necessitate further reform of the CAP.More specifically my priorities are:on Market Access to retain the maximum possible level of protection against increased imports;on Domestic Supports to defend direct payments to farmers from reduction by ensuring that their eligibility for Green Box status is maintained;on Export Subsidies to ensure flexibility in the phasing out arrangements and  to demand full parallel treatment for elimination of all forms of export subsidy;on Non-Trade Concerns, to seek recognition for non-trade issues such as environmental, animal welfare and animal health controls.The Agrivision 2015 Action Plan which I published in March 2006 sets out my vision for a competitive, consumer-focused and knowledge driven agri-food sector which will contribute to a vibrant rural economy, society and environment and which exploits opportunities in non-food areas. In addition to a broad vision statement, the Plan sets out one hundred and sixty six specific actions to be implemented for the development of the sector.  It was drawn up in the light of recent CAP reforms and the likelihood of a more liberalised trade policy under a new WTO agreement.I believe that the Agri-Vision 2015 Action Plan and the €8.7 billion package of agri-food measures in the National Development Plan will facilitate the continued growth of Irish Agri-Food sector and ensure that the sector is competitive on global markets.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	547	The EU Commission is the body legally responsible for monitoring compliance by Member States with fish quota allocations.  Where a Member State has breached a quota allocation for a stock in a particular year, in the normal course the provisions of Council Regulation 847 /96 introducing additional conditions for year to year management of TACs and quotas are applied.  In this regard, where catches of a particular stock are exceeded by a Member State, that amount is deducted from that Member State's quota for the following year.  In addition, the EU Commission may take infringement proceedings against a Member State where it considers that the Member State is not properly managing its quotas and where it is not ensuring that the limits set are being respected.It is the responsibility of each member state to manage its own quotas taking into account their own national circumstances.  In the current environment, where stocks are under pressure and quotas are declining most Member States find the management of quotas to be an increasing challenge.  A number of Member States, including the UK, France and Denmark have introduced schemes to permanently reduce their fishing fleets in order to bring fleets into balance with available quotas in recent times.  A important objective of fleet decommissioning schemes is to increase the quantum of quota available to the remaining vessels in the fleet.I have sought EU approval so that I can introduce a new decommissioning scheme to remove excess capacity from Ireland's whitefish fleet in accordance with the recommendations of the Cawely report "Steering A New Course — Strategy for A Restructured, Sustainable and Profitable Seafood Industry 2007-2013".  I hope to be in a position to launch this scheme in the near future.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	548	In relation to quota allocations, you are no doubt aware that Ireland's shares of the main fish stocks were set in the early 1980's when fish stocks were being shared out between Member States.  The share allocations were  based on catch records and reflect the fishing levels by the Irish fleet at that time.  Since then it has been a priority of successive Ministers with responsibility for the fisheries brief to have these shares improved.  In 1992 and 2002,  the Common Fisheries Policy was reviewed and in both cases substantial efforts were made  to push Ireland's case for increases shares of important stocks without success.  Ireland received no support from other Member States for changes in the allocation keys for the share out of stocks.        The practical reality is that to achieve an increase in Ireland's share of Total Allowable Catch (TACs), other Member States would have to take a cut in their share.  This is all the more difficult to achieve when TACs of all the main commercial species are falling and the reality is that achieving a qualified majority for such an outcome at the Fisheries Council is not deliverable.The reform package, agreed in December 2002, included key national priorities such as the continuation of the Hague quota preferences, an action plan to address the problem of juvenile fish catches, stronger control and enforcement and new Regional Advisory Councils giving fishermen a strong voice in shaping future fisheries policy at EU level.It is important to note that  Ireland has 14 % of demersal/whitefish stocks and 21% of pelagic stocks (excluding blue whiting which is mainly landed for fish meal)  in the waters around our coast (northern part of Western Waters).   In 2007, this amounted to 35,359 tonnes of demersal/whitefish and 128,806 tonnes of herring, mackerel, horse mackerel and albacore tuna.  In addition, Ireland's quota of blue whiting amounted to 35,278 tonnes.    The Cawley Strategic report  "Steering A New Course — Strategy for a Restructured, Sustainable and Profitable Irish Seafood Industry 2007-2013" sets out a clear strategy to maximise the value of quotas focused on increasing the value of seafood at every stage from the sea to the table.  I am satisfied that the effective implementation of this Stategy, which the Government has endorsed, will deliver a a sustainable, profitable and self-reliant industry that will maximise its long term contribution to coastal communities.  I am fully committed to working with industry to deliver the strategy set down efficiently and effectively.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	549	I propose to take Questions Nos. 329 and 330 together.The representative organisations for pig producers and processors have been in contact with me about a range of issues affecting the sector. A major concern for the industry is the very high cost of feed and consequent erosion of profit margins. The rise in feed prices can be attributed to a number of factors such as (i) heavy demand for cereals in Asia (ii) the increased demand for feed materials from the biofuel industry and (iii) unfavourable weather conditions which affected many of the major cereal growing countries.The EU Council of Agriculture Ministers has, in response to the pressures on the international cereal and feed markets, agreed to suspend the obligation to set 10% of arable land aside.  This will ensure that more arable land is available for cereal cultivation in 2008.In relation to market supports, a scheme of financial assistance for the private storage of pigmeat has been in place since 29th October.  This was adopted by the European Commission in response to a request from me and some other Member States. I have also impressed on the Commission the need for export refunds for fresh and frozen pigmeat and this will be kept under consideration.Pigmeat features prominently in Bord Bia's programme of promotion on the home and export markets. I have asked the Bord to intensify its autumn pork and bacon promotion campaign in order to ensure that the market remains firm over the coming months. Additional funding is being made available for this. The Bord Bia quality assurance schemes are also a good tool in maintaining consumer confidence and, in this context, the pigmeat scheme is well established and managed.On the export front, Irish pork has access to important markets worldwide and pork is included  in overseas promotion drives and market access initiatives. I recognise, however, that the weak U.S. dollar is creating difficulties for exports to non-EU countries.I am working with the Minister for Health and Children towards the introduction of legislation to provide better information to consumers on the origin of pigmeat sold in this country. This will require the approval of the EU Commission, which following the public consultation process by the FSAI and consideration of its outcome, will be pursued shortly.   I have introduced other initiatives to support the industry such as the extension of the farm waste management scheme to the pig sector and my Department's programme of financial assistance for the transition to welfare-friendly sow housing.This is a difficult period for pig producers but the sector has proven itself resilient in the past. Within the framework of the EU common agricultural policy, I will continue to ensure that pig producers' problems are highlighted with a view to suitable action.

However it is important to note that the FVO have procedures that can involve protracted correspondence on their draft report with the national authorities in the Member State or Third country concerned.The Food and Veterinary Office is part of the EU Directorate-General for Health and Consumer Protection. It conducts missions to Member States and third countries to check on compliance with the requirements of EU food safety and quality, animal health and welfare and plant health within the EU and on compliance with EU import requirements in third countries. The Commission report on their findings to the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health. I would remind the Deputy again that the Commissioner has personally assured me that he will not hesitate to take appropriate protection measures if a product, imported from a third country represents a risk for the health of EU consumers, livestock or plants.

The information which these regulations require on the label includes the registered number of the slaughterhouse or cutting plant and, where imported from a Third Country, an indication of country of origin.  These regulations do not apply to poultry products that are processed in any way. Draft regulations requiring the origin labelling of pigmeat, poultry meat and sheep meat were prepared in my Department and forwarded to the Department of Health and Children as the Regulations will be made under the Health Act 1947.A public consultation on the proposed regulations took place during the past month via the website of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland. The consultation period has now passed and   the proposed legislation is being reviewed in the light of submitted comments.  The draft legislation will then be forwarded to the European Commission for approval. The commencement date for the legislation will depend on the Commission's response and, possibly, that of other Member States.   In the proposed legislation ‘origin' will be defined as the country where the animal was reared and, if different, the country of slaughter. This will have to be indicated on meat and meat products containing over 70% meat. The requirement to show the country of rearing and slaughter of the animal will not be superseded by any ‘substantial transformation'.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	552	The Minister for Health and Children has overall responsibility for the general food labelling legislation. Responsibility for enforcement of labelling legislation rests with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) through its service contracts with my Department, the Sea Fisheries Protection Agency, the Health Services Executive, the Local Authorities and the National Consumer Agency.General food labelling legislation, as set out in Directive 2000/13/EC on the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs does not require a declaration of origin of food.  However declaration requirements exist in legislation for some food products including beef, and some imported poultry in specific circumstances such as when raw and pre-packed. There is a clear requirement that consumers should not be misled by food labelling. Manufacturers may voluntarily declare a country of origin, and consumers should not be misled by that declaration.The labelling of beef is governed by Council Regulation  (EC) No. 1760/2000 of 17 July 2000 and is underpinned by a full animal identification and traceability system.  These compulsory labelling regulations require all operators and organisations marketing beef within the Community to provide the following information on the label:A reference code to enable the beef to be traced back to the animal or group of animals from which it was derivedThe approval number of the slaughterhouse and the country in which it is locatedThe approval number of the de-boning hall and the country in which it is locatedAn indication of the origin of the animal from which the beef was derived to include the country in which it was born and reared.These Regulations are implemented in Ireland by the European Communities (Labelling of Beef and Beef Products) Regulations, 2000 (S.I. No. 435 of 2000) and the European Communities (Labelling of Beef and Beef Products) (Amended) Regulations, 2002 (S.I. No. 485 of 2000).The competent authority with responsibility for enforcement of labelling legislation in retail establishments is the Health Service Executive through its Environmental Health Officers under contract to the FSAI.  As far as my Department is concerned labelling checks are carried out as part of the routine official checks at meat plants under DAFF control. Checks are conducted on a random, risk based frequency and cover labelling, traceability/origin, identification of cattle, labelling of carcases, meat, mince meat, meat products.

It is operated through the Vocational Education Committees.  The aims of the Scheme are to give unemployed people education and training opportunities which will develop and prepare them to go into paid employment or on to further education opportunities leading to paid employment.A training allowance is paid by the VECs to students who previously drew unemployment benefit or assistance. The student ceases to receive an unemployment payment and, instead, receives a VTOS training allowance at a rate equivalent to the maximum rate of unemployment benefit, plus a payment for an adult or child dependant, if appropriate. VTOS students also retain their social welfare secondary benefits.The allowances for VTOS students, for meals and travel, referred to in the questions are equivalent to these paid to participants on FÁS training courses. VTOS students may be entitled to a travel allowance if they reside more than 3 miles from a centre. These allowances are increased periodically in line with increases in FÁS rates. The current rates are in operation since 2002. There are no plans to increase them in the near future.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	562	My Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services in primary schools under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978/79 scheme for the employment of full-time secretaries and caretakers in primary schools, under which my Department meets the full cost of salary. This scheme is being phased out as posts become vacant and no new posts are being created. This scheme has been superseded by a more extensive grant scheme now referred to as the Ancillary Services grant.The Ancillary Services grant scheme is flexible in nature, giving Boards of Management discretion as to the manner in which caretaking and secretarial services are provided. The grants paid are not directly linked to any objective pay scales. The level and extent of services provided is a matter for the school authorities who, through the discretion afforded by the scheme, apply diverse arrangements for caretaking and secretarial services as resources permit. As the secretaries and caretakers are employees of individual schools, my Department does not have any role in determining the pay and conditions under which they are engaged. These are matters to be agreed between the staff concerned and the school authorities.There have been significant improvements in the level of funding provided to primary schools in recent years. Since 1997 the standard rate of the Ancillary Services grant has increased from €38.09 per pupil to €145.50 per pupil at present. The level of capitation grant at primary level has increased from €57.14 to €163.58 per pupil in the same period. The amount of grant paid to an individual school is determined by the enrolment in the school.  This Government has shown a strong commitment to improving primary school funding in recent years and I will continue to prioritise this area in the context of available resources.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	563	A grant scheme for schoolbooks for needy pupils in post-primary schools has operated since the introduction of the scheme for the provision of free post-primary education in the 1967/68 school year. The purpose of the scheme is to provide aid towards the cost of schoolbooks. A needy pupil, for the purpose of the scheme, is defined as a pupil from a family in which genuine hardship exists.  Schools are notified of the scheme each year by Circular Letter. The scheme is administered by school principals. Principals have discretion in the selection of pupils to be assisted and the level of assistance in each case, subject to the annual financial allocation and the terms of the scheme.The 2007 allocation is €7.941million. 128,000 pupils are being assisted under the scheme in the 2007/08 academic year. Of this, some €0.9m issued to support seed capital and book loan/rental schemes. Schools designated as disadvantaged received a higher rate of grant per needy pupil. In addition to this, as part of the DEIS (Delivering Equality of  Opportunity in Schools) programme, some €4.7m    was issued in additional non pay supports to second level DEIS schools. The funds can be used flexibly by schools as part of their action plans to address the educational needs of pupils at risk, working in collaboration with parents and local community agencies.

Schools that do not currently have NEPS psychologists assigned to them, such as the school to which the Deputy refers in the question, may avail of the SCPA and have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.Since NEPS was established, we have more than trebled the number of psychologists in the service. We are committed to increasing its staffing further, so that by 2009 there will be 200 NEPS psychologists.  The number of psychologists employed by NEPS in April was 128. Approval was given earlier this year to increase the number of NEPS psychologists to 158 in 2007. However, the recruitment process has taken longer than expected. By September this year, there were 131 psychologists in NEPS. This has since increased to 135. My Department has also agreed start dates for a further 3 psychologists, two of which are due to start with NEPS in December 2007 and one in January 2008.  The recruitment process is ongoing with a view to filling the remaining vacancies as soon as possible.

Schools that do not currently have NEPS psychologists assigned to them may avail of the SCPA and have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved and paid for by NEPS. According to my Department's records some 150 psychologists were engaged by schools under the SCPA in the 2006/07 academic year.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	566	Apart from a small number of prescribed texts at second-level, mainly in the case of language subjects, decisions on which textbooks to use in first and second-level schools are taken at school level.  Syllabus planners are conscious of the need to avoid over-frequent changes to textbooks, primarily in order to minimise increases in the cost burden for parents. However, textbooks have to be changed periodically to enable teachers to keep their students' work educationally stimulating and to ensure that content and methodology are kept up to date.  School authorities have been advised that books should be changed only to the extent that is absolutely necessary.My Department operates a grant scheme towards the cost of providing school textbooks for pupils from low-income families in schools at first and second-level. Schools are notified of the scheme each year by circular letter.  Principal teachers administer the book grant schemes in schools in a flexible way under the terms of the schemes based on their knowledge of particular circumstances in individual cases. My Department will provide funding amounting to some €13.8m under the schemes in 2007.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	567	The Deputy is aware that the home tuition scheme which provides funding to parents to provide education at home for children who, for a number of reasons such as chronic illness, are unable to attend school was extended in recent years to facilitate tuition for children awaiting a suitable educational placement and also to provide early educational intervention for pre-school children with autism.The Deputy will also be aware that the National Council for Special Education is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers, for the establishment of special classes for autism and for allocating resource teachers and special needs assistants to schools to support children with special needs.  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.The information requested by the Deputy is not readily available in my Department for the period in question in the requested format. However, for the past two years, home tuition information has been maintained electronically and I have requested my Officials to send the relevant information to the Deputy directly.

The Fund supports retention and participation among under-represented groups of students in further and higher education and is available to students in area partnerships and community groups which participate in the Local Development Social Inclusion Programme (LDSIP). Application for Millennium funding is made annually by organisations through Pobal (formally Area Development Management).The student referred to by the Deputy may contact his Local Area Partnership Company which in his case is Drogheda Partnership Company, Workspace Centre, Mayoralty Street, Drogheda, Co. Louth telephone No. (041) 9842088 for further information and assistance.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	569	Acquisition of  a site for primary school provision in Tyrrellstown is advancing well. The site is such that it should provide accommodation for up to two 24 classroom schools, each of which would have a 3 stream junior infant intake. This equates to a pupil intake of 162 junior infants per year.  The Department will be discussing the configuration and size of the schools with the two patron bodies concerned, Educate Together and the Catholic Archbishop of Dublin.  Due to commercial sensitivities of site acquisitions it would not be appropriate for me  to identify the vendor or the site cost at this time.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	570	The New School Advisory Committee (NSAC) has received formal notification from Educate Together of an intention to apply for the recognition of a new primary school for September, 2008 in the location referred to by the Deputy.The NSAC is an independent advisory group established to process applications for the recognition of new primary schools and to make recommendations to the Minister for Education and Science. It is expected that the NSAC will produce its report early in 2008.In the meantime, the Department has prioritised a site acquisition in the area under the Fingal School Model Agreement process and this matter is on-going.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	571	The funding arrangements made by my Department for second level schools reflect the sectoral division of our second level system.  At the core of all arrangements is a reliance upon capitation as the principle determinant of funding.My Department provides funding to secondary schools by way of per capita grants, which affords schools considerable flexibility in the use of these resources to cater for the needs of their pupils.There have been significant improvements in recent years in the level of funding for voluntary secondary schools.  With effect from January 2007, the standard per capita grant was increased by €18 per pupil and now amounts to €316 per pupil.  In addition, voluntary secondary schools have benefited by the increase of €30 per pupil in 2007 in the support services grant bringing that grant to €189 per pupil.The cumulative increase of €48 per pupil in a voluntary secondary school brings the aggregate grant to over €500 per pupil.  These grants are in addition to the per capita funding of up to €40,000 per school that is also provided by my Department to secondary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services.  For example in the case of a secondary school with 500 pupils, this brings annual grants towards general expenses and support service to over €290,000.  This represents an increase of 83% since 2000.Budget allocations for schools in the Community and Comprehensive school sector along with those in the VEC sector are increased on a pro rata basis with increases in the per capita grant. All schools are eligible for recurrent per capita grants towards special classes and curricular support grants.These significant increases in the funding of post primary schools are a clear demonstration of my commitment to prioritise available resources to address the needs of schools.  My Department will be considering, in line with the Programme for Government commitment, how best to complete the process of equalisation of funding at second level.

Where it is not possible to provide a reasonable level of service to meet the educational needs of a pupil, my Department may consider an application for a grant towards the cost of organising private transport.  My Department is satisfied, in this instance, that a reasonable level of service was provided for the pupil referred to by the Deputy in the details supplied and, therefore, the question of a grant payment does not arise.The Deputy will appreciate that it is a matter for Bus Éireann to plan school bus routes and co-ordinate services in an efficient and cost-effective manner.

Decisions on the Scheme will be made later in the year.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	574	The tender documentation for the project referred to by the Deputy is almost complete.Progression of all projects to tender and construction will be considered in the context of my Department's Multi-Annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	575	I propose to take Questions Nos. 363 and 364 together.My Department funds three maintenance grant schemes for third level students which are administered by the Local Authorities and the Vocational Education Committees.  These are the Higher Education Grants Scheme, the Vocational Education committees' Scholarship Scheme, the Third Level Maintenance Grants Scheme for Trainees and the Maintenance Grants Scheme for Students attending Post Leaving Certificate Courses.The Higher Education Grants Scheme is administered by the Local Authorities.  The other three schemes are administered by the Vocational Education Committees.Under the terms of the maintenance grants schemes grant assistance is awarded to students who meet the prescribed conditions of funding including those which relate to age, residence, means, nationality and previous academic attainment.The nationality requirement as set out in the 2007 Grant Schemes states:Candidates must:—hold E.U. Nationality; orhave Official Refugee Status; or — have been granted Humanitarian Leave to Remain in the State (prior to the Immigration Act 1999); orbe a person in respect of whom the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has granted permission to remain following a determination not to make a deportation order under section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999; orhave permission to remain in the State by virtue of marriage to an Irish national residing in the State, or be the child of such person, not having EU nationality; orhave permission to remain in the State by virtue of marriage to a national of another EU Member State who is residing in the State and who is or has been employed, or self-employed, in the State, or be the child of such a person, not having EU nationality; orbe nationals of a member country of the European Economic Area (EEA) or Switzerland.Students must meet the nationality requirement at the time of entry or re-entry to an approved course.  However the Grants Schemes contain a ‘change in circumstances' clause which provides that a candidate's eligibility may be assessed or re-assessed in the event of a change in circumstances in relation to, inter alia, reckonable income, the number of dependant children, normal residence and nationality, where the candidate becomes an Irish national or the national of another EU member State.The ‘change in circumstances' provision allows candidates who acquire nationality through the naturalisation process, during the course of their studies, to apply to be assessed or re-assessed for grant assistance with effect from the academic term when the change occurs.The decision on eligibility for third level or further education grants is a matter for the relevant local authority or VEC.  These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is desired.If an individual applicant considers that she/he has been unjustly refused the special rate of maintenance grant, she/he may appeal, in the first instance, to the relevant local authority or VEC.Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down in writing by the relevant local authority or VEC, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the conditions correctly in his/her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department.  Alternatively, as already indicated, the local authority or VEC may, itself, in exceptional circumstances, seek clarification on issues from my Department.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	576	The school referred to by the Deputy is a four teacher school with approximately 16 pupils.  There are three teaching vacancies out of a total teaching complement of four teaching posts at the school.  Due to this exceptional number of vacancies, the school was unable to re-open in September 2007.  I am informed that the Board of Management is actively engaged in a recruitment process to fill these vacancies and that every effort is being made to expedite the process with a view to re-opening the school as soon as possible.In the interim, arrangements have been made to accommodate some children in other schools.  Where this has not been possible, my Department has offered a home tuition grant to the remaining families.It is my understanding that the school management has been in contact with the pupils' families.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	582	Since 28 March 2006, a fully qualified teacher in either the primary or post primary sector must be registered with the Teaching Council, the independent statutory body, which regulates the teaching profession.For registration to take place, an individual must satisfy certain criteria, including criteria relating to academic qualifications.  I understand that a registration application has been made to the Teaching Council in respect of the individual referred to by the Deputy.  Any queries in connection with the application should be made directly to the Teaching Council by the individual concerned.  I do not have any role in the matter of teacher registration.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	583	The revised primary curriculum was launched in 1999 after extensive consultation with the partners in education.Page 27 in the Introduction to the Curriculum states "It is a particular feature of Irish primary education that children, from the beginning of schooling, have experience of language learning in two languages."  It also sets out a suggested minimum weekly time framework for tuition.  This provides that where a first language is being taught, there should be four hours instruction per week, and 3 hours per week where there is a shorter day for the infant classes.  Where a second language is being taught, the suggested minimum timeframe is 3.5 hours per week, and 2.5 hours per week for infant classes with a shorter day.Some time ago my Department sought the advice of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment on issues relating to emergent literacy in Irish medium schools.  The NCCA produced a series of reports on the matter, including a consultation paper, a literature review of research, and a report on the consultation process.  The Council presented its final advice in February 2007.Having considered the advice in full, I have determined as a public policy issue that the position as set out in the curriculum, and in previous Parliamentary Questions, should remain unchanged i.e that the minimum recommended timeframe set out for a second language in the curriculum should be adhered to.  Accordingly, Circular 0044/2007 requires that Irish medium schools should provide for a minimum provision in English of 3.30 hours per week, or 2.5 hours per week where there is a shorter day for infant classes, no later than the start of the second term in Junior infants.I met the National Parents Council and a range of Irish language organisations to discuss the matter, and my officials met the Chief Executive of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment.  In addition, the Council was notified formally of my decision in the matter prior to the issue of the Circular.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	585	My Department gives an annual grant to all Vocational Education Committees for the provision of Adult Literacy and Community Education.  The cost of the literacy service delivered by the VECs in 2006 was over €20 million.  To cater for the needs of adult migrants, there is a facility, within the adult literacy service, for those who wish to improve their English to participate in English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) courses.  In 2005, there were 10,000 places availed of for ESOL courses and this rose to 12,000 in 2006.  This latter figure constitutes 30% of the adult literacy places within the adult literacy service.My Department, in conjunction with the Office for Integration, has commissioned an independent review to assist in the development of a national English language training policy and framework for legally-resident adult immigrants based on extensive stakeholder consultation.  This is due for completion in early 2008.The question of creating a dedicated fund for the teaching of English to adult migrants will be considered in the context of the outcome of the review.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	586	The post-primary curriculum for the study of Irish has the capacity to cater for a wide diversity of ability. Nevertheless, provision exists for exemption from the study of Irish in limited special circumstances.The guidelines in relation to an exemption from the study of Irish at post-primary level are set out in Rule 46 of the Rules and Programme for Secondary Schools and in Circular M10/94. Under the terms of this Rule, Principals of post-primary schools have delegated authority to grant exemptions provided that the student meets the criteria as set down.The criteria provide that exemptions may be granted by school authorities for (a) students whose primary education up to 11 years of age was received in Northern Ireland or outside Ireland (b) students who were previously enrolled as recognised students in a primary school or post-primary school who are being re-enrolled after a period spent abroad, provided that at least 3 years have elapsed since the previous enrolment in the State and the student is at least 11 years of age on re-enrolment and (c) certain categories of students with special educational needs as set out in Circular M10/94 or (d) students from abroad, who have no understanding of English, when enrolled.My Department has no record of an exemption from the study of Irish being granted by the school in respect of the pupil referred to by the Deputy. An application for an exemption would have to be made to the school authorities.

The requirement for a site has been advertised on a number of occasions, most recently in September 2007.  On foot of the most recent advertisement, proposals are currently under consideration and a technical assessment on these proposals will be forwarded to the Department in due course.  Agreement to enter a contract for purchase of this site will be considered in the context of the Department's 2008 budget for acquisition of sites, which has yet to be finalised.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	591	I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the Department is advancing plans to provide four new post primary schools for the Dublin 15 area.  Each of these schools will cater for up to 1,000 pupils.As the Deputy will be aware, I have already, given the go-ahead for the delivery of one of these schools in Phibblestown.  A site reservation has been made in the Tyrrelstown area of Dublin 15 for the second while the third will be delivered under the Hansfield Strategic Development Zone process.  Discussions are on-going with Fingal County Council for the acquisition of a site for the fourth school which will be in Castleknock.It is expected that the plans outlined will meet the post primary needs of the Dublin 15 area into the future. The situation will, nonetheless, continue to be kept under review by the Department.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	592	In 2001, the Department advised Fingal County Council that a reservation for a post primary school site was not required in the proposed Phoenix Park development.This advice was based on information available at the time, including the extent of the proposed housing developments and the extent of existing educational provision.  Taken into consideration also was the fact that, due to the greater mobility of post primary students, additional demand for post primary places could be met by schools in the wider area.As they Deputy will be aware, due to on-going developments, there are plans to provide four new post primary school in Dublin 15. The areas concerned are Phibblestown, Hansfield (Strategic Development Zone), Tyrrelstown and Castleknock.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	595	In February of this year I announced my intention to proceed with a pilot project involving a new additional model of primary school patronage in Diswellstown, Co. Dublin. While the exact location of the new school in Diswellstown has yet to be finalised, there are two potential sites being considered and my Department has asked Fingal County Council to expedite this process as a matter of urgency.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	596	Pending the completion of the consultation process and the evaluation of the pilot community primary school project, I decided as a matter of policy that no vocational education committee (with the exception of the aforementioned pilot community primary school project) should act as a patron in respect of a primary school or otherwise, establish or maintain a primary school until further notice. I therefore directed all Vocational Education Committees not to establish or maintain a primary school and not to seek recognition of a primary school or recognition as a Patron until further notice or direction.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	597	I assume the Deputy is referring to the schools known as the Model schools. The model schools are:1. Dunmanway Model School, Co. Cork2. Monaghan Model School, Co. Monaghan3. Limerick Model School, Limerick4. Bailieboro Model School, Co. Cavan5. Scoil Fhursa, Co. na Gaillimhe6. Athy Model School, Co. Kildare7. Central Model School (Senior), Dublin8. Central Model School (Junior), Dublin9. Scoil Chaoimhin, DublinThe model schools have their origin in the set of instructions drawn up by Chief Secretary Stanley in 1831 that empowered the Commissioners for National Education (National Education Board) to , inter alia , establish a model school for the training of teachers. Only one model school was first contemplated, a central model school in Dublin. From 1845 onwards local model schools were established managed by local inspectors. The Royal Commission on Education 1868-1870 found that model schools were an unduly expensive method of training teachers, and their use for this purpose ceased from about 1883 onwards, the schools continuing to function as ordinary schools.The Board was brought to an end in 1922, when its functions were taken over by the Minister for Education and the Department of Education was set up under the Ministers and Secretaries Act of 1924.  The model schools continued to be managed by inspectors and funded by the Department.The Education Act 1998 placed the patronage of schools on a statutory basis. The Minister as owner of the model schools became the Patron in accordance with the terms of the Act.As Patron the Minister, in respect of these schools, has the same powers under the legislation as any other school patron. For example the Minister appoints the Board of Management of the model schools while in the case of schools under the patronage of the Catholic or Protestant church it is the Bishop that appoints the Board.Model Schools are recognised primary schools which are maintained from State funds and are ordinary primary schools offering the national curriculum. The relevant section of my Department approves the appointment of teachers on my behalf.It is the Minister's historic  role in relation to the school and her current role as Patron  under the Education Act 1998 that distinguishes these schools from those under the patronage of catholic or protestant bishops.The schools operate as Catholic or Protestant schools in accordance with the historic traditions that go back to their foundation and the community to be served at the time they were established.

Its role is to ensure that there is adherence to overall guidelines, that objectives are clear and that there is consistency across departments in the approach adopted.The objectives agreed between Secretaries General and Assistant Secretaries must be submitted to the CPA and may be questioned by the CPA. At the end of each review period, the recommendations by Secretaries General on the payment of awards must be approved by the CPA. The report of the CPA does not set out detail of the performance objectives agreed.The performance objectives under this scheme are agreed for each of a small group of individuals who are identified with specific functional areas of work. Inevitably the agreed objectives for any one of these individuals will include objectives relating to his/her functional area of work, allowing each individual to be identified with specific objectives.

The Department of Education and Science holds the co-ordinating role for the transposition of this Directive.Transposition of provisions for the Sectoral professions (doctors with basic training, specialised doctors, nurses responsible for general care, dental practitioners, specialised dental practitioners, veterinary surgeons, midwives, pharmacists and architects) is being undertaken by the relevant line Departments in each case. My Department  is transposing provisions for the General System covering the remaining professions.  A draft Statutory Instrument for the transposition of the general system under the Directive is undergoing final review and it is hoped that it will be completed in early December. In the meantime, the conditions are being applied by the relevant competent authorities on an administrative basis.  The transposition regime undertaken for 2005/36/EC will include provision for automatic recognition of the sectoral qualifications listed for Romania and Bulgaria, which are included in Directive 2006/100/EC.

The school was also successful in obtaining approval for Mechanical and Electrical Works under an Emergency Grant in 2007 for works costing in excess of €381,000.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	609	The position is that VECs are statutory bodies governed by extensive legislation, primarily the Vocational Education Act 1930 to 2001. Accordingly, all employees of VECs, including caretakers, are subject to terms and conditions of employment determined by the VEC concerned, with the consent of the Minster for Finance.My Department provides funding towards the cost of caretaking services in the case of secondary schools under two separate schemes. One is the 1978/79 scheme for the employment of school caretakers in secondary schools under which my Department meets the full cost of salary. The 1978/79 scheme is being phased out as posts become vacant and no new posts are being created.The 1978/79 scheme has been superseded by a more extensive school support grant scheme towards the funding of ancillary services in schools including caretaking services. The scheme is flexible in nature giving Boards of Management and schools discretion as to the manner in which these services are provided.Under that scheme each school receives a grant from my Department for the provision of caretaking and other ancillary services. It is a matter for each school to determine how best to meet its caretaking requirements. My Department has no direct role in the pay or conditions of service of caretakers employed directly by schools under these arrangements.  There are no proposals at present to change this position.The funding arrangements made by my Department for second level schools reflect the sectoral division of our second level system. At the core of all arrangements is a reliance upon capitation as the principle determinant of funding. My Department provides funding to secondary schools by way of per capita grants, which affords schools considerable flexibility in the use of these resources to cater for the needs of their pupils.There have been significant improvements in recent years in the level of funding for voluntary secondary schools. With effect from January 2007, the standard per capita grant was increased by €18 per pupil and now amounts to €316 per pupil. In addition, voluntary secondary schools have benefited by the increase of €30 per pupil in 2007 in the support services grant bringing that grant to €189 per pupil.The cumulative increase of €48 per pupil in a voluntary secondary school brings the aggregate grant to over €500 per pupil. These grants are in addition to the per capita funding of up to €40,000 per school that is also provided by my Department to secondary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services. For example in the case of a secondary school with 500 pupils, this brings annual grants towards general expenses and support service to over €290,000.  This represents an increase of 83% since 2000.These significant increases in the funding of post primary schools are a clear demonstration of my commitment to prioritise available resources to address the needs of schools. My Department will be considering, in line with the Programme for Government commitment, how best to complete the process of equalisation of funding at second level.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	610	My Department first began to publish school inspection reports in June 2006. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that since then, 1,055 reports on some 700 schools have been made available to school communities and the general public through publication on my Department's website. There are 286 published Whole-School Evaluation (WSE) reports which include 218 WSE reports on primary schools, 53 WSE reports at post-primary level, as well as 15 evaluations of centres for education encompassing Youth Encounter Project Schools, Youthreach Centres and Senior Traveller Training Centres. A further tranche of WSE reports will be published later this week increasing the number of published inspection reports even more.It is not possible to indicate precisely when all schools will have an inspection under the WSE model, but it certainly will take some time because WSE is only one of a range of inspection formats employed by the inspectorate. I can assure the Deputy, however, that the Inspectorate has frequent engagement with a great many schools each year through inspection visits for the probation of newly qualified teachers in primary schools (more than 2,300 teachers this year) and the conduct of more than 700 Subject Inspections in post-primary schools annually. I am satisfied that the scope of this inspection activity, in terms of coverage of schools, ensures a high level of external quality assurance of schools at both first and second levels.Full details of the inspection reports that have been published are available on my Department's website www.education.gov.ie.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	611	The National Educational Welfare Board is developing a nationwide service on a continuing basis that is accessible to schools, parents/guardians and others concerned with the welfare of young people. For this purpose, Educational Welfare Officers (EWOs) have been deployed throughout the country to provide a welfare-focused service to support regular school attendance and discharge the Board's functions locally operating through 5 regional teams, with bases in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford. An additional 15 staff have been allocated to the NEWB in 2007. This brings the current authorised staffing of the Board to 109 posts of which 90 are allocated to working directly in the service delivery area. The staffing complement is comprised of 19 HQ and support staff, 5 regional managers, 13 Senior EWO's and 72 EWO's.Educational Welfare Officers play a pivotal role in implementing the service provided by the NEWB through monitoring school attendance and working to improve it. The EWOs also help parents that are experiencing a difficulty with getting a school place for their child.  The NEWB has advised that the matter for additional resources for all areas is kept under continuous review. Areas are prioritized for additional service based on a combined analysis of demographic data, absence data reported from schools and other indicators of disadvantage. A service is provided from 26 locations nationwide. Staff are deployed in areas of greatest disadvantage and in areas designated under the Government's RAPID programme.In addition to the intensive service provided in designated areas the Board follows up on urgent cases nationally where children are not currently receiving an education. Urgent cases include children who are out of school; children with no school place; children who have been refused enrolment in school; where a school principal contacts the NEWB with an expression of concern about a pupil or children who have been excluded or suspended on a long term basis from school.In respect of the Deputy's specific question relating to the number of counties throughout the country that have no educational welfare officer. I am informed by the Board that the service is currently available to every county with a dedicated officer appointed to all counties with the exception of counties Roscommon and Leitrim. This matter will be addressed through the recruitment process currently underway to fill the additional EWO posts as one of these posts has been designated to cover the Roscommon / Leitrim area.This government is determined to do all that is possible to ensure that every child gets all the opportunities and support they need to enable them to achieve their potential and participate fully in education. I am pleased to advise the Deputy that funding to the Board for 2007 amounted to €9.808 million. This represents an increase of 20% on the 2006 allocation and of 50% on the 2004 level. This substantial increase in funding is a clear indication of this Government's commitment to prioritise investment in favour of those most at risk. Through increased investment and improved services we are determined to optimise access, participation and educational outcomes at every level of the system for disadvantaged groups.I will be keeping the issue of the NEWB's staffing under review in light of the rollout of services, the scope for integrated working and any proposals that the Board may put to me in relation to clearly identified priority needs.

The SENO is also a focal point of contact for parents and schools.My officials have been in contact with the NCSE and have been advised that the pupil referred to by the Deputy is in receipt of 5 individual hours resource teaching per week, which is the maximum number of hours available.  In addition, I am informed that the pupil also has the services of a full time special needs assistant.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	616	The Social Personal and Health Education (SPHE) Programme in all primary schools includes a specific ‘safety and protection' strand which is designed to develop in children an increasing sense of personal responsibility for their own safety and that of others. The learning objectives of this strand specifically include such issues as safety strategies for crossing the road, using the bus or being a pedestrian, crossing the road with an adult, and being familiar with the rules for travelling in a car or bus, or on a bicycle.SPHE is also a mandatory junior cycle subject at second-level. The ‘personal safety' strand of the junior cycle programme includes such issues as road safety and is supported by a range of curriculum materials. In addition, a road safety programme for use in Transition Year is currently being developed by the Road Safety Authority in collaboration with my Department, the NCCA and the Second Level Support Service.On 6th February, the Road Safety Authority launched the RSA MACE "Safe to School" campaign at primary level, which is aimed at helping primary school children learn effective road safety lessons. The first part of this campaign is about walking to school safely and as part of this initiative educational packs and DVDs have been distributed to all primary schools and a Walking to School Guide has been produced. A dedicated website, www.safetoschool.ie, has also been launched as part of the campaign.I have no plans at present to introduce a scheme as outlined by the Deputy.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	618	The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30th September of the previous school year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule which is issued annually to all primary schools.According to data submitted to the Department by the Board of Management of the school referred to by the Deputy, the enrolment in the school on 30th September 2006 was 75 pupils. In accordance with the staffing schedule (Circular 0020/2007), which is available on the Department's website at www.education.ie and a hard copy of which has issued to all primary schools, the mainstream staffing in the school for the 2007/08 school year will remain as a Principal and 2 mainstream class teachers.According to further data submitted to the Department by the Board of Management of the school, the enrolment in the school on 30th September 2007 was 80 pupils. The staffing of the school for the 2008/2009 school year will be based on this figure and on the new staffing schedule for the 2008/09 school year which will issue from my Department early in 2008.Within the terms of the staffing arrangements for primary schools there is provision for additional posts, referred to as developing school posts, to be assigned to schools on the basis of projected enrolments for the next school year. Under these arrangements, a developing school post may be sanctioned provisionally where the projected enrolment at 30th September of the school year in question equals or exceeds a specified figure. If the specified figure is not achieved on 30th September, sanction for the post is withdrawn.As I stated in my reply to the Deputy's representation in July 2007, it was open to the Board of Management to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeal Board which was established to adjudicate on appeals on mainstream staffing allocations in primary schools. Details of the criteria and application dates for appeal are contained in the staffing schedule. They are also available in Circular 0024/2007 (Appeal Board for Mainstream Staffing in Primary Schools) which is available on my Department's website.Meetings of the Appeal Board were held on 22nd May 2007, 3rd July 2007 and the 23rd October 2007. My Department has no record of receiving an appeal from the Board of Management of the school in question for consideration by the Primary Staffing Appeal Board at any of these meetings .
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	619	The Education (Welfare) Act, 2000 established the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) as the single national body with responsibility for school attendance. The Act provides a comprehensive framework promoting regular school attendance and tackling the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving. The general functions of the Board are to ensure that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education.  Enrolment decisions are the responsibility of the Board of Management of each individual school. My Department has no role in relation to processing applications for enrolment by schools.In relation to this particular case, the Board have been requested to provide an update to my Department on the child's educational status.  When this has been provided, I will be writing directly to the deputy with the relevant details.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	620	My Department's Student Maintenance Grants Schemes take account of the incomes and losses of the relevant tax year.  The schemes provide that the grant awarding agency may allow losses of the relevant year to be offset against other incomes of the same year, but they do not allow losses of any prior year to be offset in the relevant year.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	621	Drug prevention education is implemented as part of the Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) curricula in ALL primary and post-primary schools. The SPHE curriculum is mandatory in all primary schools and post-primary schools up to Junior Certificate Level in which substance use is one of 10 modules taught.At primary level, the Substance Misuse Prevention Programme (SMPP or ‘The Walk Tall' Programme) is a national programme, established in 1996, to provide in-service to teachers in primary schools in the area of legal and illegal substances. The programme teaching and resource materials focus on both alcohol and drugs in an age appropriate manner. The programme has an integrated approach to drug education and is a key strategy in drug abuse prevention education. Teaching and resource materials developed by the ‘Walk Tall' Programme are made available to all primary and special schools nationally.The Walk Tall Support Service currently has a full time staff of three, comprised of a national support officer and two assistants on secondment from teaching duties. A part-time panel of approximately 20 teachers is available to deliver summer training courses nationally.At post-primary level, the substance misuse prevention programme ‘On My Own Two Feet' which is an integral part of the SPHE curriculum,draws on three approaches: knowledge-attitude,decision-making and social competence. As such it is a comprehensive life-skills programme.All post-primary schools are invited to in-service training in SPHE each spring and autumn on a regional basis. A selection of SPHE topics are offered to teachers, including substance use education. Health Promotion Officers and Regional Development Officers along with experts in specific areas, such as substance use education are involved in the delivery of this in-service.I am confident that together these initiatives are ensuring that the education system plays its role in combating drug abuse among young people. Clearly, however, this issue requires action on many fronts. To this end, the Government has put in place the National Drugs Strategy which aims to reduce drug abuse through investment in a mixture of different facilities and programmes and through actions by a range of Departments and Agencies.The evidence available to me from both the national Misuse Prevention Programme( SMPP) and the national SPHE Support Service informs me that the substance misuse education prevention programmes being implemented as an integral part of the SPHE curricula is in line with best international practice and while all programmes of this nature are constantly under review, I do not have any plans at present to revise the programmes.

Full details of all personnel currently serving overseas on UN mandated operations, observer missions or undertaking representative or staff postings are listed in the tabular statement below.The main overseas missions, in which Defence Forces personnel are deployed, are the NATO-led International Security presence (KFOR) in Kosovo with 272  personnel and the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) with 57 personnel.  In addition, 41 personnel are serving in EUFOR, the EU-led operation in Bosnia and Herzegovina.  Other personnel are serving as monitors and observers with the United Nations (UN), the European Union (EU) and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).  Staff are also deployed at the organisational headquarters of the UN, EU, OSCE and NATO.Members of the Irish Defence Forces serve on peacekeeping missions under Chapter VI and Chapter VII of the UN Charter.   UNIFIL operates under Chapter VI of the UN Charter. Peacekeeping operations mounted under this chapter are of the traditional type, where the UN acts as a monitoring, patrolling and observing force after peace has been established.KFOR, EUFOR, ISAF and EUFOR TCHAD/RCA operate under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, that is, they are entitled to use force to implement their mandates and to protect themselves and the international civil presence. Peacekeeping operations mounted under this Chapter are commonly known as peace enforcement operations where the consent of the parties is not required.KFOR was established in June, 1999 to support the maintenance of civil law and order within Kosovo, so as to develop a climate of safety and security, which will enable the transfer of increased responsibility to the civil authorities.Ireland has participated in KFOR since August 1999. The Irish (37th) Infantry Group currently serves in the Multi-National Task Force (Centre). In addition to Ireland, the Task Force also comprises troops from the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic, Sweden, Finland and Latvia. The Task Force's area of responsibility is generally the Pristina region, covering 7 municipalities with a population of approximately 1 million.The Irish contingent currently comprises an APC Mounted Infantry Group of some 215 personnel, including a number of personnel in staff posts at various KFOR Headquarters. Last August, Ireland assumed the role of Framework Nation for the Multinational Task Force (Centre) in Kosovo for a period of 12 months.  An additional 57 Irish personnel are serving with KFOR in support of the Framework Nation role, bringing Ireland's current total deployment to the force to 272.Following the cessation of hostilities in Lebanon in July/August 2006, an Irish Infantry Group deployed to South Lebanon on 31 October, 2006 as part of the integrated Finnish/Irish Battalion within UNIFIL, to carry out tasks in support of UNIFIL, including dealing with unexploded ordnance clearance and reconstruction.  Ireland provided the security detail for the Engineering contingent from Finland.  The Finnish/Irish Battalion completed its deployment at the end of last month  and the withdrawal process is currently underway.  109 Irish personnel returned to Ireland on 1 November, 2007 and the remaining members of the Battalion will return to Ireland later this month. A small number of Defence Forces personnel will continue to serve at UNIFIL HQ.Ireland has participated in EUFOR since December 2004, the successor mission to the Stabilisation force (SFOR) in Bosnia and Herzegovina with which Ireland had previously been serving since 1997.  The Irish contingent with EUFOR currently comprises 41 personnel. The role of the Defence Forces personnel currently serving in EUFOR is to provide personnel for the headquarters, the Military Police Unit, Verification Teams and the National Support Element. All Irish personnel are located at Camp Butmir, Sarajevo.Ireland has participated in International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan since 5 July 2002, following the Government Decision of 2 July 2002, authorising the provision of seven members of the Permanent Defence Force for service with the force. Since then, the Government have reviewed and approved, on an annual basis, the continued participation by seven members of the Permanent Defence Force in ISAF.Following Government decision in October 2007, eleven Irish personnel are currently serving with the EUFOR TCHAD/RCA Mission.Number1.

The process is designed to benefit people transacting residential conveyancing in that by allowing the purchaser's solicitor to act also on behalf of the lending institution, costs are reduced to the benefit of consumers and the length of time taken to complete the conveyance is also reduced.  I would also point out that it was never intended that the process would be used for commercial purposes nor was it intended that the process should be used where the applicant was the lodging solicitor.As part of the process, in so far as it applies, the purchasers' solicitor will usually give an undertaking to a financial institution to the effect that he or she will ensure that the purchaser has a good marketable title to the property, that the documents are executed and that all the title deeds are stamped, registered and lodged with the institution.  In addition, the solicitor will generally, pending lodgement of the title deeds with the bank or building society, undertake to hold the deeds in trust for the lending institution.  In that context, it is important to note that where a solicitor fails to honour an undertaking given, it is considered to be professional misconduct and, as a result, the solicitor is rendered liable to the Law Society's disciplinary procedures and to investigation by the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal.  Depending on the particular circumstances of a case the criminal law may also apply to it.Mortgage lending is primarily a matter for the financial institutions involved and in so far as the system of banking and making loans available to clients is concerned, the Deputy will appreciate that I have no function. The Financial Regulator is responsible for the prudential supervision of Irish-licensed financial institutions and is independent in matters of day-to-day supervision.  I understand that the Regulator has consistently conveyed to lending institutions that mortgage lending policies and practices should be prudent and responsible.I have already indicated to the House that it is in everybody's interest that the best practices that clearly exist are followed in the area of solicitors' undertakings.  I have also stated that in so far as there are any matters to be reviewed or issues to be addressed on the Government side the Deputy can be assured that the responsible Ministers will do so.

These are generally dealt with in chronological order as this is deemed to be the fairest to all applicants. It is likely, therefore, that further processing of the applications will commence in the first half of 2008.I will inform the Deputy and the persons in question when I have reached a decision on the matter.

This Regulation requires that in order to avail of residency rights under these Regulations, applicants must submit evidence showing lawful residence in another EU Member State prior to arrival in Ireland. The person in question did not meet the criteria for eligibility for residence in the State in accordance with Regulation 3(2).  The vires of this Regulation was recently upheld in the High Court.  The matter is under appeal to the Supreme Court.I am also informed that the applicant made a late application under the IBC scheme and as such could not be considered.  This matter is under appeal to the Supreme Court and I understand a decision is expected in the near future.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	632	The person concerned arrived in the State on 19 October 2001 and was granted temporary permission to remain on foot of a work permit. She subsequently decided to pursue a full time course of studies, however her attendance record did not meet the course requirements.The person concerned was informed by letter dated 19 May 2004 that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order in respect of her and afforded her three options in accordance with Section 3(3) (b) (ii) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, namely to leave the State voluntarily, to consent to the making of a deportation order or to submit, within 15 working days, representations to the Minister, in writing, setting out the reasons why she should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.The case of the person concerned was examined under Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 as amended, and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 on the Prohibition of Refoulement. On 3 August 2004, my predecessor refused temporary leave to remain in the State and signed a deportation order in respect of her. Notice of this order was served by registered post requiring her to present herself to the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), 13/14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2, on 3 March 2005, in order to make travel arrangements for her deportation from the State. The person concerned failed to present herself as required and was classified as evading her deportation.The effect of the deportation order is that the person concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter outside the State. Anyone evading his/her deportation order and remaining in the State is liable to arrest and detention pursuant to Section 5 of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended.My Department does not appear to be in receipt of any application for permission to remain in the State on foot of marriage to an Irish National. However, in order for such an application to be accepted, both parties must be resident in the State.A person the subject of a deportation order may apply to have his/her deportation order revoked pursuant to Section 3 (11) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended. However, any such application would require substantial grounds to be successful.

It is the understanding of my Department that the applicant's spouse no longer resides in the State and accordingly the applicant is ineligible to apply for residence in the State under EU Treaty Rights.  This matter is currently before the High Court for judicial review and accordingly I cannot comment further.The issue as to the entitlement of the applicant to a work permit is solely a matter for consideration by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	634	The Reception and Integration Agency (RIA), which operates under the aegis of my Department has responsibility, inter alia, for meeting the accommodation and related ancillary needs of asylum seekers under the Government policy of Direct Provision and dispersal.  In this regard, the RIA is currently providing accommodation for 6,366 asylum seekers in 61 centres located across 22 counties.The centre at the Hotel Montague, Emo, Co. Laois, has a contract capacity for 200 persons — or approximately 50-55 families. Its current occupancy is 83 persons and it is anticipated that full capacity will soon be achieved at this centre.The provision and resourcing of statutory services such as health, social welfare, education and so forth to asylum seekers are matters, in the first instance, for the relevant Government Departments and the agencies operating under their aegis. In that regard the RIA is a multi-disciplinary, cross agency, body with staff seconded to it from a number of Departments and agencies — Department of Health and Children, Department of Education and Science, Department of Environment and Local Government, Dublin City Council, HSE and the Irish Red Cross — so as to coordinate service delivery to asylum seekers at local level and to liaise with local statutory service providers and the appropriate Government Departments.The opening of any new centre will place demands on local service providers and it is natural that concerns should be expressed. This has been the case with many of the centres referred to above, including those in a rural location similar to this centre, and these concerns have abated over a short period of time.  As with those other centres, RIA immediately facilitated an inter-agency meeting with all relevant State service providers to discuss the issues involved. This took place at the centre on 25 October, 2007.  RIA staff, including those seconded to it as referred to above, have fed back to the respective service providing authorities the concerns raised at that meeting. Considerable progress has been made already in relation to service provision and work in this area will intensify over the coming weeks.All asylum seekers are entitled to access health services under the medical card scheme and discussions are ongoing with the relevant health service providers to facilitate the provision of the necessary services to the asylum seekers at the centre.  RIA is cognisant of the potential impact on the local community of this centre and to minimise it, a dedicated space has been made available within the centre to enable the Community Welfare Officer to discharge his/her functions in respect of asylum seekers.  A separate medical area has also been made available for the use of the general practitioner who will operate at the centre.  This area  is also at the disposal of the Public Health Nurse who will visit the centre as required.Immigrant children, including children of asylum seekers,  are entitled to primary and post primary education.  Education in Ireland is compulsory from age six to sixteen years.  It is not possible at this stage to quantify the number of children who will ultimately reside at the centre, as this will depend entirely on the composition of families seeking asylum.   School enrolment is at an early stage and the RIA is actively engaged with the appropriate State service providers.The centre operates a seven-day bus service which will take residents  to nearby Portlaoise where they can access services usually available in large urban areas.  This bus will operate on an almost hourly basis between 8.30 a.m. and 4.15 p.m., Monday to Friday, seven outward and six inward journeys . A more restricted service of four journeys to and from the centre will be in place on Saturday, Sunday and Bank Holidays.  In addition, residents can avail of the local Bus Éireann service from Portlaoise to Dublin, a private bus contractor service from the centre to Dublin, and the Iarnród Eireann rail service from Portlaoise or Monasterevin to Dublin.The following indoor facilities are already available to residents at the centre:Children's play areaChildren's creche (currently operated on a cooperative basis by the parents)Children's TV / DVDs / Videos / computer gamesAdult-only area with tea / coffee facilitiesPool tableResidents' computer area with internet accessLarge multichannel TV in communal area with DVD player availableA number of pieces of recreational equipment, table soccer and table tennis  will be available at the centre shortly.The following outdoor facilities are available (or shortly will be available) to residents at the centre:Large children's outdoor playground currently in preparation with climbing frames, slides, swings, playhouse, etc., and outdoor seating for parental supervision (equipment on-site but landscaping not yet completed).Large garden areaOutdoor basketball Tarmac court (surface in place, equipment due)Outdoor football Tarmac areaOutdoor sheltered smoking area.The RIA is also aware that the nearby Emo Court estate offers outstanding opportunities for walks of various lengths suitable for a range of fitness levels.  In addition, the soon to be completed Portlaoise Town Adventure Park will offer excellent opportunities for asylum seeker children to interact in a play environment with Irish and other children.  The RIA further understands that the centre will shortly be the venue for a ‘welcome' meeting between the centre residents and local representatives and amenity providers.

The Commissioner has recently submitted proposals to my Department to align Garda Divisions with local authority boundaries which will lead to greater efficiencies and effectiveness for the Force and facilitate more effective operation of the Joint Policing Committees.  The 2008 Annual Policing Plan, which will include the specific aspects of the proposals to be implemented next year, will shortly be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas in compliance with Section 22(6) of the Act.It would be inappropriate for me to comment on the specific matters raised by the Deputy regarding Co. Kildare prior to the policing plans containing such details being laid before the Houses.

The application could not, therefore, be considered under the revised arrangements.   Accordingly,  the applicant was notified of this by letter dated 15 December 2005.The person concerned has submitted an application for consideration in the context of subsidiary protection, pursuant to the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006 which came into force on 10 October 2006, and his eligibility for subsidiary protection will be determined accordingly.If the subsidiary protection application is refused, the case file of the person concerned, including all representations submitted, will be considered under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (Prohibition of Refoulement).  I expect the file to be passed to me for decision in due course.

The Garda Síochána Act 2005 consequently makes provision for this and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose. Following the setting up of the necessary technical systems and auditing of the data from which the statistics are compiled, the CSO is now compiling and publishing criminal statistics and has published provisional headline crime statistics since the third quarter of 2006. In addition, it has compiled and published a series of quarterly and annual statistics for the period starting with the first quarter of 2003. I understand that the CSO are examining how the crime statistics published might be expanded and made more comprehensive.I have requested the CSO to provide the statistics sought by the Deputy directly to him.I am pleased to note that the provisional headline crime figures for the third quarter released by the Central Statistics Office show a decrease of 9.8% in the number of cases of assault causing harm when compared with the same quarter in 2006.

Failure to meet these conditions renders the licence invalid and the provisions of section 38 of the Road Traffic Act 1961 are breached. This renders a person liable to prosecution.I am informed by the Garda authorities that statistics on prosecutions for the offence of not holding a valid driving licence  are not compiled in such a way as to provide a breakdown of prosecutions for this offence where the person prosecuted breached the requirements referred to.The new regulatory provisions introducing learner permits which came into effect on 30 October, 2007, create a specific offence of failing to be accompanied by a full driving licence holder as required by the licensing of driving regulations.

Where a D visa has been approved, the applicant is required to register with the Garda National Immigration Bureau.Visas for entry into Ireland are sought for a wide variety of purposes and the requirements for approval vary having regard to the type of visa applied for.  Comprehensive information on making a visa application is available on the website of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service at www.inis.gov.ie.Visa applications are processed as speedily as possible having regard to the numbers on hand and the resources available to process them.  All applicants are advised to make an application at least eight weeks before their proposed travel date.  At present it takes, on average, four to six weeks to process a straightforward application.I would advise the Deputy that errors in the decision-making process for visa applications are rare and, furthermore, there is an appeal procedure which is available to any applicant who feels that the decision is not the right one.

In that context they may also apply to be exempt from employment permit requirements.The dependants of the aforementioned, who have been legally resident in the State for over five years may also apply for long term residency. This particular long term permission does not grant an exemption from employment permit requirements to any such dependants.Time spent in the State on student conditions cannot be counted towards long term residency.While applications for long term residency are under consideration, the person concerned should ensure that their permission to remain in the State is kept up to date.An application for long term residence from the person referred to by the Deputy was received in July 2007. I understand that applications received in July 2006 are currently being dealt with. As soon as a decision is made on the case, the person concerned will be notified.

Kilfinane is covered by the Bruff District.  The personnel strength of the Bruff District on the same date was 41.  Local Garda management is satisfied that policing in the area adequately caters for the needs of the community in Kilfinane.The Deputy will appreciate that, as with any large organisation, on any given day the overall strength of the organisation may fluctuate due, for example, to  retirements, resignations etc.It is the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner to allocate personnel throughout the force taking everything into account. The situation will be kept under review and when additional personnel next become available the needs of Kilfinane Garda Station will be fully considered by him within the overall context of the needs of Garda Districts/Divisions throughout the country.

In that context they may also apply to be exempt from employment permit requirements.The dependants of the aforementioned, who have been legally resident in the State for over five years may also apply for long term residency. This particular long term permission does not grant an exemption from employment permit requirements to any such dependants.  Time spent in the State on student conditions cannot be counted towards long term residency.  While applications for long term residency are under consideration, the person concerned should ensure that their permission to remain in the State is kept up to date.An application for long term residence from the person referred to by the Deputy was received in August 2006. I understand that applications received in July 2006 are currently being dealt with. As soon as a decision is made on the case, the person concerned will be notified.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	653	I assume the Deputy's question refers to Argentinian nationals whose only direct lineal ancestor to have been born in Ireland was a great-grandparent.My Department has been engaged in extensive correspondence over the last number of years in relation to the question of Irish citizenship for the three individuals concerned and the broader issue of Irish citizenship for Argentinian nationals of Irish descent.The position is that the great-grandchildren of persons born in Ireland can obtain Irish citizenship by registering in the Foreign Births Register provided either of their parents had at the time of their birth acquired Irish citizenship through registration in the Foreign Births Register.  There is one exception to that rule.  If one parent had registered in the Foreign Births Register prior to 31 December 1986, their child can register even if the parent had not registered at the time of that person's birth.If persons are not entitled to Irish citizenship in these circumstances, they can apply for Irish citizenship through naturalisation.  Such applications are considered under the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts 1956 — 2004.  The applicant must fulfil certain statutory requirements including requirements in relation to residency.  However I am empowered to dispense with the statutory conditions in whole or in part in certain circumstances — for example where the applicant is of Irish descent or Irish associations.  Every such application is decided upon on its individual circumstances and in accordance with the law.The three persons referred to in the Deputy's question lodged applications for naturalisation in 2002.  Having considered all of the information available at that time, the three applications were refused.  It is, of course, open to the individuals to apply again for naturalisation at any time in the future.  Any such applications will be considered in the context of the legislation in force at that time.

In that context they may also apply to be exempt from employment permit requirements.  While applications for long term residency are under consideration, the person concerned should ensure that their permission to remain in the State is kept up to date.An application for long term residence from the person referred to by the Deputy was received in September 2006.

The investigation team is based at Coolock Garda Station and is being assisted by specialist units from the National Support Services, including the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation.To date over four hundred persons were interviewed as witnesses and a similar number of statements have been taken during the course of this investigation. Nineteen persons have been arrested and interviewed in connection with the unlawful death of the person referred to.A file on some aspects of this investigation has been forwarded to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and continued consultation is taking place.I am further informed that Garda management is satisfied that sufficient resources are allocated to the investigation and as this is an ongoing Garda investigation it would be inappropriate for me to comment further at this time.I am also informed that a Chief Superintendent has been appointed to carry out an investigation under the Garda Síochána (Discipline) Regulations, 1989, into potential breaches of discipline by members of An Garda Síochána in their dealings with possible threats against the person referred to. This investigation is also on-going and it would be inappropriate for me to comment further at this time.

The Property Registration Authority replaces the Registrar of Deeds and Titles as the registering authority in relation to property registration in Ireland and, subject to the above Act, is independent in the performance of its functions.I would also like to refer the Deputy to a service for TDs and Senators concerning the current status of applications, such as the subject of this question, which was introduced in May 2006.  The service was introduced, inter alia, to provide a speedier and more cost effective alternative to submitting Parliamentary Questions.  This service, which is operated by the Property Registration Authority, is available all year round.I can further inform the Deputy that his query has been forwarded to the Property Registration Authority for attention and direct reply via the above mentioned service.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	661	In determining whether to make a deportation order or grant temporary leave to remain in the State, I must have regard to the eleven factors set out in Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, and Section 5 (Prohibition of Refoulement) of the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended.  Each case is considered in the context of its own individual facts, merits and circumstances.The table below provides the deportation statistics requested by the Deputy:YearNumber of deportation orders madeNumber of deportation orders effected20022,43052120032,41159120042,91559920051,89939620061,566302Total11,2212,409The effect of a deportation order is that the person concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter outside the State. A person who is the subject of a deportation order may re-enter the State legally by first seeking and obtaining the revocation of his/her deportation order. Such an application would require substantial grounds to be successful. Any person attempting to return to the State while still the subject of a valid deportation order, is liable to arrest and detention pursuant to Section 5 of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended.I can confirm that there are no fixed controls in respect of persons travelling between North and South and there is no possibility of introducing such controls in the future.  Of course I am concerned, and I know that this concern is widely shared both here and in Great Britain, that persons can exploit this absence of fixed controls to move illegally within the CTA.  In this regard, I would like to emphasise that the Garda National Immigration Bureau, the British Border and Immigration Agency and the British police work closely together and run regular intelligence led operations aimed at interrupting such illegal movement.  These joint operations have successfully prevented foreign nationals moving illegally between the two jurisdictions.  Officials from my Department, the Garda National Immigration Bureau and the British Border and Immigration Agency are examining ways to further build on this cooperation.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	666	Part 11 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006, which provides for civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by adults, was commenced on 1 January, 2007. Part 13 of the Act relating to anti-social behaviour by children was commenced on 1 March, 2007. These provisions set out an incremental procedure for addressing anti-social behaviour by adults and children.  With regard to children, these range from a warning from a member of An Garda Síochána, to a good behaviour contract involving the child and his or her parents or guardian, to referral to the Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme and to the making of a behaviour order by the Children's Court.In setting up this regime, the intention was that these warnings or good behaviour contracts would themselves address the problem behaviour.  It is only if they fail that a civil order (in the case of an adult) or a behaviour order (in the case of a child) would be applied for by An Garda Síochána.I am informed by the Garda authorities that up to 30 September, 2007, 264 behaviour warnings have been issued to adults and 80 behaviour warnings to children. Where these do not succeed in altering a person's behaviour, they will culminate in An Garda Síochána applying to the courts for an order.During this period the Carlow/Kildare Garda Division, which includes Carlow Garda District, issued 16 behaviour warnings to adults and two to children. The Waterford/Kilkenny Garda Division, which includes the Kilkenny and Thomastown Garda Districts, issued seven behaviour warnings to adults and three to children in the same period.Figures are provisional, operational and liable to change.

It is designed to provide financial assistance from my Department to qualifying local organisations towards meeting the capital costs associated with the establishment of local community-run CCTV systems. The scheme operates at two levels: initial funding for the assessment of needs and substantive funding for fully developed proposals.  Matching funding for RAPID areas is available from the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  Pobal has been engaged to administer the Scheme on behalf of my Department.I have been informed by Pobal that to date no application has been received under the Community-based CCTV Scheme from any group in Courtown, County Wexford.  I am committed to the further expansion of the community-based CCTV around the country and this process is ongoing.  It is intended to invite applications for funding under the Community-based CCTV Scheme periodically and it will be open to any group to submit an application for funding.  Further details of the scheme and relevant documentation are available at my Department's website (www.justice.ie) or at Pobal's website (www.pobal.ie).

These are generally dealt with in chronological order as this is deemed to be the fairest to all applicants. It is likely, therefore, that further processing of the application will commence in early 2009.I will inform the Deputy and the person in question when I have reached a decision on the matter.

Part 13 of the Act relating to anti-social behaviour by children was commenced on 1 March, 2007. These provisions set out an incremental procedure for addressing anti-social behaviour by adults and children.  With regard to children, these range from a warning from a member of An Garda Síochána, to a good behaviour contract involving the child and his or her parents or guardian, to referral to the Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme and to the making of a behaviour order by the Children's Court.I am informed by the Garda authorities that up to 30 September, 2007, 284 behaviour warnings to adults and 80 behaviour warnings to children have been issued.During this period the Dublin Metropolitan Region North Garda Division issued eight behaviour warnings to adults.  Figures are provisional, operational and liable to change.

Following the evaluation of the submissions received in respect of the RFI a total of six companies/consortia were short-listed in February 2007 to participate in the next stage of the process.A detailed Request for Tender (RFT) was issued to the six short-listed candidates, with a closing date of 23 August, 2007 set for receipt of  tenders. The process of selecting a preferred bidder is well advanced. Roll-out of the cameras would be dependent, inter alia, on the conclusion of contract discussions with the preferred bidder.The purpose of the safety camera initiative is to enhance overall road safety and help reduce the numbers of deaths and serious injuries on our roads by reducing the incidence of drivers exceeding the speed limits set. The operational criteria to be applied will be determined by An Garda Síochána, and the deployment of cameras will be focused on locations where there is an established or prospective risk of collisions. Speed monitoring will take place on the basis of a matrix which will link the monitoring to speed related collision data.With a view to ensuring on-going appropriate deployment of safety cameras, the service provider will conduct regular speed surveys at locations identified as having the greatest propensity for speed related collisions.The requirements of a system to monitor the individual speed of vehicles and one to gain broader information with a view to traffic management obviously differ. I am informed by the Garda authorities that the safety cameras operated by the service provider will be used for speed enforcement only. It is not currently envisaged that the safety camera system will be used for traffic management or the pursuit of other road traffic offences.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	680	Section 34 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 enables a planning authority to grant a planning permission subject to or without conditions as appropriate. While the interpretation of planning legislation is a matter in each case for the planning authority concerned and ultimately for the Courts, the legislation sets out that in making decisions on planning applications, planning authorities must consider the proper planning and sustainable development of the area, having regard to the provisions of the development plan, any submissions or observations received, and relevant Ministerial or Government policies.While the legislation does not specifically address the question of planning conditions which would make significant changes to the application, my Department's Development Management Guidelines for Planning Authorities, issued in June 2007, states, under the heading "Conditions directly departing from the application" that:"A condition that radically alters the nature of the development to which the application relates will usually be unacceptable. For example, a condition should not require the omission of a use, which forms an essential part of a proposed development, or a complete re-design of a development.  If there is a fundamental objection to a significant part of a development proposal, and this cannot fairly be dealt with in isolation from the rest of the proposal, the proper course is to refuse permission for the whole."These Guidelines, which are available on my Department's website  at www.environ.ie,  were issued under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 and planning authorities and An Bord Pleanála are required to have regard to them in the exercise of their planning functions.Finally, in relation to site notices, the Programme for Government sets out a clear commitment to review planning regulations to strengthen the provision regarding potential abuse of public notice provisions. My Department is currently examining this issue.

These items are used primarily for binding electric cables or wires, to keep wires away from moving parts and to help trace and service wiring systems.  They are also commonly used to prevent hub-caps from falling off moving vehicles.  While I agree that the use of cable ties for public postering needs to be discouraged, I do not believe that the imposition of a levy on sales of the product would be a proportionate response as most sales are likely to be for legitimate purposes.Section 19 of the Litter Pollution Act 1997 makes it an offence to exhibit articles or advertisements on property in, or visible from, a public place without the prior written authority of the relevant owner, occupier or person in charge of that property.  This provision also extends to any ties used to secure such advertisements.  Exemptions are provided in the case of advertisements advertising a public meeting, other than an auction, and in relation to certain election posters; however, the advertisement and all related cable ties must be removed at the latest seven days after the date of such meeting or election.Under the Litter Pollution Acts 1997 to 2003 primary responsibility for developing and implementing responses to litter pollution rests with local authorities.  It is a matter for each local authority to ensure that its functional area is, as far as practicable, kept free of litter and that cleaning, including the removal of cable ties associated with public postering, is scheduled to achieve this.It is the duty of all political parties and others involved in public meetings, elections and referenda to comply with litter legislation.  My Department has reminded local authorities and political parties regularly of the relevant provisions of litter legislation in the context of elections, in particular the requirements of the Litter Pollution Acts 1997 to 2003 to remove posters and poster ties within 7 days of polling.

It also imposes a duty on local authorities to take all reasonable steps (including the exercise of any appropriate statutory powers) to ensure that any land within their functional area does not become or continue to be a derelict site.  To this end, local authorities are empowered to direct the owner of land to take specified measures to prevent it becoming or continuing to be a derelict site, to acquire by agreement or compulsorily any derelict site within their functional area, or to take appropriate steps with a view to the imposition of a levy on derelict sites.  It is a matter for local authorities to pursue payment of a derelict sites levy, which may be recovered as a simple contract debt in any court of competent jurisdiction and which is a charge on the land concerned until it is paid.

The Directive requires that no later than 16 July 2016, biodegradable municipal waste going to landfill must be reduced to 35% of the total amount (by weight) of biodegradable municipal waste produced in 1995.  The National Strategy on Biodegradable Waste sets recycling targets for paper and cardboard of 55% by 2010, 65% by 2013 and 67% by 2016.  This compares with a recycling rate of just under 50% achieved in 2005.The attainment of these targets presents a formidable challenge for the sectors involved, including the newsprint industry. Discussions are ongoing between my Department and the newsprint industry with a view to developing a producer responsibility initiative (PRI) for the recovery and recycling of newspapers and magazines.  A Joint Industry Taskforce co-ordinated by National Newspapers of Ireland (NNI) is leading the negotiations with my Department.Discussions have focused on waste prevention and minimisation issues in the newsprint industry, specifically the practice of "Boxing Out" i.e. oversupply of newsprint; recovery and recycling of unsold newspapers and magazines, and post–consumer newsprint waste.Since the establishment of the Taskforce progress has been made by the industry in increasing the use of recycled paper in newsprint.  My Department has asked the Taskforce to develop an industry code of practice with a view to preventing and minimising waste in this sector.  At the suggestion of the Department, the National Newspapers of Ireland (NNI) representing the newsprint publishers have now appointed an Environment Officer who is examining the issues referred to above.  NNI have been engaged recently in a further round of consultations with the other Taskforce organisations.  I understand that NNI hope to complete work on developing a proposal and that this will be submitted to my Department shortly.  I am concerned that a stable and sustainable industry initiative for the management of this important waste stream be developed as early as possible.

An additional 395 general dog licences were also issued in that year.  A general dog licence authorises a person to hold an unspecified number of dogs.Returns from local authorities indicate that the amount of money raised in 2006 through the issue of licences and from on-the-spot fines was some €2.6 million.  950 persons paid on-the-spot fines and 103 were successfully prosecuted in 2006 for breaches of Section 2 of the Control of Dogs Acts 1986-1992, relating to licensing requirements.

It has raised awareness of the litter problem in participating towns and cities and helped stimulate local business and community groups to do something about it.I assume that the question refers to the IBAL proposal that a litter commissioner should be put in place to manage litter in Dublin City.  This was suggested by IBAL in August 2006 following the publication of a litter survey that IBAL had carried out in Dublin.  Under the Litter Pollution Acts 1997 to 2003 primary responsibility for developing and implementing responses to litter pollution rests with local authorities.  It is a matter for each local authority to ensure that its functional area is, as far as practicable, kept free of litter.In Dublin City Council, delegated responsibility for litter management is assigned to the appropriate Assistant City Manager.  As far as the Department is aware, Dublin City Council considers this organisational arrangement to be appropriate.

A key function of the Boards is to bring about the more integrated delivery of public services at local level via their Strategies for Economic, Social and Cultural Development.CDBs were given statutory recognition in the Local Government Act, 2001.  However, the Boards themselves are not executive bodies and do not have a specific budget of their own.  They are supported in the main by the relevant local authority and implementation of the Boards' Strategies is the responsibility of their member agencies, having regard to available resources.CDBs completed a review of their Strategies in 2006 to ensure that they remain focused on key priorities over the following three years.  In this context, independent consultants were appointed to examine the Strategy Reviews and bring forward recommendations to develop and strengthen the Boards in line with a commitment in Towards 2016.  The consultants recently submitted their final report to my Department and it is expected that this will be available in the near future.

The majority of such requests are met within the statutory timeframes. In cases where it becomes apparent that there will be difficulties meeting these timeframes, for example due to the large volume of records involved in the request, it is normal practice to consult with the applicant and agree mutually satisfactory arrangements to overcome any such difficulties.

Most of these plans are posted on the website of my Department's National Parks and Wildlife Service, www.npws.ie.  I envisage that a further 56 SAC plans will be the subject of public consultation before the end of this year.  Draft plans for another 94 sites are currently in preparation.

The NPWS scheme can be beneficial to those whom REPS does not suit for any reason.  My Department will shortly be notifying relevant landowners of the designations for protection of the hen harrier.  Additional compensation, at a rate agreed with farming representative organisations, is available to farmers whose land includes habitats of threatened species and who agree to follow the scientific prescriptions for farming in an environmentally friendly way to preserve these habitats through the farm plan scheme.  Compensation payments are also available from my Department to farmers, based on stocking levels contained in the Commonage Framework Plans that were drawn up for commonage land and came into effect on 1 January 2003.As regards conservation of bogs, my Department continues to purchase, on a voluntary basis, the freehold or turbary rights in raised bog SACs.  Turf cutting in most of these SACs is due to end in 2008.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	708	Section 34 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 provides planning authorities with the discretionary powers to grant planning permission subject to conditions as appropriate to the individual project. Under the Strategic Infrastructure Act, 2006, An Bord Pleanála has powers to attach conditions in respect of applications made to it under the new strategic consent process. In relation to electricity transmission lines specifically, this means that planning authorities and the Board already have powers to require that power lines be placed underground, if, for example, they are in close proximity to inhabited dwellings, or exceed a particular voltage.The interpretation and implementation of planning legislation is a matter in each case for the planning authority concerned and ultimately for the Courts. However, the legislation sets out that in making decisions on planning applications, planning authorities must consider the proper planning and sustainable development of the area, having regard to the provisions of the development plan, any submissions or observations received, and relevant Ministerial or Government policies.  I believe the current discretionary powers available to the Board and to planning authorities to be appropriate. Accordingly, I have no proposals at the moment to make the suggested amendment.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	709	The Government published the report of the Expert Group on the Health Effects of Electromagnetic Fields earlier in 2007. The Report examined a wide range of issues in relation to the potential health effects of electromagnetic fields, including those produced by electric appliances in the home and from electricity pylons. It answers many of the health risk questions raised by the public in relation to the potential effects of electromagnetic fields, and is available for download on the Department's website (www.environ.ie).With regard to Extremely Low Frequency (ELF) fields emitted by electricity power lines, the Report concluded that there is limited scientific evidence of adverse health effects. The Expert Group have recommended that precautionary measures be used, where appropriate, and that Ireland continue to adopt and enforce the international guidelines developed by the International Commission on Non-ionising Radiation Protection and endorsed by the World Health Organisation and the European Union.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	710	Nuttall's pondweed (Elodea nuttallii) has long, leafy underwater stems that are initially rooted in the substrate, but which subsequently become detached.  Reproduction in Ireland is exclusively by fragmentation.  It is tolerant of disturbance and can grow in moderately saline water.  It forms very dense submerged stands, occupying the water column from top to bottom, posing a serious impediment to drinking water abstraction and recreational water use, and it can result in fish kills.  As with other species of invasive plants it is very difficult to control.  Physical removal may simply exacerbate the problem by fragmenting the plant; each portion can start a new colony.  Chemical treatment is severely restricted in waterways by EU law.  The plant is spreading in Ireland and is widespread in small ornamental and artificial fishery lakes.  It is currently replacing Canadian Pondweed (Elodea canadensis) on long sections of the Grand Canal.Section 52 of the Wildlife Act 1976 (as amended) provides for the making of regulations prohibiting the possession or introduction of any species of wild flora which may be detrimental to native species. It is my intention to make regulations under this section in the first quarter of 2008, and to provide for a short lead in time, after which possession or introduction of Nuttall's pondweed will be prohibited.   My purpose is to prevent its further dispersal through garden centres for use in ponds and aquaria, from which it may escape or be released into the wild.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	711	Mink found in the wild in Ireland are descended from animals that escaped from fur farms.  They have been breeding in the wild since the 1950s and are now found throughout the country.  As wild mink are not protected under the Wildlife Acts 1976 and 2000 my Department has no function in relation to them, and therefore there are no population figures available to me.  My Department carries out trapping of mink to protect particular bird colonies.  As mink is not a protected species they can also be trapped freely by landowners and their agents.A major scientific study, which was carried out over three years, 1983 to 1986, into the biology of the feral mink and its impact and control issues in Ireland, concluded that mink populations naturally stabilise.  While recommending trapping in specific locations where they are causing a problem, e.g. to game birds or to island and colony nesting birds, the study concluded that it is difficult substantially to reduce mink populations over larger areas.  It advised that attempting to do so could even exacerbate the problem by creating a vacuum to be filled by young colonisers, which would be liable to cause more problems than a well-established, stabilised population. In most situations the scientific advice is that it is best to leave mink to stabilise naturally.

I am now considering the Hunt's response and I will make my decision on the licence application as soon as possible.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	713	Budget 2006 included provision of a sum of €2 million, through the Department of Social and Family Affairs, for the delivery in Waterford, in 2007 by Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) of a fuel poverty initiative supplementary to the Warmer Homes Scheme.  The initiative includes high efficiency central heating as well as substantial insulation measures to address whole house energy efficiency, to be applied within the Waterford city and county area.  The package of measures provided under the Waterford Initiative thus represents a significant extension to both the level and cost of interventions applied to address fuel poverty.The Waterford Initiative is being delivered on an introductory basis to approximately 400 owner occupied homes.  It does not include local authority homes, since they are separately covered by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government programme.  The research component for the Waterford Initiative will assess the effectiveness of the proposed interventions in addressing fuel poverty.  The results from this research will be available next year and will inform any future programme decisions.  There are no current plans to extend the programme beyond its current remit.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	714	The Government is committed to promoting and incentivising energy efficiency.  I published a draft National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for public consultation on 3 October and I identified in that draft Plan in excess of 60 actions that Government may use to achieve energy efficiency savings of at least 20% by 2020.The residential sector is a key area and offers much potential for energy savings, particularly in terms of the generally poorer insulation standards of older housing stock.  The Programme for Government 2007-2012 commits to the introduction of a domestic insulation programme.  Officials from my Department, in consultation with Sustainable Energy Ireland, are considering options in this regard for my consideration with a view to implementation of an appropriate scheme to meet the commitment in the Programme for Government.

The development of a verifiable metering system for micro-scale producers will be facilitated by the development of a smart-metering solution, the pilot scheme for which was launched earlier this week.  My Department is working with Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI), the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), ESB Networks and the Electro-Technical Council of Ireland, to deliver the other arrangements that will be needed to allow domestic power generation be sold back to the national grid.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	720	The Bioenergy Action Plan sets out, among other things, measures aimed at encouraging farmers to grow energy crops.  The move to a biofuels obligation in 2009 together with our ambitious targets, is creating opportunities for the farming community to diversify into energy crops.  The production of energy crops in Ireland is relatively underdeveloped and the incentives put in place by my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, are designed to encourage further development.Ireland currently has 400,000 hectares of land under tillage and 75,000 hectares of land would be required if all of the 2% biofuels target were to be met from indigenous crops. By establishing targets of 5.75% and 10% market penetration by 2010 and 2020, we are creating a Biofuels market framework in which Irish farmers will have significant opportunities to participate.  While there is a significant increase in indigenous feedstocks being used in the biofuels scheme, I am not in a position to state the precise percentage of indigenous raw materials being used.In the case of larger scale, long-term developments under the scheme, where significant investments are required, a degree of imports have been identified as necessary until facilities and feedstock supply chains are in place.  The majority of applicants under the scheme have indicated that it is their immediate or longer term intention to locate processing facilities in Ireland.
