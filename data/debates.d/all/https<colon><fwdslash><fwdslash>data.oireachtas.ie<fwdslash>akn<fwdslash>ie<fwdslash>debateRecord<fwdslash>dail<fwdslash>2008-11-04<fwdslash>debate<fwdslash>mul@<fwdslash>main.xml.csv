#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	0	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, together.The Government does not plan to hold any constitutional referendum at present.  I would like it put on the record again that neither I nor my Department is responsible for the implementation of all the recommendations of the Joint Committee on the Constitution.The fine work of the current committee and its predecessors has produced 11 reports, which form a very useful repository of informed work on various aspects of the Constitution.  Many recommendations have been acted upon and many others continue to be under active consideration by the relevant Minister or Department.  However, the committee does not report to me — the reports are published and the recommendations are made for all.As issues arise, they will be dealt with appropriately and the valuable information contained in these reports will be availed of.  If there is any particular recommendation of interest to Deputies, they should get in touch with, or table a parliamentary question to, the relevant Minister.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	1	Arising from the Taoiseach's response, will he outline the Government's current position on the endorsement of the Lisbon treaty?  Everybody knows the decision of the Irish people was in the negative.  The fact is that the Lisbon treaty cannot come into effect unless or until it is endorsed by the people of this country.An analysis was carried out of the "No" campaign.  Was any analysis carried out of the "Yes" campaign?  Have the Heads of the other EU Governments asked the Taoiseach to consider holding a second Lisbon treaty referendum before the European Parliament elections scheduled for the first week of June 2009?  If so, will spending and fundraising rules be introduced to prevent a repeat of the behaviour of a number of groups and organisations involved in the last Lisbon treaty campaign?What is the position of the Taoiseach, as Head of Government, on responding in December to the Heads of Government meeting at the Council in view of President Sarkozy's statement that his aim is to reach agreement between the 27 member states on the common path during that meeting?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	2	Our position on the Lisbon treaty is obviously as Deputy Kenny states.  What we have been doing with colleagues, counterparts, governments and institutions in the European Union is providing them with the information we have gleaned from the survey on why people voted "Yes" or "No" in the referendum in May, and indicating to them, as I did at the October meeting, the broad areas we need to discuss further as to whether concerns raised during the last campaign can be dealt with.  Our task is to engage in this exercise with them between now and December.  On the basis of the outcome of that exercise, we will determine how to proceed from there.  Obviously, it is the hope of the Government and the other 26 member states to be able to indicate a pathway forward and the elements to move the issue forward.On the question of spending and fundraising rules, I have not sought to address that issue in any way.  It has not arisen and we are still working on the policy issues concerned.The statements of the President of the Council obviously reflect the European Council conclusions which we discussed here last week and which indicate the hope that we can all outline the elements of the way forward by way of a roadmap.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	3	Arising from that reply, does the Taoiseach agree the Lisbon treaty cannot be endorsed or brought into effect unless or until the Irish people decide to do so?  Does he accept there are only two options, namely, to proceed down some legal route, with some element of constitutionality thrown in, or to decide to put the question to the people again?  I respect the good work the Oireachtas Sub-Committee on Ireland's Future in the European Union in this regard.  I have seen some of the contributions made at its meetings.  I am sure the sub-committee will publish a number of recommendations or proposals when it concludes its work on 28 November 2008.Consider the serious implications for the next European Commission, which, according to the Nice treaty, must have its membership reduced to a number less than the number of member states in the Union, that is, less than 27.  There is considerable angst and concern in EU member states over the fighting of the EU elections on the basis of the Nice treaty rather than the Lisbon treaty, as they had expected.  These are obviously matters for the Taoiseach and the Government to consider.  Are we likely to have another attempt to have the Lisbon treaty endorsed?  That is the bottom line.  If that is to be the eventual decision does the Taoiseach see it happening before or after the European elections in June next year?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	4	The Deputy is asking me to speculate on work that is still ongoing, its purpose being to see in what way the concerns raised by the people can be addressed.  Until that exercise is conducted and until we see if we can form the basis of an agreement to move forward it is speculative to say what might happen.  Obviously we are very grateful that colleague governments and other member states are providing us with the opportunity to explore those options with them.  Until we explore them, have those conversations and see what is available, we know only one thing, namely, that 26 states do not wish to revert to their parliaments for re-ratification of the treaty.  It is also obvious that unless all 27 states ratify the treaty it will not come into force.  The political dilemma is how to act in solidarity with colleagues and other member states while respecting the decision we came to; we must see in what way we can move the situation forward based on further clarification and elucidation of the concerns raised during the course of the last referendum.  That is the exercise we are involved in at present and to project beyond that at this point is premature.

I would not question the Taoiseach's honesty but how straight is he being with us in this House and with the electorate?  Last week he had ample opportunity to indicate to us his intentions regarding a second referendum on the Lisbon treaty.  Today he has again had the opportunity and yet we read over the course of the weekend that it is the intention of the Government to hold a second referendum on the Lisbon treaty in 2009.  Will the Taoiseach comment on those press reports and tell us exactly what status he attributes to them?  How accurate are they?  It is important that we know exactly the situation.  How straight is the Taoiseach with the electorate when so far he has clearly failed to accept the verdict of the people in respect of the Lisbon treaty during the earlier stage of this year?  He will differ strongly from what I have to say.Will the Taoiseach accept that it is of great concern to the people that they have exercised their democratic right and have expressed their will in the course of a properly constituted referendum?  They have given their answer.  The Irish electorate expects the Taoiseach and Government to represent its views in Europe and not to kowtow to what is clearly a bullying exercise on the part of other parliamentary interests across the European Union.  The Taoiseach will reject this terminology but can he outline to us what steps he has taken to address the critical issues that were identified during the course of the referendum, namely, sovereignty, neutrality, workers' rights, protection of public services, etc.?  What steps has he taken to seek to re-negotiate a treaty that will address all those core concerns of the people?  These include a social progress clause for workers, strengthening of key vetoes in public services, taxation and international trade, the securing of the removal of the self-amending clauses including Article 48 and the retention of Ireland's permanent Commissioner.  Would the Taoiseach agree that these are the actions, utterances and commitments that the electorate, having clearly spoken during the course of a protracted Lisbon referendum campaign earlier this year, now expects of its Taoiseach and Government?  Does he accept that there is no evidence that he has in any way lived up to those expectations and that there is a clear and ever growing frustration, not only on the part of those who voted "No" to Lisbon but also among many who voted "Yes" and are looking on in incredulity at their Government's failure to respect democratic wishes?My party asked the following question of the Taoiseach's predecessor regarding the Nice treaty and perhaps the Taoiseach will avail of the opportunity to make his position clear on the matter.  If he is proposing to have a second referendum on the Lisbon treaty, will he let us have a "best of three"?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	7	I fundamentally disagree with Deputy Ó Caoláin on all these matters for the following reasons.  The decision of the Irish people is being respected and the Lisbon treaty cannot be ratified without the agreement of all member states, including the Irish people, in the matter.  The problem we have is our understanding of the consequences of the real situation.  The Deputy outlined to me the Sinn Féin version of the world which is that we would go back and renegotiate the treaty.  Having spoken to the Heads of State and Government of the other 26 member states which negotiated the treaty, the option of renegotiation is not available because they do not wish to re-ratify or renegotiate the treaty.

I have attended many functions at which prominent members of the Deputy's party who hold executive responsibility welcomed the fact that funds are being provided under INTERREG on the Border for this, that and the other.  Thanks to the solidarity of citizens of the European Union, many millions of euro have facilitated all of that.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	14	At the same time, however, the Deputy is telling me not to kowtow to bullying exercises.  There is no bullying taking place; member states are stating positions.  Ireland must decide where this leaves us, what we want to do about it and which of the concerns raised it will be possible to have addressed in a way that would give people more confidence on some of the issues.  That is my job and responsibility.Deputy Ó Caoláin can remain on the Opposition benches, from which he can continue to argue that the Irish people has spoken and that is the end of the matter but I have to determine what is in our national interest arising out of that decision, while also respecting it.  The idea that this matter is done and dusted, we can proceed as before, our position has not changed, our interests are fine and we can wait to see whether others will decide to renegotiate the treaty, is wrong.  Other member states have stated their position.Obviously, if we maintain our present position and the treaty is not ratified, it will create a new political situation at European level, which I do not believe would be in our interests.  In the meantime, I will do my job, which is to see in what way I can address some of the concerns being raised.  I will establish from member states at the December Council what precisely is available, rather that what the Deputy claims is or should be available, in this 27-way street as opposed to two-way or one-way street.  A consensus has been built up over many years of negotiation and we have made a certain decision which others respect.  Having established what further issues can be addressed to us, we will return to the House and determine where we will go from there.One cannot continue to carry on as if the realities are as set out by Deputy Ó Caoláin.  All the realities have to be put on the table and if the reality is that Irish people decide they do not want to be part of the building up of the institutions of the European Union or the direction in which it is going, let us have a clear understanding of how that affects our interests.  Let us have a debate on the issue.Let us understand what we are doing as a consequence.  I am not questioning the decision.  That decision was taken.  Decisions are taken by democratic vote in parliaments and by governments and local authorities every day of the week.  However, I would be a long time waiting for Deputy Ó Caoláin's view of the world to extend to me.

Does the Taoiseach not accept it is about one's view of the democratically expressed will of the Irish people?  With all due respect to the response he has given, which was a typical filibuster on his part, he never answered a single question I put to him.

It was as empty a response as could be.  Does he not have a responsibility to answer this Deputy fairly and the Irish people responsibly, and state clearly what his intentions are?  He has failed time after time to use the opportunity to confirm the situation.  This is another opportunity for him.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	26	We will leave that aside for the moment.  The first point is that no decision has been taken on a second referendum.  The second point is that the situation at the moment is as the people decided last May.  The third point is that the 26 other member states have given their views as a result of that and, fourth, it is my job to work with them to see whether the concerns raised in the referendum might possibly be addressed so that we can make an assessment of where we go from here.  Finally, the idea that we can reject the treaty and there are no consequences is cuckoo land.

Will he say whether there is any provision in the Estimates and the budget for the holding of a referendum in 2009?  The question relates not just to whether there will be another referendum on Europe, but to referendums in general.  What is the position in relation to the holding of a referendum on children's rights and what are the Government's intentions in that regard?Reference is made in the Agreed Programme for Government to the possibility of a referendum on the introduction of means to ensure that criminal trials may no longer be collapsed on the grounds of legal technicalities.  Is it intended to hold a referendum on that matter?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	28	I do not have any supplementary information on the last point raised by the Deputy.I have no problem talking to Opposition party leaders before the December Council meeting.No provision was made in the Estimates for a referendum next year because no decision has been taken.  Calls for a constitutional amendment to enshrine children's rights under the Constitution have been referred to.  Government proposals to amend the Constitution in relation to children were published in the Twenty-eighth Amendment to the Constitution Bill 2007.  The programme for Government includes a commitment to deepen consensus on these proposals.  As a result, a Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children was established in November 2007.  The committee has already presented an interim report to the Oireachtas recommending that the Government should publish legislation to establish a statutory scheme for Garda vetting and the exchange of soft information on persons posing a threat to children.  That is the current position.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	30	I cannot anticipate any Government decision.  As of today, that is the situation.  I have explained what the Government is attempting to achieve in its work with colleagues at the European level, arising out of the various European Councils we have had and the conclusions that have been reached since the most recent referendum.  I do not wish to anticipate any decision until we see how this process proceeds.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	31	I return to the Lisbon treaty.  The Taoiseach said we were assessing the implications of our decision through the work of the sub-committee and considering how the reason Ireland voted "No" can be addressed and how we can move ahead.  There are some practical problems in that regard.  By this time next year we will have to deal with the question of the Commission and its size.  Currently, the Commission is decided on the basis of the Nice treaty — for which we voted on the second occasion — and this means the Commission must be smaller than the number of member states and some countries would lose out in terms of the appointment of a Commissioner.  Does the Taoiseach envisage a situation whereby the lifetime of the existing Commission could be extended into 2010, which would allow for plenty of time for the Taoiseach to consider the options open to him, and the question of the extension of the  Commission would not be a constitutional issue?  I would say the 27 member states could agree this.From my involvement with the European People's Party, I can confirm for the Taoiseach that there is a major practical issue with regard to the holding of the elections next June on the basis of Nice, rather than Lisbon as originally intended.  The Irish people have made their decision on this and it is expected the elections will be fought on the basis of the Nice treaty, which has implications for the number of MEPs in a number of countries, but does not impact on us.  Does the Taoiseach see this issue being addressed at the December summit or is it a foregone conclusion that the elections next year will be held on the basis of the Nice treaty?Another problem brought to my attention relates to referenda generally, where there may be a need for tidying up.  No disrespect to the current incumbent, but a number of people have mentioned that the period of time for the Presidency is seven years.  There seems to be a view that this might be adjusted to a five-year period, but this would require a referendum.  I do not know whether the Taoiseach's immediate predecessor is interested in that, but I hear comments in that regard in various locations around the country.  Has the Taoiseach a view on that?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	32	I do not see any reason to change the term of office of the President of Ireland, as seven years is a proper and adequate length.  I am not aware of any major public demand to change the term.On the other questions, if the treaty of Lisbon is not ratified before May 2009, the European Parliament elections will have to be held under the existing arrangements.  The question of whether that will be the case depends on the work that is ongoing.  I cannot anticipate the outcome of the December Council or what its conclusions will be.  Obviously, member states would like to bring some clarity to the issue of the basis for the holding the elections at that point. Many of their selection arrangements will, I am sure, kick in and the list systems in countries with various methods of selection will come into play on these issues.  That issue may be addressed at the December Council meeting.However, it is idle to speculate beyond the fact that we are engaged in this process and we have undertaken with colleagues to proceed with our efforts.  Come December, it is the hope of all 27 member states that we will be in a position to set out the elements of a roadmap so that certainty and clarity are brought to issues in order to address some of the uncertainties to which the Deputy referred.In regard to the Commission, I could not offer a substitute for the legal advice of the Commission and the Council's legal services on these matters in terms of the practical arrangements which might be found.  In purely legal terms, I would not think there is much leeway beyond the tenure itself.  Some form of minor extension may be possible but I do not think it could be done as simply as was suggested.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	33	I raise the issue because, as the Taoiseach will be aware, the Lisbon treaty contains a reverse clause.  Irrespective of how the Government decides to seek endorsement of Lisbon by the Irish people, the 27 member states could decide in December, if the treaty is endorsed by Ireland, to invoke this clause.  According to Millward Brown and others, retaining a Commissioner was a matter of interest to the Irish people, although it was my view that, with 27 Commissioners, we would have Commissioners for back gardens and whatever else rather than positions with real influence.  Perhaps the other 26 Heads of State will consider the clause in conjunction with the Taoiseach at December's Council meeting.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	34	A range of views are expressed on individual issues but, particularly in light of events that have arisen in the past several months, such as the Georgia situation and the international financial crisis, it is a strongly held view that speedy co-ordination and institutional rigour within the institutions are prerequisites for the Union's effectiveness, not only in its own region but also globally.  The other 26 member states firmly believe that the institutional arrangements of the Lisbon treaty would greatly advance the effectiveness of the European Union in its present enlarged situation and were other states to join subsequently.  In regard to these matters, which are often discussed in isolation, many member states would contend that a delicate institutional balance was struck between the Parliament, the Commission and the Council, and the changes must be seen as a package.  It is important that we understand this view is strongly held by others.

Leaving aside Government decisions, he has not yet told us his intentions.On a separate constitutional matter and not to let the opportunity pass, has the Taoiseach given consideration since taking office to an idea proposed by my party when we tabled a Bill on the constitutional right to housing?  Has the Taoiseach noted, as many of us who leave this institution late in the evening do, the number of people who remain homeless on the streets of this city?  Does he accept this is not confined to the streets of Dublin but is echoed in many major population centres and large towns throughout the country?  Would he accept that, in this ever-straightening economic climate, with repossession requests building almost weekly and repossession orders being granted, more and more people are facing straightened circumstances in respect of housing provision for themselves and their families?  A key approach would be a confirmation of the constitutional right of citizens to housing, which would be a significant impetus in addressing the need of social housing provision throughout the country.  This has not been addressed with the focus required, or we would not be looking at such misery on our streets.  At this time of the year, it becomes increasingly apparent and distressing.  I ask the Taoiseach to take my urging on this matter.  It is a matter on which we could find common purpose and support.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	44	The constitutional tradition is not to enumerate each constitutional right in the Constitution.  We have a doctrine of unenumerated rights, directives of social policy, Articles 41 and 44 and a range of articles where the rights of citizens are well-protected by our courts.  They have displayed an ability to develop Irish jurisprudence in a way in which we can all be proud.In recent times, there has been a tendency to suggest including in the Constitution every problem that is identified.  The Constitution is a set of principles, which are not meant as an all-encompassing set of rights limited to those mentioned therein.  Nor are they interpreted by those in the Supreme Court — the only ones who can interpret the Constitution — as such.  That has been a fundamental part of Irish judicial thinking for many years.  Through the provisions that exist, we can seek to ensure that statutory rights are respected and that we continue with the developments in this area, of which this Administration can be proud.  One quarter of all houses extant in Ireland have been built in the past 12 or 13 years.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	45	The Taoiseach referred to the consequences of the referendum decision on the Lisbon treaty.  One of those consequences was that Irish citizens do not have access to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which would have been part of the Lisbon treaty, had it been ratified.  That would have provided Irish citizens, in European law, with a right to housing.  Has the Taoiseach or the Government given consideration to enshrining the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the Constitution?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	46	No, one must be careful that what might seem like a good idea might raise questions of interpretation and might affect existing jurisprudence.  These are complex issues and the Charter of Fundamental Rights stands in its own right.  It has been set within the treaty context. Incorporating this into our constitutional law in that way would not necessarily provide the clarity people believe it might bring in terms of how it would impact on existing property rights, etc., within our Constitution.  This is a complex area of the direct applicability of EU law.  Our treaties are incorporated as part of our constitutional law, depending on what provisions we use in terms of when we put them before the people.  In practice, that has been the outcome.In an effort to bring more clarity to the situation, we are concentrating very much on some of the issues raised that had an impact on people's view of the treaty.  I emphasise again that all the evidence suggests that the Irish people are pro the European Union and pro what we have achieved during the past 35 years.  Specific issues arose which were debated.  People took a certain view on them.  Whether there was a sufficient legal basis for that view is not something I want to go into now, but clearly we need to bring some more clarity to these issues.  We should concentrate on that in the coming months.

Will he accept also that the enshrining of a particular right in the Constitution is not the assertion of a principle, that the Constitution creates an imperative, that there is a huge and critical difference here and that the Government must respect that and act accordingly?  The imperative that placing the right to housing in the Constitution would create would allow for hopefully a more dynamic approach to housing provision that could address the terrible tragedy that unfolds outside this institution every night of every week year on year?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	48	The point I am making is that I would be very slow to change the Constitution.  There must be a strong imperative to do so.  The objectives the Deputy seeks to achieve can be achieved without the necessity of inserting such a constitutional principle into the Constitution.  The directives on social policy as part of that constitutional document have provided a means by which we have seen a veritable social revolution in this country in terms of the state of the nation and the quality of life we now enjoy.  That flexibility was one of the geniuses behind its creation and subsequent enactment.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	49	In regard to amending the Constitution, we had the All- Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution, which produced ten or 11 reports, the last of which was produced in January 2006.  That process appears to have run out of steam.  Very few of the recommendations for constitutional change made by the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution appear to have been given effect.  What is the Government's position on the reports of the all-party committee?  Are they now to gather dust or is there some programme or plan by which recommendations made by the all-party committee will be given effect in constitutional change?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	50	The Government's record of acting on recommendations of that particular committee has been good I would argue and most of the more significant proposals have been acted upon.  The recommendations involving a constitutional amendment that were acted upon include the abolition of reference to the death penalty, the abortion question and the local government recognition issue; the judicial oversight issue was not passed by the Dáil.  Other recommendations acted upon which did not require a constitutional amendment include the conduct of referenda and the scrutiny of EU business.  I do not believe that any of the work of the committee on the Constitution was wasted; even if some recommendations were not acted upon immediately, the work of the committee provides a very firm basis for consideration of many issues involving a constitutional change into the future.  These are also points to be made in this context.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	51	As I made clear during the lengthy debate in the House last week, the 2009 budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure.  These decisions were made to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run.  In this respect education while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure could not be totally spared.  Prudent management of the Government finances is vital at this time of global economic uncertainty when tax revenue has fallen so significantly and when world economic conditions are so serious.  Even with the budget measures in place there will still be a significantly increased borrowing requirement in 2009.When the country was able to afford it we reduced the basis on which primary teachers are allocated to schools from being based on an average number of pupils per teacher of 35 pupils down to the current level of 27 pupils.  The change to a new average of 28 pupils per teacher must be viewed in that context.  It means primary schools will be staffed exactly as they were during the 2006-07 school year during which they operated well.Since 1997 primary teacher numbers have increased by approximately 10,000, with approximately 7,000 of these teachers entering the system in the past six years alone.  The continuation of this level of annual increase of the order of 1,000 primary teachers each year was just not sustainable for 2009 in the current economic climate.  Although it reverses some of the progress that we have made in recent years I had no option but to curtail the annual increase in teacher numbers.  While I appreciate this will impact on class sizes the reality is that it will not impact on every school and rather the change will impact on the total number of teachers in some 10% to 15% of primary schools.Regarding the number of teaching posts involved in this change, I have already said the net overall position is a reduction of approximately 200 posts from the primary teacher payroll next September compared with this September across all the staffing measures involving primary schools.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.This is calculated on the basis of a removal of up to 1,100 posts of which some 400 to 500 posts are expected to be due to the staffing schedule change specifically.  This will be offset by the creation of 900 posts that will be required to meet increasing enrolments and as resource teachers for special needs.  The estimated impact of the staffing schedule change is calculated on the same basis under which estimates of the cost of improving the staffing schedule were calculated in the past.In terms of the position in respect of any one school for September 2009, schools are currently returning data to my Department on their enrolment as of 30 September last.  My Department has commenced processing this data although not all schools have yet made their returns.  The allocation process including notification to schools will commence early in the new year.  The allocation process includes appellate mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules.  The final allocation to a school is also a function of the operation of the redeployment panels which provide for the retention of a teacher in an existing school if a new post is not available within the agreed terms of the scheme.  The allocation process for language support teachers is an annual one and existing provision is not rolled over automatically.  Schools will be applying afresh in the spring and early summer of 2009 for the 2009-10 school year, based on their assessment of the prospective needs of existing pupils and any new pupils they are enrolling.It will be necessary in the more testing economic climate ahead for us to continue to target and prioritise our resources to maximum effect for everyone.  While teacher numbers are important numerous influential reports have highlighted that teacher quality is the single most important factor far and above anything else in improving educational outcomes for children.  Ensuring high-quality teaching and learning is a challenge and dealing with factors that inhibit it represent a challenge for the Government, the Department, school management and the teacher unions.I am confident that as the global economy improves it will be possible to build again on the significant achievements of recent years and do so in a manner consistent with the overall prudent management of the economy.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	52	Would the Minister accept that if there had been no cutbacks in the budget, from next September we would have 1,000 more teachers in primary school education?

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	54	I thank the Minister.  The question merely required a "Yes" or "No" answer.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	55	The Minister is standing and is still answering.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	57	I will call the Deputy again later.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	58	Of course there would be an additional 1,000 teachers.  However, given that we have increasing demographics we estimate that 1,100 teachers will be taken out and that 900 will come in as a result of demographics and other factors.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	59	In my question I asked the Minister how many schools would be affected by this change.  He maintains that it will be somewhere between 10% and 15%, which on my reckoning is approximately 340 to 400 schools.  Am I right in suggesting that?
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	60	There are approximately 3,300 schools.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	61	Effectively the Minister is saying that 400 schools will lose a teacher from next September.  In his reply the Minister referred to the staffing schedule that existed in 2006-07.  Would he not accept that since that time an additional 35,000 children have entered primary schools?  We will have 500 fewer language support teachers within the system.  For 28,000 children English is not their primary language.  Can I put it to him that his comparison with 2006-07 is not fair and accurate given the situation that exists in primary education now?
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	62	Given the overall budget and financial situation, I had a choice of taking a 3% cut across the board.  If we had taken that choice, we would have taken out 2,500 teachers.  Instead, reverting one year to the 2006-07 level would have the least impact.  In terms of language support teachers, for example, we were conscious to leave ourselves an opportunity to retain the option of supporting the schools experiencing a major influx of pupils.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	63	I will allow Deputy Brian Hayes a brief supplementary question.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	64	I appreciate this useful opportunity, as it is the first time that the Minister has effectively admitted to the House that there will be 1,000 fewer national school teachers from September 2009.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	65	The Deputy should have listened to my speech last week.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	66	I did not talk over the Minister's reply.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	67	I apologise.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	68	It is clear that the programme for Government's commitment to reducing the staffing schedule from 27:1 to 24:1 in the first three years will not come about, given the increase to 28:1.  Will the Minister admit that there is no possibility of the commitment being honoured during the Government's lifetime?Will the Minister publish each school's enrolment figures, which were given to his Department on 30 September?  If he cannot do so soon, at what point will he be able to publish them?  Each school would be able to see where it stands in respect of the savage cutbacks.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	69	As the Deputy knows, the programme for Government was based on a 4.4% annual increase.  Given that it appears there will be a reduction in 2009, circumstances have changed.  When we examined the figures in July, the tax take was to have decreased by €3.5 billion.  When we re-examined them at the end of September, the tax deficit was going to be €6.5 billion.  In July, the Government did not touch any front-line teaching or special needs assistant, SNA, posts, but we took a 3% cut across the board.The Deputy knows well that 80% of all funding in education comprises payments to teachers, SNAs, their pensions, etc.  There was no room for manoeuvre.  In those circumstances, we took the least disruptive option.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	70	Then the aim will not be reached.  The programme for Government's commitment is gone.

I have made it clear that I want to restore the ratio when economic circumstances allow.  It is my intention that, as the economy grows, we will re-examine the situation.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	73	The 2040 one.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	74	The Government's continued prioritisation of education during the past 11 years is evident from our investment in 2009 of €9.6 billion, more than treble what it was in 1997.  The increase of €302 million in the education budget for 2009 is a real achievement in the current economic climate.  Education is one of only three Departments to have increased funding in 2009.Regarding day-to-day funding of schools, I have prioritised funding for primary schools.  The education budget for 2009 has provided for improvements to the overall level of day-to-day funding for primary schools, which will see funding increase from €167 million in 2008 to almost €190 million in 2009.  This builds on the progress made in recent years, which has seen the primary school capitation grant increase from €81.26 per pupil in 2000 to its current rate of €200.  This represents an increase of 146% in the standard rate of capitation grant since 2000.  The primary capitation grant has been increased by more than €21 to bring the rate to €200 per pupil and the ancillary services grant for primary schools will also be improved by €3.50 to €155 per pupil.Taken together, these increases mean that primary schools eligible for the full ancillary services grant will get €355 per pupil, almost €25 extra, in this school year to cover their day-to-day running costs, with a primary school of 300 pupils getting an additional €7,475.  In 2000, a primary school with 300 pupils was in receipt of less than €40,000 to meet its day-to-day running costs.  Under the new rates, that same school will receive €106,500, excluding the salary of teachers and special needs assistants, which are paid by the Department.Furthermore, enhanced rates of capitation funding are paid in respect of children with special educational needs who attend special schools or special classes attached to mainstream schools.  The current rates range from €512 to €986 per pupil, an increase of 59% from the 2006 rate.My Department recognises the additional funding pressures that arise in schools serving disadvantaged areas.  A significant number of schools, approximately one fifth of all primary schools and almost one third of second level schools, are within the Department's Delivering Equality of Opportunities in School, DEIS, programme for disadvantaged schools and get additional funding accordingly.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.While making difficult decisions for the 2009 Estimates, particularly in the current financial climate, my main focus was to target resources on the schools most in need and to retain resources in the schools targeted under the DEIS initiative.  This approach is in line with the broad thrust of the recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Those DEIS schools that benefit from a reduced pupil-teacher ratio will not be affected by the general increase in the ratio and all DEIS schools will maintain access to the home-school community liaison, HSCL, scheme, the school completion programme, SCP, additional capitation funding based on level of disadvantage and funding arising from the book grant scheme.This year, approximately €800 million will be spent by the Department on tackling educational disadvantage at all levels from preschool to further and higher education.  This represents an increase of nearly €70 million on the comparable 2007 figure and is testament to the Government's determination to prioritise social inclusion and ensure that children and young people get the supports they need to do well at school.We are committed to investing in education, but we must invest at a level consistent with what we can afford and what is sustainable at the moment given economic circumstances.  I am confident that, as the global economy improves, it will be possible to build again on the significant achievements of recent years and to do so in a manner consistent with overall prudent management of the economy.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	75	I thank the Minister for his reply.  Unfortunately, he did not get to the nub of the issue.  Were the Minister to run a course in his Department for curt replies or to provide Deputies with a code for the various paragraphs regurgitated at every Question Time, a rain forest might be spared.  However, that is another matter and my time is tight.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	76	The Leas-Cheann Comhairle is very strict.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	77	My explanation will be in "injury time" so that it will not affect Question Time.  Each Priority Question has six minutes, two of which are for the Minister's initial reply.  Given that I allowed him three minutes, he has used more than half of the time available for this question.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	78	My question is simple.  As the Minister knows from his constituency work if not his Department, there are middle income areas in his extensive constituency where raising additional money to cover basic funding is not a problem.  There are voluntary contributions at the tax efficient level of €250, which is the norm.  They are not mandatory, but one receives contribution rates of up to 80%.  In another part of the Minister's constituency, this does not occur.  The board of management or, primarily, the principal must look for funding.  The historical increase in funding does not cover operating costs because increases in the rate of inflation are less than increases in the rates of education inflation and operation.Previously, patrons of primary schools, some 93% of which are run by the Catholic church, contributed towards the deficit in operational costs.  According to my research, this is no longer the case.  The burden falls on principals and parents, not necessarily on the parish, although there is an urban-rural divide.  In this regard, does the Minister not have any questions as to the continued right of governance proclaimed by patrons?
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	79	I made it clear in the House that I was unsatisfied with the level of capitation, particularly at primary level.  In spite of our financial difficulties, the Government believed it appropriate to increase the capitation grant level.  In excess of 80% of school patrons, particularly those of primary schools, are with the Catholic church.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	80	Some 93%.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	81	I have been given no indication of the churches and parishes not making contributions.  In certain schools, voluntary contributions can be made by parents.  I often wonder whether this is a bad thing.  Social capital is rising out of our new, emerging society in the sense that it brings people together and creates communities.  Schools can mirror communities.  A bond between parents and the community is outstanding for the school.We must be careful to ensure that no one is forced into making a voluntary contribution or that it is structured in such a way as to make people feel excluded or embarrassed if they are unable to contribute.  However, all of our experiences in this regard have been positive.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	82	The Minister will consolidate social disadvantage if he goes down this road.  What is provided in DEIS I and DEIS II does not compensate for a middle income area consolidating its school.  From a principal's point of view, there are serious management problems associated with the running of schools in terms of how the Department pays the capitation grant and during what period of the education year it is paid.  If the Minister receives from the primary education providers a request to meet with them to discuss how the Department can improve its act in terms of cashflow and other supports, will he do so and will he deal constructively with them?

I have indicated my willingness to meet with all of the education partners.  I want to co-operate and work with them to the best possible extent.I met last week with the Association of Secondary Teachers in Ireland, ASTI, and following requests for a meeting from the Irish National Teachers' Organisation, INTO, and the Teachers Union of Ireland, TUI, I will also meet with them.

#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	87	The school transport scheme, operated by Bus Éireann on behalf of my Department, is primarily a rural-based scheme which facilitates the transportation of more than 134,000 children to primary and post-primary schools each day.The Deputy will be aware that the school transport system is a significant operation involving approximately 42 million journeys of more than 82 million km on 6,000 routes every school year.  The 2008 allocation for school transport was €175.2 million and this has been increased by 12% to €196 million in 2009, an indication, given the difficult fiscal conditions, of the Government's commitment to maintaining the scheme.  The allocation to school transport services has increased almost threefold since 1997.Despite the escalating cost of the service, charges for school transport had not been increased from 1998 until the third term in the 2007-08 school year.  A further increase was necessary at the beginning of the 2008-09 school year.  The budget 2009 increase applies from the beginning of the 2009-10 school year.  In the overall context and in order to minimise the overall effects, these increases have been confined to the 55,000 eligible post-primary children availing of concessionary transport.  Charges will continue to be waived in respect of post-primary children whose families are in possession of a valid medical card, or to a further 19,000 children.  Eligible children attending primary schools and children with special needs, approximately 54,000 children, will continue to travel free of charge.  A maximum family rate will also be applied.  The total contribution from parents will continue to represent only 7% of the overall allocation for school transport in 2009.This scheme aims to provide comfortable and safe transport for children travelling to and from school.  Measures to ensure the highest standards in this regard include the phasing out of the three for two seating arrangement on primary and post-primary services, providing all children with a seat; the addition of a considerable number of vehicles to address capacity shortfalls arising from the decision to provide each child with an individual seat and the equipping of all school buses in the scheme with seat belts; and inspection by Bus Éireann, using an independent agency, to satisfy itself that all buses entering the school transport scheme are fitted with seat belts which meet the standard agreed with the Department of Transport.  In addition, Bus Éireann has put in place a random vehicle inspection process conducted by a leading independent external expert in this field.
#FrankFeighan	unknown-#FrankFeighan-party	unknown-#FrankFeighan-dob	unknown-#FrankFeighan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	88	I thank the Minister of State for his reply although I am dissatisfied with it.  At the commencement of this year, the cost of school transport for junior cycle students was €99.  This increased to €138 at Easter, to €168 in July and to €300 under the budget, an increase of 203% in less than seven months.Will the Minister reverse these charges?  If not, will he state that there will be no further increases in charges during the lifetime of this Government?  I believe this charge is anti-family and anti-rural.  Young students in the Minister's constituency have available to them public transport to take them to school.  This charge is a huge burden on families in rural areas.  Will the Minister say if further increases are proposed or if he will reduce the cost?
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	89	School transport charges are escalating all the time owing to expanding numbers and the growing diversity of schools, and in order to meet the transport needs of special needs children.  The allocation for school transport has increased from €51.1 million in 1998 to €175.2 million in 2008, a 340% increase.  Major improvements, some of which I referred to earlier, have been made to the scheme since 2001.  All of these improvements cost money.Obviously, as we have only recently dealt with the Estimates for 2009, I am not in a position to say what will be the case in the future.  However, as I stated earlier, school transport charges had not been increased for ten years.  I take this opportunity to inform the House that my officials are currently examining, in conjunction with Bus Éireann, potential options in regard to the payment of the maximum family charge of €600.  For example, the financial implications of spreading a portion of the payment for this specific group of parents into 2010 will be of central importance.  I assure the Deputy that parents will be given ample notice of any options agreed in this regard.

The Government made many promises in regard to the replacement of this scheme but no replacement mechanism has, as yet, been put in place.  Public transport operators are concerned they may not be able to fulfil their duties over the year owing to them not having received the fuel rebate as promised on numerous occasions.

#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	92	Unfortunately, it was not possible, in the current fiscal climate, to make additional funding available in respect of an increase in contractors' rates for the 2008-2009 school year.  As announced in the budget, the increase provided allows for payment of a compensatory allowance to private contractors who may avail of the fuel rebate scheme until the end of the month.  My officials are currently in discussions with Bus Éireann in this regard.The three contractors' groups, the Private Association of Motor Bus Owners, Coach Tourism and Transport Council of Ireland and the Federation of Transport Operators, have been fully apprised of the position.  We hope to finalise discussions in this regard during the coming weeks.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	93	The National Development Plan 2007-2013 provides for almost €4.5 billion for the school building programme.  The allocation for school building in 2009 is €581 million.  This represents a significant investment in the school building and modernisation programme.The Deputy will appreciate that the climate within which the 2009 budget has been framed is different from that of recent years.  The Government has been faced with difficult choices across all areas of public spending.  This level of funding for the building programme, at a time of great pressure on public finances, is significant.This investment will build on the achievements of the previous National Development Plan 2000-2006, when an aggregate total of more than €2.6 billion was invested in upgrading the existing school infrastructure and providing new school accommodation at first and second level.  This programme which delivered more than 7,800 building projects also provided for investment in site purchases, the annual minor works grant to all primary schools, the asbestos and radon remediation programmes, science and technology initiatives, emergency works and grants for the purchase of furniture and equipment.Innovations in the delivery of school buildings such as the development of generic repeat designs and the use of the design and build model ensure that new school buildings are delivered in the fastest timeframe possible.  My Department also adopted a policy of devolving much greater authority to local school management boards to manage and deliver smaller building projects, thus freeing up my Department to concentrate on the larger scale projects.  This has facilitated the completion of 3,000 projects, costing more than €300 million, under the summer works scheme and more than 700 projects under the small schools and permanent accommodation schemes.Value for money is a key criterion in the implementation of the school building programme and competitive tendering, in line with public procurement procedures, ensures that this is achieved.  As I have indicated publicly, the current decline in activity in the construction industry provides an opportunity for my Department to continue to pursue value for money in the procurement and construction of school buildings.The allocation for 2009 will allow my Department to complete 26 major projects and commence construction on another 62 major projects.  It will permit completion of 100 smaller projects on-site and allow another 80 projects previously approved to progress to completion as well as funding the other elements of the programme, such as the annual minor works grant, site purchases, emergency works etc.  It is also my intention to have a summer works scheme in 2009.  Provision has also been made in the capital allocation for the continuation of my Department's public private partnership programme.

Some of the projects will be paid from the 2008 figure.  The Deputy will be delighted to hear I am getting back tenders that are 15% and 20% less than they were when previously tendered.  I insisted re-tendering take place in order for us to get value for money for the projects on hand.If the Deputy read my speech last week he knows I clearly indicated we are €5 million short on last year's figure.  I will get much more value and deliver more projects on the basis of the competitive tenders we will get during the course of 2009.  I am satisfied that will happen.

He had a very accountable and transparent initiative where schools knew exactly where they stood on the list.  That initiative was put to one side by the Minister's immediate predecessor, Deputy Mary Hanafin, and it has not yet been reinstated.  When will schools know exactly where they stand on this list rather than having to wait for the wink and nod which comes from the local Fianna Fáil Deputy and which eventually comes through the Minister?  When will schools be told the truth as to when it is likely their projects will be advanced, as against the Tammany Hall politics played by the Minister and his party over the past number of years?

Band 1 means a project is a priority.I want to be clear on this.  We have a website that is being updated at the moment and I have instructed my officials that when the website is up and running properly, all of the data on schools and their band rating should be put on the website.  I hope the website will be in place properly before the end of the year, and that the data which the Deputy requires and is anxious to receive will be on it.

Does the Minister regard that as value for money when €4.6 million has been spent by those 14 schools without one block, building or extension going up?  Is that value for money?

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	125	Notwithstanding the increase of €302 million in the education budget for 2009, in making the announcement of the budget measures for education, I stressed that tough choices had to be made in meeting the needs of the education sector in these difficult times.  The resources available to the Department have meant that these choices have been very challenging and the decision made to suspend the substitution cover for school business in second-level schools was a difficult one.  The provision of substitute cover for school business at second level was only introduced in 2003.  The supervision and substitution scheme was also introduced at that time.Substitution cover for official school business such as absences of teachers when schools are participating in sports competitions relates to second level schools only.  I emphasise that accordingly, there is no change to the position in primary schools for participation in sports competitions.  The supervision and substitution scheme will continue to operate without any changes and teachers who agree to participate will continue to receive an annual payment of €1,789 in addition to their normal salary. Some cover for official school business is available to second-level schools within this scheme.I am aware that from January, the changes regarding substitution will present particular challenges for school managers but I considered that suspending part of the improvements made in 2003 to the substitution scheme was preferable to impacting more significantly on teacher numbers.  Prior to 2003, schools managed without any of this provision and this did not impede on their capacity to participate, for example, in football and other sports competitions.I fully accept this was possible through flexibility and goodwill by all.  As we manage through this difficult period I am asking teachers in all schools to co-operate fully with school managers in coping with this change in the interest of the students. I am also requesting the school managerial bodies to ensure that the supervision and substitution scheme is operated with maximum effectiveness in all schools.
#JohnOMahony	unknown-#JohnOMahony-party	unknown-#JohnOMahony-dob	unknown-#JohnOMahony-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	126	The Minister comes from a county where the players are well able to stand up for themselves.  The children of this country, particularly those at second level whom the Minister spoke about who are involved in sport, depend on the teachers and parents.  They came in their thousands to the outside of the Dáil last week.  These children depend on the Minister and us as Deputies to stand up for them regarding the provision of sports activities outside the school.The Minister is in the educational system but I am not sure he is fully aware of how vital these sports are, particularly with team games where people learn how to win and lose, along with discipline.  I do not expect the Minister to agree with those on this side of the House when we say the budget was botched but we should look at it a bit more positively in the sense that given the inequity shown against the elderly and the disabled, there was some good sense in rowing back on the schemes or changing them.The Minister referred to reduced tender prices.  I presume that will mean fewer millions of euro spent on prefabs.  I appeal to the Minister, as a former teacher, to look at this issue particularly with regard to the provision of sporting competitions.  Sport makes school bearable for children and in view of this will the Minister reconsider the matter?  Unless this matter is revisited, teams will be pulling out of sporting activities.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	128	The important point to make is that I share with Deputy O'Mahony an interest in sport.  I participated myself and neither I nor other members of the Government wished to take this decision.  Unfortunately, it is worth considering what has happened since 2003.In the 2007-08 school year, the Department paid for 2.05 million hours, or 362,000 days, of substitution cover in primary schools at a cost of €65 million.  The projected cost of substitution in 2008-09 is €85 million.  In the post-primary sector, the estimated level of substitution cover provided, based on the assumption that the level of usage by vocational education committees will be 56%, is 1.683 million hours, or 382,000 days.  This cost €64 million and the projected costs for 2008-09 are €67 million.  The level of substitution hours paid in 2007-08 to teachers and casuals in VECs, at €37 per hour, was 1.023 million hours.  Moreover, 1.14 million hours were paid for primary schools, costing €56 million.  In addition, the cost in the current financial year of expenditure on the supervision substitute scheme is €56 million for primary and €35 million for the secondary community.  Moreover, there were 34,000 single day absences for uncertified sick leave.

As for primary schools, the Minister stated they were not affected.  The reason is the teachers take out their teams in the evenings.  It pertains to teachers' goodwill.

Having been involved myself, I have seen the amount of time that people put in, as well as the commitment of school teachers throughout this period.  The last thing I wish to take away is their goodwill.  My point is certain provisions now must be taken on the basis we cannot afford to continue to pay in 2009 the present level of supports.  It was a choice either of this or of taking out teachers.  I believe that having as many teachers as possible in the classroom is paramount.

#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	144	As of October 2008, 3,905 schools have been provided with broadband connectivity under the schools broadband access programme.  As the Deputy will be aware, this programme is being undertaken in partnership with industry in the context of a Government-IBEC-Telecommunications and Internet Federation, TIF, agreement to provide local broadband connectivity to schools.  The programme has three elements, namely, local connectivity to schools, a national broadband network and a broadband support service desk.  Schools connectivity is being routed to the Internet through a national broadband network, which is supported by HEAnet and provides centrally managed services for schools such as security, anti-spam, anti-virus and content filtering.Turning to the specific question, of the 3,905 local connectivity installations, 27% or 1,051 schools, have fixed line services, 26% or 1,028 schools, have wireless services and 47% or 1,826 schools, have satellite services.  A further 72 schools have had broadband access provided under the Hermes and advanced deployment programmes and are not included in the 3,905 schools.  The split of technology services across these 72 schools is 43 fixed line services, 25 wireless services and four satellite services.Having regard to the usage levels observed by HEAnet, the Department has procured additional bandwidth from its two satellite providers to improve the broadband connection speeds for schools on this portion of the schools broadband network.  The situation continues to be monitored closely.  In addition, the Department has migrated schools to superior alternative technologies, where feasible.The Department will issue shortly a request for tenders, RFT, for the next round of service.  The priority for the new procurement process will be to ensure the broadband services to schools keep in line with national infrastructure improvements.  The RFT will seek tenders which at least maintain the existing service that schools currently receive.  Having regard to the general developments in broadband availability nationally, improved service offerings are expected to be received under the new tender process.The Department also will collaborate with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to pursue the Government objective of equipping second level schools with 100 megabytes per second of broadband connectivity and installing local area networks, as outlined in the consultation paper on next generation broadband.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	145	While I thank the Minister of State for his reply, the figures are somewhat misleading in that according to my information, 1,577 schools have access to satellite-provided broadband, which is highly unreliable, weak and slow.  If one is on a fixed-line connection, the further away one physically is from the local exchange, the weaker or slower is the signal.  While the figure of more than 90% of schools having broadband connectivity appears to be satisfactory, the quality of that connection may not be.  I have to hand an example of a school with 12 computers in which it is unusable, given the time it takes to download information or messages with file attachments.  While the new round of tendering has been announced previously, the Minister of State has announced it in the House today.  Can he assure me it will improve the quality of the broadband?  That is the main complaint I receive from teachers in the school system.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	146	First, there is 99% coverage of broadband in schools, rather than the 90% referred to by the Deputy.  I cannot account for the discrepancy between 1,826 schools and the figure of 1,500 as suggested by the Deputy.  I can only rely on the figures that were presented to me today.  If some clarification is required, this can be considered.As for the technology itself, the Deputy is referring to satellite provision.  The Department must be technology neutral in respect of any tendering process.  We are confident, however, that in the context of the great investment in broadband technology in recent years, this tendering process will offer extremely good value for money and will provide cutting edge technology to improve the standard, which I believe to be the core of the Deputy's question.

He seeks 100 megabyte per second broadband connectivity for secondary schools and wishes to ensure that such connectivity is wireless-based to the greatest possible extent.  Although these targets are highly ambitious, they represent the correct prioritisation by the Government of the manner in which it wishes to have broadband in schools.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	156	I propose to take Questions Nos. 106 and 113 together.I wish to re-emphasise that there are no changes proposed in respect of the Protestant block grant.  Protestant fee-charging schools receive and will continue to receive the Protestant block grant, which in the current school year amounts to €6.25 million.  This payment covers capitation, tuition and boarding grants.The grant is distributed by the Secondary Education Committee among needier Protestant children.  Applications are made by parents to the Central Protestant Churches Authority which, on the basis of a means test, distributes the funds to individual schools on the basis of pupil needs.  The retention of this grant demonstrates the importance that I, and the Government, continue to attach to ensuring that students of the Protestant faith can attend schools which reflect their denominational ethos.Furthermore, in retaining this grant, the Government is being faithful to the separate arrangements that were agreed with Protestant schools when the free scheme was introduced by Donogh O'Malley and, at the time, it was the payment of a block grant in particular for Protestant fee-charging schools that distinguished them from Catholic schools that also chose to continue to charge fees.  In addition to the block grant, Protestant fee-charging schools were paid a range of support services grants that Catholic fee-charging schools did not receive.  The purpose of these grants was not to offset fees for disadvantaged Protestant students.It is estimated that savings of €2.8 million will accrue as a result of the withdrawal of these grants from Protestant fee-charging schools in 2009.  I have had to take decisions in regard to a range of grants that have impacted on the funding of schools generally.  With the Protestant block grant protected, I can see no justification for treating Protestant fee-charging schools in a special way, particularly given that Catholic fee-charging schools have not been in receipt of the grants in question at all.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	157	I put it to the Minister that his actions on the issue gravely endanger a number of Protestant fee-paying schools outside of the larger cities.  He needs to rethink this position.  The special services grant, which he is effectively abolishing for Protestant fee-paying schools, will put many such schools to the wall in the coming years.Currently, we have 26 Protestant post-primary schools in this country — five comprehensive and 21 fee-paying schools in 13 of the 26 counties.  If one wants a Protestant ethos-led education for one's child, one has to send that child to a boarding school because, in effect, we have so few such schools.When will the Minister meet with Archbishop Neill, whom I understand has sought a meeting with him to discuss the situation?  In the context of North-South relations and the plurality of educational expression that we cherish, I urge the Minister to rethink his position and not to act in the way proposed in his budget announcement?
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	158	It was with no great relish that the grant was taken away.  I appreciate that it will cause difficulties for some Protestant schools.  I realise there are 21 Protestant fee-paying schools and I also realise that the existing block grant is quite substantial.  A capitation grant of €39.36 is paid to 94% of pupils.  A tuition grant of €274 per pupil is paid to 94% of pupils.  The tuition fee for pupils who board is €15.36 per pupil.  I am maintaining that grant, which is a significant one.Catholic fee-paying schools do not avail of a similar capitation grant but we have adhered to the agreement that was reached in the time of Donogh O'Malley on the block grant.  A 90% grant is available to Protestant schools for the school building programme but an ad hoc arrangement applies to Catholic fee-paying schools.  Sometimes not even 50% of the building costs of Catholic fee-paying schools are covered.  In withdrawing the grants, we are bringing Protestant fee-paying schools into line with Catholic fee-paying schools.  Legal advice from the Attorney General’s office suggests that we could find it extremely difficult to defend the continuation of those grants.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	159	I never thought I would see the day when I would speak in praise of Deputy Bertie Ahern, but I must say this cut would never have happened under the former Taoiseach.  He would have been alert to the sensitivity of the issue and he would certainly have realised that its import goes way beyond educational considerations — important as they are.I contradict the Minister's attempt to rewrite history by suggesting that the commitment was to pay a block grant.  That was not the commitment; it was to treat Protestant schools in the same way as schools going into the free scheme.  This is the first ever breach of that commitment.  That commitment itself reflected a commitment given to the Protestant community at the foundation of the State that they would be able to choose a school that reflected their faith and ethos.  The sum of money under consideration is small.I echo my colleague in urging the Minister to reconsider the issue.  I do not know if he is aware of the impact it will have on schools.  The number of schools affected is small but each school will lose, on average, €140,000 in the middle of the school year.  That will have a significant impact.  The immediate impact is that children will be taken out of school.  They will have to leave the schools they have attended for years.  The longer term impact is that schools will close.  Does the Minister think this breach of faith and the long-term impact it will have on the Protestant community is really worth this paltry saving?
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	160	Deputy Hayes asked me if I would meet the Protestant bishops.  I have agreed to meet with them and a date has been arranged for a meeting.  I hope it will take place within the next two weeks.I wish to clarify a matter which I think is important.  The free education scheme was introduced in 1967 to facilitate the provision of second level education for all young people.  Prior to that, all voluntary schools recognised by the Department and subject to its regulations were paid grants.  With the introduction of the free education scheme, the majority of schools agreed to discontinue charging fees and were compensated by enhanced capitation grants.  In 1986, the capitation grant was withdrawn from Catholic fee-charging schools for budgetary reasons.  Catholic fee-charging second level schools do not receive the per capita grant or the schools services support grant in respect of their students, nor do they receive the various other curricular grants for current expenditure supports to which schools in the free education scheme are entitled.  Some fee-charging schools are in receipt of secretarial support under the terms of the scheme.I remind the Deputy that, first, there is a legal impediment.  If a case is taken by one of the Catholic schools——

We are trying to cement a peace process, especially in the Border areas, yet schools are being put under pressure.  I refer to Monaghan Collegiate School, the Royal Schools in Cavan and in Donegal and schools in Sligo, Dundalk and Drogheda, right around the Border.  They are all being put under pressure by the Minister's spurious comment.  It is extremely dangerous of him to suggest that a legal case will be taken against him if he does not break an agreement that has been in place for 40 years.I urge the Minister to reconsider and to realise the damage he is doing not just to the individual schools in question, but to the structure that has been agreed and that has worked well for the past 40 years.  I have never said it in the House before but I believe the Protestant community has the right to maintain its own ethos and to have its own schools.  That was recognised 40 years ago and the Minister is putting that at serious risk.  I urge him to reconsider and to ensure that does not happen.

However, once people are any distance at all from the exchange — sometimes even half a mile — the strength of the signal is such that they cannot get broadband.  Is it the Minister's intention that these people will simply never get it and, if so, what has he planned for them?  What are we to tell people in these areas nominally serviced by broadband but with no real option of getting it?; (6) Deputy Martin Ferris — the status of the new build for Scoil Eoin primary school, Tralee, the largest primary school in County Kerry; (7) Deputy Deirdre Clune — the provision of gateway funding for the Cork docklands project; and (8) Deputies Kieran O'Donnell and Michael Noonan — the steps being taken to secure the future of jobs at the Dell plant in Limerick.The matters raised by Deputies Kieran O'Donnell, Michael Noonan, Billy Timmins and Deirdre Clune have been selected for discussion.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	223	Three weeks ago at this time, the Minister for Finance was receiving a standing ovation for the budget he introduced.  Three weeks later, the budget has unravelled like a ball of string.  Having been received with a standing ovation by Government Members, it was received with a great deal of anger, shock and dismay by the most vulnerable in society around the country.  The final nail in the coffin of budget 2009 is the report from the Directorate-General for Economic and Financial Affairs of the European Commission.  The document singles out Ireland and effectively states the Taoiseach's budget and projections are miles off course.  How does he explain the difference of €5 billion in the projections of the Minister for Finance and the Government for 2010 and those of the Directorate-General for Economic and Financial Affairs of the European Commission, which is a participant in the legal process involved?  Will he confirm that he stands over the figures in his budget?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	224	Of course we stand over the figures in our budget.  The Commission's forecasts are pessimistic for the European Union as a whole.  The report confirms that the euro area is already in recession.  The outlook, therefore, across all the European Union for next year is similar.The forecast for the Irish economy published by the Commission yesterday is broadly in line with that of the Department of Finance, which underpins the budget.  The Commission is forecasting negative GDP growth of 1.5% this year and that the economy will contract by a further 1% next year.  The Commission is also forecasting a fall in the rate of the harmonised index inflation figure in Ireland over the coming months, with further easing expected in 2009-10.  These forecasts are broadly in line with those published on budget day.  This easing in inflationary pressures is a welcome development at this time.On the budgetary position, the Commission notes that our expected deficit of 5.5% of GDP this year largely reflects the very large tax shortfall.  The Commission expects the deficit to widen next year to 6.75% of GDP and 7.2% in 2010 on a no-policy-change basis.  That forecast does not take into account the commitment to restore the current budget to balance over the coming years, as included in our budgetary arithmetic.The medium-term strategy underpinning the budget set out the clear intention of stabilising and restoring balance to the public finances as soon as possible by, among other steps, reducing and prioritising public expenditure and adjusting taxation levels to reflect the changed realities.  The Commission's analysis confirms our own stated position that tough decisions will continue to have to be taken over the coming years.  The aim of our budget was to seek to stabilise the public finances.  Over the next three years, our aim is to restore sustainability thereto.The Commission shares our optimism in respect of a return to growth in 2010.  It forecasts a growth rate of 2.4%, the third highest in the EU, for Ireland in that year.  This must not be overlooked as we face these challenges with a strong position from our low ratio of debt to GDP.  The answers to the Deputy's questions are technical.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	225	The Taoiseach stated the Government's projected growth figures are broadly in line with those of the Commission, but he did not deal with the projections for the deficit.  His projection for 2010 is 4.7% while the Commission's is 7.2%, which amounts to a difference of €5 billion.  Will he outline the policy changes, about which he spoke, that will bring Ireland's economy into line with where it should be?  If the Taoiseach stands over his figures for his budget of three weeks ago, why is the Minister for Finance running around solo saying we must have more cutbacks?  He is quoted again today as saying we face further cutbacks.  Obviously, he knows the Exchequer figures that will be published in ten minutes.  The Taoiseach accepts that the figures given in his budget are right in respect of the deficit for 2010, but the economic directorate says there is a difference of €5 billion and the Minister for Finance says we will have further cutbacks.  Is this evidence of a major split between the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance?  The Minister says we will have further cutbacks and the Taoiseach says this is not the case.  Otherwise, the figures given in the budget three weeks ago are completely at variance with what the Commission directorate states.  If that is the case, the Government is making it up as it goes along.  We have no road map, no plan and no strategy to restore the economy to good health.The Commission report singled out Ireland and said it was a particularly sharp issue for this country where the Government balance is projected to reach a deficit of 5.5% in 2008 and almost 7% in 2009.  If that is the case, can I take it from the Taoiseach that we are to have another budget in the spring?  Are we faced with a number of policy options that will require supplementary budgets or another budget before the scheduled one of 2009?  This is important in the context of the creation and protection of jobs and for the management of our economy.Will we have another budget in 2009?  Is there a difference of opinion between the Taoiseach and his Minister for Finance?  Why is the Minister talking about further cutbacks if the Taoiseach stands over the figures announced three weeks ago?

That forecast does not take into account the commitment to restore the current budget to balance which was included in our budgetary arithmetic.  That is the normal procedure; we outlined the three-year position in the multi-annual cycle budgets brought forward in the House for the past four or five years.  The Commission does not do that; it is simply giving a no policy change position.  The Government has outlined its position on that situation.  There is no problem here regarding what the Commission is saying and what we are saying.

We know also that he is optimistic about our prospects for recovery and growth in the medium term.  I was a member of ECOFIN and saw many occasions where the excessive deficit procedure was invoked.  It was invoked in our situation because of the sharp deterioration in our public finances where the deficit is clearly over 3%.  These are the Stability and Growth Pact rules and the procedures are invoked and applied to our country when it happens just as they are applied to other countries when it happens in their part of the cycle.  There is no need to indicate any fundamental difference here.There is no difference between the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and anyone else in the Government.  The Minister for Finance is outlining very clearly his determination——

He said that he is satisfied the expenditure targets set out by the Government will be met and that he is also satisfied that if further action is required, it will be taken until the next budget.  That does not necessarily mean a mini-budget.  The taxation measures in the budget will be set out in the Finance Bill.  Obviously, if further expenditure control measures are required, they will be adopted.  That is specifically what the Minister for Finance said, rather than Deputy Kenny's paraphrasing of what he said.

When we come forward with our 2010 budget, we will outline the policy changes that are required on the basis of how the economy performs in the coming year and similarly with the following years.  The whole purpose of the budgetary cycle and what we are trying achieve is to get a sustainable position.  The problem with Deputy Kenny's party is that it talks about tiger budgetary fiscal situation and disagrees with every step taken to try to bring it about.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	240	I wish to raise with the Taoiseach a particular set of decisions made in the budget relating to increases in a number of health charges.  The charge for attending an accident and emergency department in a hospital was raised in the budget to €100, bringing it now to almost seven times what it cost in 1997, approximately €15.  The charge for an overnight stay in a hospital has been raised to €75, three times what it cost in 1997.  The threshold for the drug refund scheme has been increased to €100, over four times its cost in 1997.  By any standards, these are very substantial increases in taxation on illness because the only people eligible to pay these taxes are those who are sick, who need to get into hospital or who need drugs.I wish to raise in particular the impact of those charges on low-income families.  I want the Taoiseach to consider the case of a working family, a couple with two children, with a family income of €25,000 per year.  The Taoiseach's Government considers this family to be too well-off to have a medical card so they would be liable to pay the accident and emergency charge if a family member had to go to hospital.  What does that family do in the middle of the night if a child gets sick, they cannot get a doctor and they do not have the €100 to bring the child to the accident and emergency department?  What would be the Taoiseach's advice to that family?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	241	Obviously, they would go to the accident and emergency department and have the child treated.  That is what they would and will do.  In respect of any charges that arise as a result, I am sure that would be dealt with in due course on the basis of ability to pay.  That is what happens.  As the Deputy says, where there is referral from the GP to the hospital, it is a different situation in respect of the charge.  That charge is envisaged for situations when people arrive at accident and emergency without GP referral.  People will continue to attend if a child's requirements merit their attendance.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	242	That answer shows how out of touch the Taoiseach is with the reality of people's lives and the difficulties they have in making ends meet.  I do not know if the Taoiseach is aware but where one turns up with a child at a hospital without money to pay the charge, the hospital refers the debt to debt collectors.

Does the Taoiseach believe it is fair or reasonable that a family on that level of income, of €500 or less a week, should pay the charge?  They have a sick child, cannot get a doctor and even if they could, the call out charge for a doctor would be of that order anyway.The Taoiseach is right.  They decide, as most parents would, faced with a sick child in the middle of the night, to get the care.  They will bring the child to the hospital.  The problem is where they will find the €100 to pay for it.  On that level of income, that is a very severe charge.  Is the Taoiseach suggesting that, if the hospital visit were to be on a Thursday night before pay day, that the family call around by the hospital on the way home from work on the Friday and pay €100 from the small wage they have?  Is that how they will pay and is that a fair charge?  This was one of the increases applied in the budget and it will impact on people on that level of income.  Does the Taoiseach think this is fair?

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	261	When can we expect to have the adoption Bill before the House?  When will the health legislation dealing with the universal right to a medical card be brought before the House?  Does the Taoiseach envisage introducing legislation for a restructuring of the Irish banking system?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	262	On promised legislation, I expect the adoption Bill to be taken this session.  Regarding the health miscellaneous provisions Bill on the change to the legal basis of entitlement to the medical card schemes etc., as the legislation must be enacted before 1 January, it will have to be taken in this session.  Legislation is not promised on the banking system.  The legislation that has been enacted in the House on banking covers any possibility of that arising, although I am not saying it will arise.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	263	On the legislation to take medical cards from those aged over 70 years, will the Taoiseach be more specific about when it will be published and if it has been approved by Government?  Will we have the normal arrangement, whereby there will be a two-week period between the taking of Second Stage and Committee Stage of the Bill?In July 2007, ethics legislation passed all Stages in the Seanad.  As the Taoiseach will recall, the relevant Bill was first announced on 10 October 2006 on the steps of Government Buildings by the then Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, and then Tánaiste, former Deputy Michael McDowell.  This was done as part of an agreement for the continuation of the Government under which the legislation in question would be published and enacted.  As I indicated, the Bill passed all Stages in the Seanad in July 2007 but has not been presented in this House.  When will the legislation come before the House and what are the Government's intentions with regard to enacting it?  When will the Taoiseach move the writ for the Dublin South by-election?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	264	On the Deputy's final question, the writ will be moved in due course.  On the ethics legislation, it is a matter for the Whips to consider when it will be taken.  Much priority legislation, including the Social Welfare Bill, Finance Bill and nursing homes Bill, will come before the House this session.  On the health miscellaneous provisions Bill, the legislation has not yet come before Government and has to be prepared based on the decisions made the weekend before last.  I do not see a reason for such a major gap between Stages as it will be a simple Bill.  I presume it could be taken reasonably quickly because there is not much involved in it.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	272	I have indicated the policy position.  The Government is seeking to ensure the legislative provisions are in place as and from 1 January 2009.  Those who are set to lose their entitlements will keep them until that date.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	273	When will the Bill come before the House?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	274	I cannot be more specific other than to indicate a timeframe of before 1 January.  With respect, Deputy Gilmore was a member of a government.  I cannot anticipate the situation but the policy decisions were taken less than two weeks ago.  The Government has indicated that legislation will be required to amend the health legislation and we intend to do this in a timely fashion.  Given that the new arrangements will take effect on 1 January 2009, we can safely say the Bill will come before the House before that date.  I cannot be more specific.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	275	The Government will introduce the Bill at the last minute, which it will rush and then guillotine.  Is that what is hatching?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	276	It is a question of giving legislative effect to what has been well debated in the House over the past two weeks.

Will he indicate the progress made on the legislation to abolish the National Council on Ageing and Older People?  When will it come before the House?

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	281	As the Deputy will be aware, I have always held him in the highest regard.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	284	Have we gone backwards in legislating for the tens of thousands who live in apartment blocks that are supposed to be governed by management companies?  Deputy Brian Lenihan undertook, when he was Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to be the lead Minister and bring forward the legislation.  Is there any sign of the legislation?  Is it coming from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform?  He is not a man who likes legislating, I can assure the Taoiseach.  What are the plans because there are tens of thousands of residents in serious trouble?  Some of the companies work, but most of them do not, and this area needs legislation.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	285	I am aware of the situation, which has been raised here on a number of occasions.  Options are being considered in consultation with the relevant Departments and the Attorney General as to whether it might be more expeditious to introduce a single Bill in an effort to——
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	286	That is not an explanation.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	289	——to adopt a sector approach to amending existing legislation.  The Government's decision on the matter will be made on the basis of how quickly the required legislation can be enacted.  We are seeking to find out whether there is a more expeditious way of dealing with it, than dealing with it separately.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	290	That is a year and a half——

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	292	That does not lessen its complexity, the fact we are dealing with it in that manner.

#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	294	That is not relevant now.

I had previously asked the Tánaiste but that information had never been given before. Why is it  not intended to amend the Competition Act to address the difficulties already well highlighted as regards the Irish Pharmaceutical Union, the Irish Dental Association and other interests and not just the IMO.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	296	We cannot go into that now.

#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	299	By way of further clarification we are being told two contradictory things.  The Tánaiste has stated on the record that legislation is being prepared to enable consultation with the IMO, that does not include the bodies Deputy Ó Caoláin has referenced.  Separately, we have been told that there is to be legislation next year that will take account of the review of the competition Bill.  The issue is when the legislation will be introduced and whether it will deal comprehensively with all of those who have been excluded under section 4 of the Competition Act.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	300	The same considerations do not apply in respect of all these organisations, but I shall make a general point.  We have promised to undertake work between the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment on the issue of amending section 4 of the Competition Act 2004 in a manner consistent with EU competition law and national policy.  This is the undertaking we have given.  People will understand that it cannot easily be circumvented or wished away, since there is an EU competition law component that is directly applicable here.  We have undertaken to find out how it might be possible to amend the section in the context of the exercise being undertaken by Dr. Barry and others as regards the ability to deal with drug usage in this country and provide savings, which we believe might be significant in that area.  On our part it is an issue of good faith to see whether this can be done in a manner consistent with EU competition law and national policy.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	361	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."The principal purpose of this Bill is to make provision in domestic law for the obligations the State will assume under the Convention on Cluster Munitions.  As the House will be aware, the convention was adopted by consensus at the conclusion of the Dublin diplomatic conference last May at Croke Park.  It will be opened for signature at a ceremony in Oslo on 3 December and will enter into force six months after 30 states have ratified it.The Government is committed to promoting the earliest possible entry into force of the convention and, as a demonstration of that commitment, we have given priority to the early publication and enactment of the present Bill, so that Ireland will be in a position both to sign and ratify the convention on 3 December.  The programme for Government commits us to campaign for a complete ban on cluster munitions.  I know this priority is also shared by all Members of the House.  Deputies are aware of the loss of life and limb due to these horrendous weapons and have previously expressed their support for action to bring an end to this scourge.The successful conclusion of negotiations on the Convention on Cluster Munitions under Irish chairmanship represents one of the most significant contributions to the development of international humanitarian law in recent years.  I am very proud of the contribution made by officials of my Department and by members of the Defence Forces to this success.International humanitarian law is the branch of the law concerned with the conduct of armed conflict.  Once an armed conflict begins, international humanitarian law applies to limit its effects.  Without it the barbarism and brutality of armed conflict would be without restriction.  International humanitarian law limits the right of the parties to an armed conflict in their choice of methods and means of warfare.  It also requires them to spare those who do not, or can no longer, take a direct part in hostilities, thereby protecting civilians, as well as captured and incapacitated combatants, from the effects of conflict.The basic rule of international humanitarian law in the protection of the civilian population in time of armed conflict is that the parties to the conflict must at all times distinguish between civilians and combatants and between civilian objects and military objectives.  The rule permits them to direct their operations against combatants and military objectives only.  Indiscriminate attacks are prohibited.Where a weapon is incapable of distinguishing between civilian and combatant, or where it is prone to use in such a manner that the effect is similar, it will tend to violate this general basic rule.  It has been found, however, that as with anti-personnel mines, the general rule has not been sufficient in itself to prevent the atrocious humanitarian consequences arising from the use of cluster munitions.  A number of states continued to insist that it was possible to observe the basic rule and still use cluster munitions.  For Ireland and our partners in the Oslo process, and for the many like-minded countries that joined us, it was clear that a new instrument of international humanitarian law dealing specifically with cluster munitions was essential.Historically, cluster bombs have resulted in significant damage in every conflict in which they have been used and have repeatedly caused excessive harm to civilians.  Among the first uses of cluster munitions was an attack on Grimsby during the Second World War, where many civilians were killed and injured by munitions which had not exploded upon impact.  The weapon subsequently formed part of NATO arsenals during the Cold War.  They were used on an enormous scale during the Vietnam War, with Laos becoming the most affected country in the world.  Over 260 million sub-munitions were dropped during the Indochina conflict and at the end of the war it was estimated that some 80 million of these sub-munitions were left unexploded.  They continue to cause civilian casualties, restrict access to land and impede social and economic development there.Cluster munitions were also used extensively during the conflict in Kosovo.  Almost 235,000 sub-munitions were dropped across the region against a range of mobile and static targets during the NATO campaign in 1999.  Human Rights Watch has documented 75 civilian deaths and injuries as a direct result of cluster munitions during the bombing campaign.  They have continued to affect civilians there, even after hostilities have ceased.  To date, at least 152 post conflict casualties are estimated to have been caused by unexploded bomblets.  In 2002, Landmine Action published detailed case-studies of social and economic impacts resulting from cluster munitions contamination in western Kosovo.  These case studies highlighted issues such as the abandonment of traditional pastoral practices due to contamination of high summer pastures, extensive contamination making agricultural subsistence doubtful, and hampered infrastructure renovation, which in turn acted as a barrier to the return of displaced populations.The high failure rate, large numbers of sub-munitions and extremely wide strike pattern means that even a single cluster munitions strike in or near an agricultural area can pose a significant long-term socioeconomic and physical threat to the population.  Reports by the Iraq landmine impact survey in 2006 revealed that in some areas of southern Iraq, 100% of agricultural land and 95% of pasture land was inaccessible due to explosive remnants of war, a high proportion of which were cluster bomb sub-munitions.  Due to desperation, necessity and the long time it takes to clear affected areas, many people take the conscious risk to return to their land before it has been cleared.  This all too often results in the most tragic of consequences.The 2006 Lebanon war offers a substantial example of the destruction and devastation that the widespread use of cluster munitions can cause.  Some 4 million sub-munitions were fired into south Lebanon by Israel.  This left approximately 1 million unexploded individual sub-munitions in the area.  Areas contaminated included agricultural land and water and power infrastructure.  The UN Food and Agriculture Organization estimated that in large areas of southern Lebanon at least 25% of the cultivated area was contaminated by unexploded cluster sub-munitions.  By December 2007, 217 civilians in Lebanon had been killed or injured by unexploded ordnance, almost all by sub-munitions.Most recently, it has been reported that both sides in the Russian-Georgian conflict engaged in the use of cluster munitions.  It is our hope that even states which do not immediately become party to the new convention will, nonetheless, be inhibited from using cluster munitions by the stigmatisation effect of widespread adherence by others.In the light of the absence of progress in the Geneva forum offered by the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, and inspired by the process which led to the conclusion of the Ottawa Convention on the Prohibition of Anti-Personnel Mines, Norway convened a meeting in Oslo in February 2007 of countries ready to explore ways to address the issue of cluster munitions in a determined and effective manner.  Ireland was among the 46 states, including some cluster munition users and-or producers, such as France, Germany and the United Kingdom, which committed themselves in the Oslo declaration to complete an international treaty by the end of 2008 to "prohibit the use, production, transfer and stockpiling of cluster munitions that cause unacceptable harm to civilians".The Oslo process, as it became known, was driven forward by a core group of like-minded countries, comprising Norway, Ireland, Austria, the Holy See, Mexico, New Zealand, and Peru, and was characterised by a strong partnership between government, international organisations and civil society.  From the outset, there was a strong humanitarian focus to ensure that any agreement reached would adequately address the numerous relief and development issues that are left in the wake of the use of cluster munitions.  The attitude taken was that this was not a classic disarmament negotiation, where both sides faced each other in an atmosphere of mutual distrust, but rather a humanitarian one, where there was general agreement and commitment to our objective, but how best to achieve this had still to be established.  I am pleased to say that this spirit of collaboration prevailed throughout and contributed to the excellent outcome.Significantly, at the second international conference of the Oslo process in Lima, in May 2007, the composition of the process began to evolve and expand.  Some 68 countries were represented there, many of them developing states from Latin America, Africa and Asia, including many states affected by cluster munitions.  An enduring feature of the Oslo process is the increasingly widespread participation from developing and affected states.Momentum for the Oslo process continued to grow exponentially and the third international conference in Vienna in December 2007 was attended by 138 countries.  The core group discussion text tabled at the conference resulted in collective indications of support for a strong treaty that would focus not only on a widespread ban on cluster munitions but also on support for victim assistance and co-operation.  The discussions also identified a number of potentially contentious issues, including the definition of cluster munitions and the so-called interoperability issue of military co-operation with states not party to a future treaty.Far from derailing the Oslo process, these difficulties served to encourage us to redouble our efforts in order to achieve a successful outcome to the penultimate conference in Wellington in February 2008.  Wellington was an extremely important stage in the process as the anticipated final declaration was intended to act as a basis on which formal treaty negotiations could be held in Dublin.  Although the conference saw some tense and even difficult exchanges, much was achieved.  The draft convention text was discussed in detail.  While major differences remained on key issues of scope and definitions, as well as interoperability and transition periods, prospective solutions for many less contentious issues were identified.  The Irish delegation worked extremely hard to encourage support for the Wellington declaration and by the conclusion of the conference there was an overwhelming endorsement by 82 states to associate themselves with the text.  Japan and South Africa, neither of which had signed up to Oslo, also endorsed the declaration and committed to attend the Dublin conference.  Commitment to the Wellington declaration was in effect the entry ticket to the Dublin conference and many more states committed themselves in the run-up to Dublin.The Dublin diplomatic conference was attended by 127 states, with 107 attending as participants and 20 as observers.  A large number of international, intergovernmental and non-governmental organisations also attended as observers.  Many significant differences needed to be resolved on key issues such as definitions, the possible period of transition to a ban and future military co-operation, including in UN mandated missions, with states not party to the convention.  However, following two weeks of intense work and building on the preparatory discussions held at the earlier meetings, the conference adopted by consensus the text of the Convention on Cluster Munitions.I will now set out the main provisions of this ground breaking convention.  There is a comprehensive prohibition on the use, development, production, acquisition, stockpiling, retention and transfer of cluster munitions, as well as on assisting, encouraging or inducing anyone to engage in behaviour prohibited to a state party under the convention.The definition of a cluster munition under the convention is comprehensive and will lead to the prohibition of all cluster munitions that cause unacceptable harm to civilians.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	363	The convention prohibits all types of cluster munitions that have ever been used in an armed conflict.  Furthermore, following proposals made by the Irish delegation, the convention also prohibits explosive bomblets that are specifically designed to be dispersed or released from dispensers affixed to aircraft in the same way as it does cluster munitions proper.  This is an extremely important provision which closes potential loopholes created by new technologies.The convention provides that a state party's stockpiles of cluster munitions must be destroyed within eight years of the convention's entry into force for that state party.  This period may, under exceptional circumstances, be extended.  In view of the fact that some states may not have facilities suitable for destroying stockpiled cluster munitions, the transfer of cluster munitions to another state party for the purpose of destruction is permitted.  Furthermore, the retention or acquisition of a limited number of cluster munitions and explosive submunitions for training purposes, as well as their transfer to another state party for such purposes, is permitted.  The number of submunitions retained or acquired shall not exceed the minimum absolutely necessary and there is an obligation to report on the numbers retained or acquired and the use made of them.With regard to the clearance of cluster munition remnants, such remnants in areas under the jurisdiction or control of a state party are to be cleared and destroyed within ten years of the convention's entry into force for that state party, or within ten years of the end of active hostilities in cases where such remnants arise after such entry into force.  Provision is made for the extension of this deadline where circumstances warrant it.An important feature of the convention is the onus it puts on state parties that have used cluster munitions against other states parties to assist in the clearance of cluster munition remnants.  They are strongly encouraged to provide technical, financial, material or human resources assistance to the latter state party as well as providing the precise locations of any strike.  This element of the convention, as the International Committee of the Red Cross has stated, establishes a broader norm so those who engage in armed conflict can no longer walk away from the long-term consequences of the munitions they use, leaving the burden to devastated local communities.  The convention includes comprehensive provisions on assistance by state parties to cluster munition victims in areas under their jurisdiction or control.  They should adequately provide age and gender sensitive assistance, including medical care, rehabilitation and psychological support, as well as provide for social and economic inclusion.Article 6 of the convention includes detailed provisions regarding international co-operation and assistance.  This will be most relevant to the obligations regarding stockpile destruction, clearance and destruction of cluster munition remnants and victim assistance.  The article also stipulates that states in a position to do so shall provide technical, material and financial assistance to state parties affected by cluster munitions.  Furthermore, a state party may seek assistance from the international community, including states parties, the UN and NGOs in developing a national action plan.The provisions of the convention in regard to victim assistance have been acknowledged as setting a new benchmark in this area.  Irish Aid is urgently examining how best to integrate this aspect into its funding and co-operation activities.  Ireland is fully committed to support for victim assistance.  A case in point is our dedication to the Ottawa Convention on anti-personnel land mines.  In 2007 alone, we provided funding to 11 affected countries, including €1 million for integrated mine clearance projects in Laos.The convention lays down detailed obligations regarding annual reporting by state parties on the implementation of their obligations.  It also provides for meetings between the state parties.  The first meeting must be convened within one year of the entry into force of the convention with subsequent meetings to be convened by the Secretary General of the United Nations annually until the first review conference.Taking account of the fact that, at least initially, not all states will be party to the convention and that some states not party may wish to continue to use cluster munitions, provision is made in Article 21 for state parties to engage in military co-operation and operations with states not party to the convention that might engage in activities prohibited to a state party.  This provision specifically does not authorise a state party to develop, produce or otherwise acquire cluster munitions, to itself stockpile or transfer cluster munitions, to itself use cluster munitions or to expressly request the use of cluster munitions in cases where the choice of munitions used is within its exclusive control.  When considering this article, it should be noted that each state party is obliged to encourage states not party to the convention to become party to it and, where it engages in military co-operation or operations as referred to above, to notify the states concerned of its obligations under the convention, promote the norms established by the convention and make its best efforts to discourage states not party to the convention from using cluster munitions.Ireland believes that the prohibition on cluster munitions contained in the convention will become established as a new norm of international humanitarian law.  This will happen when states begin to feel obliged to behave in accordance with it, irrespective of whether they are parties to it.  It has happened already, very successfully, in the case of the anti-personnel mine ban convention.  We hope that the Convention on Cluster Munitions will have a similar effect.  It would be difficult to overestimate the importance of this convention and the positive impact it will have for present and future generations of civilians caught up in zones of conflict.  With the ground breaking provisions for victim assistance and clearance of contaminated areas, it represents a major advance in international humanitarian law.  At the conclusion of the Dublin conference, the International Committee of the Red Cross delivered a statement stressing its humanitarian significance in which it observed:The implementation of this treaty will undoubtedly allow many children in future conflict zones the chance to grow up to be adults.  It will also afford their parents the chance to feed those children from the harvests of lands not contaminated with cluster munitions.The statement went on to note:In adopting this Convention [we] have put in place the last essential element in an international legal regime to address the effects of weapons that can't stop killing....we now have the tools to prevent or remedy the often tragic consequences for civilians of all explosive munitions used in armed conflicts.The UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, addressed the opening of the conference by video message and at the conclusion expressed his delight that the strong calls to address the humanitarian impact of cluster munitions had been answered.  He described the convention as a new international standard that would enhance the protection of civilians, strengthen human rights and improve prospects for development.  He also confirmed that he would accept depository functions and pledged the support and assistance of the entire United Nations system to states parties in implementing their treaty obligations.  On 30 October, the first committee of the United Nations General Assembly adopted by consensus a resolution brought forward by Ireland, which provides the mandate for the UN Secretary-General to perform the administrative functions conferred on him by the Convention on Cluster Munitions.The convention will be opened for signature in Oslo on 3 December this year, and will enter into force six months after the deposit of the 30th instrument of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession.  Given our involvement with the Oslo process and our leadership throughout, the Government considers it imperative for Ireland to be in a position to both sign and ratify the convention on 3 December.  This would be in keeping with our record on the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention, where Ireland was one of only three states which signed and ratified on the first day.  In order to be best placed to sign and ratify the Convention on Cluster Munitions the Government is seeking to enact this Bill within a very tight timeframe.  Early enactment will ensure that the State is in a position to meet its obligations from the moment of the convention's entry into force.  It was with this aim in mind that, as soon as the convention was adopted on 30 May, the relevant Departments began work on preparing the Bill.The primary purpose of the Bill is to create offences in respect of the use, development, production, acquisition, stockpiling, retention or transfer of cluster munitions and explosive bomblets as required under the convention.  We are also taking this opportunity to make similar provision for anti-personnel mines in order further to implement the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention, which was ratified by Ireland in 1997.  The current law on anti-personnel mines is set out in the Explosives (Land Mines) Order 1996, which was made under the Explosives Act 1875.  That order is likely to be revoked by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform upon enactment of new explosives legislation and the consequent repeal of the 1875 Act and we wish to avoid a legal vacuum.Section 1 sets out the Short Title of the Bill and provides for its commencement.  Section 2 makes provision for the interpretation of key terms as defined in both conventions, and other relevant terms.  Many of the terms defined for the purposes of the Bill have been the subject of agreement in the negotiation of the two conventions and their reproduction in the domestic laws of state parties is necessary to ensure that their obligations are observed in a consistent manner among them.  This is especially true for the definitions of a cluster munition, an explosive bomblet and an anti-personnel mine.  If different states were to define key terms in their domestic laws in different ways co-operation between the parties to the conventions would become extremely complex and problematic and would inevitably frustrate coherent implementation of the convention.Sections 3 and 4 are standard provisions for the laying of orders and expenses.  Section 5 allows the Minister to declare by order which states are parties to the Convention on Cluster Munitions.  This is necessary for the purposes of co-operation with those states under section 7 of the Bill.  A similar provision enabling the Minister to declare by order the states parties to the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention is made in section 8.Section 6 makes it a criminal offence, with certain exceptions set out in section 7, to use, develop, produce, acquire, possess, retain or transfer a cluster munition or an explosive bomblet.  It will also be an offence to assist, encourage or induce the commission of such an offence.  Any such act committed outside the State on board an Irish ship or aircraft, or by a member of the Defence Forces, will also be an offence.  Section 6 gives effect to the requirement under Article 9 of the convention to take all appropriate measures to implement the convention, including the imposition of penal sanctions to prevent and suppress any prohibited activity.In accordance with the Convention on Cluster Munitions, section 7 permits certain acts that might otherwise be offences under section 6, namely retention or acquisition of a limited number of cluster munitions or explosive bomblets for development of, and training in, detection, clearance and destruction of these munitions, or for the development of counter-measures.  This is in accordance with Article 3 of the convention.  It also makes provision for their possession in the context of criminal investigations or proceedings and their transfer to the Defence Forces or to another state party for the purposes of their destruction.Provision is also made to enable the Defence Forces to participate in United Nations mandated peacekeeping forces with a state or states that may not be party to the Convention on Cluster Munitions, in accordance with Article 21 of that convention.  This is the so-called "interoperability" provision of the convention, which was the most difficult issue to resolve in the negotiations at Croke Park.  Agreement was reached on Article 21 quite literally only at the last moment.  Section 7(4) of the Bill will ensure that future participation by the Defence Forces in UN mandated peacekeeping operations will be consistent with the convention.  Its purpose is to ensure that no member of the Defence Forces, while serving abroad with military personnel of states that are not party to the convention, such as in a UN peacekeeping mission, may find himself or herself criminally liable for an inadvertent, unintended or unavoidable act that might otherwise be an offence.  The Bill makes clear that under no circumstances may he or she expressly request the use of cluster munitions.It is very unlikely that section 7(4) of the Bill will ever be invoked.  It is important to recall that Article 21 obliges every state party to the convention to work to promote universal adherence to it and the Government will continue to urge all states to become parties to the convention.  Our preference in considering future contributions to peacekeeping missions will naturally be to join with states that are parties to the convention and in these circumstances the question of interoperability with states not party to it will not arise.  Even were we to find ourselves as members of a peacekeeping mission that included the armed forces of a state that is not party to the convention, every effort will be made in the elaboration of codes of conduct, rules of engagement, caveats and similar agreements prepared for the mission to ensure that there is no prospect of cluster munitions playing any role.  It is highly unlikely therefore that section 7(4) will ever apply but all Members of the House agree on the importance of ensuring that no member of the Defence Forces should ever face prosecution for simply carrying out his or her duty as a member of a peacekeeping mission.Section 9 makes the use, development, production, acquisition, possession, retention or transfer of an anti-personnel mine an offence, in accordance with Article 9 of the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention.  Certain exceptions are permitted, in accordance with the convention, and these are provided for in section 10.Section 13 provides for penalties to be imposed upon summary conviction and conviction on indictment of an offence under sections 6 and 9 relating to anti-personnel mines.  The maximum penalty for conviction on indictment is ten years imprisonment or a fine of €250,000, or both.  This reflects the seriousness of the offences concerned.  Section 14 provides for liability of a body corporate and is a standard provision to ensure that bodies corporate do not avoid responsibility for conduct prohibited to individuals.  Section 15 allows for the forfeiture of items to the State and is necessary to ensure that a cluster munition, explosive bomblet or anti-personnel mine seized during the investigation of a suspected offence is not returned to a claimant under the Police (Property) Act 1897 but is sent for destruction.  The texts of the two conventions are set out for ease of reference in the Schedules to the Bill.This comprehensive legislation was drawn up in consultation with the national committee on international humanitarian law, which was established in advance of the diplomatic conference.  My Department has also consulted closely with the International Committee of the Red Cross, which made available an advance copy of its model law for the implementation of the Convention on Cluster Munitions.In addition to the provisions of the Bill as published it is also the Government's intention to introduce additional legislative provision that will make it expressly clear that the investment of public moneys, including by the National Pensions Reserve Fund, in any company that produces cluster munitions or anti-personnel mines is prohibited.  However this is a complex undertaking, involving consultations among numerous actors, and it was unfortunately not possible to complete work on it in time for its inclusion in the Bill as published.  We hope to be able to bring this forward as soon as possible to allow for consideration on Committee Stage.I must reiterate that it is an absolute priority for Ireland to be in a position to both sign and ratify the convention in Oslo on 3 December and this legislation will facilitate that objective.  Thus I would ask all Members of the House to support the early enactment of this Bill in the best interests of international humanitarian law, disarmament and development.  I thank all Members for their support to date, prior to and during the convention.  I commend the Bill to the House.

Members will remember that earlier this year I introduced a Private Members' Bill on cluster munitions.  I regret that the Minister's predecessor was not magnanimous enough to accept the Bill.  It was no different from this Bill, except that it went a little further.  I cannot understand why the Minister refused to accept it.  I welcome that the Title of the Bill has been changed from the Inhumane Munitions Bill to Cluster Munitions and Anti-Personnel Mines Bill.  The original Title sent out a strange message.Changes are required to strengthen this Bill but I support the principles behind the Bill.  I regret that the Government has not published the provision to prohibit investment by a State body in any producer of cluster munitions or anti-personnel mines.  Fine Gael will bring an amendment to this effect on Committee Stage.  The Minister referred to the Government bringing forward such an amendment and referred to its complexity.  This issue was well-flagged and, while I do not want to have a go at the Minister's predecessor, he made a big play of the fact that the Government would bring forward this measure, notwithstanding that he did not support our Bill on the night.  It is unacceptable that such a measure is not included in this Bill, which is being introduced six months after our Bill, and given that this measure was well flagged.  It cannot have been that difficult to have included it.  The blame probably lies with the Department of Finance and perhaps that tells its own story.The urgency to deal with this issue was shown by the Government only a few months ago. We all applauded when the Dublin Convention was agreed, but since then and since I introduced my Bill on this issue last April, we have seen yet another war in which cluster munitions were used.  Last August Russia and Georgia fought a war over South Ossetia.  Now is not the time to discuss the rights and wrongs of that war, who started it, who provoked it or who caused it, but both countries are guilty of the crime — in my view it is a crime — of using cluster munitions.  Russia denied it, but Human Rights Watch, an organisation that has been an outspoken campaigner against cluster munitions, is convinced, based on evidence, that both countries used them.  Georgia has admitted to doing so, but it insists that its cluster bombs contained a self-destruct mechanism to make them inoperable after the war.We know from past wars elsewhere that these mechanisms do not work in all cases.  At least 10% of those cluster munitions, even if they are designed to cease to be live, still remain live.  While we remember the South Ossetia War as being in 2008, there is every likelihood that in 2009, 2010, 2018 and perhaps in 100 years' time people, many of them children, will still be killed by the cluster bombs dropped in 2008.Last night the BBC broadcast a programme on the First World War.  Most of us think of the First World War as having ended in 1918, but it turns out that in 2008, 90 years after the end of that war, people are still being killed by unexploded bombs that were fired in that war.  What was termed "The war to end all wars" keeps on killing.Prior to the First World War, the British artillery based here continuously fired munitions in the Glen of Imaal in Wicklow over a period of three or four weeks in preparation for the war and in respect of those munitions fired there was a one third failure rate.  Many of them are to be found unexploded in the military ranges in the Glen of Imaal.  I do not believe we will ever be in a position to clear them, but it is important that the safety guidelines and notices warning of them in that area are constantly reviewed.  A tragedy occurred in the late 1970s when some young children were killed when they picked up an unexploded mortar bomb.The First World War bombs that have exploded are not cluster munitions but the remnants of the normal artillery of the day. They are far less dangerous, far less widespread and far less of a threat than cluster munitions, but they are still killing.  If 90 years after the end of that war, deaths continue to occur, for how many decades, maybe centuries, will people in South Ossetia be killed by cluster munitions?  Will Deputies in this House a century from now be reading of young South Ossetians being killed by cluster bombs dropped in 2008?We know that cluster munitions kill for generations after a war ends.  The Laos civil war ended in 1975, but people were still being killed this year, perhaps this very day, in Laos, thanks to the cluster munitions used in that war.  Cluster munitions used in the Second World War and in Vietnam are still killing.If cluster bombs had existed in the early 1920s and had been used during our War of Independence, we would have members of our own families being killed by them still.  That illustrates how dangerous they are.  They kill long after the war they were used in has been forgotten, long after it has been confined to the history books, long after everyone who was alive at the time of the war and those who fought in the war has died.  Cluster munitions are almost literally a war without end.The first cluster bombs were made by Germany and dropped during the Second World War in Grimsby, as the Minister outlined.  Other states copied the technology and developed it, producing carnage in country after country.  In the 1960s the United States used cluster bombs in Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos.  France used them in Chad in the 1960s.  The United States used them in Iraq and Kuwait in 1991.  Russia used them in Chechnya in the 1990s while the Sudanese Government used them against the Sudanese People's Liberation Army.  Up to the end of the last century, in 1999, the United States, Britain and the Netherlands used them in Kosovo.  They continue to be used in this century and not only in South Ossetia.  In the current Iraq war, the US military used them.  Only two years ago the Israelis used them in Lebanon.I will cite an example from one war on the record. Globalsecurity.org indicates that, “According to the UN Mine Action Co-ordination Centre (UNMACC) in Pristina, the total number of mines and UXO (unexploded ordinances) cleared by 8 March 2001 [in Kosovo] was assessed at [more than 84,000]” — more than 84,000 in one country in one war.  They were not all cluster munitions but many of them were.  How many people, including children, have been or will be killed by those 84,000 unexploded bombs?  When were they or will they be killed?  This year?  This decade?  This century?Let us not forget how cluster munitions kill.  Fragments of exploding munitions travel at high velocity.  When they strike they set off pressure waves within the body, with those pressure waves and the fragments and projectiles doing horrific damage to soft tissue and organs.  Even a single fragment can rupture the spleen or cause the intestines to implode.  If a victim survives the incident, and needless to say many will not, they may suffer from a variety of injuries, including loss of limbs, burns, puncture wounds, ruptured eardrums, blindness, or all of those and other injuries.  Many of those who survive speak of wishing they had not, such is the horrific nature of their injuries.Anton Antonowicz reported in the Daily Mirror that:Among the 168 patients I counted [in a hospital], not one was being treated for bullet wounds.  All of them, men, women, children, bore the wounds of bomb shrapnel.  It peppered their bodies.  Blackened the skin. Smashed heads.  Tore limbs.  A doctor reported that  "All the injuries you see were caused by cluster bombs ... The majority of the victims were children who died because they were outside".That is what those who use cluster munitions inflict on victims, and why those weapons must be banned by every country on every continent forever.I want to pay tribute to the work of the Government in the Dublin conference, which produced the treaty to ban cluster munitions.  In particular, I compliment the Minister, Deputy Martin, and his staff in the Department of Foreign Affairs on the excellent work they did.  Ireland and the other countries in the core group of the Oslo Process, namely, Austria, the Holy See, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway and Peru, did humanity some service in helping to deliver this treaty and deserve praise for that.  Those countries who assembled in Croke Park for the conference delivered one of the most significant advances for humanity in this century so far.I also pay tribute to a number of Irish newspapers, in particular The Star, which ran a vigorous campaign on the issue and helped inform Irish people of the horrors of cluster munitions and campaigned to see their use ended.  Those campaigns will have helped save lives and will have kept the issue alive in the minds of the public.  They deserve our thanks.I pay a special tribute to one world leader, Britain's Prime Minister, Gordon Brown.  Britain, like many other states, fought for years to prevent this deal and refused to join it, but Gordon Brown this year over-ruled his advisers and his military, to commit Britain to abandoning the use of those weapons.  That was the act of real leadership and deserves to be acknowledged.Today, on 4 November, millions of people in the United States are going to the polls to elect the next US president.  Two honourable men, Senators Obama and McCain, have fought a remarkable campaign.  We will know tonight which one of them will win the race for the White House.  For eight years the presidency of George Bush has resisted attempts to restrict and ban these weapons, albeit by allowing a one year ban to come into place, which is due to end in late December.  I appeal to the new president, whether it is Senator Obama or Senator McCain, to follow Gordon Brown's lead and take a principled stand against these evil weapons. Senator McCain, to his credit, broke with President Bush and with his party on the issue of the use of torture, calling for it to be halted in all cases. Whether today sees the election of Senator Obama or Senator McCain as president, I hope we will see the election of a president who will take a principled stand on cluster munitions by telling the US military that they can no longer ever be used.  I ask the Government to raise this issue directly with the new US president.Fine Gael also urges the Government to raise with Russia, China, Israel, India and Pakistan their refusal to agree to the treaty ban on cluster munitions.  We must not mince our words in putting on the record the unacceptability of their behaviour.   Under Article 85 of the Geneva Conventions, it is a war crime to launch "an indiscriminate attack affecting the civilian population in the knowledge that such an attack will cause an excessive loss of life or injury to civilians".  Under the Hague Conventions, Articles 22 and 23 state that, "The right of belligerents to adopt means of injuring the enemy is not unlimited," and that "It is especially forbidden to kill treacherously individuals belonging to the hostile nation or army".  I cannot see how the use of cluster bombs can be viewed as other than a war crime and any leader who authorises their use as other than a war criminal.I have not focused on the fact that the Bill also deals with anti-personnel mines, but I warmly welcome this inclusion.  I do not know why this is only featuring in legislation in 2008 when we signed the treaty in 1997.  Will the Minister clarify the reasons for the delay?  However, it is a welcome, if belated, step.  The fact that the Bill deals with two of the most gruesome and morally reprehensible weapons ever invented, cluster munitions and landmines, makes the legislation one of the most important enactments we have had to deal with here.The Minister has dealt with the various sections, which are relatively straightforward.  Everybody in the House supports the banning of cluster munitions which are reprehensible and indiscriminate weapons.  They do not distinguish between friend and foe, or between child and adult.  The implications of such weapons continue for many years after the conflict occurs.  When I served in Lebanon, I often met children with one arm or one leg missing caused by playing with something that to them appeared attractive.  Very often these munitions are disguised as attractive items basically to strike terror into a population.Section 7(4) deals with the issue of interoperability.  Fine Gael supports this measure.  We believe it is necessary in order to enable us to participate in peacekeeping operations.  I would hope that in time this section will become redundant.  I am not aware if Defence Forces personnel have ever operated in a situation where cluster munitions were used by a friendly force.  I would not imagine this to be the case.  I know they have operated in several areas where they are a threat and one part of their missions is often to clear up such areas.  If the Bill did not provide for that measure our peacekeeping, as we know it today, would come to an end.  It would not be possible for us to carry out peacekeeping operations if we prohibited Irish forces from serving with personnel from countries that were not signatories to the convention, or that used these munitions or had them in stores.  I would hope that with the passing of time this section of the Bill will become redundant.  Much depends on the approach of the incoming President of the United States of America.  I hope this will be a step that country will take.The Bill contains no provision for applying a cost on the offender for the destruction of cluster munitions and rather requires them to be delivered to the Defence Forces for their destruction.  I ask the Minister to review this provision.  Fine Gael will table an amendment requiring the offender, the guilty party, to pay the cost of the destruction of the munitions.We will also table an amendment to prevent State companies investing in companies that manufacture or are involved in the production or otherwise of such munitions.  During the debate on the Fine Gael Private Members' Bill, we dealt with the issue of financial institutions producing the annual reports on companies involved in their manufacture.  We may also revisit that matter.I welcome the Bill and our party will do all we can to facilitate it so that it can all be in order by the time the signature is required, which I believe is sometime in December.  I wish the Minister well and thank his officials for their work on the Bill.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	365	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  It is important that I acknowledge the Government's intentions in introducing this legislation and the manner in which consensus was achieved on so many fundamental aspects of it over a period of a few years.  I also pay tribute to people like Tony D'Costa of Pax Christi Ireland and others in the non-governmental sector who were involved not only in the issue of prohibiting cluster munitions and related ordnances, but also had continued a campaign that preceded and ran through the attempt to have a comprehensive ban on landmines.I have a very genuine sense of both appreciation and admiration for the officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs who were involved in tasks of active diplomacy.  My office, along with those of Deputy Timmins and Senator Norris, organised a meeting of parliamentarians in Buswells Hotel which coincided with the conference in Croke Park.  It was useful to hear their views even though in the end I may have a reservation as to the completeness of what was achieved, a point to which I will return shortly.  This active diplomacy is an exemplary action by a country like Ireland and was much appreciated internationally.I will have the opportunity tomorrow to say that I regard Ireland's departure from our strong position on the Nuclear Suppliers Group a retrograde action.  On this occasion we were in fact being very positive.  When one considers Ireland's record in international law regarding the United Nations there is a high point with the non-nuclear proliferation treaty and Mr. Aiken's presence at the United Nations.  There were also moments, as when with the new agenda group we sought to draw attention to the non-compliance of nuclear powers and also make the case against any proliferation that endangers the very survival of the population of the planet.  In that sense, I welcome this legislation although not quite unreservedly.  I have two points to make that are important in the interpretation of the Bill.  The context is also very important.The Bill stretches back to include landmines.  I was a member of the Government when the landmines convention was prepared.  It was very important at that stage that we produced a template of what we wanted from the conference that produced the convention.  In the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs in 2006 and 2007, I proposed resolutions suggesting that Ireland, as it were, should anticipate the conference that would eventually take place in Croke Park by laying down a template to which people could then respond.  The Government and I differed on that.  The advice to the Government seemed to be that one should let the conference take its course and then, on the basis of securing the maximum compliance, respond to the final conclusion.  It is a matter for future historians to decide which was the right course.  Be that as it may, my view is that the former model is the better one.  In 2006 and 2007, Belgium and Austria had followed such a path in the preparation of domestic legislation.This is a rather long way of stating a point of view that I hold, which is that one should always use one's domestic legislation, given the activist achievement Ireland can point to, to go beyond the minimum required in the convention.  In that way, one is continually raising the bar.  On Committee Stage, I intend to table an amendment on interoperability.  The distinguished spokesperson for Fine Gael, for whom I have the greatest respect, and I differ.  I believe it is an important moral lien on participants in conflicts for Ireland to take a strong line regarding section 7.  It is insufficient to claim that as long as one did not know, then one could not be involved in any kind of criminal guilt or responsibility.  There is need for an absolute ban on any form of participation with a non-signatory of the treaty on cluster munitions.  I will return to another one later that worried me greatly in the course of the discussions at the conference and afterwards.  I want to be as scrupulously fair to the Government as I can be.  It has to some extent met the suggestion that one could define a residual category of acceptable cluster munitions on a scale of human impact.  I will revert to this on Committee Stage.Out of courtesy, I suggest that the Minister examine section 30 of the Defence Act 1954, whereby the Minister for Defence has the right to authorise the placing of mines.  Will section 30 survive this legislation?  From my first lay view of the Bill, it will not change the Act.The degree of consensus in the House is incredible and welcome, but we should bear in mind the question of how many permanent members of the Security Council were represented at the Croke Park conference and with what consequences.  The decision of the Nuclear Suppliers Group on the US-India nuclear agreement facilitated India and its neighbour, Pakistan, neither of which was involved in the conference.According to an NGO that appeared at a 2007 meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, some 200 types of cluster bomb have been developed by 33 countries whereas 28 countries produce them.  Millions of cluster munitions have been used in the past 40 to 50 years and billions have been stockpiled by 76 governments.  This is the scale of the problem, but people are excessively polite about, for example, the actions of the Israeli Government during the conflict in southern Lebanon, where our soldiers served.  Some 4 million cluster bombs were released during the last 72 hours of the truce negotiations.  People suggest that one must be on one side or the other to discuss the Arab-Israeli conflict dispassionately, but the situation is an outrageous breach of humanitarian law.Up to a point, international humanitarian law protects civilians during times of conflict.  However, when the conflict is over, considerable areas have been rendered unusable.  To the Minister's credit, he correctly referred to the destruction of pastoral lands and so forth that will not be usable for not one, but many generations.  He also listed those who were killed after the cessation of conflicts in Kosovo and elsewhere.When I was an election observer in Cambodia, I was in charge of the Kompong Chnang district at the top of the Tonle Sap River.  One could not step out of a vehicle for fear of landmines.  More importantly, I saw the tens of thousands of people who had been maimed and were still at risk.  I admired people from New Zealand and elsewhere who were involved in the humanitarian task of removing mines, but I have no faith in the suggestion that those who place mines will ever tell the international community where they have been laid.  There is no evidence of it in the reports of those involved in peacekeeping or conflict studies.  The moral argument against landmines and so forth is not answered by suggestions that the issue can be dealt with scientifically or technologically through sharing information in future on where mines have been placed.  While it would be a good idea and facilitate clearance, it will not work.I have a problem with the definitional sections of the Bill.  For example, they refer to fewer than ten elements.  If one hits the target, the other nine lie unexploded.  One is partially accepting the consequences of cluster munitions and their civilian impact.  For this reason, I am in favour of an outright ban.  I am also in favour of the question of prohibition, which would address the issue of interoperability, to which I will revert on Committee Stage.An interesting question that may be worthy of reflection should be brought to Cabinet by the Minister.  He stated that the production, transmission and carriage of cluster munitions will be prohibited.  I agree with him in this respect.  A unique element of the Ottawa convention, popularly known as the Diana convention, was the transfer of landmines.  The Bill mentions transfer by way of ship or aircraft.  This suggests that there has always been a provision to inspect an aircraft at Shannon Airport suspected of carrying landmines.  In terms of cluster munitions, I presume that the same inspection rights of military aircraft will exist.  I hope to be of assistance to the Government shortly in terms of such amendments as are appropriate to the Chicago convention regarding an inspection regime of leased civilian aircraft.It is important to refer to additional points, one of which the Minister mentioned and that may be examined more closely on Committee Stage, namely, the impact on victims.  At a meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Senator Norris and I tabled a motion stressing that victims be generously treated.Returning to first principles, it is interesting that the total amount being spent by the United States, which is paralleled by China, the former Soviet Union and several other countries, on armaments is not decreasing.  The figure for the US is approximately $600 billion, which stands in contrast against the aid budget or any minuscule amount being spent on countries such as Cambodia, Vietnam and Laos.  We must remember that the bombing of Laos was one of the great inhuman acts, totally illegal and without  permission even of the country involved in the bombing.  Laotians are still there, still suffering with their country destroyed in an intergenerational sense, so there are issues of intergenerational justice that arise.  I have saluted the achievement of the Government in respect of this legislation.  I salute also the achievement of those who have worked professionally to bring about consensus.  I hope they can accept that I take a harder line in regard to what should be the diplomatic thrust in respect of, for example, text.  I hold the view — drawn from the experience of the preparations for the Ottawa Convention in relation to landmines — that it is better to put the template in place and to try to bring people up to it.  I would argue that I am supported in this by the absence of significant figures from the Croke Park conference.  It is to their shame that they were not present at that conference.In regard to the future shape of geopolitics and the new architecture that is opening up internationally, it is important that a lien be put on countries, including India and Pakistan, that suggests what can be achieved diplomatically rather than militarily.  We are coming out of a terrible couple of decades during which — we must be realistic when discussing international affairs — the United Nations has been weakened by external events and by some of its own internal practices.  Also, it is has been weakened contextually in terms of its inability, often hampered by weak resolutions that have come from a security council that is not free to act in accordance with even the humanitarian principles of the charter.In addition, there has been very little to which to point by way of UN reform during the past decade.  The result of this has been a shift from what was regarded as the great promise of the end of the Cold War that the resources of the world, financial, human, technological and scientific, might be released for the great tasks of reducing avoidable diseases such as malaria to enable people to move to a state of food sufficiency and the concept of sustainable development.  This has been entirely reversed.  There is a growing feeling, driven by the neo-con authors of the project for a new American century, that argued, in a distortion of an old classical theory of Thucydides and the Peloponnesian war, that not to exercise power was to lose power, a complete distortion of that Greek text into which I will not be drawn.  This was a disastrous interpretation of the role of resources and power in the world.An issue then arises as to whether we can recover the diplomatic moment in international affairs, and the atmosphere is not good.  For example, it is perceived as soft diplomacy to be able to go tediously towards negotiation.  It is clear that the conflicts that exist in the world at present are no longer primarily inter-State but intrastate with people seizing on the vestiges of religion, nationality or ethnic identity and putting the cloak of their current conflict on them to carry them forward.  This is creating a disaster in Africa and in respect of India-Pakistan relations.  In those circumstances, the role of diplomacy must be expressed forcibly.  We should not adjust ourselves to that which is achievable by those who are half-hearted in terms of their international obligations.In regard to Kosovo, one of the speakers on the fringes of the conference was 27 year old Branislav Kapetanovic, a man from the Serbian Army, who lost four of his limbs and suffered extensive damage to his hearing and sight while attempting to escape an attack on an airport.  NATO dropped 240,000 cluster bombs on Kosovo.  This raises the issue of whether there are circumstances in which clusters should be used.  I do not believe they should ever be used.  Also, on whether there are circumstances in which cluster bombs can fall with limited damage — a text which continues to hover around — the answer must be "No".  On whether there are circumstances in which one can participate with a State or non-signatory to the convention and simply state that as long as one does not know what is in the package one can escape moral consequence, the answer must also be "No".  This is not to weaken or take from what has been achieved, it is simply to give content to what I have been saying, namely, that the bar must be raised in respect of the assertion of diplomacy above war.  I was convinced of this when approximately five or six weeks prior to the Iraq War in conversation with Tariq Aziz regarding whether the diplomatic alternatives to war been exhausted.  Clearly, they had not.There are few more damaging or degrading moments at the United nations than when a false file is put into the hands of a decent man and is read out as evidence in relation to weapons of mass destruction.  On the basis of a tissue of lies and a crafting of deceit and dishonesty, people were driven to war resulting in the loss of many lives. How will we ever put a final figure on the loss of life in this regard?  There are many in the shadows who say our economy relies on defence spending, defence spending being the test of power, and that therefore to have power one must always be seen to exercise it.  This is the old argument that the Athenians lost against Sparta, a false argument on the basis that they did not exercise their power.As an academic, I was often appalled by the intellectuals in different countries who were willing to provide a kind of knowledge system that supported the abuse of power.  I pay tribute to all of those who have worked on the text so far.  I remain convinced that it can be improved by including all that is part of the international consensus and by going a little further.  The Bill will, I hope, fine tune that capacity that existed in the Ottowa convention to ensure nothing is transferred to our air space that will contravene the convention.  I sometimes worry about those in the human rights community and international law community who study the Geneva conventions.  I would argue that it is necessary for us to pay far more attention to international rights that arise in post-conflict situations.  To my mind it places an impossible burden on oneself to suggest that the aim is to resolve conflicts in the sense of eliminating them.  Very often, what one is left with is the creation of an amnesty in the memory of conflict as will enable people to negotiate together and to become involved in the construction of a new form of society.  The world is full of these examples.It is important that there is a new international recognition of the post-conflict casualties.  The media of the world is irresponsible again and again in respect of the manner in which it constructs its forgetfulness.  During the time of the famine in Somalia one could hardly move in Mogadishu for the number of cameras there.  Nobody now looks at Somalia.  Few people visit Cambodia where in the archives in the capital one can see paper rotting because nobody is there to look after it, where there are huge education problems because of an absence of teachers.  Even fewer people visit Laos, and on it goes in many cases.  The morality associated with the banning of cluster munitions and other anti-personnel devices requires that one goes further in taking up the consequences of actions that were taken at times when there was not such enlightened thinking.Another issue dealt with in section 7 — I will return to it on Committee Stage — relates to measures necessary for people to address such matters as research, clearance and so forth.  That is a very different issue from accepting, as any kind of principle, that stockpiles should not now be eliminated.  I gave a figure on current stockpiles and it is important they are eliminated.We must pay tribute to the different dimensions of the achievement of this convention.  I have rightly given credit to the Government for this, as well as the professional diplomatic corps.  The people I have particularly in mind are very important and do not lose faith in language and text when the issue is almost slipping away.  If there is a history of the conflict in Northern Ireland, it is the manner in which the process was kept going by those who worked on text when those at the top had reached an impasse.  It is perhaps the case with the Middle East conflict that if a secretariat had been provided to the Quartet process with regard to Israel and Palestine, it would have provided many opportunities for a principle of continuity after the United States had lost interest or come in or out of its relationship to the conflict.  It is still worth the consideration.We are at a very important time in our history in Europe and internationally.  We are faced with the challenge of crafting an entirely new version of economy internationally which will take account of human need and be built on the principle of sustainability.  It may encounter a further principle of inter-generational justice.  This will require confronting the destructive misuse of resources, human and physical, financial and intellectual.Beyond this convention — a real achievement I hope we will be able to fine tune and endorse — we must take it as an instrument, confront the non-signatories and drive on towards building a different way of relating to each other.  In turn we will feed all this into the United Nations mechanism, which is the only international institution we have.  It is pointless to criticise it and it is much more important to make it work.

#MJNolan	unknown-#MJNolan-party	unknown-#MJNolan-dob	unknown-#MJNolan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	368	I commend the Minister on bringing forward this legislation, which must be passed so we can be party to the convention that will be ratified and signed in Oslo on 3 December.  I welcome the cross-party support for it and the work done by this Minister, the Department and the Government.Cluster munitions have inflicted unacceptable harm on civilian populations and many countries have seen the deadly legacy from cluster submunitions failing to detonate.  We have all seen images on television of young children in particular who have been affected by these deadly munitions.Civilians are killed and injured by cluster bombs exploding years after their use in war; people are still being killed and maimed by such ordnance.  Tragic loss of life and terrible injuries from this are evident across the world and our televisions bring home to us these particularly terrible injuries.  Unexploded cluster munitions also present a significant obstacle to post-conflict communities seeking to rebuild their lives.  Economic reconstruction and social recovery cannot take place until explosive ordnance is cleared and destroyed.Such a task of clearance is a daunting challenge.  I saw at first hand the work of the Irish Defence Forces in this regard when I visited the Lebanon.  Those personnel are to be commended on their technical and professional skills in clearing areas of unexploded ordnance.It is time for us to deal with the cause of the problem as the legacy of unexploded cluster munitions endangers civilian lives in the same way as landmines, and the problem must be dealt with similarly.  The Irish Defence Forces have a clear international reputation in the work it does in this regard.  However, we continually see First World countries developing and specialising in the production of these bombs.  It is unfortunate we cannot do more in that regard but this is a step in the right direction, for which I commend the Minister.On 30 May this year, 107 states participated in the Dublin conference on cluster munitions and agreed to adopt the text of a new convention.  By doing so, the participating states fulfilled the commitment made in the Oslo declaration in February 2007 to conclude by 2008 a legally binding international instrument prohibiting the use and stockpiling of cluster munitions that caused unacceptable harm to civilians, secure adequate provision of care and rehabilitation to survivors and clearance of contaminated areas.The conference was well attended and I heard the Minister, in his opening remarks, speak about countries such as South Africa and Japan, which were not at the forefront but participated in the conference.  The Department of Foreign Affairs took a very active and hands-on role in the process, for which it should be commended.The new convention will be opened for signature at a signing conference in Oslo on 3 December.  All states wishing to join may attend this ceremony and I am glad to hear Ireland will be there to sign up on that date.  Those which do not sign up on 3 December in Oslo can do so at a later stage at the United Nations headquarters in New York.  The new convention prohibits all use, stockpiling, production and transfer of cluster munitions.  Separate articles in the convention concern assistance to victims, clearance of contaminated areas and the destruction of stockpiles.This legislation will confirm this country's support for all efforts this year to conclude the international instrument prohibiting cluster munitions that cause unacceptable harm to civilians.  We need a legally binding international instrument that prohibits the use, development, production, stockpiling and transfer of cluster munitions that cause unacceptable harm to civilians.  The destruction of current stockpiles is also required, and I am led to believe tens of thousands of tonnes of those munitions are stockpiled in various countries.  The instrument also provides for clearance, risk reduction and other risk mitigation activities, as well as actions for victim assistance, co-operation, compliance and transparency measures.Over the past 50 years the use of cluster munitions has shown us the devastating and horrendous impact of such weapons.  Human rights, humanitarian and development impacts of cluster munitions are still present today.The events in 2006 reminded one of this tragedy, when Israel deployed thousands of tonnes of cluster munitions in Lebanon.  Such munitions will still be present in 20, 30 and 40 years' time.  The unfortunate point is that children in particular tend to be the victims of such unexploded ordnance.  Children, by their nature, are inquisitive and will play in areas that less physically nimble adults are unable to access.  Moreover, their inquisitive nature means that when children see something, they pick it up with unfortunate results.  A case from Laos was reported in the newspaper recently, in which 14 children came across an unexploded bomb.  I believe four were killed and the rest were badly injured.The effects on children have been recorded and the United Nations is doing much work in this respect.  For example, two thirds of cluster munitions casualties in Kosovo were 19 years of age or younger.  The average age of casualties in Afghanistan was between seven and 14.  In Vietnam, which was littered with cluster munitions for more than 30 years, data on recent casualties also show a scary story in which children made up 62% of cluster munitions casualties, compared to 49% of landmine and other ordnance casualties.The need for risk reduction education and for the rights of all survivors to medical care, rehabilitation services, psychological support and social and economic inclusion must be recognised.  For children, this means making schools accessible, training teachers to work with children with disabilities and ensuring the support provided is lifelong.  It also means being attentive to the social, economic and psychological needs of children when their parents fall victim to cluster munitions.  The commitment by states, civil society and international organisations to make progress in disarmament, arms control and non-proliferation, through new and creative forms of diplomacy, is growing.  Many states and millions of people globally recognise that our prospects for a peaceful and prosperous future are, to a large extent, dependent on our ability to prohibit or control the development, use, stockpiling and transfer of nuclear, biological, chemical and conventional weapons.Recently, the UN Secretary General stated he was deeply troubled by the lack of progress on global disarmament and all Members would agree.  He called on member states of the UN to improve global security by breaking the stalemate on disarmament that threatens other key objectives of the UN charter.  A treaty prohibiting cluster munitions is among the initiatives that will result in greater global security.  The convention also should address the key concerns of the inherent inaccuracy and frequent malfunctioning of cluster munitions, which makes them particularly indiscriminate, both at the time of their use and long after the conflict has ended.I commend the Minister and wish this legislation a speedy passage in order that Ireland will be able to be a signatory to the convention in Oslo on 3 December.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	369	I also congratulate the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the introduction today of the Cluster Munitions and Anti-Personnel Mines Bill to make provision in domestic law for the obligations the State will assume under the Convention on Cluster Munitions, CCM.  It is a demonstration of the Minister's commitment that he has facilitated the early publication and enactment of this Bill in order that Ireland will be in a position to sign and ratify the convention in Oslo in December.  It was a great honour for Ireland to host the diplomatic conference in Dublin that adopted the CCM in 2008.  It brought the need for immediate action to everyone's consciousness.The conference was attended by 130 states and a large number of international intergovernmental and non-governmental organisations, including many Irish NGOs.  The successful conclusion of negotiations on the CCM under Irish chairmanship represents one of the most significant contributions to the development of international humanitarian law in recent years and constitutes a major achievement in Irish foreign policy.  All those involved in the Department of Foreign Affairs, our embassies and, not least, the Minister are to be congratulated on this achievement.The heart of the convention is an immediate and unconditional ban on all cluster munitions, which cause unacceptable harm to civilians.  Each state party undertakes never in any circumstances to use, develop, produce, acquire, stockpile, retain or transfer cluster munitions, or to assist another party in so doing.  By adopting a wide and encompassing definition, the convention effectively prohibits all cluster munitions that have ever been used in armed conflict.  It also was a very important achievement that the convention provides for no transition periods during which the cluster weapons outlawed could still be used.  In addition, states that sign up to the convention will undertake to ensure the destruction of all their cluster munitions within eight years, with short extensions possible in case of difficulty.  Areas containing cluster munition remnants must be cleared within ten years.  The Government also is pleased that the language in the new convention on victim rights and assistance is the most advanced on these issues ever included in an international instrument.As the Minister noted, among the first uses of cluster munitions was an attack on Grimsby during the Second World War, in which many civilians were killed and injured by munitions that had not exploded upon impact.  The weapon subsequently formed part of NATO's arsenal during the Cold War.  Cluster munitions were used on an enormous scale during the Vietnam War and Laos, which was not even a declared participant in the war, became the most affected country in the world.  The high failure rate, large numbers of sub-munitions and extremely wide strike pattern mean that even a single cluster munitions strike in or near an agricultural area can pose a significant long-term socio-economic and physical threat to the population.  The unexploded bombs continue to cause civilian casualties, restrict access to land and impede social and economic development in such countries.The 2006 Lebanon war offers a significant example of the destruction and devastation the widespread use of cluster munitions can cause.  Approximately 4 million sub-munitions were fired into south Lebanon by Israel.  This left approximately 1 million unexploded individual sub-munitions in the area.  The areas contaminated included agricultural land, as well as water and power infrastructure.  Most recently, it has been reported that both sides in the Russian-Georgian conflict engaged in the use of cluster munitions and this has been condemned in the Council of Europe.Ireland is determined that the prohibition on cluster munitions contained in the convention should become established as a new norm of international humanitarian law.  The hope is that even states which do not become party to the new convention immediately nonetheless will be inhibited from using cluster munitions by the stigmatisation effect of widespread adherence by others.  This has already happened successfully in respect of the anti-personnel mine ban convention and it is hoped the Convention on Cluster Munitions will have a similar effect.Ireland was among the 46 states, including some cluster munition users and cluster munitions producers, such as France, Germany and the United Kingdom, which committed themselves in Oslo in February 2007 to complete an international treaty by the end of 2008 to prohibit the use, production, transfer and stockpiling of cluster munitions that cause unacceptable harm to civilians and to establish a framework for co-operation and assistance that ensures adequate provision of care and rehabilitation to survivors and their communities, clearance of contaminated areas, risk education and destruction of stockpiles of prohibited cluster munitions.  The Oslo process, as it became known, was driven forward by a core group of seven like-minded countries.  I am pleased Ireland was to the fore in that respect, in conjunction with Norway, Austria, the Holy See, Mexico, New Zealand, and Peru, who worked closely with the Cluster Munitions Coalition, NGOs, and international organisations such as the UN and the International Committee of the Red Cross.  From the outset there was a strong humanitarian focus to ensure any agreement reached would adequately address the numerous relief and development issues that are left in the wake of the use of cluster munitions.Momentum for the Oslo process continued to grow exponentially and by the time of the Dublin conference more than 100 countries had joined.  Following two weeks of intense work the diplomatic conference adopted, by consensus of all participating states, the text of the Convention on Cluster Munitions.  There is now a comprehensive prohibition on the use, development, production, acquisition, stockpiling, retention and transfer of cluster munitions, as well as on assisting, encouraging or inducing anyone to engage in behaviour prohibited to a state party under the convention.The definition of a cluster munition under the convention is comprehensive and will lead to the prohibition of all cluster munitions that cause unacceptable harm to civilians.  The convention prohibits all types of cluster munitions that have ever been used in armed conflict.  The convention provides that a state party's stockpile of cluster munitions must be destroyed within eight years of the convention's entry into force for that state party.  That period may, under exceptional circumstances, be extended.  In view of the fact that some states may not have facilities suitable for destroying stockpiled cluster munitions, the transfer of cluster munitions to another state party for the purpose of destruction is permitted.  A small number of cluster munitions may also be retained for training purposes under very strict rules.The provisions of the convention on victim assistance have been acknowledged as setting a new benchmark in this area and the Government will work to integrate this aspect into its funding and co-operation activities.  As Deputy Nolan indicated, Ireland is fully committed to the provision of support for victim assistance, clearance of areas contaminated by unexploded remnants of war, destruction of stockpiles, risk education and support for the rehabilitation and socio-economic integration of survivors.  I am delighted we have offered substantial support over the years to landmine clearance.Ireland's efforts on cluster munitions did not end with the successful completion of the Dublin conference.  In the run up to the convention's signature in Oslo, much work has been carried out to encourage all governments to sign the convention and to promote awareness of the treaty.  Three regional conferences have been held in Sofia, Kampala and Laos, with two more to be held in Lebanon and Ecuador, to encourage states to attend the ceremony in Oslo.  Ireland, as one of the core group, has been highly active at the conferences, presenting papers and lobbying governments.  The reaction has been very positive and international momentum for signature in Oslo continues to grow.  It is one of the proud achievements of the Irish foreign service that we have been playing such an important role in this development.  I am delighted to support the introduction of the legislation, which is a significant landmark in Ireland's foreign policy.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	370	The Bill is one of the most important to come before the House for some time.  It deals with two of the most notorious weapons used in the 20th century, namely, cluster munitions and landmines.  Other weapons may have cost more lives in wars, but few have such a long-term impact.  Landmines and cluster munitions kill people, usually children, for decades after a war has ended.I welcome the Bill because of what it proposes, but that is not to say it does not have flaws.  I concur with my colleague, Deputy Timmins, in regretting the omission by the Government of a provision to prohibit the investment by State bodies in any producer of cluster munitions or anti-personnel mines.  I understand the Minister indicated an amendment will be made to this effect on Committee Stage.  I hope that will be the case.  It is important that this country would have no association of any form with any body, agency or country that is any way involved with producing elements of cluster munitions no matter how difficult that might be for some companies.  Fine Gael believes that is a major and serious omission and we will propose an amendment to rectify it.Cluster munitions are weapons deployed from the air by aircraft, including fighters, bombers and helicopters.  In mid-air the weapon opens, scattering hundreds of smaller sub-munitions, known as bomblets, many the size of a coke can, to the ground.  Other cluster munitions can be launched by being shot out of artillery, rockets, and missile systems on the ground.  Whatever the means by which they are launched, the effect is the same — a large area the size of a football pitch is covered by mines, where they sit — often unexploded — for days, weeks, months, often years, long after a war has ended, until someone comes in contact with them.  It may be the case that a little child finds a coloured object on the ground and picks it up to play with it, or it can come into contact with a farm implement, or it may be triggered by some object hitting off it.  Whatever the trigger, the results are the same — a massive explosion that can seriously maim or kill.  Often those who die are the lucky ones as those who are maimed can suffer horrifying injuries that scar them for life, leaving them without limbs and with horrific wounds.  Any single fragment of a bomblet can rupture the spleen or cause the intestines to explode.We have all seen on television various depictions of people who have been affected.  It is something one would be better off not to see.  It is not just the horror of the injuries that shock, but also the fact that those who are injured add to the injustice.  Handicap International has said:"The majority of victims are poor, uneducated males at work representing 76.8% of total confirmed casualties.  Many of those are boys under the age of 18.  In South Lebanon, nearly 90% of land used for farming and shepherding is contaminated with unexploded cluster submunitions."  [It further observed]  "98% of cluster sub-munitions casualties are civilians killed and injured while returning home in the aftermath of conflict or while going about their daily tasks to survive."In Kosovo, 53% of casualties occurred in the two months after the end of the conflict.  Most of the victims who were maimed or killed were boys aged between five and 15.  Researchers for Human Rights Watch stated that in "dozens of towns and villages [in the Lebanon], Israel used cluster munitions containing sub-munitions with high failure rates.  These left behind homes, gardens, fields, and public spaces — including a hospital — littered with hundreds of thousands and possibility a million unexploded submunitions" which could "endanger civilians for months or years to come".Not alone is it important to ban cluster munitions but major operations should be put in place in areas such as the Lebanon to sweep them clean of cluster munitions as soon as possible.  We are talking about weapons that kill the young and the innocent and do so long after the war is over, and leave those who survive with horrifying and sickening injuries in extreme pain, at worst, or without limbs, at best, for the rest of their lives.  That is all because a handful of countries refuse to stop using those barbaric weapons.  I hope the Dublin Convention, in which the Government played an important role, will mark the beginning of the end of the use of cluster munitions.However, it is not the end.  As other Members stated, the United States, Pakistan, Russia, India, China and Israel remain outside the remit of the convention and refuse to abide by it.  We must not stop campaigning until all states are forced to abandon their use.  I would go so far as to call their use a war crime and some would go so far as to say those who authorise their use should be regarded as war criminals.I urge the Government to continue to lobby hard to push the issue and to use all fora available to continue the campaign.  I hope the new US President will abandon the Bush Administration's refusal to sign up to the treaty banning these sick weapons.  Mr. Barack Obama seems to have taken a very strong stance on them and would probably be much more open to banning them than a President of a Republican-led Government.Anti-personnel mines are also covered by the Bill, which will give legislative force to the treaty signed in Oslo in 1997.  There are three types of anti-personnel mines.  The first type, the blast mine, is the most common.  These are buried no more than a few centimetres deep and are generally triggered by someone stepping on the pressure plate and applying approximately 11 to 35.3 lbs of pressure.  These mines are designed to destroy an object in close proximity, such as a person's foot or leg.  A blast mine is designed to break the targeted object into fragments, which can cause secondary damage, such as infection and the need for amputation.The second type, the bounding mine, is usually buried with only a small part of the igniter protruding from the ground.  These mines are activated by pressure or a trip-wire.  One may hear this type of mine referred to as a "Bouncing Betty".  When activated, the igniter sets off a propelling charge, lifting the mine approximately 1 m into the air.  The mine then ignites a main charge, causing injury to a person's head and chest, which is quite horrific.The third type, the fragmentation mine, releases fragments in all directions, or can be arranged to send fragments in one direction.  In the latter case, it is called a directional fragmentation mine.  It can cause injury up to 200 m away and kill at closer distances.  The fragments used in the mines are either metal or glass.  Fragmentation mines can be bounding or ground based.Ireland formally signed the mine ban treaty on 3 December 1997 and is scheduled to sign up to the cluster munitions treaty in December in Oslo.  The Cluster Munitions and Anti-Personnel Mines Bill is intended to give the treaties legislative effect.As we know, Fine Gael proposed its own Cluster Munitions Bill earlier this year.  It was voted down on Second Stage, despite urgings from NGOs that it be accepted and amended on Committee Stage to make any changes that would arise on foot of the Dublin Convention.While I am glad this Bill is before the House, there was no reason whatsoever the Fine Gael Bill could not have been accepted.  It would have served as a strong statement of the unanimity of the House on this issue to those visiting Dublin for the convention.  Ultimately politics prevailed and the Government, or Minister specifically, did not want to recognise the work Deputy Timmins did in putting together a very comprehensive Bill on cluster munitions.While I welcome this important Bill, Fine Gael will be proposing amendments to strengthen it in some respects.  However, I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and the other Government Members on their work and for being leaders in this field.  I congratulate them on doing such a good job at the convention held in Croke Park some months ago.  It certainly created a very good and positive impression of this country.In his speech, the Minister referred to the fact that provision was made in the Bill to enable the Defence Forces to participate in UN-mandated peacekeeping forces with the state or states that may not be party to the convention on cluster munitions in accordance with Article 21 thereof.  This is the so-called "interoperability" provision of the convention, which was the most difficult issue to resolve in the negotiations at Croke Park.  It is important that those involved in Irish missions emphasise at all times that they will not be party to the use of cluster munitions of any form in any operations in which they are involved in conjunction with countries that have not yet signed up to the agreement.  All the EUFOR countries are signed up to the convention so this does not apply to them.  The section of the Bill in this regard should be strengthened.I welcome the Bill, which is very important.  We are playing our role in the House and doing our job.  I compliment Deputy Timmins who, as Opposition spokesperson, showed what can be achieved in the legislation he introduced.  I am glad the Government has more or less accepted the essence of what he said.  Together we can produce very good legislation that will be very effective internationally.

Committee and Report Stages should be completed as quickly as possible so Ireland can, once again, send out a message to other countries that it is willing to take a stand and be to the forefront in addressing these issues.Ba mhaith liom buíochas a thabhairt as an deis labhairt anocht ar an gceist ríthábhachtach seo ceist An Bille um Chnuas-Mhuinisin 2008. Measaim go bhfuil sé tábhachtach go dtugaimid tacaíocht don Bhille seo. Ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a ghabháil leis an tAire Martin agus an tAire Ahern as an obair a dhéan siad go dtí seo ar an mBille seo agus daoine eile atá tar éis cuidiú leis an mBille seo  a chur chun cinn  agus a dhéanamh cinnte de go bhfuil convention againn agus go bhfuilimid ag síniú  an convention sin agus go bhfuilimid ag moladh do thíortha eile in san domhain go síníodh siad san an convention ach ní hamháin sin ach go ndéanann beart de réir an gníomh atá leagtha síos ansin sa deireadh thiar go mbeidh muid mar shochaí agus mar dhomhain tar éis fáil réidh leis na cnús ionseain seo atá luaite in san Bille. An rud atá I gceist in san Bille ná go bhfuilimid ag cur leis an convention a bhí ann roimhe seo land mines agus ag an am sin bhí Éire chun tosaigh arís. Bhí sé ríthábhachtach go raibh an chomhdháil i bpáirc an crócaigh níos luaithe i mbliana agus measaim gur léir ón méid atá ós ár gcomhair inniu gur obair mhaith a déanadh ag an gcomhdháil sin. Ní raibh mé in ann a bheith ann agus féachaint ar an obair a bhí ar siúl acu. Tá an Teachta Deenihan  tar éis leagan amach dúinn cheana féin go díreach cad tá i gceist san sórt buama seo. Buamaí gránna amach is amach iad más féidir le haon bhuama gan bheith gránna sa deireadh thiar an rud atá i gceist anseo ná na céadta buamaí beaga a chaitheamh thar ceantar beag gan iad a bheith dírithe ar aon duine nó aon arm ach go háirithe agus an rud atá i gceist ná déanamh cinnte go maraítear an méid is mó saighdiúirí nó daoine ionraic nó fiú go ndéanfaí iad a ghortú. Is cuimhin liomsa léamh tamaill de bhlianta ó shin faoi dhuine a bhí ag déanamh straitéis maidir le cogaíocht i Vietnam agus bhí siad san ag caint faoi, go raibh sé beagnach níos fearr dóibh dá ngortófaí saighdiúir Meiriceánach ná go maireofaí é toisc gur cheangal sé sin suas triúr nó ceathrar saighdiúr eile má tá duine gortaithe go dona.  Measaim gurb é sin roinnt den fáth go bhfuil na stáit timpeall an domhain fós ag úsáid na sórt seo buamaí.Tá an Teachta Deenihan tar éis leagan amach dúinn cheana féin go díreach cad tá i gceist in san sórt buama seo. Buamaí gránna amach is amach iad, más féidir le haon bhuama gan bheith gránna.  Sa deireadh thiar an rud atá i gceist anseo ná, na céadta buamaí beaga a chaitheamh thar ceantar beag gan iad a bheith dírithe ar aon duine nó aon arm, ach go háirithe, agus an rud atá i gceist ná déanamh cinnte go maraítear an méid is mó saighdiúirí nó daoine ionraic nó fiú go ndéanfaí iad a ghortú.Tuigeann siad gur féidir daoine a mharú ach go minic go bhfuil sé níos measa do namhaid, má tá a lán saighdiúirí nó daoine ionraic gortaithe agus go mbíonn ar an stát casadh le déanamh cinnte go bhfuil cóir leigheas le fáil acu sin agus go bhfuil na saighdiúirí nó an sórt tacaíocht sa chúlra gafa ag tabhairt aire do dhaoine atá gortaithe tar éis cos nó lámh nó géag éigin a chailliúint nó atá tar éis a bheith dallaithe ag a leithéid de bhuamaí. An rud is measa faoi seo ná, ní nuair atá an cogadh thart, má tá cogadh ann in aon chor, is ina dhiaidh sin a bhíonn an cuid is mó de na daoine gortaithe ag an sórt seo buama páistí ach go háirithe. Nuair a chaitear na buamaí seo ón aer de ghnáth scaipeann siad i ngach áit ní dhéantar aon iarracht déanamh cinnte go bhfuil gach uile ceann tar éis pléascadh, ní dhéantar aon iarracht déanamh cinnte nach bhfuil siad i gceantair cosúil le scoileanna nó páirceanna peile nó ar thaobh na sléibhte áit áta daoine ag tabhairt aire do chaoirigh nó a leithéid nó istigh i Jungles nó i gceantair atá siad ag tabhairt aire do bheithígh nó ag cur na barraí. An rud a tharlaíonn ná go minic bíonn daoine ag tabhairt aire do chaoirigh nó ag imirt peile nó a leithéid agus sin an uair a ghortaítear na páistí agus sin an áit a chóir go mbádh muid ag díriú air.Tá freagracht áirithe acu siúd atá ag úsáid seo glanadh suas ina dhiaidh agus fiú siúd atá tar éis an coinbhinsiún a shíniú ba chóir go mbeadh dualgas orthu dul ar ais chuig na ceantair fiú más fiche nó tríocha bliain ó shin dul ar ais ansin agus déanamh cinnte de go bhfuil gach uile ceann de na bomblets seo glanta ón ceantar. Nach mbeidh muid ag féachaint ar pháistí beaga le cos amháin nó lámh amháin toisc gur chuaigh siad amach chun imirt deich, fiche bliain ina dhiaidh cogadh a bheith thart nó fiú dhá nó trí mhí. Ceann de na príomh dualgais nuair atá síocháin idir thortha ná go mbeadh orthu déileáil leis na muinisin atá thart agus gur gá dóibh dul isteach ins na páirceanna ach go háirithe ionas go mbeadh feirmeoirí in ann barraí a chur go mbeadh an talamh sin glanta de haon saghas stuif atá curtha san talamh nó atá tar éis titim isteach sa talamh.Measaim go bhfuil an ceart ag an Teachta Deenihan nuair a bhí sé ag caint faoi alt 21 áit a luann sé comhoibriú míleata ag tíortha dream amháin atá tar éis an coinbhinsiún a shíniú ag dream eile nach bhfuil gur cóir féachaint arís ar sin agus measaim fhéin agus i mo thuairim fhéin ba chóir go mbeidh muid ag déanamh cinnte de nach bhfuil saighdiúirí Éireannacha ag obair nó ar obráidithe thar lear áiteanna atá na tíortha sin fós gafa le cluster munitions. Ní cóir go mbeadh baint ar bith againn le haon arm atá fós stocanna acu de leithéid de arm lóin nó atá tar éis é a úsáid le tamall agus nach bhfuil tar éis an choinbhinsiún seo a shíniú. Caithfimid a déanamh cinnte de chomh maith ní hamháin go síníonn muid é seo ach go ndéanfaimid níos mó agus is féidir le tír beag cosúil linne méid áirithe a dhéanamh. Dhéan muid an coinbhinsiún a shíniú tá muid tar éis an Bille seo a chur ós ár gcomhair tá méid áirithe eile gur féidir linn a dhéanamh agus in san méid sin measaim gur féidir linne an ceist a ardú gach uair atá muid ag déanamh ceangal trádála le tíortha eile go ndéanfaimid é mar ceann de na coinníollacha nuair atá muid ag déanamh na ceangail trádála sin go mbeadh mar choinníoll go bhfaigheann siad réidh leis an armlóin seo agus go gcuireann siad ar lea-taobh aon tógáil dá leithéid atá ar bun nó aon déantúsaíocht dá leithéid atá ar bun in san tír sin faoi láthair. Measaim go gcaithfimid brú a chur ar leithéidí na Stáit Aontaithe Meiriceá leithéidí Shasana, an Fhrainc agus sin gur gá dóibhsan, i bhfad Éireann níos mó a dhéanamh ná díreach an coinbhinsiún a shíniú agus déileáil leis an stoc atá acu fhéin. Toisc gur dhéan siad an stoc a thógaint sa chéad dul síos dhéan siad rás armlóin idir iad fhéin agus a naimhde a chothú thar na blianta agus is de thairbhe sin go bhfuil na stoic seo fós ann.Is fiú féachaint go díreach ar cad tá i gceist againn, tá muid ag caint faoi tamall de bhlianta go raibh 260 milliún anti-personal mines ag 131 Stát. Tá fhios agam ó shin go bhfuil ísliú mór agus ísliú suntasach tagtha ar an líon den sórt buama seo den sórt mianaigh seo ach fós tá na céadta milliún de mianaigh talamh ag tíortha timpeall an domhain agus caithfidh na Stáit Aontaithe iad siúd ach go háirithe níos mó a dhéanamh chun fáil réidh leo agus impí ar na Stáit eile fáil réidh leo. Níl sé maith go leor díreach an coinbhinsiún a shíniú agus measaim sin a bhí i gceist in san comhdháil agus sin atá i gceist in san reachtaíocht seo.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	372	I thank all Deputies who contributed to the Second Stage debate, particularly Deputies Michael D. Higgins and Billy Timmins.  I share with all Members of the House a common abhorrence of cluster munitions and anti-personnel mines.  These are extraordinary weapons and it is sickening that human ingenuity is used and abused to produce weaponry which causes such mayhem and damage and is wilfully designed to destroy human life.  Deputy Ó Snodaigh referred to the residue of these weapons in Vietnam.  It is appalling that in Flanders fields, where ploughing took place last week, dangerous weaponry from the First World War remains.  I also thank those Deputies who recognised the Government's work in achieving consensus on the Convention on Cluster Munitions in Dublin last May.  Irish people can be proud of the work invested in this issue by officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs and members of the Defence Forces.Achieving a comprehensive prohibition on the use, development, production, acquisition, stockpiling, retention and transfer of cluster munitions was an important objective for the Government and all parties in this House.  It has been achieved early in the lifetime of the Government and the Oslo process and Convention on Cluster Munitions exceeded early levels of ambition for what could be done.  This success is due to the almost global recognition of the horror of cluster munitions.  I echo the sentiments of a number of Deputies when I note with sadness that nations which regard themselves as civilised or advocates of democracy should be involved in the production, distribution and use of these weapons.As Deputies will be aware, the Convention on Cluster Munitions was adopted by consensus at the conclusion of the Dublin diplomatic conference last May at Croke Park.  It will be opened for signature at a ceremony in Oslo on 3 December and will enter into force six months after 30 states have ratified it.  The Bill will allow Ireland to sign the convention and ratify it an early date.The successful conclusion of negotiations under Irish chairmanship is one of the most significant contributions to the development of international humanitarian law in recent years and a major achievement in Irish foreign policy.  As the Minister for Foreign Affairs emphasised, the Government and all Members of the Oireachtas share a common ambition to carry forward the excellent work which has already been done by being in a position to both sign and ratify the Convention on Cluster Munitions at the ceremony in Oslo in December.  The enactment of the Bill facilitates this ambition and will clearly demonstrate Ireland's commitment to promoting the earliest possible entry into force of the convention.The heart of the convention is an immediate and unconditional ban on all cluster munitions which cause unacceptable harm to civilians.  Each state party undertakes that it will never, in any circumstances, use, develop, produce, acquire, stockpile, retain or transfer cluster munitions or assist another party in so doing.  By adopting a wide and encompassing definition, the convention effectively prohibits all cluster munitions that have ever been used in armed conflict.  It does not provide for any exceptions in that it bans all weapons which have the effect and characteristics of cluster munitions and cause unacceptable harm to civilians.  It is a pity we cannot go a step further and introduce a prohibition on all weaponry which causes harm to human life because it is widely sought.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	374	In addition to the comprehensive ban contained in the convention, the provisions on clearance and victim assistance are a source of particular satisfaction to us all.  These provisions have been acknowledged as having set a new benchmark in international humanitarian law.  The Government will work to implement the commitments we have undertaken in the convention in our funding and co-operation activities.  Perhaps most important, however, particularly given the graphic evidence of irresponsible use of this weaponry, is the onus the convention places on those who have caused damage to assist in the clearance of cluster munitions and their remnants.  They are strongly encouraged to provide as much assistance as possible, including financial and material aid, to the affected country.  This provision ensures that countries which engage in the use of these monstrous weapons will no longer be able to walk away from the damage and devastation they have caused.  Those who fail to meet this requirement will stand guilty at the bar of human judgment.Ireland's efforts on cluster munitions have not ended with the successful completion of the Dublin conference at Croke Park.  In the run-up to signature in Oslo, much work has been done to encourage as many governments as possible to sign the convention and promote awareness of the treaty.  Three regional conferences have been held in Sofia, Kampala and Laos, with more to come, aimed at encouraging states to attend the ceremony in Oslo.  Ireland, as one of the core group, has been highly active at these conferences, presenting papers and lobbying governments to sign up to the convention.  We also organised a large event in the margins of the UN General Assembly last month to promote the convention.  The reaction has been positive and international momentum for signature in Oslo continues to grow.The Oslo process was successful because of the hard work of Ireland and the other core group members, UN organisations, the International Committee of the Red Cross and numerous NGOs.  In particular, the wonderful work of the Cluster Munition Coalition and more than 20 Irish NGOs was central to creating awareness of the issues involved with cluster munitions.  I am pleased with the ongoing engagement of Irish NGOs in the process and the invaluable support they have offered to the Department.  Implementation of the convention after the signing ceremony will require our continued dedication and co-operation with this diverse group of dedicated actors.  A priority for the Government will be to build on and further develop our partnerships to provide the Convention on Cluster Munitions with the support essential for its long-term implementation and success.  Ireland and other key actors intend to begin work immediately after the signing ceremony to ensure momentum for the convention is maintained.Some of the key issues we have started to consider are the lessons we have learned from the implementation of the 1997 Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Treaty and how these could be applied to the Convention on Cluster Munitions and the role civil society can play in monitoring and implementing the convention.  We will also work to ensure continued ownership and support among the key actors and to promote ratification and universalisation of the convention.Ireland will also work to support any actions needed in the run-up to the first meeting of states parties, which must be convened within one year of the entry into force of the convention.  Subsequent meetings will be convened by the Secretary General of the United Nations annually until the first review conference due to be held five years after entry into force of the convention.  It is our hope that the first meeting of states parties will take place as early as this time next year and we will work hard toward this objective.I reiterate the absolute priority for Ireland to be in a position to both sign and ratify the convention in Oslo on 3 December.  The Government is grateful to all Members and parties in that regard.  The early enactment of this Bill facilitates Ireland's continued leadership in an area which is important to us all.Deputy Timmins raised a question about investing in or financing companies in this area.  The Government will table an amendment on this on Committee Stage.  Deputy Michael D. Higgins asked a series of questions.  I listened to the concerns he expressed about interoperability.  The purpose of the relevant sections of the Bill is to ensure that members of an Irish contingent could not be prosecuted for inducing or encouraging the use of cluster munitions contrary to section 6(2) of the Bill where he or she is not knowingly involved in such activity.  The Deputy will appreciate that provision.  Deputy Higgins asked a very important question about aircraft and ships, something I believe he and I should have a discussion on.  I have some ideas, but in the usual way, where the Garda have a reasonable suspicion that a criminal offence is being committed, it has the power to search.  I shall cause the other questions to be answered in writing.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	375	I move:That the Bill be referred to the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs, in accordance with Standing Order 122(1) and paragraph 1(a)(i) of the Orders of Reference of that committee.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	376	I wish to share my time with Deputies Deirdre Clune, Simon Coveney, Tom Hayes and Jimmy Deenihan, with the agreement of the House.I move:"—That Dáil Éireann:notes that the number of people seeking training programmes will rise rapidly as a consequence of:the numbers on the live register increasing by nearly 50% over the past twelve months; andthe projected 8% unemployment rate for 2009;notes that the standardised unemployment rate is at a nine year high with unemployment in Ireland now higher than in the United States, Britain, Japan, the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, the Czech Republic, Switzerland, Poland, Singapore and South Korea, among others; andcalls on Government to:restructure publicly funded training programmes to make training provision more responsive to a rapidly changing labour   market and economy;conduct a comprehensive expenditure audit of FÁS to ensure that the taxpayer's substantial investment is getting best value for money;consider the needs of small and medium sized businesses when developing and promoting training services; andchange the eligibility criteria for the back to education allowance to open up access to further education for the unemployed."The 30th Dáil is only 16 months old at this stage, yet I note this is the third debate we have had on employment already.  In many ways it is a reflection of the gravity of the situation in which we find ourselves and the growing realisation that rising unemployment is the human cost of economic mismanagement.In the first debate we had on unemployment, about 12 months ago, Deputy Micheál Martin, the then Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, told the House the best benchmark of how a country is doing is its capacity to generate new sustainable jobs and advance the standard of living of its citizens.  Ultimately that is what good macro-economic and sound enterprise policies deliver.  I agree entirely with Deputy Martin in that regard.  Let us therefore apply the Martin tests to the current Government.  The first test is to ask whether macro-economic policy has been sound.  The answer is certainly that it has not been sound.  Public spending has increased by 80% in the past five years, financed by windfall taxes on an unsustainable debt-fuelled property boom.  Now it is being financed through borrowings of at least €11 billion this year and perhaps €15 billion or more next year, a deficit that is rapidly getting out of control.  The likelihood is that the national debt will probably double by the middle of 2010.  By the end of 2011 national debt as a proportion of GDP is likely to be higher than it was when this Administration came to office in 1997.  Also, there has been a series of enterprise policies.  We talked a good deal about the "dirty dozen" and the "terrible 32".  I have my own favourite, the "terrible ten", namely the ten policies the Government introduced which are both anti-enterprise and anti-employment.The first of these is the national wage agreement which, in itself, is driving up the cost of employment — and risks driving people out of their jobs.  The decision to cut apprenticeships was a major mistake.  This is one of the few areas in which FÁS does a good job and yet, for some reason, the Minister has decided to cut apprenticeships.  There was the failure to make any effort to reform FÁS and the initial denial over several months that anything was wrong with that organisation.  Then there were the cutbacks in infrastructural spending, particularly as regards road building, rail building and broadband.  I cannot understand the decision in the budget in particular to cut back spending on broadband by 25%, since technology is the growth area of the future.Then there is the rising cost of doing business, where the Government has literally stood by and allowed utility prices, local government rates and levies to increase.  There is the growing administrative burden on companies, which again, has been increased by the budget.  The car parking tax will have to be administered inter alia at greater cost to Government.  The decision to increase VAT, again, will damage jobs.I cannot understand the cutback in jobseekers benefit at a time when people are losing their jobs.  People who have been working for a year or certainly, nine months, are now being punished for the fact that they have lost their jobs through the cutbacks in jobseekers benefit.  A decision to increase capital gains tax will cost jobs as will the failure, in particular, to recapitalise the banks.  I have come from a meeting with some sub-contractors from County Meath, whom I met with Deputy Shane McEntee, and the extent of the pressure that small companies are under is really shocking.  So many companies are in contact with us all the time who had their overdraft facilities halved by the banks and are now facing the prospect of having to lay off people and go out of business because of the Government's failure to follow up on the guarantee Fine Gael supported, with a strategy to recapitalise the banks.The result of all these failed macro-economic and anti-enterprise policies is rising unemployment.  Rising unemployment is the human consequence of economic mismanagement by this  Government.  The live register figures will be released tomorrow.  I do not know what they contain, perhaps the Minister does.  However, I anticipate that the live register will be more than 250,000 for the first time in 11 years.  I expect that, within a month or two, if not tomorrow, the numbers signing on will be higher than they were when Fine Gael left office in 1997.  I appreciate that is not the case yet, in terms of percentages, but we are getting there fast.In terms of percentages, we are talking about a standardised unemployment rate of 6.6% at the moment.  The ESRI and FÁS say it will be more than 8% this year.  Bear in mind that the EU average unemployment rate is 7% and it means we are accepting that Ireland is again going to be a high unemployment country.Let us look at where we are in relation to other countries: Netherlands, Denmark, Finland, Poland, Sweden, Britain, Norway, Japan, the United States, Austria, the Czech Republic, Malta, Israel, Singapore, to name a few, are countries with lower unemployment than Ireland's.  It is probable we shall overtake Italy, Germany and Portugal in the coming months.  The Government will, no doubt, argue that this is all down to international factors — and international factors have a part to play in this.  However, all countries are feeling the cold wind of occurrences in the international markets, yet they are not all suffering as Ireland is.  Unemployment in Germany, for instance, is at a 16-year low, and as I mentioned, Ireland will overtake it within the next few months.  The reality is that all the countries I referred to are part of the world we live in, and not on a different planet.  It occurs to me more and more that those on a different planet are the Members opposite and the Ministers who do not acknowledge the extent to which the situation in Ireland is so much worse than among our partners and competitors.  This has allowed them to get off the hook and not take action.At present Ireland is losing 720 jobs a week.  That effectively works out — including Saturday, Sunday and night-time employment — that we are losing a job every ten minutes.  That is an extraordinary situation to be in compared to what it was like when this Administration came to power, when a job was being created every seven minutes.  The Small Firms Association said today that these figures should be a wake-up call for the Government, which is clearly asleep.  There has been comment about the absence of the Tánaiste in the United States.  I do not oppose the fact that she has gone to the United States and believe it is appropriate that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment should travel overseas.  However, there are 52 weeks in the year and the Dáil sits for just over 30 of them.  There are 20 weeks during which trade missions could be done.  The former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, made a point of doing these in January and I believe that is when they should be done.  Perhaps, better than going to the United States in election week — when the focus is very much on what is happening in America — the Minister might have done better, not necessarily to come in here and listen to me, but just to do her job and try to restore Ireland's competitiveness.When Fine Gael left office, Ireland was the fourth most competitive country in the world.  It was the place people wanted to come to, to invest and do business.  Under this Government we have fallen into 22nd place and that has not improved at all during the period in which Deputy Martin was Minister, or during the time Deputy Mary Coughlan has been Minister.  We are getting to a stage where almost half the multinational companies that had invested in Ireland are saying they would not do so again, if they were in a position to make such a decision.  Rather than going to the United States during a Dáil session, perhaps the Minister should take action and start to make Ireland competitive again because it is only through trade that we will get out of this recession.  We cannot borrow, tax or cut our way out of it, so we must trade our way out, and that means addressing the issue of competitiveness.It seems to me the Government has thrown in the towel on employment, in the same way that it has on the economy and public services.  Everything is somebody else's fault and the Government is powerless to act, on all occasions.  However, there is a better way.  There is still hope for Ireland.  I am not despondent about the future in the way that many are.  We can still have a balanced budget, full employment and high quality public services.  That can only be done, however, if the right policies are put in place — and they must be put in place now.The first action to be taken is to address the budgetary crisis.  We need to end the pretence that the budget currently going through the House addresses the economic crisis in any serious way.  Essentially, it is a hit and hope budget — tax a bit, cut a bit and borrow a bit more and hope something turns up.  That will not work.  We need to bring the deficit under control.  This means abandoning Deputy Brian Lenihan's budget and adopting the alternative proposals set out by the Fine Gael party, which will bring us to a situation whereby borrowing will start to fall back.The next most important action to be taken is to invest in education and training and some speakers will discuss that later.  One of the key areas where we must invest in training is in construction.  We are about to move from a situation where 20% of our economy was construction based to one where only 8% is.  This means that more than half of the people who were involved in construction jobs will never be involved in construction jobs again.  They need to be retrained for new jobs.  We need to identify where those new jobs will be, in IT, the food industry, biotechnology and green collar jobs, alternative energy in particular.  A strategy to deal with this should have been in place a long time ago, but if it is not, let us get it in place now.We need to overhaul FÁS, an organisation that spends €1 billion a year but which does not produce the return we should expect.  We must also consider a public works programme, as was done in the past.  We have significant numbers of skilled people who are unemployed for the first time who could be used in a public works programme, perhaps run by the OPW, to build schools and develop our infrastructure at a cost at which these projects could not be delivered earlier.  We need to consider expanding programmes, such as community employment, CE, in areas of disadvantage.  I am not a fan of the community employment schemes as an active labour market measure, but I accept they have an important social role.  In areas of disadvantage where high unemployment leads to higher crime levels and further deprivation, we must consider expanding CE for several years, until the worst of the recession is over.We must also address the issue of people under 25 being on the dole.  Nobody under 25 should be on the dole.  Perhaps it is all right for people under 25 to be on it for two or three months when between jobs, but not after that.  We must create a situation where people under 25 who are not in work are given a guarantee that they will have a position in training or education, but they must also be told that it is not acceptable for them to continue to be on the dole and refuse jobs or the opportunity of training or education.  We should have a contract with the approximate 40,000 unemployed under 25 year olds that will ensure they have employment, a work scheme, training or education.The most important action we can take is to begin the process of restoring competitiveness and to expand the supports for business.  There has been no success in this regard during the past six years under the Government.  We can do this in several ways.  We can freeze Government charges, starting with rates and development levies.  We could begin with this from tomorrow.  If this year's increases were to be the last ones or if the Government was to guarantee they would not be increased for the next two years, this would give businesses confidence that they would not face an extra 10%  or 15% increases over the next few years.  We could also do something about utility costs, electricity, water, gas and telecommunications.  Another speaker will deal with this in more detail.We could also invest in infrastructure.  We could reverse the cuts in investment in broadband, roads and rail by freeing up the pension reserve fund on a PPP basis, as proposed in the Fine Gael alternative budget.  We could also cut back on red tape, as other countries have done.  We have a commitment from Government that it will cut back on red tape by 25% by 2012, but have not been provided with any figures with regard to how much it will be cut back by the end of this year or next.  It seems we are supposed to wait until 2012 for something to happen in this regard.We could also reverse the VAT hikes, which were a big mistake and the cost of which will fall on retailers and result in higher unemployment.  We could do as ISME suggested and suspend the pay deal.  We accept that people earning under €50,000 will need a cost of living increase, but in a time of recession we cannot justify borrowing €1 billion to increase public sector pay.  The effect of this would be to increase labour costs for businesses by 6% or 7%, which would only result in further employment.  There is nothing to be achieved by a pay deal that causes people to lose jobs.We also need to recapitalise the banks.  The guarantee has brought us this far, but only this far.  Ordinary people and businesses large and small have seen their overdrafts cut and they cannot get credit.  Credit, as the Minister for Finance said, is the lifeblood of the economy.  Deputy Richard Bruton said credit is the oil on the cogs of the wheels of finance.  We cannot waste any further time with regard to making the decision to capitalise the banks.  While it will be an unpopular and difficult decision, the Government can be assured it will have the support of the Fine Gael Party if it is done appropriately, we get a guarantee of an equity stake in the banks, and they guarantee they will restore credit to business.We should also consolidate labour law.  Currently, we have 17 different labour law Acts.  This is too many and results in confusion, creating difficulties for small businesses in particular.  An area to which the Government must give attention is the issue of the joint labour committees, JLCs.  This is a complex issue, but I know the Minister of State understands it well.  We cannot sit back for much longer in a situation where businesses are closing on Sundays because of the requirement for double pay.  We are all for labour rights, but labour rights that cause people to lose jobs must be reviewed.  I hope the Government does not wait for the courts to solve the problem and that the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, will be proactive in dealing with the situation.Ireland is sliding into an economic abyss, the economy is shrinking, public finances are starting to make Ireland look more like a developing country than a developed one and unemployment is set to soar.  This cannot be denied, but all is not lost.  There is still hope for Ireland.  With real leadership and the right policies, the best is yet to come for the country.  The Fine Gael Party will not be content merely to prosecute the Government for its failures, but will also point the way forward to recovery and reform.  That is what this motion does and I commend it to the House.
#DeirdreClune	unknown-#DeirdreClune-party	unknown-#DeirdreClune-dob	unknown-#DeirdreClune-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	377	I support the motion.  Tomorrow we expect the latest figures on unemployment and expect they will be negative and that unemployment will have soared.  Deputy Varadkar mentioned unemployment among young people and I will make further comment on that area.  The number of unemployed under 25 year olds is a matter to which the Government should give serious attention.  The figures for September 2007 to September 2008 show that nationally the number of people under 25 unemployed has increased by 60%.  In Laois and Meath the increase is 95%.  This is a startling figure, which probably reflects lay offs in the construction industry where so many young people were employed.Many of these young people left school to take up a trade that today is no longer viable.  Some of them have been on training or apprenticeship courses, but are unable to finish them.  We need to focus on this area.  Many of these young people probably have no ties, such as a family or house, and will now think of going abroad and seeking employment outside of the country, but we do not want to lose them.  We certainly do not want a repeat of the brain drain we had in the 1980s.  We want to ensure people like this are identified and offered training that will provide them with alternative employment prospects.  They must be recognised and given support.  Many of these people could be facilitated by ensuring they can complete their apprenticeship programme.FÁS appeared recently before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment and we had a long discussion on this issue.  There are opportunities in the UK and it was suggested to FÁS that it could work with young people who have not completed their apprenticeships and secure positions for them to do so there.  High levels of youth unemployment are a serious concern, but it is young people who can most benefit from retraining.FÁS must become more proactive and must anticipate what is coming down the tracks.  It must be flexible in its approach and must encourage people to avail of training opportunities.  It must recognise what the market needs and demands.  It has set up an environmental construction course, but this is already oversubscribed and cannot match demand.  This reflects an organisation that is not flexible enough to cope with or adapt to market demand.  We know from Sustainable Energy Ireland how many houses will have to be brought up to the standard of the building energy regulations.  The potential for significant spending in that area could create employment opportunities but our national training agency is not equipping people with the requisite skills.  Beginning in January 2009, all second-hand homes will be required to have a building energy rating before they are sold or rented.  Unfortunately, the people who are qualified to conduct the necessary inspections are few in number.  This is but one example of how we can and should react by training young people in the skills needed for a changing market.Fine Gael's motion calls on the Government to review the back-to-education allowance with a view to facilitating people who are not in receipt of jobseekers allowance for 12 months.  This requirement is an obstacle and we should provide for flexibility, particularly in respect of low income workers.  There is little difference between what one would receive in social welfare payments and the minimum wage.   It would make sense for many people to return to education, provided they have the inclination to upgrade their skills.It is important that the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Social and Family Affairs communicate with each other.  In September, my help was sought by a woman who had secured a place on a VTOS course but was not entitled to the back-to-education allowance because she had formerly worked at home looking after four children.  As the youngest child had started school, she wanted to avail of the opportunity to upgrade her skills and improve her employment prospects.  However, she is required to receive social welfare payments for 12 months before she can take up a course.  That is ludicrous.  The back-to-education allowance should be available to people who want to improve their prospects.  It can be adapted to facilitate these people at no real cost to the State because they are already being paid other social welfare benefits.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	378	As previous speakers have noted, tomorrow will see the publication of new live register figures.  I doubt anybody expects good news, given that the number on the register has increased by almost 50% in the past 12 months.  The ESRI now predicts unemployment to reach 8% in 2009.  That is a conservative estimate compared to the many others who predict that the figure will be closer to 10%.  Ireland is entering into a painful and difficult period in which tens of thousands of people will have to cope with losing their jobs.A combination of reckless Government spending, gross economic mismanagement of public funds and denial for too long of the severity of the situation, combined with an international bank liquidity crisis, plummeting consumer confidence and the collapse of the construction industry, have created in Ireland what many describe as a perfect storm.  At times like this, people expect the Government to provide leadership and a steady hand on the tiller as it plots a course through an uncomfortable period.  It is, therefore, reason for worry that we are getting neither leadership nor a coherent plan to lead Ireland through its recession.  The budget was supposed to be a strong statement of new thinking and hope for people who recognise the depressing nature of the next 12 to 18 months.  However, instead of a decisive budget setting out a clear path, we were given little more than a discussion document that changes by the week and lacks any clear plan.Governments in times of recession should have two priorities.  First, they should protect existing jobs while creating new opportunities for those who are made unemployed.  Second, they should protect the vulnerable because in difficult times the State is the safety net and the last resort for many.  We have spent the past several weeks pointing out the Government's failure to protect the vulnerable in the budget, and this evening we are focusing on job protection and creation.  Where is the Government's plan for economic recovery?  What is it doing to protect jobs?  It appears at present that it is up to the Opposition to devise strategies and plans for job creation and protection.In regard to small and medium sized enterprises' access to funds and credit, the Government's amendment to the motion congratulates the Government on stabilising the financial services sector so that Irish enterprises have improved access to funds.  The reality is that many businesses, particularly small ones, simply do not have any such access.  If we leave them to struggle to exist in the current environment, many will not last beyond the next four months because they cannot get overdrafts, never mind modest loans.  The Government needs to put in place a strategy for recapitalising our banks to free up more money.  It took the right decision on the bank guarantee scheme, and the Opposition supported it, but we cannot sit back on our laurels when the job is not yet finished.  Companies are going out of business because they can no longer access basic funds.  We have the choice of looking at mergers and acquisitions in the hope of freeing up capital, taking equity stakes in banks or seeking private investment from abroad, which is what Gordon Brown attempted in his visit to the oil rich states.  However, we do not seem to be taking any of these options.  That is the reason for the level of frustration with the Government's performance in this area.In terms of the impact of the budget on funding for local authorities, I urge the Minister of State to emphasise to local authority managers the importance of not increasing rates and development charges.  The private sector simply cannot shoulder that burden.Let us hear some strategies for the green economy.  We are given generalised statements on the opportunities provided by the green economy but the details are missing.
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	379	I commend my colleague, Deputy Varadkar, on moving this motion.  Unemployment is affecting many people, both young and old, in every community.  The harsh reality of unemployment is a cause of concern to everybody, including the Government.  Last week alone, 700 temporary jobs were lost in Limerick city, with profound effects on parts of my constituency.  Tipperary town has one of the highest unemployment rates and is one of the most disadvantaged towns in the country, according to statistics.  There is real worry in the area with regard to Dell.  I do not want to be a prophet of gloom but the Government has a clear responsibility in respect of Dell.  If anything happened, there would be a major effect on the economy of Limerick, Clare, south Tipperary and north Tipperary.There are major problems.  The uncompetitiveness in the economy and the inability of the Government to keep costs low show what is lacking.  I refer to the inability to provide better essential infrastructure, transport and communications.  Broadband in smaller villages is so slow that it is unbelievable.  Last week the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Ryan, announced the deferral of broadband to certain areas.  That is unfair to many people in difficult economic times.In South Tipperary the number of unemployed people under the age of 25 has risen by67%. Shame on the Government that unemployment has been allowed to creep up higher and higher, to worrying proportions, while the Government has been busy calling Fine Gael prophets of doom.We must improve access to training for every person who loses a job or is on the live register.  There are various questions about FÁS, which has a great role to play in helping the unemployed.  Across the country, many people have been trained by FÁS and we should not forget the impact this has had on our community.
#OlwynEnrightFG	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-party	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-dob	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	380	I support the motion.  This is an important opportunity for the Government to consider what it must do to get the economy back on track and tackle rapidly rising unemployment.  I wish to focus on one part of the Fine Gael motion, the back-to-education allowance.We have seen consistent losses of employment.  On 8 October I outlined the effects on my constituency.  Each Deputy is conscious of problems in their constituency.  The figure provided by Deputy Varadkar of 720 jobs lost per week brings the issue home.  Often, more attention is given to big announcements of a group of job losses but everyday losses are causing serious concern.The criteria for the back-to-education allowance must be changed, but not in the negative way they were changed in the budget where 500 places on the scheme were lost.  They must be changed in a positive way to allow people to participate.  The current scheme, which the Government stands over and which the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, and her predecessor, Deputy Cullen, stood over, forces people on to the live register.  If one wants to avail of the back-to-education allowance, one must be unemployed for 12 months in most instances.  The point about major job losses is that most often in these situations people receive a redundancy package.  If there is a small job loss, such as one or two jobs in a shop or restaurant or a local business, the people affected often do not receive redundancy packages.  Such people must wait for the full 12 months before obtaining the back-to-education allowance.  If one is made unemployed in August or September, effectively one might have to wait a further year before accessing third level education because of the way it falls.The second case that must be addressed is that of the person on the minimum wage who is excluded from availing of the allowance.  This is forcing people on to the live register.  On the minimum wage, one earns approximately €346 per week and on jobseeker's allowance, with rent allowance and the medical card, one receives €347 per week, €1 better off than the person on the minimum wage.  On the minimum wage, one cannot avail of the back-to-education allowance unless one gives up that job.  To encourage people to do that in order to avail of the education system is deplorable and negative.  It is driving people into unemployment.Youth employment must be seriously addressed.  The Government has made much of addressing the issue of lone parents and unemployment by providing 50 facilitators who will work on a one-to-one basis, according to the Minister, with all lone parents.  When these people wake up tomorrow morning and hear the live register figures they will wonder how on earth this can be done.  The Minister is saying that each of the facilitators will deal on a one-to-one basis with 8,000 people, almost a quota in most constituencies.  This is impossible and cannot happen.  The level of co-operation between the Department of Social and Family Affairs and FÁS is insufficient.  The Government must answer questions about the facilitators and the back-to-education allowance.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	381	Last Friday the IBEC director general, Mr. Turlough O'Sullivan, issued a press release to the effect that firms in the private sector are losing jobs at the fastest rate in decades.  Reduced competitiveness and increased costs are making it extremely difficult for firms to survive.  As Deputy Varadkar said, we are losing one job in this country every ten minutes, 700 jobs per week.  This is quite worrying and I think it will accelerate.  There could be 350,000 to 400,000 people on the live register within a year if trends continue.I was in Silicon Valley last March with a group from Tralee to encourage industrialists to come to Kerry.  I met the chief executive of the San José Silicon Valley Chamber of Commerce at 8 a.m.  There were four delegations before us and a queue after us.  People go there from around the world because there is a lot of noise around the Silicon Valley.  The Silicon Valley has been very kind to Ireland, giving us Apple, Intel, Hewlett Packard, Sun Microsystems and many more.  Now there is much competition and it is not happening.I met a senior IDA official and asked him the reason.  He replied that the task of the IDA is very difficult now.  For example, employing someone in Ireland costs $28, but $26 in California and $6 in Poland.  As Mr. O'Sullivan said, we have lost our competitiveness.  The president of the leadership group is John Hartnett, who is president of Palm.  Next week it will visit Trinity College, bringing venture capitalists and industrialists to tell us that they want to help us but that we must become competitive.  They will send out a stark message.  The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment will meet them but they will give us the message that we will not attract the industry we attracted in the past if we do not become competitive.It is startling and alarming that the live register total in Kerry in September 2007 was 5,958 and grew to 9,085 in September 2008, an increase of 3,127 or 52.5%.  This is unprecedented but is the result of years of neglect by the IDA and other Government agencies.  One would swear that Kerry did not exist.  For example, the IDA brought 13 itineraries to Kerry over five years.  Some of these were for leisure visits to play golf and give the impression the IDA was sending the odd itinerary to Kerry.  Shannon Development, on the other hand, put €9 million of its money into creating a technology park in Tralee.  What did the Minister's predecessor, the Minister, Deputy Martin, do?  He took the brief of promoting industry away from Shannon Development, which was making an impression in terms of achievements.  The business centre in Listowel is now full and there is also the technology park in Tralee.  The then Minister withdrew Shannon Development's brief in that respect in case it might create any more jobs.  One can single out Kerry and point to the reason for the increase in the rate of unemployment.  Normally I am fair and balanced and not so political in the points I make in this House.  The finger can be pointed at the Government for its inaction and for agency inaction in this respect.The Minister of State is practical.  The message here is stark.  Unless we examine our competitiveness, President Obama, on taking office, may examine our advantage in terms of corporate tax in attracting American companies to invest here.   We could then be in serious trouble.I thank my colleague for bringing forward this motion, but it deserves to receive more attention than that of the one Member present on the Government side.  That is unacceptable.

#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	384	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue.  As outlined, it has been raised on a number of occasions, which shows the strong views of Members on all sides of the House on this issue and the level of concern in terms of the challenges we face.It is appropriate that we take account of the backdrop to our economic position and recognise from the outset that these challenges are faced by virtually every other modern economy in the world today.  We have all been affected by the major downturn currently gripping the world's economy.  How we respond to this downturn will determine our future and the Government is determined to continue to take the necessary steps to ensure that Ireland will overcome these difficult circumstances.However, we must acknowledge that, as a small open economy, Ireland is particularly prone to the effects of the economic challenges unfolding across the world's financial markets.  The worldwide economic difficulties are producing effects of a range and severity that are unprecedented in modern history.  The world financial system is currently experiencing an ongoing period of rapid transformation and the fluctuations taking place are impacting on industry, enterprises and individuals not only in Ireland but throughout the world.Difficult and decisive action needs to be taken to ensure economic stability in these tumultuous times.  The Government recognised this fact and brought forward its budget by six weeks in recognition of the extraordinary circumstances facing us — the challenges we face require an agile response and a willingness to be flexible in the face of ever-shifting circumstances.The Government has a proven track record and the experience necessary to manage the economy during this challenging period.  We have proven ourselves by managing the economy to record levels of growth and expansion during the past decade.  We have been at the helm of the economy during a period that witnessed a remarkable leap in living standards for most citizens, which now exceed the EU average at a time when we have record levels of people in employment.  The Government has managed the economy in a way that has built on our inherent strengths, namely our highly skilled and flexible workforce, our work ethic and our benign business environment.We will continue to manage the economy in a manner that ensures we protect and sustain the success and prosperity we have created during the past ten years.  The Government has displayed the courage and conviction to make difficult decisions in the interests of the State.  We will continue to take decisive action that will safeguard our competitiveness and that are in the interests of citizens.  That is why the Government is determined to do all in its power to tackle rising unemployment, which is of great concern.  As politicians, we all recognise the impact unemployment can have on an individual, a family and a community.  New live register figures will be published tomorrow and they will almost certainly show a further deterioration in numbers in employment.The unwelcome conditions in the labour market here reflect the current international economic downturn and Ireland's openness to events affecting the global economy.  We have been adversely affected by the lack of confidence in the world economy, which is manifested in the dramatic fluctuations in stock markets across the globe and the severe reduction in credit, which is the lifeblood of businesses.I take the points raised by some Deputies opposite in the context of credit being made available to small businesses.  As I said during a debate in the Seanad, there is a new arrangement in place between the Government, the Oireachtas and the people of Ireland in the context of the banks because of the bank guarantee scheme.  Banks are strategic in ensuring  that credit, primarily short-term credit such as overdraft and current account facilities, is made available to small and medium-sized businesses.  It is important that such access to credit is maintained, particularly for the productive areas of the economy.  I would be concerned that banks in trying to balance the figures on their balance sheets and ensure they appear correct might target the productive element of the economy, primarily the small and medium-sized businesses.  I acknowledge the support from some sides of the House in ensuring the bolstering of our financial credit system to maintain the economy.  The other options available would have been catastrophic.  We must acknowledge that measure introduced by the Government, with the support of some Opposition Members.I acknowledge that the number on the live register increased significantly over the summer, with the unemployment rate on this basis reaching 6.3% in September.  This represents an increase of almost 50% in a 12-month period.  However, it should be noted that the live register is not designed to measure the rate of unemployment because it includes part-time, seasonal and casual workers who are entitled to unemployment benefit.Employment and unemployment figures are best measured by the Quarterly National Household Survey, the QNHS, published by the Central Statistics Office.  In the second quarter of 2008, the most recent quarter for which data are available, the QNHS measured unemployment at 5.2%, which compared favourably with the EU27 average unemployment rate of 6.8%.  The employment growth for the year was 0.3% above the EU27 average and we were in line with the EU employment targets set for 2010.  However, the Government recognises that the increasing number of people who have been made unemployed represents a major challenge that we must address.  Certain sectors of the economy, in particular the construction and manufacturing sectors, have seen a downturn in activity, with consequent increases in unemployment on a significant scale.  For the first time in a decade many Irish people are facing a very difficult and uncertain period.  The Government has attached the highest priority to assisting these people.  We will continue to direct the necessary resources to the employment and training support services, which will provide a helping hand and assist these people in securing other employment as soon as possible.I realise that rising unemployment levels coupled with the downturn in the economy represent the most demanding challenge which Ireland has faced in almost 20 years.  However, the Government has already taken decisive action to respond to the challenges we are now facing.  We have shown leadership and sent out a strong message that Ireland is responding to the global economic crisis in a proactive and prudent manner.We took early action to address the deterioration in economic and fiscal prospects by introducing the budget 2009 budget earlier than anticipated.  We have secured substantial savings across virtually all areas of public expenditure and we will continue to seek additional savings were possible.  The Government has made many necessary tough decisions in recent weeks in order that Ireland is placed in a position to reap the benefits that will arise once our economic situation and that of the wider world improves.We should acknowledge that total investment for labour market programmes in my Department's Estimate for 2009 will amount to more than €1billion, or 56% of the total budget.  Of this, €1.05 billion will be delivered through FÁS.  Within the FÁS budget funding for community employment and job initiative schemes will be increased by 2% to €450 million.  This will enable FÁS to continue to support a minimum of 22,500 participants on these programmes next year.  Funding for FÁS services to people with disabilities is also being increased by 2%.  A total of €77.7 million in 2009 budget for FÁS is ring-fenced for specific employment and training programmes for people with disabilities.  The allocation from the national training fund for training the unemployed has been increased by €9.5 million this year to more than €208 million.  This allocation will help workers who have recently lost their jobs, including redundant apprentices, through training and re-skilling.  While labour market programmes have been refocused to assist the unemployed, funding for upskilling those in employment in 2009 will still amount to €168.5 million and will be delivered primarily by FÁS and Skillnets.The additional allocation in budget 2009 will enable FÁS to develop new initiatives in addition to the normal delivery of its employment services and training supports to the unemployed.  The purpose of these supports is to assist individuals in securing alternative employment either through sourcing possible employment opportunities or by providing them with upskilling opportunities that will increase their potential employability.  In addition the Department of Social and Family Affairs and FÁS are working closely together to respond quickly to the rising live register numbers.  In particular FÁS's employment services and the local employment services are gearing up to provide increased capacity for an expected increase in referrals from the live register.  FÁS is also providing a range of certified and flexible programmes designed to upskill redundant workers so that they can enhance their prospect of securing employment.  A number of programmes are already in place and the frequency and range of these will be expanded over the coming months.I have already mentioned the significant downturn in construction-related activity since the start of this year.  The construction sector is undergoing a major structural change at present and as a result there has been a major increase in the numbers of people within the construction sector who have been made redundant.  There has also been an increase in the number of apprentices being made redundant.  FÁS, in addition to the usual supports it provides to redundant workers, has established a training fund to enable it to provide a timely response to identified training and retraining needs for low-skilled and redundant craft workers from the construction sector.  It is intended that this will enable individuals to secure a speedy return to work, or where this cannot be secured to provide relevant upskilling opportunities in order that the jobseekers can secure employment in alternative sectors.It is also focusing on providing retraining opportunities for redundant construction workers in emerging areas such as the installation of energy efficient and renewable technologies, environmental activity, and compliance and regulatory work as was mentioned by the Deputies opposite.  In addition FÁS is assisting individuals in any way it can in securing employment abroad in construction in other EU countries.  In that regard FÁS has held job fairs in Dublin and Cork, which brought many employers from other EU member states offering employment in their construction sectors.My Department and FÁS have been actively examining the issue of redundant apprentices and have put in place a series of actions to facilitate redundant apprentices in completing their studies.  These include allowing redundant apprentices to progress to their next off-the-job phase of training without having to do the next on-the-job phase.  A register of redundant apprentices has been established in order to identify these people at the earliest possible time and FÁS has prioritised the need to locate an employer to sponsor the completion of the apprentices' off-the-job training.  A proportion of the additional €9 million assigned to FÁS to provide supports for people seeking employment has been provided to enable FÁS to develop a specific programme aimed at assisting redundant apprentices.  It is intended that this programme will facilitate redundant apprentices in securing the much needed on the job experience they require in order to continue their apprenticeship.Further help for those who have become distanced from the labour market for some time and who are seeking to re-enter is provided by the community employment scheme.  Community employment is an active labour market programme designed to provide eligible long-term unemployed people and other disadvantaged persons with an opportunity to engage in useful work within their communities on a fixed-term basis.  The programme helps unemployed people to progress to the open labour market by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to work routine and assists them in developing both their technical and personal skills.  The Government is investing €377 million this year in community employment with a view to maintaining overall numbers on FÁS schemes at 2007 levels.  At present more than 22,400 people are employed on community employment schemes nationally.  In delivering these places, FÁS operates flexibly in the management of this allocation in order to maximise progression to the labour market while at the same time facilitating the support of community services.While we must continue to provide the necessary supports and services to the people within our workforce who most require our assistance, we must not forget that the continuing development of Ireland's education and training systems will be pivotal in helping Ireland overcome the challenges we are facing and in sustaining our economic success in the future.  We must ensure that our education and training systems continue to harness the collective skills and talents of our workforce.  We must ensure that our systems are meeting the changing needs of society from both an economic and social perspective.  It is of paramount importance to continue to focus attention on developing the skills of our population, so that the Irish labour force can continually adapt and upgrade its skills to meet emerging opportunities and challenges.  The flexibility of our workforce must remain a key strength in these difficult times.This evening's motion calls for a comprehensive audit of FÁS to ensure that the taxpayer is getting value for money from the agency.  There are two points I would like to make in response.  A review, funded by my Department, is investigating how to ensure value for money and obtain the maximum benefit from the operation of labour market programmes provided by both FÁS and Skillnets.  As well as analysing the FÁS and Skillnets-run labour market programmes, the review will also draw conclusions about the adequacy and balance of resources in the context of current and future labour market policy challenges, including the national skills strategy.  The steering group conducting the review is chaired by a senior official from my Department and includes members from the Departments of Finance, Social and Family Affairs, and Education and Science.  FÁS and Skillnets are also represented on the group which is supported by Forfás.Set against what is an undoubtedly tough global economic background, a number of key labour market challenges face the country.  The implementation of the national skills strategy, which sets out clear long-term objectives for the lifelong learning of those in employment and for developing Ireland's human capital through upskilling, training and education for the period to 2020, is intrinsically linked to the future economic prosperity of the country.  Over the two days of the debate Deputies will refer to other issues mentioned in the motion.  I commend the amendment to the House.
#JohnMcGuinness	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-party	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-dob	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	385	My Department and its agencies will play a vital role in working through the current economic circumstances to ensure we are well positioned to reap the benefits that will undoubtedly arise when global markets improve.  We will do this by continuing to attract foreign direct investment, by helping Irish businesses to develop and increase exports, by continuing to prioritise investment in science, technology and innovation, and by continuing to provide supports to small businesses.In speaking about exports, I recognise the role played by Enterprise Ireland and in recent times by the 180 business people representing 94 companies who visited China on a very extensive trade mission.  Their generating of €160 million worth of business is an indication that within those markets our Asian strategy is successful.  It is an indicator to other Irish companies that in spite of the issues raised about competitiveness in our economy, we have the ability and resources to continue to make our impression on companies far abroad.  The Chinese market is very important to us.  I encourage companies to take a leaf out of the books of those engaged with Enterprise Ireland and to try to expand their companies in the context of internationalising and commercialising their products and services to ensure they are included in the development policy of Enterprise Ireland in those markets.The Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, has stated we will continue to provide the necessary support services and retraining opportunities to assist those who have been made unemployed in this difficult time.  By providing these services it is our intention that people who have recently been made unemployed will be given every opportunity to reskill and to secure alternative employment as soon as possible.The Government will continue to take whatever steps are required to safeguard the economy.  Based on our decisive actions we have stabilised the financial services sector so that enterprises, small, medium and large, have improved access to funds, thereby protecting jobs and Irish economic growth.  I am aware of some of the continuing difficulties that smaller companies, including those that have invested heavily in property and other businesses, are having with banks.  We need to continue to monitor the area to ensure the funds needed to allow companies to continue to trade and grow are secured by them.  It is an ongoing developing situation of which the Government needs to be conscious.  All our efforts will need to be put into that sector to ensure they have access to those vital funds.The current economic turmoil that is affecting the entire world economy is obviously having a serious impact on our economic performance.  However, despite witnessing some of the most dramatic changes in the world's financial markets, Ireland's SME sector continues to make an important contribution to our economic prosperity.  More than 250,000 small businesses operate in our economy and employ approximately 800,000 people.  The Government recognises the importance of SMEs.  Given ongoing economic difficulties throughout the world, the role of SMEs is becoming increasingly important.  The Government is committed to ensuring that we put in place policies and programmes that encourage the emergence of new business creations and facilitate long-term business survival.Our tax system is one of the most supportive of business in the world and we dedicate significant Exchequer resources to the promotion of research and development.  The introduction of the better regulation programme to tackle regulatory burdens, particularly those faced by the business community, is intended to provide a supportive environment for small businesses.  The Government has adopted new strategies to support the entire enterprise sector, including small business, based on the reports of the Enterprise Strategy Group and the Small Business Forum.There is no doubt that future prosperity will be founded on the development and growth of Irish-owned companies.  This vision can be realised if the challenges faced by enterprise are met head-on.  In this context, the development of the strength and depth of our indigenous sector will be critical if we are to return to the levels of prosperity achieved in recent years.  In this regard, the Government has already taken concerted action to assist businesses in succeeding in the ever-increasing competitive environment in which they operate.  We have established the Management Development Council, MDC, increased support for the county and city enterprise boards, CEBs, and created an almost seamless support mechanism through Enterprise Ireland and the boards by ensuring that the former is addressing policy and the boards' direction.  In budget 2009, we introduced new tax relief measures specifically aimed at assisting new start-up companies, we are continuing to tackle red tape and reducing it wherever feasible and we are promoting increased entrepreneurial activity.Arising out of the final report of the Small Business Forum and its recommendation that management capability in business be raised to best international standards, the MDC was established last year.  The council's membership is drawn from the key stakeholders in the provision and usage of management development training and is chaired by Professor Frank Roche of UCD.  The work of the MDC has two main strands.  First, it will benchmark Ireland's current management development provision, determining whether it meets the requirements of SMEs, identifying any gaps and developing action plans to address them.  Second, the council is charged with developing a co-ordinated approach to building appreciation in the SME sector for the value and need of leadership and management skills.I look forward to receiving the MDC's report next year.  It is clear it will be key in assisting us tailor our management development training to the precise needs of business.  This is vital, as I strongly believe that management development training is an issue of importance for enterprise development policy.  Research shows that the benefits of management training are not restricted to the individual manager or enterprise.High-growth SMEs are large net job creators and significant drivers of economic growth.  By enhancing and further developing the managerial skills of small firms, all of us stand to gain.  It is in the interests of the State, employers and employees to ensure SMEs have access to world class management development training.  Given the global market in which Irish companies must compete, access to high-quality management development training is no longer an option.  Rather, it is a necessity.  I am confident that the MDC's findings will find many positives in our existing provision of services to the SME sector.The county and city enterprise boards have a clearly defined role as the principal deliverers of State support to the micro-enterprise sector.  As a result of their strong regional presence, they are well placed to help micro-enterprises deal with changing economic circumstances.  Through the provision of both financial and non-financial support, the boards have assisted many micro-enterprises in developing their growth and export potential as well as bringing them to a stage where they have sufficient mass to access the services of Enterprise Ireland.  It is my intention in working with the boards and Enterprise Ireland to ensure the seamless transfer of businesses between them.  SMEs will view this seamless organisation as clear support for them in accessing new markets, growing and realising their full potential.Last month, the Government further illustrated its commitment to supporting small businesses by announcing in the budget that supports, through the county and city enterprise boards, will increase next year by almost €3 million, or 9%, to €34.8 million.  This is recognition and support of the boards, which have developed a structure capable of generating and tapping into enterprise at local level.  The 2009 allocation for the CEBs recognises the importance of continuing to promote entrepreneurship at this time.The SME sector is critical to the development of the economy.  I will continue to do my best to bring my business understanding to bear on the policy direction taken in the promotion and development of the sector.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	386	I support the Government's amendment.  It is important that we recognise the difficulty facing the Government and the entire political system in trying to manage the economy at this time.  The downturn is evident across the world.  In particular, the stock market and financial market meltdowns are creating unprecedented difficulties for administrations.Clearly, a small open economy like ours will suffer the ravages of unemployment at a much quicker rate than larger economies.  Therefore, the Government has been required to take decisive action more quickly than other nations.  It should be commended for doing so.  The Government has recognised the need to address the issue by first bringing forward the budget and subsequently putting in place the bank guarantee scheme, which is viewed throughout Europe as successful.  This is not to suggest that this or another Administration will not need to recapitalise banks at some point, but that is for another day.  The necessary decisive action has been taken and has shown the markets and the wider community that the Government is prepared to take tough decisions.The country faces serious challenges, particularly in terms of the increase in unemployment.  A number of factors are involved.  The Government's strategy for attracting foreign direct investment and its support for indigenous industry are important planks of the overall strategy.  The agencies with responsibility — the IDA and Enterprise Ireland — are working well in a difficult global environment.We must refocus our relationship with Europe.  I do not wish to rehash the Lisbon treaty debate.  However, if we have learned anything in recent months, it is that remaining at the centre of the European project will be vital for the economy.  Many sectors in society should be mindful of the difficulties encountered by Iceland in light of the stance they took on the Lisbon treaty.  Our continuation at the heart of EU decision-making is vital if we are to ensure the underpinning of employment.  It will allow us to grapple with an international crisis.I welcome the reference by the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, to the need to deal with redundant apprentices due to the sudden change in the construction sector.  Many people who had legitimate expectations of finding employment in Ireland are in difficult positions because they will not be able to travel to other countries to take up gainful employment.  It is important that they find methods to finalise their apprenticeships so that they will be able to find meaningful employment, whether in other countries or in Ireland when the building boom resumes.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	13117	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	393	I will begin with a quotation from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment report entitled Innovation in Ireland published in 2008:Ireland's ability to build and sustain its innovation capacity depends on developing and maintaining our skills at world-class levels, and on high quality, continuous education.  Individuals need to respond to the increasing pressures of globalisation by embracing a culture of life-long learning and employability;...I repeat the second sentence: "Individuals need to respond to the increasing pressures of globalisation by embracing a culture of life-long learning and employability".  I listened carefully to the Minister and it is hard to disagree with what has been said in that one senses there is a proactive approach and a continuation of strategies to maintain employment.  However, were I one of the 32,000 plus persons made redundant and thus having to apply between 1 January and the end of this month for assistance under the redundancy scheme, this would not provide me with too much solace.I know of a particular apprentice — there are hundreds like him — who, even if he wanted, could not return to complete his course because there are no jobs in his particular field.  The construction industry has dried up.  The proof of this is the current lack of house building.  Given these trends, apprentices are reluctant to continue their training.I know of an apprentice who, having completed his leaving certificate examination in 2006, decided to embark on a few years' travelling.  When he returned home he took up an apprenticeship as a cabinet maker but was subsequently laid off.  He then decided, given the trends that were emerging, to do a public relations course.  When the person concerned, who was in receipt of jobseeker's allowance, approached the Department of Social and Family Affairs in respect of a place on a public relations course he was told he would have to be signing on for 156 days before he would quality for the back-to-education allowance.  This is wherein the nub of the problem lies.I referred earlier to the thousands of people already laid-off and made redundant, many of whom want to get back into the education sphere.  I acknowledge the €1.5 billion allocation for FÁS and the investment in SMEs.  However, many of the people who previously worked in research and development and high-end IT jobs now want to do MBAs and to upskill but there is no mechanism through which they can re-enter the FÁS or SME framework without their incurring serious economic hardship.  These people do not qualify for third level grants or the back-to-education allowance as they are already in receipt of the jobseeker's allowance.Were I on the opposite side of the House I would be re-examining the demographics of this situation in terms of where the lay-offs have taken place and the educational attainment of those involved.  I would also be much more flexible in my approach, which is what the Government will have to be if unemployment continues to rise.  A person who is eligible for jobseeker's allowance for 12 months should also be eligible for a back-to-education allowance if he or she wishes to upskill by re-entering the education system.The 22,500 people currently engaged in community employment schemes do exceptional work.  However, many of these people are hampered after a few years by the principle of progression, of which we hear so much.  I would also be a little more flexible in respect of the requirement to quit a community employment scheme after a specified period.  I would allow for a greater degree of flexibility in terms of permitting these people, where possible, to continue to work in their communities and would pay them the allowances required in this regard.  This would help to sustain communities and would provide these people with employment.There have been lay-offs in a wide range of areas, including agriculture, banking, finance and insurance.  A wide array of people will not necessarily fit into the training schemes envisaged by Government.  Many people working in the energy, manufacturing, building and civil engineering areas have been laid-off and will not get work any time soon.  Many of them were reliant on the construction industry and on the IT sector, in particular the research and development component of the IT sector, an area almost always hit first during a downturn.  These people are unable to return to the education system unless they pay for it themselves.  While an unemployed single person with savings has a good chance of accessing a third level course, an unemployed person within a family structure will need to put aside every penny to meet his or her family circumstances.The Government needs to apply some lateral thinking in this area.  It does not appear to have internalised the full extent of the problems facing unemployed people in the future.  Instead of quoting chapter and verse in this House on that which we know already — one has only to look at the Departments' websites to learn what is being spent — it should bring forth fresh ideas in regard to how our people can upskill.I acknowledge the investment in FÁS training for installation schemes and so on.  It was once said to me that the next boom might result from our having to fix some of the faulty and dodgy houses constructed in haste during the past ten years.  It may be that such a scheme will be required.  However, we must also cater for high end jobs.  We must bear in mind that hundreds, if not thousands, of people are currently unemployed.We need to look after those people who will not necessarily fit into the mechanism prescribed by the two Ministers in their response.  I reiterate the Government's words that individuals need to respond.  Individuals want to respond to the changing market and to this downturn.  However, they may want to diversify into completely different areas of education.  This, for some people, is an opportunity to re-assess from where they come.  If we are talking about entrepreneurial spirit in this country, the only way it can be reinvigorated is if the €179 million allocated to Science Foundation Ireland or €90 million spent on encouraging FDI is re-examined and perhaps apportioned at least in part to localised schemes for people who have that kind of spirit and who wish to create indigenous and SME-type industry.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	394	I thank the Labour Party for sharing its slot with me and welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  My party has constantly highlighted the need for training in the last two years as it became apparent the economy was contracting and job losses were on the rise.  Even before the current economic crisis, we had pointed out that the construction industry in particular was heading for a crash and the State risked massive unemployment unless it started training workers in that sector in alternative industries.  Unfortunately, none of these calls was heeded and we see the consequences now.It is imperative in the next few months that we see jobs created.  It is not enough to have a highly trained workforce if it has no means of employment.  The 2009 budget failed spectacularly to produce a strategy for job creation in the time ahead.  It was a book-balancing exercise for Fianna Fáil based on the contracting revenue brought about by job losses, but nowhere did it set out a plan for creating jobs to increase revenue.  If anything, the budget included measures that have the potential seriously to curtail employment.  The small to medium business sector which employs the majority of Irish people is going to the wall in the current economic crisis and instead of introducing measures to help, the budget undermined it.The increase in VAT will have a serious impact on consumption in this State if it is passed onto the consumer.  If it is not, and these businesses subsume the increase, it will have a serious impact on their ability to operate.  Either way, an industry dependent on domestic consumption was targeted in this budget to raise finances and cover the fall-out from the Government's short-sighted economic policies.  Ironically, one area of the budget where the Government gave money away — to the tune of €180 million — was stamp duty.  However, the move is more a sop to developers trying to shift current properties than a plan to keep jobs in the construction sector.I wish to deal with the jobs fall-out in this sector first because although many other areas, such as manufacturing and the SME sector, are feeling the squeeze, construction is where we are haemorrhaging jobs.  As the Fianna Fáil-led Government came to power in 1997, employee numbers in the industry soared from fewer than 100,000 in 1994 to 260,000 in 2007.  At its peak, construction accounted for almost one quarter of all economic activity.  The growth of this unsustainable sector was pushed by Government policy of property tax reliefs and support for its developer friends.  The indirect taxation that resulted for the Exchequer was an added bonus and acted as a deterrent to the Government in doing anything to rein in the sector.As a result of its growth, thousands of young men headed on to sites and into apprenticeships.  Many left school early and others left other industries like farming to the detriment of those sectors.  It is estimated that a minimum of 30,000 construction workers have lost their jobs so far in 2008.  This figure comes from CSO projections based on live register data and we do not have exact figures on how many construction workers have emigrated.  In offering training to those leaving this sector or at risk of losing their jobs, it is imperative the State takes an intelligent approach.  We should not be training for training sake — we must train these individuals in skills we need and which will be of real benefit.This leads to my point about FÁS.  Leaving aside the issue of financial irregularities in our largest training agency, something which of course must be dealt with in full, my main concern regarding FÁS is the type of training it is providing for those out of work.  There does not seem to be any joined-up thinking or plan behind at least some of the courses offered by it.  For example, two of the courses launched by FÁS in recent times, or in development, include domestic heat pump installation and floor covering installation, both potentially useless courses given the downturn in the related construction sector.It is essential the State introduces a specific back-to-education scheme for construction sector workers under 25 years of age and without leaving certificates.  The Taoiseach's Department estimated that under-25s represent over 50% of the total construction unemployment figure in 2007 and 2008, and a large majority do not have a leaving certificate.It is also essential that training and upskilling courses for alternative industries to construction be provided.  Where possible, workers should be retrained in areas they would be comfortable with and which we are also trying to expand, such as energy saving and renewable energy sectors.As I mentioned previously, it is not just in construction where people are losing jobs and a raft of new training courses will be needed in the months ahead to sustain the significant numbers signing on.  I call on the number of community employment schemes, in particular, to be increased, and for the schemes to be reviewed in terms of the training they provide and the merit they bring to society.  It is also important that training courses are provided with a view to our underperforming indigenous export market.  It is completely unacceptable that 90% of exports in the State are from the foreign direct investment sector, welcome and all as it is, with only 10% from the indigenous sector.  It is grossly unacceptable but this should have been planned for many years ago in order to see fruits now.  It is an indictment of Government policy over all those years that action was not taken on indigenous exports.Five years ago, Ahead of the Curve identified problems with the sales skills of those working in the export sector.  The report noted a scarcity of sales personnel with the right mix of industry background and technical knowledge, that Irish market graduates are perceived by the industry to lack practical business skills and that only 25% of sales personnel in Irish SMEs have formal qualifications in marketing sales.  This skills deficit must be tackled soon.It is important to mention the child care sector, which is very neglected by this Government.  When workers lose their jobs, it is incumbent upon the State to ensure they can avail of training and upskilling opportunities.  However, we must be aware that the difference in income between someone employed and someone in training is vast, and if that individual was previously dependent on our very overpriced and underresourced child care sector, a problem arises.  These people cannot continue to keep their children in expensive facilities, so who minds their child when they are receiving training?The equal opportunities child care scheme, while not nearly broad enough, traditionally stepped into this breach for people who were either unemployed and seeking work, in training, or in low income jobs.  The decision of the Government to do away with the scheme and replace it with a less effective one further decreases the number of affordable child care places available.  Given the lack of child care, which has acted as a handicap to our workforce even in times of near full employment, I suggest the Government concentrate on this sector for both training and job creation.  I also ask the Government to reverse its decision on the equal opportunities child care scheme.The need for training will grow in the coming months but I reiterate my initial point.  As well as providing training and upskilling, the Government urgently needs to produce a plan that will create jobs.  The public finances simply are not there to sustain significant numbers in training for any length of time.  In order to turn around our economy, we must develop jobs very quickly to offer people an alternative when they become unemployed.With regard to child care facilities, I appreciate there is much capital expenditure normally involved in the establishment of such projects.  Perhaps some schools with enough available land could have child care facilities within them, thus encompassing an environment that will be comfortable for the child through its early education.  That is one avenue of reducing capital costs and the cost of child care, which is very important.

The bringing forward of the budget by eight weeks was meant to demonstrate the Government was in control of significant problems in the economy and was willing and able to deal with them in a fair and equitable manner.  What has emerged, rather, is a badly thought-out document, which uses as its prime target the most vulnerable, the elderly, students and farmers.  As I already have spoken on the education issue, I wish to turn my attention to the cutbacks in the budget pertaining to farming.The farming industry is a sector of the economy that has taken and survived many hits over the years.  While manufacturing, construction and some service industries have come and gone, farming has managed to withstand more downturns than most.  It has had its good days but these have been far outnumbered by the difficulties it has faced.  Farmers have seen the prices they receive for their produce fall while the price paid by the consumer has rocketed in some cases.  For example, earlier this year grain farmers were obliged to accept a large reduction in price for their barley from Diageo.  Concurrently however, Diageo increased the price the same farmers were obliged to pay for a pint of Guinness for the third time within a brief period.I wish to refer to a few of the savage cutbacks in the budget that, if implemented, will drive people from the land.  If this is allowed to happen at this time, it will have far greater consequences than would have been the case a few years ago, when there were opportunities available in other sectors, such as the construction industry in particular, and young farmers had a choice.  The only choice the proposed changes will leave them with is the emigrant aeroplane or ship.First, the installation aid for young farmers, which was an incentive for the young population to get into farming, was axed.  The €15,000 grant has been withdrawn just when it is most needed to provide a sustainable job.  One often hears of the enormous cost of each job created in the manufacturing industry.  Although such jobs now are announced only rarely, their cost far exceeds €15,000 per job.  Earlier, I read a document in which the creation of every job by the IDA is estimated to cost approximately €60,000, which is far removed from the moneys needed for the installation aid.Last week, I was visited in my clinic by a mother who last year convinced her son not to take up a job offer from Mayo County Council, in order that he might do the course to qualify for the green certificate and become a qualified farmer.  Although he now has a green certificate, he is not entitled to installation aid because he had not completed all the documentation for his application and has no immediate prospect of a job outside farming.  It has been suggested that this scheme merely has been suspended.  However, even were the scheme to be restored, this would be of little use to the aforementioned young man who, being just within the allowable age limit at present, would be too old.  Members have been told the average number of take-ups of this scheme is 800 per annum.  The announcement of such a number of jobs in any other sector of the economy at present would be the cause of a national celebration.  Members should remember the total cost to the Government was only €7 million, or €8,750 per young farmer, as the remainder of the cost was met by Europe.The cuts in the disadvantaged area payment in the budget also will have detrimental effects on the smallest and weakest farmers.  In my constituency of Mayo, farmers on the maximum 45 hectare limit will lose €1,300 per year.  If that loss is added to the cutback in the suckler cow welfare scheme, the average farmer in Mayo will be at a loss of a minimum of €2,500.  This will cost the farmers of County Mayo alone millions of euro.  The budget seems intent on shutting down farming as a career in rural Ireland.  Fairness and equity were promised in the budget and a strong case exists for a reversal of some of the aforementioned measures, both to support young people to take up jobs that await them and in the interests of fairness, equity and economic sense.I will conclude by noting I already have spoken about education cutbacks.  I attended a meeting last week in Claremorris of 1,500 farmers at which the anger and dejection were palpable.  One must not forget that not alone are farmers losing money in the aforementioned cutbacks, as mothers and fathers they will be obliged to fork out the additional hundreds of euro for school transport, school books and all the grant aid that has been taken from them in the education cutbacks.  In addition, these are the same people who will be affected by the cuts in the health budget, the home care packages and so on.  I will sum up the budget by asking the reason the vulnerable have been hit to such an extent.
#DeirdreClune	unknown-#DeirdreClune-party	unknown-#DeirdreClune-dob	unknown-#DeirdreClune-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	399	Although it is late in the evening and not many Members are present, I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak for the first time on the budget.  In particular, I wish to use some of my time to concentrate on the education cutbacks, which constituted a highly negative and retrograde step.  I also will focus on the vulnerable in our society and those who cannot speak for themselves.  Members, who were candidates during the last general election, are fully aware of the impact that reducing the pupil-teacher ratio will have on schools, on the children who are there to be educated and on the teachers, as well as of the associated stress that will spill over into family life.This is an era in which there is supposed to be a focus on education.  All one hears from the Minister and the Government is that education is extremely important and that young people must be attracted into the sciences, engineering and mathematics.  They are to be encouraged not alone to finish their second level education but to participate in third level education.  However, unless young people are provided with the requisite support, we will be making the job much more difficult.  As children become older, they reach an age at which they should take an interest in science and in their education and should feel both challenged and confident in facing such subjects.  However, if they do not receive the support they need during their primary education, they certainly will not follow through at second level.The statistics and arguments can be read on the websites of the INTO and the ASTI.  All Members are fully aware of the implications that such cutbacks and the cutback on pupil-teacher ratios in particular will have on children.  This measure, combined with the capping of the number of language support teachers, certainly will increase pressure on teachers themselves.  Their professional role is to instill knowledge, encourage children to develop through their education and be in a position to face State examinations.  Such a negative, retrograde step as that will ensure teachers will not be able to do what their training and profession demands of them.  I am confident that at some stage we will emerge from the recession, but it will take many years to reverse the cutbacks.  The vote we had in this House last week underlined the Government's commitment to the cutbacks.  When one leaves primary education, one does not have another opportunity to get to grips with reading, writing and arithmetic — the three Rs.  Secondary school is a different scenario and is much more challenging and pupils need to be equipped with the basics.  I am not a teacher, but I am a parent and I know well the value and importance of primary education in particular.Having received many e-mails last week from secondary schools, I am concerned at the impact of the education cuts on less popular subjects.  In one case I had an e-mail from the principal of a girls' secondary school who is trying to encourage and foster physics and chemistry.  One class had 14 students and there were 16 students in another.  The school is in danger of losing one of those class teachers and that subject will be lost to the girls.  I am sure a similar situation will arise in some boys' schools also.  Those students will miss out on a very valuable opportunity as a result of the negative cutbacks.  Primary school children will never recover from the neglect that will result from the cutbacks.  Students who have become used to a range of subjects will also be affected by cutbacks and some subjects will not be available in certain schools.  Every school has a different story.  I am sure that as the weeks and months go by we will all become familiar with them, especially now that schools are back from the mid-term break.I was interested to read an article in a newspaper today about partnerships sought between schools and computer firms to encourage investment in ICT.  Reference was made to the Minister's longer term goal of increasing the take-up of science and engineering courses at third level in the building of Ireland's knowledge economy.  We all applaud that.  It is a wonderful goal, but it is not a long-term goal.  It should be today's goal.  We are a small country that needs to compete internationally.  Our success to date has been based on our ability to attract foreign direct investment as well as investment from indigenous companies.  One of our greatest assets was our young, highly educated workforce.  The future would appear to be hopeless given that we have a Minister whose long-term goal is to attract young people to take up the study of science and engineering.  We should have been doing that before now.  The Minister's objective should be to increase the take-up of science and engineering subjects.  Microsoft, Intel and other such companies that have invested here need high-level graduates in those subjects.  Currently, many companies employ immigrants and that situation cannot last forever.  As a country we need to create our own engineers, scientists and computer graduates to take up the jobs that already exist and those we hope to attract.What really shocked me in the budget was the blatant nature of the cutbacks.  There was no emphasis on reform or investing in our future, or no clear message as to how the Government sees us moving forward.  The debacle with the medical cards for over 70s was reversed when the Government realised how unpopular it was not just with the over 70s, but with their families and friends.  Young people did not want to be part of a society which made that type of statement.  When the Government realised how unpopular a move it was, it turned its focus on general practitioners and expected them to bail it out.  We have yet to see that happen.  The removal of the medical cards from some people over 70 was a totally unnecessary step that caused huge anger.Likewise, I was shocked to hear on the news tonight that the Minister for Health and Children has scrapped the introduction of the vaccination programme for cervical cancer, which had been outlined in September for young girls aged between 12 and 14.  Such an approach has proven to be successful and would have reduced the number of deaths from cervical cancer year on year.  Currently, it is estimated that 70 people per year die from the disease.  That is another negative and backward step to take.  The vaccination programme was a major topic of discussion during the previous election.  I am very much aware of the matter and had been lobbied locally about it.  I had raised the issue with the Minister and was delighted to hear the vaccination programme was being introduced.  It was a positive step but now we find the programme is being scrapped, although no mention of it was made in the budget.  How many more such cuts will be slipped in?I noted the Minister's reference in his budget speech to a tax of €200 for car parking spaces in large urban areas.  It is described as an environmental measure but we have yet to see how it will work.  I have no objection to such a tax if there is an alternative means of public transport, but in many areas there is not.  In Cork, many people work in large factory units in industrial estates on the edge of the city and such people do not have a direct bus connection.  They are entirely dependent on their cars to get to work.  One cannot introduce a tax of that nature until such time as an alternative means of transport is provided.  Getting to work by public transport is fine if one is living on a direct bus route or if one has access to the Luas in Dublin, but in cases where one has no other means of getting to work — through a failure on the part of the State — I would not support the introduction of such a tax.The Acting Chairman, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, will be aware of similar areas in Limerick where a business located inside the city boundary is employing people and paying rates that are very welcome, yet a similar company located just over the city boundary in the county area with perhaps 200 car parking spaces would not be liable for the charge.  Such a tax would be an incentive for an employee to move from a company located in a city area to one located in a county area with a resultant loss of revenue to the city in rates.  There would also be a loss to city centre businesses and services from staff working in that area.  The measure is ill-thought out.  I accept that such a measure should be considered if an alternative, reliable public transport system is in place but until such time as we have that, the tax should not be introduced.  The increase in VAT is unnecessary.  It will contribute to inflation and discourage people from spending, especially on services.  I would have thought the approach to the budget would have been to keep taxes down and seek savings where possible.Fine Gael produced budgetary proposals prior to the budget.  The budget should certainly have encouraged people to spend money and should not have discouraged them by increasing VAT rates.  Fine Gael recommended savings in Departments and a very controversial proposal to freeze public sector pay for those earning over €50,000.  This has met with the approval of those I have spoken to recently.  Parents of children in classes of 35 next September would certainly prefer to take a pay freeze if earning over €50,000 than to have the focus on their children removed.  They do not want their children neglected and subjected to negative measures that will affect them for life.There were ways of budgeting without slashing and burning, as it has been described, and without increasing taxes and making the major cuts we have witnessed.  Such measures would not have affected those in the front line or the vulnerable, who do not have a voice.  I commend those over 70 because they certainly made their voice heard two weeks ago during the debate on the budget in the House.  I was amazed to see at least 15,000 people turning up on the streets and making their objections known to the Government.  While I would not commend the treatment of many Members and while I have heard some stories of quite unpleasant events and altercations, there was, nonetheless, a considerable silent majority that was shocked at the way the elderly were treated and at the attitude to them in the Government's announcements.I want to refer to the regeneration of the docklands in Cork.  Mention was made of Seveso sites in the budget and grant aid was provided to ensure they could be remediated.  Seveso sites, such as those with liquid storage tanks and fertilizer factories, are potentially dangerous to those living near them.  There are three such sites in the docklands in Cork and they must be moved, at considerable expense, if we are to ensure the development of the docklands.  That they were mentioned in the budget and that supports were announced to facilitate their removal is welcome.  I will have an opportunity to speak on this matter on the Adjournment so I will not dwell on it now.  It was a positive move and, for the first time, the potential to regenerate and develop our docklands has been recognised.The budget presented an opportunity for the Government to do something creative and send out a positive message although we are experiencing tough times.  The problems we face are not solely the result of the global economic downturn since many of them are of the Government's making.  This is because of complete over-reliance on tax revenue from the property sector, which has now collapsed.  Revenue from this sector has been very much below what was expected.  Poor results were reported in this regard on the news tonight.An increasing number of people are losing jobs.  Tonight we discussed a Private Members' motion, moved by Deputy Varadkar, on employment and noted people are losing jobs every day.  We hear of the job losses that make the headlines but do not hear about the small and medium enterprises that are letting go one to three people.  These numbers are adding up and contribute to a total of 720 job losses per week.  Those who lose jobs will either be claiming social welfare payments or looking to the State to retrain them so as to gain employment.The outlook is stark.  I support the Private Members' motion before the House this week that points to the need to focus on those who have lost their jobs to ensure they can be retrained, upskilled and given the necessary qualifications to regain employment.  Opportunities exist in the green energy and services sectors.  It cannot be all doom and gloom but we need to recognise times have changed and that people need skills to face the jobs market.  They need to be supported in this regard.We need to send out a message that, as a country, we have been over-reliant on the property sector.  We have not been investing money where we should have been over recent years.  The Budget Statement and Minister's recent statement inspire no confidence in this regard.  No thought has been put into making savings in the public sector or to investment in capital infrastructure to ensure we will be equipped and fighting fit when the upturn comes and that we will be in our rightful place and play our part as a strong economy, which we have the capacity to redevelop.I do not support any of the cutbacks and am disappointed there was no imagination or optimism.  There was no roadmap indicating where we are going as a country and how the Government will steer us out of this decline.

There is much public worry over the state of the economy.  I have been talking to my constituents in Donegal and know their concern is very real.  The issue is not unique to Ireland.  We are in the midst of a global economic crisis but we are better equipped for it than many.Difficult decisions had to be made by the Government to deliver its budget.  The decisions are ones we would rather not have to take but they are necessary in these uncertain times.  There is no credit to be derived from delivering stricter budgetary controls in respect of social welfare benefits, schools, hospitals, farmers, PAYE workers or senior citizens but these measures were necessary.Consider some of the measures proposed by the Opposition, particularly Fine Gael.  The Government announced cuts of €2 billion while Fine Gael proposed cuts of €4 billion.  I would love to know the circumstances we would be in if cuts of €4 billion had been made.  I wonder whether the Opposition really realises where it stands on budgets.  The measures of the Government were taken to ensure the progress of the past decade will be protected and that the country will be best placed to take advantage of the inevitable upturn in the international economy when it occurs.Our economy is much better insulated from the difficulties it will face over the coming years than it was from the difficulties it faced in the 1980s.  That is the reality.  We are tackling the problem head on and I am confident the Government will see Ireland though this storm.  Our focus is upon generating economic growth through employment, assisting industry and enhancing economic competitiveness.The Government's decision to guarantee deposits in Irish banks in an effort to restore confidence was courageous and was replicated in many European countries.  We have led the way in times of despair and other countries are examining our movements in order to try to keep up with us.  That is what this Government was elected to do, to manage the economy.  That is what we are doing in this difficult time, not taking short-term decisions but looking further down the road to ensure the growth we have enjoyed can come back again.Much was offered in the budget in terms of social welfare for those more in need.  Improvements in family income supplement for low-income working families have been introduced and there have also been increases in child-related payments to those dependent on social welfare.  A further 18,000 families will become eligible for the back to school clothing and footwear allowance, which is much needed by many families across the country.  Much worry and anxiety have been expressed in recent days by older people in respect of the availability of medical cards.  Like others, my office was inundated with calls from pensioners who were concerned they might lose their medical card.  I am delighted the Taoiseach made the decision he did.  It certainly shows this Government is prepared to listen to the people.  We did not bring in decisions just because we liked to but we wanted to look after all concerned, particularly those in need.  I believe the revisions of the scheme will satisfy the vast majority.The closure of two Army barracks in my county has also caused much concern among staff and Army personnel in Rockhill and Lifford.  Unfortunately, the running of these barracks is extremely costly and it has been decided the personnel will be facilitated at Finner Army camp in the near future.  I have been told this decision was reached for two main reasons.  The first is cost savings; the second is that there is less requirement for excess Army barracks along the Border because of the changed situation arising from the peace process in Northern Ireland.  It is envisaged the proceeds of the sale of Rockhill and Lifford barracks will produce substantial resources for the modernisation process in the defence organisation.At this time, it may be tempting to become negative about what we have achieved in this country over the past ten to 20 years but I wish to focus on the positive.  The value of GDP increased in Ireland by over 70% between 1970 and 2006, which is well above the EU average.  National debt as a percentage of GDP has fallen from over 87% in 1990 to just over 20% in 2006.  This economy has been booming for many years and nobody can deny the progress made in this country over the last ten to 20 years.  We have all been part of building it and we have all enjoyed it.  Irish emigrants came back home on holiday and could barely recognise their home towns so great was the progress and we must not forget that.  We experienced incredible growth and prosperity and the economy is now taking a hit but with proper management provided by this Government I believe things will level out.  The good times will be back but at this critical point the emphasis is on damage limitation.The economic outlook has changed.  However, after the strong performance of our economy over many years this Government is in the best possible position to navigate its way through the challenges that lie ahead.  That is what we intend to do and our focus must be on positioning Ireland to participate in the global upturn.Of late, the Opposition has been playing political football with our economy.  It plays the blame game concerning the economic problems faced by this country.  Over ten years ago, the Opposition decided to freeze direct school funding and also proposed cutting teacher numbers.  It also cut by £20 million the budget for school buildings and renovation.  This is in stark contrast to the record of the current Government.  During the past 11 years the Government has invested unprecedented amounts of money in building roads and schools.  We must all look to our own constituencies and see the number of school buildings and extension works, the number of houses built at local authority level and the water schemes and sewage treatment plants built during this period.  The Government has spent billions of euro on increased pensions, children's allowance, carer's allowance and other social welfare benefits.  Spending on health, education and social welfare was increased dramatically in this budget.Times are tougher now and everybody will feel the strain in disposable income but I wonder which of the aforementioned increases the Opposition believes should not have been given: schools, roads or pensions.  The Opposition is understandably keen to remind us of the 1980s because that period was the last time their parties were returned to Government following a general election.  At that time inflation was approximately 21% and personal tax rates were 40% and 65%.  In 1986, the year before Fianna Fáil came back into Government, Ireland had a higher debt per head than Ethiopia and Sudan.  We can never go back to the 1980s and I am confident that with Fianna Fáil at the helm we will not.The Taoiseach has come in for much criticism from the Opposition in recent weeks and the budgets over which he presided have been held up for scrutiny.  I do not think there is anything to be ashamed of in the budgets of Deputy Cowen as Minister for Finance or in the budget of the current Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan.  The old age pension was increased by €66, financial support for parents with children aged under six almost doubled, provision for special needs education was doubled and the social welfare budget increased by 40%.  These are the vulnerable groups in society and the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Lenihan, looked after them when we were experiencing better times.  Would the Opposition prefer we had neglected them?  Its members accuse this Government of reckless spending but at the same time they continually call across the floor of this Chamber for more spending.  This is the same Opposition that called for 13 further quangos at the last election.  In its manifesto last year it called for three further junior Ministers.  There appears to be a considerable level of confusion on the other side of the House.However, it is time all elected representatives pulled together.  There has been too much finger pointing of late by the Opposition and it would be much more productive if all parties in this House got behind the Government in a joint effort to steer our economy through these more difficult times.  That would benefit all of us.  Framing a budget is not a popularity contest and nobody likes to impose stricter budgetary controls but we are not in the business of buying short-term popularity to put at risk all the gains of the last decade.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	401	Ba mhaith liom mo chuid ama a roinnt leis an dTeachta Liz McManus.  Ba mhaith liom déileáil ar dtús leis an dá ábhar as a bhfuil mé freagrach mar urlabhraí, an Ghaeilge agus cúrsaí cosanta.  Bliain ó shin, ar an 31 Deireadh Fómhair 2007, dúirt an tAire Gnóthaí Pobail, Tuaithe agus Gaeltachta go raibh fochoiste Rialtais á chur ar bun chun déileáil le todhchaí na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht.  Dúirt sé freisin gur chreid sé gurb í seo an chéad uair go raibh coiste den sórt seo ar bun sa Stát.An lá céanna, foilsíodh an staidéar teangeolaíochta ar úsáid na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht.  De réir an staidéir sin, gheobhaidh an Ghaeilge bás mar phríomh theanga na Gaeltachta taobh istigh de 20 bliain, muna gcuirtear beart raidiciúil in áit chun cosc a chur leis an meath.  Dúirt an tAire Ó Cuív go n-aontódh an fochoiste plean gníomhach taobh istigh de bhliain.  Bhí dhá chruinniú ag an fochoiste ó shin, ceann amháin ar 10 Aibreán agus ceann eile ar 23 Iúil.  Tá súil agam go n-aontóidh an Rialtas an plean gníomhach roimh an Nollaig agus go bhfoilseofar é.  Tá straitéis 20 bliain don Ghaeilge á ullmhú ag an Roinn agus deireann an tAire go bhfuil sé ag súil go mbeidh sé ag an Rialtas roimh deireadh na bliana.Fáiltíonn Páirtí an Lucht Oibre roimh an dá bheart seo atá idir lámha ag an Rialtas.  Ach, sna Meastacháin don Roinn Gnóthaí Pobail, Tuaithe agus Gaeltachta, faoin teideal Gaeltacht agus Forbairt na nOileán, tá gearradh siar i 2009 de 14%, ó €105 milliún go dtí €91 milliún.  Níl aon airgead breise ar fáil chun moltaí phleananna gníomhacha don Ghaeltacht a chur i bhfeidhm, cuma cé chomh raidiciúil agus atá siad.Cé go bhfuil méadú ó €5 milliún go dtí €9 milliún in áit eile sna Meastacháin don Ghaeilge, sin do Choiste na Gaeilge, níl aon mhéadú eile le feiscint a chabhródh le moltaí na straitéise 20 blian a chur in áit.  Tá sé soiléir nach bhfuil an Rialtas i ndáiríre i dtaobh todhchaí na Gaeilge ar chor ar bith.  Tá baol ann freisin go gcuirfí Údarás na Gaeltachta isteach faoi bhráid an IDA.  Níl an tAire sásta a rá nach dtarlóidh seo.The Minister for Defence will close five military establishments as part of the cost-cutting measures in the budget.  The four Army barracks to be closed are in Longford, Lifford, Letterkenny and Monaghan, while St. Bricin's Hospital in Dublin is also due for closure.  There could hardly be a worse time for selling these properties.  Will we repeat the mistake of 1998 when the State spent £1,400 per week on private security to protect four vacant barracks?  Serious questions arise as to what will be the net gain to the State from the eventual disposal of these five military establishments when one takes into consideration, among other issues, payments for relocation to which the 650 soldiers affected are entitled.  At a time when the retail trade is being hit hard by the recession, the withdrawal of funding from local economies will compound the problem.According to the most recent figures available, 7,817 people were on the live register in for County Waterford on 30 September 2008.  The comparable figures for 2007 and 2006 were 5,303 and 5319, respectively.  The number on the live register increased by 47% or 2,500 people in the year to the end of September.  Unfortunately, all the indications are that the October figure will be considerably worse than the figure for the previous month.This brings me to my major criticism of the budget.  Following the September returns by the Department of Finance, it was projected that the shortfall in tax revenue for the year would be €6.5 billion.  This is probably an optimistic forecast because it is probable that we will have another budget in the new year.  It has been suggested, for example, that the shortfall could be as much as €9 billion.  In such circumstances, it is vital that we plan and prepare for the eventual upturn in the global economy.Under the rainbow coalition, which has been written out of history by Deputies on the benches opposite, the economy enjoyed good growth and, more important, it was export based.  The problem we are experiencing is that the traditional industrial manufacturing base is being eroded, the construction industry is in serious decline and the tourism sector is experiencing difficulties.  The questions no one is addressing are from where new employment will come and on what areas we must focus to move ahead.Henry Ford once said that thinking is the hardest work which is probably the reason so few people do it.  Thinking and vision are lacking in the budget.  We need to apply ourselves to the future and make investment decisions in order to be prepared when the upturn takes place.  In that context, nothing is more important than education.  All relevant studies show that those who are educated do best, earn most and enjoy the best opportunities.  Upskilling is, therefore, a key issue.In my constituency and all the constituencies in the south east, including that of the Minister of State, Deputy John McGuinness, the issue of greatest concern is the need to establish a university in the region.  This issue was not addressed in the budget.  In answer to a parliamentary question tabled a few weeks ago, the Minister indicated a decision would be made in the coming weeks on applications submitted by three institutes of technology in Dublin, Cork and Waterford to have their status upgraded to that of university.  The absence of a university in the south east is holding back the region, which continues to suffer from the loss of traditional industrial jobs.  Unless the south east has the capacity to develop jobs in the knowledge economy based on top class research and development, its future will be bleak.The university of the south east being sought by my region differs from that being sought in Cork and Dublin.  The concept is based on a hub campus in Waterford with satellite campuses throughout the region.  While this is a novel proposal, it will undoubtedly work.  There is a general conviction throughout the south east that a university, above everything else, is what it needs to prosper.On any given day when the universities are in full session, 7,000 students from the south east are attending colleges outside the region.  This causes a brain drain because students who graduate tend to take up employment within a radius of approximately 60 miles of the institution they attended.  In addition, those making inward investment decisions will consider areas with an educational establishment which produces graduates who can play a part in the knowledge economy — the emerging economy  — and, most important, in the areas in which Ireland can compete.  The low cost countries are attracting the traditional manufacturing sectors which provided jobs here for so many and so long.The south east is experiencing a brain drain and the erosion of traditional industry.  The Government, in the budget, offered nothing to County Waterford and other counties in the region to enhance its readiness to advance when the potential exists to do so.  It is not necessary to wait for an economic turnaround because the creativity and entrepreneurship which develops from an institution such as a university enables people to see opportunities, even at the worst of times.  We must provide a base and capacity in the south east to ensure this objective is realised.The budget is about balancing the books.  While this is a necessary exercise, the Government took the wrong options in many areas.It cannot be all negativity, however, a case of throwing in the towel and saying matters are just terrible.  We must look at the major positive aspects that will bring about change.The decentralisation programme in my area has now been put back until 2011.  Some 225 jobs from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government were to come to Waterford and part of that project was the provision of an additional court chamber, which is very badly needed.  Not alone are we losing the decentralised Department, but also that very important project which would have an enormous effect on the efficient use of the courts system in Waterford.  The town of Dungarvan, which has suffered a number of serous industrial blows, was to get 206 jobs from Ordnance Survey Ireland, but that has been put back to 2011, at the very earliest.  I never believed this particular decentralisation project was anything more than something the former Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, made up on the back of a cigarette box, because there was neither planning nor consultation with the unions, and it was very pat.  However, it was promised to Waterford repeatedly by Government representatives.  I always felt the promises were hollow, but now we have this definite statement to the effect that nothing will happen before 2011.In terms of injecting additional moneys into economies, something that can be lost sight of is the bad situation that exists for the retail sector at the moment.  This sector employs a great many more people than many of us realise.  Its lifeblood is the circulation of money in local communities and economies.  That is not happening sufficiently at the moment and there are ways to redress this.  For example, in terms of planning and agriculture, the early retirement scheme has been withdrawn.  That existed to ensure that farms were handed over as early as possible.  Also, the installation grant has been withdrawn.  This involved providing €15,000 to help people aged under 35 get started on their farm careers.  In my view, the removal of these payments is very short-sighted.  I have a great deal more to say about the budget, but I will yield to my colleague, Deputy McManus.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	402	There was a certain expectation beforehand that it would be a tough budget but a fair one.  There was a certain amount of confidence that the new Taoiseach was a safe pair of hands.  That increased the sense of bewilderment when the budget was published because in the public's eye its two characteristics were ineptitude and unfairness.  Confidence in the trio at the top of the Government, the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance, was replaced by the lack of confidence among the public in terms of its perception not just of the economic difficulties we face, but the issue of governance.  The Government set out in its budget "to safeguard key public services, protect the vulnerable, refocus spending to enhance our productive capacity, regain export competitiveness, reskill our labour force, retain the substantial gains already made and continue our work in building a fair Ireland".  That is what the statement said, but the reality was the complete opposite.  None of those particular objectives was progressive and what was remarkable was the universal criticism the budget received.  Nobody seemed happy with it.  I am not just talking about the people directly affected by cutbacks, but commentators — the heads on the television who comment on these matters, sometimes with great erudition and sometimes not.We had a rather plaintive cry from the Minister for Finance, who described it as a call for patriotic action.  The action he got can be described as patriotic, but it was not exactly what he was expecting.  The level of uncertainty and fear engendered by the Government's failure to prepare people for what has happened regarding the changes on the economic landscape and the sense of a very sudden plummeting from boom to bust over a very short period have undermined people's sense of security in ways not recognised by the Government.  It was interesting to read the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, in yesterday's Evening Herald, stating that everything was all right when he left office in June and matters just went wrong after he left.  However, the Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, said a few days ago that we are battling the most severe economic and financial conditions for a century.  That certainly did not happen overnight.The truth is that the danger signs have been there for much longer, unemployment has been rising over a lengthy timespan and the property bubble has been bursting over a very lengthy period.  However, Fianna Fáil had an election to win and the former Taoiseach was able to predict suicide for anybody who threatened the pretty picture that had been painted by the Government about the economic situation.Now it is estimated that up to 200,000 home owners are likely to face negative equity by the end of 2009.  Currently, some 140,000 are already doing so, equivalent effectively to one in three, trapped houses worth less than the loans obtained to buy them.  Unemployment is expected to spiral to 8% in 2009 and it is interesting listening to Deputy Blaney in this regard.  Fianna Fáil loves to rewrite history, but the Government comprising Fine Gael and the Labour Party from 1994 onwards was very effective.  It oversaw the creation of approximately 1,000 jobs a week, as against almost the same now in terms of job losses.  This is the record the Government is now trying to defend.  The losses are largely in the construction sector and, as we look forward, even more construction jobs are likely to go, perhaps somewhere in the region of 150,000.  The effect this type of unemployment has on an economy and on individual families is staggering.We do not know how many repossessions are occurring or in the pipeline, but we know they have started to build up in relation to the number of individual families that cannot cope with the repayments and who were exploited by very unscrupulous mortgage companies who gave out money willy-nilly, regardless of people's ability to pay.  Some of us had hoped the budget would contain an economic stimulus package in recognition of all those construction workers and their capacity to be productive if they were put to work.  The Labour Party argued for a school building programme in every constituency.  For example, in my constituency, some schools are sub-standard in terms of health and safety and students are being accommodated in buildings that are at times dangerous.  A national insulation programme is another potential area for developing jobs and also ensuring the overall energy bill for the country may be reduced and brought under some type of control.We have argued for upskilling, education and training for those people who cannot get work.  Other countries have done this.  It is not as if we are arguing for some kind of idealistic and unrealistic approach.  Other countries have taken this approach because they recognise the capacity within their populations and know that leaving people to languish on the dole is not a good use of human potential, nor does it ensure taxes get paid.We appreciate there is a significant gap between Revenue and expenditure.  However, what action does the budget propose to deal with the issue of tax breaks for the wealthy, or with tax evasion?  Why is it the elderly and the young are the prime target for cutbacks?  It is difficult to understand this.  It appears that a deep cynicism and conservatism underpin this budget.The reform of the public service is an issue that has been raised many times.  If the Government wants to reform the public service, it should, with all due respects to Deputy McGuinness, start with the Ministers of State.  We have never seen so many people with so many titles using up——

I was a Minister of State, had devolved powers and introduced legislation.  I dealt, for example, with drug dealing in local authority estates, instituted a task force on Traveller accommodation and introduced a village renewal scheme.  I stand over my record.   However, we now have too many Ministers of State spread among the various Departments.  I instituted the homelessness initiative when only two and a half years in Government.  I can stand over my record.  If Ministers of State have devolved powers, they can be very productive.  However, the kind of pay off that has developed because we had a Government that threw money at everything is no longer justifiable, if it ever was.

#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	408	We are now seeing education as the target, with increased class sizes.  This is happening at a time when education should be reinforced if we are to be competitive at this time of global difficulties.  It is not that long ago, 40 years, since a Fianna Fáil Minister understood this.  Times were tougher then, but he understood we needed universal, well-resourced education.  When Donogh O'Malley introduced free second level education, he understood how valuable that investment was.It is interesting to note the attack now being made on the idea of universal entitlement.  Donogh O'Malley had no problem with universal entitlement because he understood that was the way forward.  Another Fianna Fáil Minister, Erskine Childers, introduced the GMS, which was based on the idea of universal entitlement to access to a GP.  This is the kind of thinking Fianna Fáil has jettisoned totally.  Instead, we now have a kind of ideological warfare directed at the principle of universal entitlements.In the health area we have seen a reintroduction of means testing in a most inefficient way in order to find a possible 5% of our population of over 70s who should not be getting free medical cards.  This results in an unnecessary and costly administrative apparatus, to what end?  We also now have a situation where we will have tax breaks with regard to private health insurance payments because of a court judgment on risk equalisation.  These two measures reinforce more than anything the justification to move to a universal health insurance system where everybody will pay health insurance according to his or her means, everybody will receive cover and we will have free access to primary care.  This will keep people out of hospital and enable us carry out the preventative work that is so valuable.I welcome the fact we are now having this ideological debate.  I remember, not long ago, Fukiama spoke about the end of history where somehow we all ended up in the middle so there was no longer to be any conflict.  Looking at recent events, sure as hell, there is conflict now.  Even the debate on the election in the US demonstrates there is an ideological battle going on.  I welcome the fact this is in the open again because it raises issues about the role of the state.We have had this debate here with regard to the bank bail-out, which has been rightly described as socialism for capitalists.  If the State is there to protect bankers, is it there to protect those who are even more worthy?  If we have reckless bankers who have over-lent to developers, why are they considered worthy of protection while mortgage payers are not?  What about mortgage payers who are unable to pay their mortgage of €1,500 or €2,000 per month?  Will they be given priority when the demand arises to recapitalise the banks that have been so reckless?What is the State's role in this regard?  Has it a role for example in taking back the telecommunications infrastructure that Eircom has not developed as it should have in the interest of ensuring Ireland is to the forefront of the industry?  We are the eighth worst country in the OECD with regard to broadband delivery.  This is a shameful record.  I remember a time when a Minister said we would be to the forefront of the telecommunications revolution.  That promise was never delivered.On the issue of fuel poverty, an increase of €2 in the allowance and provision for two extra weeks' payment is pathetic.  Some people facing the winter cannot afford to stay warm.  Thousands of people live in fuel poverty.  When I asked the Minister of State to tell me how many there were, he could not tell me.  The energy document published made all sorts of commitments on fuel poverty, but the Minister of State does not even know how many are living in fuel poverty.  We are dependent on organisations like Combat Poverty to tell us, but that organisation is to be done away with, or at the least emasculated so that it will no longer be able to do that kind of job effectively.We have a serious situation with regard to how we can support families and elderly people to keep warm this winter.  This is not being done and the budget has not delivered in this area.  I remind the Government that it is estimated that thousands of elderly people die each year as a result of not being able to keep warm in winter.  The health implications in this regard are significant.  We have one of the highest levels of this kind of death in Europe.  The extra €2 for an additional two works is, in effect, worth nothing, considering the price of coal, electricity and gas.  This is worrying and disappointing and people are justifiably angry.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	409	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the budget.  While the disadvantage of having the budget earlier this year is that the Government did not have a clue what it was talking about, the one advantage is that Members have the opportunity to debate it.  Traditionally this was the practice when budgets were published and announced in January, but since they moved to December this was no longer possible.  It is important that all Members get the opportunity to discuss and debate budgets.  It is important also that the Government is openminded with regard to suggestions from the Opposition.It should not come into this House knocking the Opposition and praising its own achievements while claiming that circumstances were very different when Fine Gael, the Labour Party and Democratic Left handed over the economy in 1997.  Circumstances were indeed different in 1997, a year in which 1,000 jobs were being created per week.  The country is at present losing a job every ten minutes.  The coalition that left office in 1997 was the first Government in many years to pass over the public finances in the black rather than the red.  At the end of 2006, the Taoiseach, as Minister for Finance, could count on €4 billion in the bank, whereas the projection for next year is a deficit of €12 billion.  That is some change given the brevity of the intervening period.  The EU believes the deficit will reach €14 billion by the end of 2010.  The Taoiseach admitted we will have to face another difficult budget and that the additional €5 billion deficit highlighted by the EU will have to be brought forward in next year's budget or in a mini-budget.In the past 12 months, 3,000 jobs have been lost in my constituency of Roscommon-South Leitrim and its surrounding towns.  For a small rural based economy, this is a huge blow.  I ask the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy McGuinness, to raise the issue of Elan Corporation with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  It was announced prior to the last election that 500 new jobs were to be created in a new development in Athlone.  Elan, which is the biggest employer in my constituency, now indicates that it will instead create these jobs in Dublin.  The company was originally founded in Athlone and its headquarters were based in the town for a number of years.  I hope the Government will get its act together before a final decision is made.  Athlone Institute of Technology put forward a proposal for a national bio-processing research facility to be based in the town but, because Wyeth flexed its muscles, this facility was ultimately established in Dublin, with the result that Elan doubts the Government's interest in supporting the midlands.  Why should Elan invest in the region when the Government is not prepared to support such a valuable research facility for Athlone?A number of contributors have pointed out that the cause of our financial predicament is not the international credit crunch, although this has given a fig leaf to a Government which put all its eggs into one basket in terms of the construction industry.  Yesterday in Brussels, the Minister for Finance put the blame on the European Central Bank for selling money too cheaply.  However, the housing bubble developed because the Government appointed Financial Regulator failed to police properly the doling out of money by banks.  The crazy situation arose whereby 110% mortgages were issued to people who now find themselves in serious financial difficulties.  The Department of Finance also turned a blind eye to this practice.  Furthermore, the Government actively encouraged the housing bubble through a variety of tax incentives.  Low interest rates were undoubtedly a contributing factor to the bubble but they also contributed to the expansion of our economy during the Celtic tiger years.Our mistake was to take our eyes of the ball in respect of competitiveness.  Ireland is now stuck in 22nd place in the World Economic Forum's competitiveness rankings.  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is supposed to be responsible for this area but the former Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, and his predecessor, Deputy Harney, failed to address the bottlenecks in our economy.  They should have lowered taxes and cut through the bureaucracy and red tape that surrounds business.  Unlike the majority of EU member states, Ireland has addressed none of these issues.Broadband is an issue with which every Deputy from a rural constituency must contend on a daily basis.  Why can we not get our act together on broadband?  At least four, if not five, State owned fibre optic cables are located within half a mile of Elan's front door, servicing the metropolitan area network, An Bord Gáis, Iarnród Éireann, the ESB and, perhaps, Bord na Móna, but they are not connected to each other.  Why can we not establish a semi-State agency with a commercial mandate to make use of these fibre optic cables, which are of no use to anyone at present, so that broadband reaches every part of the country?  That in itself would open up competition, not only in broadband but also in telephone services, and would help to address some of the competitiveness issues we currently face.  We are told that services will be the major growth area in the future but there will be no growth without access to broadband.My colleague, Deputy Bruton, spoke about the challenges that existed in advance of the budget.  He highlighted areas in which savings could be made, such as a recruitment ban on non-frontline services, a pay freeze across the public service, a better deal for the taxpayer from the bank guarantee scheme and a carbon windfall tax.  However, his proposals were ignored by the Government.  Other issues in the Government's control, such as opening access to the electricity grid to ensure competition, have not been addressed.  The energy and enthusiasm to deal with these issues are lacking.  The cost of utilities has gone through the roof in recent years, with repercussions for families as well as businesses.  Small businesses are facing serious problems in accessing capital, even where they have good ideas and sound business plans.From the point of view of Opposition Members, it is frustrating the Government failed to acknowledge its mistakes.  It has ensured the most vulnerable people in our society will foot the bill.  Those targeted are the elderly over 70, people who are sick and ill, those on social welfare payments and young people in our education system.The most vulnerable people in the disadvantaged areas in the farming community were the main focus of the attack.  It was hypocritical of the Taoiseach to state that cutbacks needed to be made but that he would not target the weak and the vulnerable.  The budget did exactly that and the impact has been on the weak and the vulnerable.The typical young family, with an income of €60,000, is paying an extra €3,200 annually as a result of the budget.  The cost of mortgage payments, utilities and services has increased and will increase over the coming months and it will be difficult for them to make repayments on mortgages.  Something needs to be done in that area to put a structure in place.  While some of the financial institutions are prepared to be reasonable and work with people to allow them to work themselves out of the situation, the vast majority are extremely ruthless and are looking to jump on people at the first available opportunity.  However, those who owe substantial amounts of money, such as developers, are treated with kid gloves.  The banks are like vultures over young families who are struggling to keep their heads above water, waiting for them to slip up so that they can penalise them.It was frustrating to see elderly people come to Leinster House the week after the budget.  People were there on Zimmer frames, in wheelchairs and with oxygen masks because of the fear that had been spread about the withdrawal of the medical card.  People came to rely on it.  Many on this side of the House were critical of the scheme when it was introduced, but it had been an effective measure in improving the health of elderly people since it was introduced.  What was sickening was that in the resolution, the savings made amount to €7 per week per elderly person.  In total, it amounts to one quarter of the cost of the electronic voting machines rotting in a field in County Meath as we speak, which are still costing us money.  Elderly people are asking themselves what will be next.  Will it be free travel?The universal provision in respect of children's allowance has been withdrawn, a mantra that has been broken.  This has not received the coverage it should but the principle has been broken in respect of the introduction of a means test.  While this only applies to those over 18 at present, we can be sure that this will be clawed back to apply to 16 year olds, 12 year olds and ten year olds, based on what the Taoiseach said this afternoon.Coming from a rural community, it is frustrating to see those in the poorest areas of land in the country being targeted.  Some €2,000 each will be taken off many farmers in the west.  In total, €34 million will be saved, a sum equal to half of what was squandered on electronic voting machines.  The Government does not care about the vulnerable elements in our society.  I refer to the cutback in the suckler cow scheme.  In fact, the money for that is ring-fenced and the changes in the budget have only drawn out that payment over a longer period of time to keep civil servants in jobs at the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Food.  Consistently, one can see that the budget was drafted by civil servants on the basis of ensuring their jobs are secured and that the most vulnerable are being penalised as a result.The HSE website has a blank page, with no information, on the over 70s medical card.  There is no information on the announcement made by the Taoiseach and the Cabinet last Tuesday week.  The fear persists and there is a lack of information being provided to elderly people on this issue.The immigration services budget for 2009 has been cut again.  What is frustrating is that this is a false economy.  At present, it takes eight years to process an asylum application.  It costs €1.4 million to process each application, based on social welfare and accommodation costs alone.  It makes more sense to speed up the process and give people a decision more quickly.  This would benefit the applicants and the taxpayer.  I cannot understand why these are not fast-tracked, instead of the situation where one in five posts in the immigration services that deal with asylum applications are vacant.I discussed the Refugee Appeals Tribunal with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform last week.  It costs €180 million per annum to process applications and appeals.  Of that, €11 million is spent on legal fees.  If we streamlined the process, significant savings could be made in the area, yet that issue was ignored.  The Minister of State, Deputy Lenihan, is turning out to be a comedian but he has seen his budget slashed by one quarter.  His budget is now less than €7 million and the administrative costs of his office are more than the money he can distribute.  The budget of the Minister of State is being cut at a time when racism is on the increase in this country and fear about an immigrant taking someone's job is increasing.  This is a time when we should spend more money in that area to deal with the concerns about racism and to promote greater integration, but we are pulling back in respect of such investment.The same applies to the budget for language teaching for those from outside the country in the Department of Education and Science.  At a time when we must ensure these people integrate in our schools and communities, to reduce the levels of resentment and racism, we are cutting back the funding available.  It is a false economy.The Minister of State, Deputy McGuinness, was frustrated when Members referred to curbing the number of Ministers of State.  The website of the Department of Education and Science refers to the Minister of State, Deputy Devins, as having responsibility for disability, five months after he was appointed as Minister of State with responsibility for science and technology.  He is the Minister of State with responsibility for science and technology and for disability issues.  If the Department of Education and Science does not know what is the responsibility of the Minister of State, how in God's name are members of the public to know?  Surely we need to streamline this area.

When I raised it previously on the Adjournment on 8 October the reply I was given was extremely unsatisfactory.  I got a four-page reply, only one paragraph of which dealt with Dell, while the question I raised specifically related to Dell.  The reply effectively stated that the IDA had been in contact with Dell and that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment had been kept informed.  Subsequently she met Dell management.  She has yet to say what was discussed.  We need to be told exactly what was discussed.  We understand from Dell that it is currently carrying out a global review of its operations with no specific date as to when it will be concluded.  It is imperative that the Tánaiste and Minister responsible, Deputy Coughlan, should become proactive on this issue.  I understand that she is involved in an IDA promotion tour in the United States.  I expect she will make a point of calling to see the head of Dell, Mr. Michael Dell, to discuss the future of the company in Limerick.During the past week Dell has laid off 450 to 500 contract temporary staff.  This has caused extreme anxiety for those people and their families.  Furthermore, it has created an enormous degree of uncertainty about the future of Dell and the job security of its 3,000 permanent staff.  The Government has a duty here and it should have been proactive in this respect.I raised this matter initially when I wrote to the Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, on 12 September asking him to intervene to deal with the multinational sector, including Dell, to see what could be done.  I did not receive a reply until 25 September, some two weeks later, indicating that the matter had been passed to the Tánaiste, Deputy Coughlan, from whom I have yet to receive a response.  This is grossly unacceptable to the workforce in Dell and to the people of Limerick.  There appears to be a veil of silence on the part of the Government about Dell.A statement must be made tonight on behalf of the Tánaiste confirming that the Government is doing absolutely everything to ensure that Dell continues to provide the employment in Limerick.  It contributes more than 4% of expenditure to the Irish economy and 5% to GDP.  The Government has let down Limerick and the employees of Dell.  We have had savage cuts, a lack of connectivity, the lost of the landing slots at Heathrow, a diminishing number of transatlantic flights and the imposition of a €10 charge on flights from Shannon.  No funding was provided in the budget, nor was any gateway funding provided, for the Limerick regeneration project.I call on the Tánaiste as a matter of urgency to establish a taskforce in Limerick to deal with the growing level of unemployment.  More than 9,000 people are on the live register in Limerick city alone, which represents an increase of 50% and is well above the national average.  Such a taskforce should deal with creating employment and retraining.  Integral to that, it should seek to provide funding for the Limerick regeneration project for the communities of Moyross, St. Mary's Park, Southill and Ballinacurra-Weston.  The overall message is that we need answers about what the Government is doing to ensure that Dell remains in Limerick and continues to be a fantastic employer for the more than 3,000 people it employs there.  The Government needs to provide incentives and to ensure that Dell remains in Limerick.

Naturally, employees in Dell and in the other companies to which I referred are the most concerned.  The announcement last week that up to 500 contract workers were being let go has heightened the level of concern.  An announcement was also made last week that Flextronics was letting 100 staff go.  It subsupplies Dell, which is its only customer.  Today, Banta let go 68 staff.  It subsupplies Dell, its only customer.  This is causing major concern.Contract workers in Dell are let go every year as production schedules are adjusted, usually on a quarterly basis, but more workers than usual have been let go this year.  This is not surprising, given the lack of confidence internationally.  I do not want to make little of contract workers being let go; they are suffering and so are their families.  My primary concern is the future of the Dell against the background of the worldwide review of its operations currently being undertaken, as announced by the company earlier this year.Dell has made an enormous contribution to Limerick and there is high confidence locally not only in its products but in its management both locally and internationally.  There is no similar confidence in the Tánaiste who is responsible as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, nor is there confidence in the IDA which has failed to give any assurances either to the local community or to the workers in Limerick.The position is difficult for everyone and scaremongering will only make things worse.  In the Minister of State's reply, I hope he can begin to restore some of the confidence that his senior Minister, the Tánaiste, has failed to restore up to now.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	417	I sincerely thank Deputy Noonan for sharing his time and allowing me to put on record my position on this issue which I have raised previously.As the Minister of State is aware, there is serious concern about Dell.  It employs more than 3,000 permanent full-time workers, as well as temporary workers who are taken on and let go in the plant.  The number of temporary workers laid off last week is far in excess of the norm in terms of the seasonal layoffs in Dell.  As Deputy Noonan said, both Flextronics and Banta, which supply Dell, have announced that they are also letting people go.  Many other companies in the region are dependent on Dell, either feeding into or out of the factory, as well as the wider economy in terms of the spending power of people employed in the company.We know that Dell is undertaking a worldwide re-evaluation of its work.  It is vital that the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, should signify on an ongoing basis to Dell and to its management the Government's full support for keeping it in Ireland, particularly in Limerick and in the midwest.  People throughout the world will be fighting the battle to keep Dell jobs in various places in the United States and elsewhere.  We must show that the Government is fully committed to addressing the issues under consideration.  As we understand it, decisions have not yet been made.  Therefore, there is time.  It is vital that the Government should put its full weight and force behind protecting those jobs.There is a great level of insecurity in the region because of the recent announcements, the situation at Shannon Airport, as outlined by Deputy O'Donnell, and a general perception that what was a very successful region is now under threat in a wide variety of ways.  However, the linchpin in all of this is the Dell company, which has been such an excellent employer in the region.  The region has also given to Dell.  It is a highly efficient and highly cost effective plant.  Through the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment the company must get the message that it is vital it remains in the region.  I urge the Minister of State to impress upon the Tánaiste how vital it is for her to keep up ongoing contact with the company.  I agree she should take the opportunity when she is in the United States to approach the company directly again.  American companies are very impressed by governments and their commitments.  They are used to dealing with politicians on employment issues.  It is vital for the Government to underpin the company and save the rest of the jobs in Dell and in the other companies that are so dependent on Dell.  It will have major repercussions if that company is allowed to go.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	418	This issue has been raised on a number of occasions and I thank the Deputies for raising it tonight.  Obviously I understand its sensitivity with three local Deputies coming to the House to raise the issue of Dell's workforce in Limerick.  The Government acknowledges the importance of Dell.  IDA Ireland is in discussion with Dell on a regular basis.  As I said on 8 October, discussions between IDA Ireland and any client company remain confidential.  Everybody is aware that there is a global downturn and there are major challenges in the context of the world economy and our present situation.  Dell, like any other company, is carrying out a review of its global operations.  That is well known and has been broadly discussed.  We are not trying to scaremonger.  We are trying to ensure every support possible is made available to ensure that Dell regards Limerick as a strategic location.IDA Ireland has been very successful in previous times.  I do not want to rehearse speeches in recent times on investment in Limerick.  Deputy O'Donnell referred to the establishment of a task force etc.  We acknowledge the concerns of the people working there.  We also acknowledge that temporary contract staff have been let go.  That is a cyclical matter that happens from time to time.  It is never easy for those who have been informed that their contracts of employment have been terminated.  Dell has been a very successful employer and is a major contributor not only to the Limerick economy but also to Ireland Inc.  I acknowledge the contribution Dell has made over many years at its plant in Limerick.  Reference was made to Flextronics and Banta and there are major spin-offs from Dell.  I assure the Deputies that the Government with IDA Ireland as a link is in discussions with Dell.  However, those discussions must remain confidential as I am sure those on the opposite side of the House will understand.Deputy O'Donnell and others raised the matter previously.  The Tánaiste met management and the Deputies will understand that those discussions must remain confidential.  However, as the Tánaiste would have outlined, the Government will ensure that every support possible will be made available to Dell.  Equally we must ensure that Ireland is seen as a competitive location.  Major companies consistently locate here.  IDA Ireland is very successful in bringing international companies here.  Yesterday Marriott announced 220 jobs to be created here.  Ireland is still competitive.  We must put our best foot forward in ensuring that companies located here at present remain here.  Importantly those considering Ireland as a location in which to invest should receive the full supports of IDA Ireland, the Government and everybody involved.I responded on this issue on 8 October to Deputy O'Donnell.  I do not want to give the same reply as he has already said that was inadequate.

I have not read from my script.  I am speaking not only as Minister of State with responsibility for labour affairs, but also as a Deputy in whose constituency companies have carried out worldwide reviews.  I understand the concerns of the local Deputies, the Dell employees and others employed in companies supplying to or being supplied from Dell.  I wish to place on the record that the Government is very conscious of the importance of Dell in Limerick and nationally.  We will do everything possible.  IDA Ireland is in consistent contact with the company.  The Tánaiste has already met the management as has been requested from the other side of the House.  It is an indication of the importance we place on this particular company.  When any companies are carrying out worldwide reviews, IDA Ireland always gets involved to mitigate the impact on Ireland.Deputy referred to other competing factors.  Dell has plants throughout the world and a global review is being carried out.  We should allow the company to carry out its review.  We will work with the company to highlight, as the Deputies have done tonight, the importance of Dell to its 3,000 full-time employees and the seasonal temporary contract workers in Limerick.  We need to allow the space and time necessary while at the same time assuring the elected representatives from Limerick that the Government and IDA Ireland are doing everything possible to mitigate any decisions that might have a negative impact on Dell in Limerick.
#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG	unknown-#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG-party	unknown-#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG-dob	unknown-#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	421	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for affording me time to speak on this issue.  The issue of extraordinary rendition has been very contentious and controversial here in the past two to three years.  The Irish Human Rights Commission, under the presidency of former Senator Maurice Manning, produced a very detailed report and representatives of the commission appeared before the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs to discuss the issues at which time we had a very lively debate.International air law has a codified framework in the Convention on International Civil Aviation, commonly known as the Chicago Convention, which was signed in December 1944.  Article 1 states that each state has complete and exclusive sovereignty over the airspace above its territory — in other words the land area and the territorial waters.  While recent reports seem to indicate that there has been a change in Government policy, on examination I cannot see how the policy has changed.  Fine Gael, as I am aware is the Government, is totally opposed to the process of extraordinary rendition.  We also want to see the facility at Guantanamo Bay closed, as I am aware the Government also does.  These reports state the Government has established a Cabinet committee on aspects of human rights.  I understand that this committee was set up a number of months ago and perhaps the Minister might clarify that for me.  It was certainly announced some time ago, but may not be set up yet.  The Minister's predecessor mentioned it in some debate.The report suggests that the Cabinet committee will examine and strengthen legal provisions to ensure the Garda and airport authorities have adequate legal powers for search and inspection of aircraft.  This may involve strengthening the provisions of the Air Navigation and Transport Acts.  I want the Minister to outline the Government policy in this regard.  What changes, if any, have taken place?  If no changes have occurred, what changes does the Government propose to take in light of this article being published?  My concern is that the article has no basis and this great heralded change of direction is inaccurate.  Perhaps the Minister will enlighten me.  I will give him the benefit of the doubt until he does.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	422	I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  Given how often it has been raised in the House and Seanad Éireann, both I and my predecessors have set out the Government's policy unequivocally, that is, we have always been totally opposed to the practice of extraordinary rendition anywhere.  The policy has not changed.The House will be aware that, last week, the Government decided to establish a Cabinet committee on aspects of international human rights.  Among the areas to be considered by the committee is the implementation of our policy on extraordinary rendition.  Already, the committee has reviewed the programme for Government commitments in this regard.I have agreed to make early contact with the new US Administration to seek a clear statement of intent to the effect that, inter alia, extraordinary rendition would cease and not resume during the new President’s term of office.  Commitments are also being sought in regard to the closure of Guantanamo Bay and to the prohibition of intensive interrogation techniques, such as water-boarding, that are considered internationally to constitute torture.  These techniques are in clear violation of international human rights and humanitarian law.The closure of Guantanamo Bay has been called for by the Government consistently and from an early point and is now the agreed position of the EU.  The ambassador in Washington will follow up on these issues as a matter of urgency, in the first instance with the transition team of the new US Administration.  There has also been contact at senior official level with the US Embassy here.  In light of the stated positions of both presidential candidates, I am hopeful that we will receive an early and positive response.The Government has received clear and specific assurances at the highest level from the US authorities that such prisoners have not been transferred through Irish territory, nor would they be, without our permission.  We have no reason to doubt the existing assurances in respect of the use of Irish airports.  The fact remains that none of the various investigations into allegations of extraordinary rendition has revealed any evidence or even resulted in a specific allegation that any person has been subjected to extraordinary rendition through Ireland.  There is no new information or allegation linking Irish airports to extraordinary rendition.  I stress that what we are looking for now is a clear overall policy statement that would commit the new Administration to ending the practice of extraordinary rendition wherever it may be occurring.With a view to strengthening as necessary the legislative provisions, the Cabinet committee on aspects of international human rights is to review the statutory powers available to the civil and police authorities regarding the search and inspection of aircraft in the context of the obligations on the State under the Chicago convention.  Relevant legislation includes the Air Navigation and Transport Act 1988, the amending Act of 1998 and sections 4 and 6 of the Criminal Law Act 1997.  Garda powers of search can be deployed only where there are reasonable grounds for their use capable of withstanding scrutiny in a court of law.  A number of investigations have taken place on foot of complaints, but have not produced any evidence of illegal activity.On the wider question of the role of the Garda Síochána in the protection of human rights, I wish to highlight the centrality of human rights compliance to policing in Ireland.  In accordance with the Garda Síochána Act 2005, there is a duty on the Garda to protect life and vindicate the human rights of the individual.  To this end, there is a comprehensive programme for human rights training within An Garda Síochána.  New members of the Garda make a declaration of the need to have regard for human rights in carrying out policing duties.I assure the House that, on the basis of information supplied to me by my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the commitment in the programme for Government on training in the human rights area is being fully implemented.  There is regular communication between the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and the Garda Commissioner.  The Commissioner has assured the Minister that sufficient resources are available to implement the commitment.  In addition, the Garda remains ready to take whatever action is open to it under the law in respect of any allegations of extraordinary rendition.I repeat the total opposition of the Government to the practice of extraordinary rendition wherever it occurs and our hope that the new US Administration will address it as a matter of utmost priority.
#DeirdreClune	unknown-#DeirdreClune-party	unknown-#DeirdreClune-dob	unknown-#DeirdreClune-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	423	I welcome the opportunity to raise this issue again.  The Minister is familiar with the Cork docklands, which lie to the east of the city.  The area has been recognised by both local authorities in the Cork region as having the potential for development.  For more than six years, the authorities have promoted it and succeeded in gaining priority recognition for it in the national development plan, the spatial strategy and the Government's submission on the EU regional aid map from 2007 to 2013.That 95% of the area is privately owned makes it different from the Dublin docklands.  A commitment to physical infrastructure is necessary to trigger private investment.  Cork has been designated as one of nine gateways under the national development plan.  The gateway innovation fund could be used to provide funding for infrastructure in the docklands area.  While gateway funding has been postponed until 2010, I request a Government commitment to funding infrastructure in the area, in particular the eastern gateway bridge proposed by Cork city and county councils.  The proposal has been submitted to the Department of Finance.  Of the major planning applications in the pipeline, some are being examined while others have been granted permission.  A Government commitment would be a small step in the right direction.The national development plan states:The key challenge for Cork over the period to 2013 will be to significantly accelerate its rate of development and population growth, focusing particularly on the potential of its central area.  The Docklands, in particular, has the capacity to accommodate an additional population of at least 15,000 people and significant commercial floor space but investment in physical infrastructure to trigger subsequent private investment is necessary.This makes my case for me.The docklands forum was established and has reported to the Government, but we are awaiting the report's publication.  I recognise the difficulty regarding sites as outlined by the Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement.  While I am sure that it applies in the case of all docklands, the issue is of particular concern in respect of the Cork docklands.  I speak for many people in the area when asking that a commitment be given to provide funding for an eastern gateway bridge.  This request comes from the city council, the Cork Chamber of Commerce, business interests and everyone interested in seeing the area developed, as it is Cork's future.  The docklands' significant potential has been well documented and gateway funding would trigger private development.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	424	I thank Deputy Clune for raising this issue on the Adjournment.  It is widely acknowledged that the Cork docklands project advanced by Cork City Council is potentially of major significance to the city itself.  From the outset, the Government has also viewed it as a project of national significance.  The council is to be congratulated on articulating an ambitious vision for the regeneration of the docklands, establishing a detailed local planning framework and undertaking various infrastructural and economic studies to support the implementation of this vision.With an area of more than 160 hectares contiguous to the city centre, the docklands offer the prospect of developing a modern, mixed use city quarter.  Current plans anticipate that, over a 20-year period, the population of the docklands could increase from 500 to 22,000.  This would entail the provision of more than 9,500 residential units, including almost 2,000 social and affordable units.  It is estimated that the regeneration project has the potential to sustain approximately 27,000 new jobs in retail and financial services, industry, ICT, higher level educational institutions and leisure and cultural activities.A development of this scale is the equivalent of placing a large town in a city centre location and would give Cork further critical mass in terms of its potential to act as a counterpoint to Dublin.  For this reason, the regeneration of the docklands is recognised as a priority project under the national development plan and as an important element in meeting the overall objectives of the national spatial strategy regarding balanced regional development.  In recognition of the potential significance of the Cork docklands project, the Government in December 2007 established the Cork Docklands Development Forum comprising representatives of relevant Departments, State agencies, local authorities and business and community interests.  The forum was asked to prioritise the early consideration by, and response of, public bodies to the docklands area plan and to promote the effective co-ordination and delivery of public investment in the docklands.The forum report submitted in early July 2008 sets out a policy and economic rationale for the regeneration project, identifies key economic and other drivers essential to the realisation of the vision for the area, identifies and costs critical public infrastructure required over the lifetime of the project, to 2027 at least, to underpin subsequent private investment, considered significant constraints and barriers to the intended redevelopment, considered how this redevelopment might be incentivised and made recommendations regarding institutional arrangements to bring the project forward.The forum report envisages significant investment in public infrastructure, including the proposed eastern gateway bridge in opening up the south docklands for development as well as possible support for the relocation of port and other activities.  While in the overall context of budgetary decisions, allocations under the gateway innovation fund have been deferred for 2009, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is conscious of the future strategic potential of the fund to drive and facilitate development and build on the local momentum in the gateways.  Also, a new tax incentive scheme to facilitate the relocation of Seveso listed industrial facilities that hinder the regeneration of docklands in urban areas was announced in the budget, a significant response to the forum submission and submissions from others.I wish also to inform the Deputy that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has discussed the matter with the Minister for Finance who is very much engaged with this project, understands the rationale behind it and is supportive of it.  He is considering ways he can support the project into the future.

Is the allocation for 2009 or 2010?  I understood the allocation was to be made available in 2010.

This charge of €900 for 2008/09 academic year does not represent the total allocation made towards student services from institutions' budgets.As announced in the budget, the third level funding allocations take account of expected increases in the student services charge in 2009.  In this regard, the Government is willing to accept increases of up to €1,500 (from €900) for the 2009/10 academic year in individual higher education institutions.   Accordingly the increase in the charge would have the effect of bringing the amount contributed by students more into line with the cost of providing services.All students who are eligible for means tested student support have the student charge paid on their behalf by the Local Authorities or the Vocational Education Committees, in addition to any maintenance grant and tuition fee grant they are entitled to. This represents approx. 37% of the student cohort.The Higher Education Authority (HEA) issued a Framework of Good Practice for the Provision of Student Services to the publicly funded Higher Education institutions in 1998. Particular reference was made to the principles of transparency and accountability. The Framework consists of guidelines to establish an appropriate system of consultation with students in the allocation of funding from the charge and in the determination of student services to be funded from this source. The HEA has periodically written to all institutions to remind them of their function in relation to the student services charge and requesting confirmation that correct procedures are in place, in accordance with the Framework of Good Practice.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	428	Under the terms of the Indemnity Agreement reached with the Religious Congregations on 5th June 2002, the Congregations agreed to make a contribution of €128 million towards the cost of the Redress Scheme. This sum was broken down as follows:Property Transfers €76.86mCash Contribution €41.14mProvision of Counselling Services €10mIn actual terms, whilst the overall figure of €128 million has not altered, the form in which it has or is to be transferred to the State has altered somewhat in terms of the property and cash contributions. This is because the Indemnity Agreement allows for cash to be substituted for property. The composition of the €128 million has changed to the following:Property Transfers €66mCash Contribution €52mProvision of Counselling Services €10mI can confirm that the full cash contribution of €52m has been received, including that which was accepted in lieu of properties. My Department has also received confirmation that the contributing congregations have provided counselling services to the value of €10m.As a result of the Indemnity Agreement, my Department agreed in principle with CORI that a total of 64 properties would be accepted, subject to good and marketable title and agreed valuations. Valuations of the individual properties were fully agreed and fixed at 2002 values.It is regrettable that the process for the final transfer of some of these properties is not yet completed. However, in the vast majority of the properties, good and marketable title has been fully established or the properties have been physically transferred to and are in possession of the State or 3rd Parties but there are some legal formalities to be finalised. In a small number of cases, consideration may have to be given to accepting an alternative property or cash where good and marketable title cannot be established. This has recently occurred in the case of one of the 64 properties where my Department accepted cash in lieu of a property where good and marketable title could not be established. Properties to the value of €26.79m have been fully transferred and a further €7.475m worth of properties have been handed over where legal arrangements are almost finalised. This leaves a balance of properties valued at €31.735 where the legal transfer remains to be completed.  In the case of all of these latter properties, with the exception of two, the properties are in use or are available for use by the transferee.Every effort will continue to be made by officials of my Department through the State's legal representatives along with the legal representatives of the congregations and by direct contact with the interested parties until all outstanding issues are finalised.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	429	The Deputy has introduced the issue of comparability of class size with the position in schools throughout Europe.I have to say to the House that given the momentous challenges that countries right across Europe are facing to cope with economic recession, and in the case of some countries to even maintain financial solvency, raising the matter of educational comparisons misses the point.The first priority for Governments throughout the world at present is to ensure economic survival. Ensuring that public services like education can be maintained at a reasonable level is but a subset of that greater priority of securing national solvency. Without economic and fiscal stability is axiomatic that public services like education will suffer.The Government is about the business of securing Ireland's future. It is the number one priority. In the budget we tried to shelter education services as best we could. Some changes to how schools are to be staffed from next September were unavoidable.I do not accept the scaremongering claims of the opposition parties or some of the more extreme comments from within the education sector in relation to the impact of the staffing changes.For example it is simply not credible to claim that by staffing primary schools on the same basis as they were staffed just a year ago that we are prejudicing educational outcomes to any great extent. Yes of course it would be desirable to make improvements as originally intended let alone have to take a step back. However this is a changed world and it would be sheer folly to allow the overall number of teachers spiral upwards as if nothing had changed. I have faith in the quality of our teachers and our schools and in their capacity to deliver as well from September 2009 as they did just over a year ago from a similar level staffing and class size position.We need to come through this difficult period and then and only then can we look at what further improvements we can make in how we staff schools and reduce class sizes.As the full extent of the global crisis seeps into public consciousness I believe that parents will accept that taking difficult decisions now in order to secure future economic prosperity and secure employment for them and ultimately their children is the first imperative of Government and that parents will see through some of the extreme commentary on these measures.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	430	I propose to take Questions Nos. 110 and 111 together.As the Deputies will be aware, a significant number of sections of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act, 2004 have been commenced, principally those establishing the National Council for Special Education and those promoting an inclusive approach to the education of children with special educational needs. Specifically, the following sections have been commenced — 1, 2, 14(1)(a), 14(1)(c), 14(2) to  14(4), 19 to 37, 40 to 53.The sections of the EPSEN Act that have been deferred are those mainly concerned with the assessment of need process, preparation and review of individual education plans and the associated appeals provisions in relation to these areas. A small number of sections refer to interaction between the NCSE and the health services. The full list of deferred sections is — 3 to 13, 14(1)(b), 14(1)(d), 14(1)(e), 14(1)(f), 15 to 18, 38 and 39.As has been outlined previously, it is not possible to commence the EPSEN Act incrementally by age cohort, therefore the provisions of the Act especially regarding assessments and individual education plans will have to be commenced for all children at the same time.  This means that the necessary training arrangements, personnel and systems have to be in place at the time of commencement.As required under the Act, the NCSE provided a report making recommendations regarding the implementation of EPSEN which suggested additional investment over a period of years of up to €235m per annum across the education and health sectors. Having considered the NCSE report, and consulted with the education partners, the Department of Health and Children and the HSE, my Department identified a range of options for the implementation of EPSEN.  It is not possible to give exact figures regarding cost as the specific amount of money required to support implementation would depend on the options chosen and the timeframe for the implementation of these options. However, my Department's opinion is that the level of investment required would be greater than that envisaged in the NCSE report.In the light of the current financial circumstances, it is therefore not possible to proceed with implementation in 2010 as originally envisaged. However, the Government will keep the matter under review and is committed to the full implementation of EPSEN at the earliest possible date.I want to take this opportunity to emphasise that children with special educational needs will continue to receive an education appropriate to their needs. I intend to build on the progress that has been achieved in recent years which has seen a huge increase in resources for special needs. The NCSE will continue to support schools, parents and children and teachers and special needs assistants will continue to be deployed to schools to meet children's needs.Furthermore, as announced on Budget day, an additional €20m has been provided — €10m for education services and €10m for health services — to strengthen and enhance services and continue the preparation for the full implementation of the Act at a later date.The additional funding being allocated to my Department will provide for an expansion of the National Educational Psychological service so that all schools in the country will be covered by the service. The additional funding available to NEPS, which represents a 33% increase over the 2008 allocation, will facilitate the recruitment of up to 50 further psychologists. It is envisaged that this will bring the number of NEPS psychologists by the end of 2009 above the proposed 200 incorporated in the Programme for Government.This investment will significantly enhance the capacity of our educational psychologists to directly support schools in the development and delivery of appropriate interventions for children with special educational needs.Additional funding is also being provided to the National Council for Special Education in 2009 to increase the Council's capacity in the move towards the full implementation of EPSEN. The additional funding will enable the Council to continue to improve, plan and co-ordinate the delivery of services for children with special needs.I have also provided for further investment in teacher training in this area.  This will ensure that teachers are provided with opportunities to access continuing professional development so that the learning and teaching needs of all pupils with Special Educational Needs continue to be met. The provision of high quality training ensures that pupils learning opportunities are enriched and learning outcomes are optimised.An integrated approach is being adopted by the education and health sectors to target these additional resources to the areas of greatest need. Progress in both sectors will be kept under review by the Office for Disability & Mental Health and the Cross-Sectoral Team during 2009.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	431	The school transport scheme, which is operated by Bus Éireann on my Department's behalf, is primarily a rural based scheme which facilitates the transportation of over 134,000 children to primary and post-primary schools each day. The Deputy will be aware that the School Transport system is a very significant operation involving about 42 million journeys of over 82 million kilometres on 6,000 routes every school year.The allocation for school transport in 2008 is €175.2 million and this has been increased by 12% to €196 million in 2009, which given the difficult fiscal conditions shows the commitment of the Government to maintaining the scheme. In fact, since 1997 the allocation to school transport services has increased almost threefold.I would point out that the charges for school transport had not been increased from 1998 until the third school term in the 2007/2008 school year despite the escalating costs of the service.  A further increase was put in place at the start of the 2008/2009 school year.The Budget 2009 increase in charges applies from the start of the 2009/2010 school year.In the overall context and in order to minimise the overall effects, these charge increases have been confined to the 55,000 eligible post primary and children availing of concessionary transport. Charges will continue to be waived in the case of eligible post-primary children where the family is in possession of a valid medical card or over a further 19,000 children. Eligible children attending primary schools and children with special needs or about 54,000 children will still travel free.  A maximum family rate will also be applied.The total contribution from parents will still only represent about 7% of the overall allocation for school transport in 2009.This scheme aims to provide comfortable and safe transport for children travelling to and from school. Measures to ensure the highest standards in this regard include:In recent years the phasing out of the 3 for 2 seating arrangement on both primary and post-primary services, providing all children with an adult seat each.The addition of a considerable number of vehicles to address capacity shortfalls arising from the decision to provide each child with an individual seat and the equipping of all dedicated school buses.Inspection by Bus Éireann using an independent agency to satisfy itself that all buses entering the School Transport Scheme have seat belts fitted to an appropriate standard, agreed with the Department of Transport.In addition, Bus Éireann has put in place a random vehicle inspection process conducted by a leading independent external expert in this field.In the light of these important supportive factors for parents in planning day to day travel arrangements for their children it is my hope that the numbers utilising the scheme will be maintained at current levels.My Department has no evidence to suggest that parents of children currently availing of school transport are planning alternative modes of transport. In addition, a number of parents continue to apply for concessionary transport annually. My officials will continue to monitor this aspect with Bus Éireann over the coming months.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	432	Notwithstanding the increase of €302 million in the education budget for 2009, which is a real achievement in the current economic climate, a number of tough and difficult decisions had to be taken.  These decisions were outlined in the Budget day announcements and included the abolition of a number of specialist grants for primary and post-primary schools.In the case of primary schools, the separate cookery grant, resource grant for language support teachers and equipment grant for resource teachers are being abolished. The total value of these grants was €2m.In the case of post-primary schools, a number of separate grant payments to second-level schools are also being abolished. These are grants for Choirs and Orchestras, Home Economics, Physics and Chemistry, Junior Certificate Schools Programme, Leaving Certificate Applied, LCVP and Transition Year. These grants helped to support the provision of these subjects and programmes in the schools. The total saving will be €5.35m.A further €6.3m is being saved at primary and post primary level by a reduction in capitation funding for Travellers and withdrawal of certain capitation funding from schools that are not in the DEIS programme but had continued to receive top-up funding originally provided under previous disadvantage initiatives.I have provided in a table for the Deputy the amount these grants cost over the last 3 years.We are committed to investing in education but we have to invest at a level that is consistent with what we can afford and what is sustainable at the moment given economic circumstances.Overall some €20 million has been allocated to improving the capitation and ancillary funding for schools.In relation to day to day funding for schools I prioritised the funding for primary schools in particular recognising the submissions made by the management bodies. The Education Budget for 2009 has provided for improvements to the overall level of day to day funding for primary schools which will see funding increase from €167 million in 2008 to almost €190 million in 2009.While I appreciate that the abolition of a range of grants will make it a challenging year ahead most of the available funding was used to increase the standard rate of capitation grant at primary level to €200 per pupil. The increases in the enhanced rates for special needs pupils in special classes and special schools brings the top rate up to almost €1,000 per pupil.I clearly will want to improve funding as soon as circumstances permit and I am anxious to make the capitation grant mechanism the single funding channel rather than have a plethora of grant schemes, thereby giving schools more flexibility and discretion on how to target funding to the school's own priorities based on its knowledge and understanding of the needs of the students it serves. There is the added advantage that administration and accounting can be reduced for schools and my Department.The Budget measures will help ensure that Ireland is well positioned to benefit when the global economy improves and we can start to build again on the significant achievements of recent years and do so in a manner consistent with overall prudent management of the Irish economy.GrantsExpenditure in 2006Expenditure in 2007Expenditure in 2008€ 000€ 000€ 000School Books Primary5,4946,3246,520 est

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	433	The net pay allocation for teachers' salaries and pensions will increase by almost €300m in 2009 as a result of a combination of pay increases, increased pension costs, increased enrolment in 2009 and the full year costs of the salaries of extra teachers appointed in September 2008.An additional €40m has also been allocated for the continued growth in the provision for special needs in primary and post-primary schools providing for the full year costs of additional Special Needs Assistants in the system this September as well as provision for additional posts next September.In view of the worsening economic position the Government had to make extremely difficult decisions and choices across all public services including education. As pay constitutes the bulk of current expenditure on education, measures impacting on the teaching resources available to schools were necessary. These measures included a regression in the staffing schedule at 1st and 2nd level and the implementation of restrictions relating to substitution cover and the employment of Language Support Teachers.It should be noted Education was one of only three Government Departments to have increased funding in 2009 which reflects the Government's continued prioritisation of education. The 2009 Education allocation of €9.6 billion is over treble what it was in 1997.  We are committed to investing in education but we have to invest at a level that is consistent with what we can afford and what is sustainable at the moment given the economic circumstances.Decisions relating to the 2010 Budget will be made in the context of available resources at the time.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	434	I understand that the Deputy is referring to a primary school in this instance.  I regard comments being made from whatever quarter about schools turning away pupils as premature, alarmist and irresponsible.  I can only conclude that such statements are motivated by a desire to create pressure for a change in relation to the decisions the Government had to take in relation to school staffing. I regard it as reprehensible that any school might seek to use children as pawns no matter how strongly they feel about the decisions that we have made.Ultimately it is a matter for each school's Board of Management to have an enrolment policy and to then operate that policy in a fair and consistent manner having regard to the overall physical space capacity of a school.  My Department has a responsibility to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.  That is no more than a normal feature of the enrolment process in any community.My Department will continue to ensure that those schools with the greatest increase in pupil numbers will still qualify for developing school status thus enabling them to get their increased staffing in September 2009 — a year in advance of other schools.The Forward Planning Section of my Department is currently in the process of identifying the areas where significant additional school accommodation will be required at primary and post-primary level. Factors under consideration include population growth, demographic trends, current and projected enrolments, recent and planned housing developments and capacity of existing schools to meet demand for places. Having considered these factors decisions will be taken on the means by which emerging needs will be met within an area.The demand for junior infant places in the area in question will be considered within this context.What is not acceptable is that any school authority would in the coming year alter its approach to enrolment simply because it wants to pressurise the government or to give support to a campaign being conducted by a teacher union.As I pointed out in the House last week the changes to the classroom staffing of primary schools reverts schools to the position that applied just over one school year ago. Schools are given teaching resources commensurate with their enrolment and under the staffing schedule schools with like enrolments are treated in the same way.In terms of accommodating pupils I believe it is totally reasonable to expect schools to operate from next September no less favourably than they did in 2006/2007.Any school acting dishonourably in this regard must ultimately answer to its local community and to the parents and children in that community in particular.In terms of the staffing implications at individual school level, schools are currently returning data to my Department in relation to their enrolment as of 30 September. My Department has commenced processing this data although all schools have not yet made their returns. The allocation processes including notification to schools will commence early in the New Year.  The allocation process includes appellate mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules. The final allocation to a school is also a function of the operation of the redeployment panels which provide for the retention of a teacher in an existing school if a new post is not available within the agreed terms of the scheme.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	435	The budget measures will mean that the level of language support will be reduced from a maximum of six extra teachers per school to a maximum of two teachers per school, as was the case before 2007.However, the ongoing requirement for current levels of language support teachers in schools should also start to reduce in line with lower levels of immigration and in line with improvements in the levels of proficiency of those pupils for whom this resource has been available.Nonetheless, schools that require language support will still be entitled to get it.  We still envisage having over 1,400 language support teachers in our schools in September 2009 and up to about 500 other teachers in part-time posts.  By any standards this is a very significant resource and the challenge will be to ensure that it is used to maximum effect.As I announced on budget day we will also provide for some alleviation for the position of those schools where there is a significant concentration of newcomer pupils as a proportion of the overall enrolment.  This will be done on a case by case basis.The allocation process for language support teachers is an annual one and existing provision is not rolled over automatically.  Schools will be applying afresh in the spring and early summer of 2009 for the 2009/10 school year, based on their assessment of the prospective needs of existing pupils and any new pupils they are enrolling.Moreover, OECD research in this field (PISA 2006) shows that Ireland is the OECD country with the highest distribution of newcomers across schools meaning that schools with higher concentrations of newcomer children are relatively unusual.  ESRI data also shows that only a small percentage of schools have high concentrations of newcomer children.I realise that standards are not simply achieved by supplying teaching resources and that the quality of the supports that the child receives and the inclusive atmosphere cultivated in schools are important factors influencing the quality of learning achieved by migrant children. My Department recognises that we must monitor and review the educational experiences that are provided to migrant students so that we can improve the quality and effectiveness of our provision. The Department is undertaking a range of research to consider the question of integration in schools and how best to deploy our resources to ensure that all the children in our schools can benefit from learning in an intercultural Ireland.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	436	I can inform the Deputy that all primary and post primary schools have access to psychological assessments either directly through my Department's National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) or through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA) which is administered by NEPS.NEPS does not keep waiting lists for assessments of children but in common with other psychological services encourages a staged assessment process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention, in consultation with their assigned NEPS psychologist. Only if there is a failure to make reasonable progress in spite of the school's best efforts, will a child be referred for individual psychological assessment. This system allows the psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.The introduction of the General Allocation model for primary schools in 2005/06 means that children with high incidence special needs now longer have to wait for an individual assessment before they can get access to extra support.Children who manifest very special or urgent needs in school and who have not been previously assessed by a psychologist and are brought to the attention of a NEPS psychologist by the Principal teacher will usually be assessed by the psychologist within that school term. Normally, principals of schools prioritise those children in need of psychological assessment in consultation with the assigned psychologist.In the case of schools that do not currently have dedicated NEPS psychologists assigned to them, as I already mentioned, such schools have access to psychological assessments through the SCPA. Under this Scheme, schools can commission assessments from a member of the panel of private practitioners approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the fees directly to the psychologist concerned.Should school authorities have specific difficulties with regard any of the foregoing I would suggest that they should contact the local NEPS Regional Director, contact details for whom are also available on my Department's website.I can also inform the Deputy that there are currently 151 psychologists employed in my Department's NEPS service, including some 21 psychologists who have been appointed since the end of June last. Furthermore 7 individuals have agreed start dates with the service between now and early January 2009 and an additional 6 are currently considering offers of employment or undergoing the requisite Garda vetting process.Additionally I was pleased to announce recently, in the context of Budget 2009, an increase in the funding available to NEPS with which it is envisaged that up to 50 further psychologists can be appointed. Recruitment of these psychologists will begin early in the new-year from the existing panel of qualified personnel, until its depletion, and discussions commence between my Department and the Public Appointments Service in relation to the establishment of a new panel in this regard.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	437	This Government's continued prioritisation of education over the last 11 years is evidenced from our investment in 2009 of €9.6 billion — over treble what it was in 1997.The increase of €302m in the Education budget for 2009 is therefore a real achievement in the current economic climate. Education is one of only three Government Departments to have increased funding in 2009.The budget for education is showing an increase of just over 3% overall, while the 2.6% increase in current expenditure sets the growth in expenditure for education in 2009 second only to Social Welfare. The commitment in relation to doubling the capitation grant to primary schools can only be looked at and considered in the context of the overall economic and budgetary position.I am aware of the funding pressures on schools and  I fully recognise the contribution of parents fund-raising to support their local school. In relation to day to day funding for schools I have prioritised funding for primary schools.The Education Budget for 2009 has provided for improvements to the overall level of day to day funding for primary schools which will see funding increase from €167 million in 2008 to almost €190 million in 2009.This builds on the progress has been made in recent years that has seen the primary school capitation grant increased from €81.26 per pupil in 2000 to its current rate of €200. This represents an increase of 146% in the standard rate of capitation grant since 2000.The primary capitation grant has been improved by more than €21 to bring the rate to €200 per pupil and the ancillary services grant for primary schools will also be improved by €3.50 to €155 per pupil.Taken together, these increases mean that primary schools eligible for the full ancillary services grant will get €355 per pupil — or almost €25 extra — in this school year to cover their day to day running costs, with a primary school of 300 pupils getting €7,475 more. In 2000, a primary school with 300 pupils was in receipt of less than €40,000 to meet its day to day running costs. That same school under these new rates will receive €106,500. This excludes the salary of teachers and Special Needs Assistants which are paid by the Department.Furthermore enhanced rates of capitation funding are paid in respect of children with special educational needs who attend special schools or special classes attached to mainstream schools. The current rates range from €512 to €986 per pupil — an increase of 59% from the rate in 2006.By any standards there have been very significant improvements within a relatively short period of time and the Government is committed to further increasing funding for schools as resources permit.  While increasing resources is important, we must also focus on measures to enhance the quality of education in our schools to ensure that increased resources lead to the best possible outcomes for our children.We are committed to investing in education but we have to invest at a level that is consistent with what we can afford and what is sustainable at the moment given economic circumstances. I am confident that as the global economy improves it will be possible to build again on the significant achievements of recent years and do so in a manner consistent with overall prudent management of the Irish economy.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	438	As the Deputy will be aware, the Education budget for 2009 has been increased by some €302 million, which is a real achievement in the current economic climate. Notwithstanding this, a number of tough and difficult decisions have had to be taken, which have seen a number of spending cuts across the education sector.My Department notified all 124 school completion projects in August last that, pursuant to a Government decision in response to the deterioration in public finances, they would be required to reduce their payroll bill by 3% in 2009 through all appropriate measures identified by local management in the light of local circumstances.Projects were advised that they had the authority to manage how the savings are to be achieved. This is to facilitate projects in their efforts to ensure that these necessary steps will be applied in such a manner as to minimise their effect on young people targeted and to prioritise those activities which are found to be of most value in supporting the young people concerned.In implementing this decision local Managers will have an opportunity to consider measures which might include the control of premium pay, the management of existing or future vacancies, the organisation of work processes and the levels at which work is carried out, as well as control of numbers through recruitment and other measures.This requirement will not have a universal effect on all 124 projects, as projects vary in size, number of schools involved and the number and status of personnel employed and the types of interventions in place.It is envisaged that the savings requested, will lead to rationalisation, with more efficient and cost effective measures being implemented. In this way, it is not expected that there will be any significant diminution of front-lines services.CountyProjectPost PrimaryPrimaryCarlowSCP70420RCarlow Voc.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	439	As the Deputy is aware, due to current economic constraints, the Government has had to make extremely difficult decisions and choices across all public services and education is no different. There is an inescapable fact that pay constitutes the bulk of current expenditure on education and therefore measures impacting on the teaching resources available to schools were necessary.The funding of teacher salaries in fee-paying schools by the State has been a long standing feature of our education system and one continued by successive Governments. In the absence of fee-paying schools and the enrolment of all pupils in the non-fee paying sector, there would be subsequent additional costs and teachers would still have to be paid.The specific measures I have had to take in relation to the staffing schedule have to be seen in this light. I had to take a measured and balanced view of what was reasonable in the circumstances.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	440	Notwithstanding the increase of €302 million in the Education budget for 2009, which is a real achievement in the current economic climate, a number of tough and difficult decisions had to be taken. These decisions included the decision to discontinue the annual funding of €97,000 that my Department made available to the Centre for Talented Youth (CTYI) at Dublin City University.While it is appreciated that the discontinuation of this funding will impact on the Centre, given the current volatile and challenging economic climate, difficult choices had to be made in order to contain public sector spending. Tax revenues are down significantly and Government expenditure has to reflect this reality. The priority of this budget was to focus on measures to channel as much as was possible of the available resources to the direct funding of our schools.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	441	The Government's commitment to education is clear both from its track record over the past decade in providing substantial additional resources, most notably extra teachers to meet previously unmet needs and from the programme the Government set for itself when it came into office. A lot has changed in the past year and the first and foremost imperative is that we stabilise the public finances. It is only by doing so that we can shelter gains made and put ourselves in the position of being able to make improvements in the future. What we are doing in primary schools from September next is staffing them on the same basis as they were staffed just over one school year ago.I am aware that a number of unfounded assertions have been made about the impact of the decision to increase the staffing schedule for schools. Numerous research studies on the influence of class size on the quality of education have been produced internationally and the general consensus is that small changes in class sizes have no measurable impact on learning outcomes for students.A recent study by Eric Hanuscheck — The Evidence on Class Size — found that the effects of class size on student achievement were insignificant in 74 per cent of the studies examined, 13 per cent showed a positive effect for lower class size and 13 per cent showed a negative impact.The OECD report Teachers Matter (2005) and the McKinsey Report, How the World's Best Performing School Systems Come Out on Top (2007) looked at a wide range of performance data from international research and at the relationship between class size and educational attainment.The main conclusions from international research can be summarised as follows:Class size reductions are more beneficial for some students than for others, for example:students in the early years of schoolingstudents from disadvantaged backgroundsstudents with special needs or learning difficultiesstudents from low-income minority groupsMarginal changes in class sizes have no significant impact of educational achievementVariables other than class size, such as the quality of teachers, have been shown to have a stronger association with educational achievement.In Ireland, national studies of English reading and mathematics in primary schools show no relationship between class size and achievement of pupils. The most recent national assessment of English reading was conducted in 2004. In this, the achievement levels of fifth class pupils did not differ significantly from those in the previous survey which took place in 1998. In 2004, the school-level pupil-teacher ratio was 19:1. This was significantly lower than the ratio of 27:1 which existed during 1998 survey.Similarly, the overall performance in mathematics of fourth class pupils did not change significantly between the national surveys of 2004 and 1999 even though the average class size in single grade fourth classes and the average class size across all classes were both significantly lower in 2004 than in 1999.I believe that the available research evidence on class size does not support the suggestion that children will experience a significant impact in the quality of their education. In framing the budget measures, I have been very conscious of the need to minimise the effect that any change in pupil-teacher ratios might have on the provision being made for our most vulnerable students.I have ensured that targeted resources in schools in the DEIS programme will be maintained at the same level as in previous years. Students with special needs and learning difficulties will continue to have full access to the same level of resource teaching, special needs assistance and learning support in every school. Traveller children will continue to benefit from additional supports. Children whose mother tongue is not English and who have English language needs will also continue to benefit from additional supports, albeit at a reduced level.I have already acknowledged that there will be a net loss of some two hundred posts in each sector but I am satisfied that the decision to marginally increase the pupil-teacher ratio is an equitable and prudent course of action in the current economic circumstances.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	442	My Department's allocation of € 9.6 billion in fact  represents an increase of  over €300m,  or  a 3% increase  on 2008.  This amount represents 5.1% of the forecasted GDP for 2009, an increase of 0.5% on the 2007 position.It should be noted Education and Science was one of only three Government Departments to have increased funding for 2009 which reflects the Government's continued prioritisation of education. The 2009 Education allocation of €9.6 billion is over treble what it was in 1997. We are committed to investing in education but we have to invest at a level that is consistent with what we can afford and what is sustainable at the moment given the economic circumstances.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	443	I propose to take Questions Nos. 125 and 154 together.The decision on eligibility for student maintenance grants is a matter for the relevant assessing authority, either the local authority or VEC, as appropriate.  The appeal provisions in place for social welfare recipients are the same as those for all grant applicants.  If an individual applicant considers that she/he has been unjustly refused a maintenance grant, or that the rate of maintenance grant awarded is not the correct one, she/he may appeal, in the first instance, to the relevant local authority or VEC.  Where an appeal is turned down, in writing, by the relevant local authority or VEC and the applicant remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in his/her case, an appeal form outlining the position may be submitted by the applicant to my Department.The prescribed income limit for the special rate of maintenance grant for the academic year 2008/2009 is €20,147. Applicants with reckonable income above that threshold may still qualify for the standard rate of maintenance grant.In addition, the Student Assistance Fund is designed to assist students who, having commenced a third-level course, experience financial hardship that may render them unable to continue their third-level studies. Applications for funding are made by the individual student to the Access Officer in the institution in which they are studying. The Fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	444	I propose to take Questions Nos. 126, 129, 130, 134 and 144 together.As I made clear during the lengthy debate in the House last week the 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure. These decisions were made to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run. In this respect Education while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure could not be totally spared.Again let me re-iterate that prudent management of the Government finances is vital at this time of global economic uncertainty when tax revenue has fallen so significantly and when world economic conditions are so serious. Even with the Budget measures in place there will still be a significantly increased borrowing requirement in 2009.When the country was able to afford it we reduced the basis on which primary teachers are allocated to schools from being based on an average number of pupils per teacher from 35 pupils down to the current level of 27 pupils. The change to a new average of 28 pupils per teacher has to be viewed in that context. It means primary schools will be staffed exactly as they were during the 2006/2007 school year during which they operated well.Since 1997 primary teacher numbers have increased by about 10,000 — about 7,000 of these teachers going into the system in the last six years alone. The continuation of this level of annual increase — of the order of 1,000 primary teachers each year — was just not sustainable for 2009 in the current economic climate. Although it reverses some of the progress that we have made in recent years I had no option but to curtail the annual increase in teacher numbers. While I appreciate this will impact on class sizes the reality is that it will not impact on every school rather the change will impact on the total number of teachers in some 10 to 15% of primary schools.In relation to the number of teaching posts involved in this change I have already said that the net overall position is a reduction of about 200 posts from the primary teacher payroll next September compared to this September across all the staffing measures involving primary schools. This is calculated on the basis of a removal of up to 1,100 posts of which some 400 to 500 posts are expected to be due to the staffing schedule change specifically. This will be offset by the creation of 900 posts that will be required to meet increasing enrolments and as resource teachers for special needs. The estimated impact of the schedule change is estimated on the same basis under which estimates of the cost of improving the staffing schedule were calculated in the past.In terms of the position in respect of any one school for September 2009, schools are currently returning data to my Department in relation to their enrolment as of 30 September last. My Department has commenced processing this data although all schools have not yet made their returns. The allocation processes including notification to schools will commence early in the New Year. The allocation process includes appellate mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules. The final allocation to a school is also a function of the operation of the redeployment panels which provide for the retention of a teacher in an existing school if a new post is not available within the agreed terms of the scheme.It will be necessary in the more testing economic climate ahead for us to continue to target and prioritise our resources to maximum effect for everyone. While teacher numbers are important numerous influential reports have highlighted the fact that teacher quality is the single most important factor — far and above anything else — in improving educational outcomes for children. Ensuring high quality teaching and learning is a challenge and dealing with factors that inhibit it represent a challenge for the Government, the Department, school management and indeed the teacher unions.I am confident that as the global economy improves it will be possible to build again on the significant achievements of recent years and do so in a manner consistent with overall prudent management of the Irish economy.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	445	The recent OECD Education at a Glance report shows that the Irish education system is performing strongly and that the outcomes achieved are significant when compared with our OECD and EU counterparts.The report shows that, between 2000 and 2005, in real terms (allowing for inflation), total public and private spending increased by 52% at primary, second and further education levels. Expenditure per student at all levels below higher level increased in real terms by 47% between 2000 and 2005, compared to 19% on average across the OECD.Expenditure on education has continued to increase since 2005 — the reference year for this report. In 2008, the Government provided over €690 million more for Education in the Estimates, with a total allocation of over €9.3 billion. €3.2 billion was spent on second-level education in 2007, the most recent year for which full figures have been compiled for the second-level sector. This spending was up from €2.9 billion in 2005 and €1.9 billion in 1998.The Deputy should note that, as published in the recent budget, the total funds allocated for second level and further education grants and services in 2009 have been increased by 3% on the 2008 estimates figure. This increase has been achieved despite the prevailing difficult economic climate.Increases provided by this Government in recent years have allowed for major progress to be made both in the day-to-day funding and staffing of our schools. Since 2005 second-level schools have benefited from substantial increases in funding for their day-to-day costs. The standard capitation grant, which stood at €286 per pupil in 2005, is now €331 per pupil, and the support services grant for secondary schools has been increased from €145 per pupil in 2005 to €204 per pupil in 2008.The Deputy is also reminded of my recent announcement, made in the context of the 2009 estimates, that from 1 January 2009 the standard per capita grant at second level will be increased by a further €14 to €345 per pupil, a 21% increase on the 2005 figure. In addition, up to €40,000 per school is also provided by my Department to secondary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services.The Deputy should also note that significant improvements have been made in the pupil teacher ratio at post primary level in recent years. The actual pupil teacher ratio at second level (i.e. the total number of pupils in the system divided by the total number of teachers in the system) fell from 16:1 in the 1996/97 school year to 13.13:1 in the 2006/07 school year.The provisions that I have made, in the context of the 2009 estimates, for an increase in the funding of second level schools is a clear demonstration of my commitment, despite a challenging economic environment, to prioritise available resources to address the needs of schools.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	446	I propose to take Questions Nos. 128, 135, 493 and 522 together.As the Deputies will be aware, the Government has had to make extremely difficult decisions and choices across all public services and education is no different.There is an inescapable fact that pay constitutes the bulk of current expenditure on education, and therefore measures impacting on the teaching resources available to schools were necessary.The specific measures I have had to take in relation to the staffing schedule have to be seen in this light.  I had to take a measured and balanced view of what was reasonable in the circumstances.Regarding difficulties encountered by schools, the position is that each school management authority is required to organise its curriculum, teaching timetable and subject options having regard to pupils' needs within the limits of the approved normal staffing allocation.A school authority may, however, encounter unanticipated difficulty in meeting essential curricular commitments to pupils within the normal staffing allocation.   As part of the normal flexibility in the allocation system, my Department will, on an exceptional basis, consider requests by a school authority for a staffing concession as short-term support.Such curricular concession applications should clearly demonstrate how the management authority has engaged in effective school planning and inter-school co-operation, where appropriate, to demonstrate how it will deal with the matter in the medium term.Mechanisms are also in place for schools that wish to appeal their staffing allocations.  The criteria for appeals are published by my Department and appeals are considered by an Appeals Board which operates independently of my Department.It is important to emphasise that the revised pupil teacher ratio affects all fee-paying schools, regardless of denominational ethos.  Fee-charging schools can continue to employ additional teachers that they fund from their fee income.With regard to the removal of certain ancillary grants received by Protestant fee-charging schools, I wish to re-emphasise that the Protestant Block grant remains in place.  Protestant fee-charging schools receive, and will continue to receive, this grant, which amounts to €6.25 million in the current school year.This payment covers capitation, tuition and boarding grants.  It is distributed by the Secondary Education Committee among needier Protestant children.  Applications are made by parents to the Central Protestant Churches Authority, which, on the basis of a means test, distributes the funds to individual schools on the basis of pupil needs.The retention of this grant demonstrates the importance that I, and this Government, continue to attach to ensuring that students of the Protestant faith can attend schools that reflect their denominational ethos.In retaining this grant, the Government is being faithful to the separate arrangements that were agreed with the Protestant schools when the free scheme was introduced by Donagh O'Malley and, at the time, it was the payment of the block grant in particular for Protestant fee-charging schools that distinguished them from Catholic schools that chose to continue to charge fees.In addition to the block grant, Protestant fee-charging schools were paid a range of support grants that Catholic fee-charging schools did not receive.  These grants were not available at the time of the agreement with the Protestant schools.It is estimated that savings of €2.8 million will accrue to the Department as a result of the withdrawal of these grants from Protestant fee-charging schools in 2009.The purpose of these grants was not to offset fees for disadvantaged Protestant students.  Rather, they covered a range of support services.I have had to take decisions in range to a relation of grants that have impacted on the funding of schools generally.  With the Protestant Block Grant protected, I can see no justification for treating the Protestant fee-charging schools in a special way, particularly given that Catholic fee-charging schools have not been in receipt of the grants in question at all.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	447	I propose to take Questions Nos. 131, 153 and 490 together.The budget measures will mean that the level of language support will be reduced from a maximum of six extra teachers per school to a maximum of two teachers per school, as was the case before 2007.However, the ongoing requirement for current levels of language support teachers in schools should also start to reduce in line with lower levels of immigration and in line with improvements in the levels of proficiency of those pupils for whom this resource has been available.Nonetheless, schools that require language support will still be entitled to get it. We still envisage having over 1,400 language support teachers in our schools in September 2009 and up to about 500 other teachers in part-time posts. By any standards this is a very significant resource and the challenge will be to ensure that it is used to maximum effect.As I announced on budget day we will also provide for some alleviation for the position of those schools where there is a significant concentration of newcomer pupils as a proportion of the overall enrolment. This will be done on a case by case basis.The allocation process for language support teachers is an annual one and existing provision is not rolled over automatically. Schools will be applying afresh in the spring and early summer of 2009 for the 2009/10 school year, based on their assessment of the prospective needs of existing pupils and any new pupils they are enrolling.Moreover, OECD research in this field (PISA 2006) shows that Ireland is the OECD country with the highest distribution of newcomers across schools meaning that schools with higher concentrations of newcomer children are relatively unusual. ESRI data also shows that only a small percentage of schools have high concentrations of newcomer children.I realise that standards are not simply achieved by supplying teaching resources and that the quality of the supports that the child receives and the inclusive atmosphere cultivated in schools are important factors influencing the quality of learning achieved by migrant children. My Department recognises that we must monitor and review the educational experiences that are provided to migrant students so that we can improve the quality and effectiveness of our provision. The Department is undertaking a range of research to consider the question of integration in schools and how best to deploy our resources to ensure that all the children in our schools can benefit from learning in an intercultural Ireland.

This has allowed officials in my Department to concentrate on delivering larger scale projects, while also ensuring that the school authorities can use their local knowledge to manage projects efficiently.  Overall, the use of such devolved schemes has resulted in cost efficient and effective delivery of minor projects in schools.The Minor Works Grant, which increased by 44% in 2006, provides school authorities with the funds to carry out ongoing repairs and maintenance work of a minor nature on school buildings.  It allows the school to prioritise how the money is spent on their schools, again using their local knowledge.The devolved Small Schools Scheme and the Permanent Accommodation Scheme, were introduced in 2003.  The purpose of the Schemes was to devolve funding to individual school authorities to undertake smaller scale building works such as refurbishment of existing buildings/provision of small extensions with guaranteed funding. Under the terms of the Schemes, school authorities were empowered to manage these works with guidance from and minimal interaction with the Department.Since the introduction of the Schemes, over 730 projects have been were approved for funding.The Summer Works Scheme, which was introduced in 2003, has resulted in the completion of over 3,000 projects, costing in excess of €300 million.  These projects have been managed on a devolved basis, with school authorities being responsible for the day to day management of the project on behalf of the Department.With so many smaller projects having been completed over the past few years, the particular emphasis in 2008 has been on providing sufficient school places in developing areas, while also delivering improvements in the quality of existing primary and post-primary school accommodation throughout the country. Accordingly my Department has focused on delivering as many large projects as possible in 2008 and funding was not made available for a Summer Works Scheme this year.However, I recognise the benefits of the scheme in addressing the needs of schools and I have previously informed the house of my intention to have a Summer Works Scheme in 2009. The details of the operation of the scheme in 2009 and the level of funding to be made available under the scheme in 2009 are currently being considered.

The staff report to a Principal Officer who is also responsible for my Department's ICT in Schools Programme.As the Deputy may be aware, this Programme is being undertaken in partnership with industry in the context of a Government — IBEC/TIF (Telecommunications and Internet Federation) Agreement to provide local broadband connectivity to schools. The Programme has three elements — local connectivity to schools, a national broadband network and a broadband support service desk. Schools connectivity is being routed to the Internet through a national broadband network, which is supported by HEAnet and provides centrally managed services for schools such as security, anti-spam/ anti-virus and content filtering. The broadband support service desk has been established to interface between the network, the local broadband service Access Providers and schools. It is managed by the National Centre for Technology in Education (NCTE).My officials are responsible for the implementation and development of the Programme. The staff involved liaise with the NCTE and HEAnet in relation to the Programme, any issues arising therein and the provision of services to schools under the Programme. Quarterly contract reviews are held with the various service providers and the staff deal with all the financial arrangements for the Programme, including processing the invoices from the various Service Providers, monitoring the Suspense Account established for the Programme and liaising with Tif members and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources in relation thereto. My officials deal with the procurement arrangements under the Programme, including the appointment of an external evaluator therefor. They liaise with officials in the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources in relation to the second-level schools proposal set out in the Consultation Paper on Next Generation Broadband. Finally, the staff assigned to work in this area are also overseeing the procurement process for the next phase of the Schools Broadband Access Programme.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	450	I propose to take Questions Nos. 136, 556 and 557 together.The Deputy will be aware of the Government's commitment to ensuring that all children with special educational needs, including those with autism, can have access to an education appropriate to their needs preferably in school settings through the primary and post primary school network. This facilitates access to individualised education programmes, fully qualified professional teachers, special needs assistants and the appropriate school curriculum.The establishment of a network of autism-specific special classes in schools across the country to cater for children with autism has been a key educational priority in recent years. In excess of 330 classes have now been approved around the country at primary and post primary level, including many in special schools. The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) will continue to establish more classes as required.Children in these classes benefit from having a reduced pupil-teacher ratio of 6:1; fully-qualified teachers who have access to training in a range of autism-specific interventions, including Applied Behavioural Analysis (ABA), the Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH) and the Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS) and there is a minimum of 2 special needs assistants in each class. These students have the option, where appropriate, of full/partial integration and interaction with other pupils. Funding is also provided for assistive technology and specialist equipment as required and special school transport arrangements may also be put in place.  My Department has put in place a training programme for teachers in autism-specific interventions including TEACCH, PECS and ABA through the Special Education Support Service.The Deputy will also be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for allocating resource teachers and special needs assistants to schools to support children with autism. The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	451	I regard comments being made from whatever quarter about schools turning away pupils as premature, alarmist and irresponsible.    I can only conclude that such statements are motivated by a desire to create pressure for a change in relation to the decisions the Government had to take in relation to school staffing. I regard it as reprehensible that any school might seek to use children as pawns no matter how strongly they feel about the decisions that we have made.Ultimately it is a matter for each school's Board of Management to have an enrolment policy and to then operate that policy in a fair and consistent manner having regard to the overall physical space capacity of a school.  My Department's has a responsibility to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.  That is no more than a normal feature of the enrolment process in any community.My Department will continue to ensure that those schools with the greatest increase in pupil numbers will still qualify for developing school status thus enabling them to get their increased staffing in September 2009 — a year in advance of other schools.  The Forward Planning Section of my Department is currently in the process of identifying the areas where significant additional school accommodation will be required at primary and post-primary level. Factors under consideration include population growth, demographic trends, current and projected enrolments, recent and planned housing developments and capacity of existing schools to meet demand for places. Having considered these factors decisions will be taken on the means by which emerging needs will be met within an area.The demand for school places in the area in question will be considered within this context.What is not acceptable is that any school authority would in the coming year alter its approach to enrolment simply because it wants to pressurise the government or to give support to a campaign being conducted by a teacher union.As I pointed out in the House last week the changes to the classroom staffing of primary schools reverts schools to the position that applied just over one school year ago. Schools are given teaching resources commensurate with their enrolment and under the staffing schedule schools with like enrolments are treated in the same way.In terms of accommodating pupils I believe it is totally reasonable to expect schools to operate from next September no less favourably than they did in 2006/2007.Any school acting dishonourably in this regard must ultimately answer to its local community and to the parents and children in that community in particular.The specific information requested by the Deputy in relation to the detailed staffing allocation of the schools in question for the academic year 2009/10 cannot be determined until the allocation process has fully concluded. There is nothing exceptional in this. The allocation process includes appellate mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules. At primary level the final allocation to a school is also a function of the operation of the redeployment panels which provide for the retention of a teacher in an existing school if a new post is not available within the agreed terms of the scheme.Schools are currently returning data to my Department in relation to their enrolment as of 30 September. My Department has commenced processing this data although all schools have not yet made their returns. The allocation processes including notification to schools will commence early in the New Year.

It is a matter for each university to manage their financial resources and to take the necessary steps to ensure that expenditure is kept within the approved budget.I understand that the Higher Education Authority (HEA) has met with, and informed the Irish University Association (IUA) of the challenging financial situation facing all institutions in 2009. The IUA has been advised that the HEA Executive will be meeting with each institution to discuss their budgetary situation. The IUA has also been informed that the Authority will be paying particular attention to the level of deficit in the sector and will be requiring specific plans, before the end of 2008, on how institutions propose to address any deficits. The HEA will be monitoring the level of deficit in the sector on an ongoing basis throughout 2009.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	453	In making the announcement of the Budget measures for education I stressed that tough choices had to be made in meeting the needs of the education sector in these difficult times.  The resources available to the Department have meant that these choices have been very challenging.The decision made to suspend the substitution cover for uncertified sick leave and school business was a difficult one and there are no plans to change that decision.The provision of substitute cover for uncertified sick leave in all schools and for school business at second level was only introduced in 2003.   In addition the supervision/ substitution scheme which gives an annual payment of €1789, in addition to normal salary  to teachers to provide supervision and substitution cover was also introduced.I am aware that from January the changes regarding substitution will present particular challenges for school managers but I felt that suspending part of the improvements made in 2003 to the substitution scheme was preferable to impacting more significantly on teacher numbers.Prior to 2003 schools managed without any of this provision and this did not impede on their capacity to participate for example in football and other sports competitions.I fully accept this was possible through flexibility and goodwill all round.  As we manage through this difficult period I am asking teachers in all schools to co-operate fully with school managers in coping with this change in the interest of the students.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	454	I propose to take Questions Nos. 140 and 447 together.The issue of the re-introduction of third level fees should be viewed in the context of the wider funding of higher education.As the Deputy will be aware, the Government is investing unprecedented levels of public funding in higher education. In 2008 some €2 billion is being invested in our third level sector. In contributing to the achievement of national policy goals for social and economic development into the future, it can be anticipated that there will be continuing significant resource needs for the sector. It is appropriate to raise questions around how future additional resource needs can be met and in particular how our higher education institutions can be supported in their development ambitions through a widening of their non-Exchequer sources of income. The introduction of a form of student contribution, which would only be applied to those who can afford to pay it, is one possibility that merits debate.My Department, with the assistance of the Higher Education Authority (HEA), is at present conducting a review of policy options relating to the introduction of a form of student contribution. In this regard a range of options are being examined, including possibilities for alternative means of imposing a student contribution such as an income contingent loans system. There are many complex and competing considerations that will fall to be taken into account by the Government in considering the available options.  In this regard, the revenue that might accrue from the introduction of fees is contingent on a range of variables relating to the various options under examination. Whilst relevant published reports will also inform the review underway, the specific work referred to by the Deputy does not form part of this review.  It is my intention, following completion of the review currently underway, to bring proposals to Government in relation to the available options.

In line with those recommendations it has been decided that where unapproved payments were being made to senior staff within certain third-level institutions, no increases on foot of the Review Body's latest report should be implemented until the position was regularised.Officials from my Department together with officials from the Higher Education Authority and the Department of Finance are now reviewing the position with each of the institutions concerned to ensure that the remuneration levels are in full compliance with the recommendations outlined in Report No 42 of the Review Body on Higher Remuneration.My Department will only approve the Review Body increases in respect of individuals who are in receipt of approved salary levels.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	456	The Back to Education Initiative (BTEI) commenced in October 2002.  It provides flexible part-time options across Further Education and is aimed at adults with less than upper second level education, including unemployed adults. It aims to give adults who wish to return to education an opportunity to combine their return to learning with family, work and other responsibilities. Programmes are offered on a part-time basis in the mornings, afternoons, evenings or at weekends.Since September 2007, any adult with less than an upper second level education is entitled to free tuition. Originally only people with a social welfare entitlement or medical card were entitled to free tuition.As part of a prioritised approach to expenditure in 2009, it was necessary to reduce the number of places on the BTEI by 500, returning it to the 2007 level of 9,000.  This reduction should be seen in the context of the significant increase in expenditure on the BTEI in the last five years, up from €6,000,000 in 2002 to €18,000,000 in 2007.The Deputy will be aware that the Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme (VTOS), which is funded by my Department, is a second chance education initiative designed specifically for the unemployed.  Unemployed persons who are at least 21 years of age and in receipt of specified social welfare payments for at least six months are eligible to participate.  It aims to give participants education and training opportunities which will develop and prepare them to go into paid employment or on to further education opportunities leading to paid employment.A training allowance (equivalent to the maximum rate of unemployment benefit, plus a payment for an adult or child dependant, if appropriate) is paid by Vocational Education Committees (VECs) to participants who previously drew unemployment benefit or assistance. These allowances will be increased in line with the appropriate social welfare rates or FÁS trainee allowances and VTOS participants also retain their social welfare secondary benefits.There are 5,000 approved places on VTOS and I shall endeavour to safeguard this position for 2009.

It is necessary to curtail expenditure in some areas, in order that resources may be more efficiently targeted at areas of greater disadvantage.  I can see no justification for treating the non-Catholic fee-charging schools in a special way, particularly given that Catholic fee-charging schools have not been in receipt of the grants in question at all.I wish to re-emphasise that there are no changes proposed in respect of the Protestant Block Grant. Protestant fee-charging schools receive, and will continue to receive, the Protestant Block grant, which in the current school year amounts to €6.25 million. This payment covers capitation, tuition and boarding grants.

Over 80% of these vehicles are privately owned, most of these being small and medium sized buses.The number of Bus Éireann school buses in use fluctuates on a monthly basis as more modern buses are introduced and others are withdrawn from service on a continual basis throughout the School Year. However, Bus Éireann use about 620 of their own buses to provide school transport each day, almost all of which are large capacity vehicles. Currently 18 Bus Éireann school buses, and 9 privately owned school buses under contract, are also used to provide one day a week rural transport services organised by Bus Éireann in the middle of the day between class times without impinging on the school transport timetable.Where requests are made to Bus Éireann for the establishment of new rural transport services for social and business activities, it is a matter for the company to evaluate these requests.  I previously indicated to the Deputy, that the cost of providing these services neither increases nor reduces the cost of school transport provided by my Department and in the same way the expanded use of the school buses for this purpose would not impact on the cost of the school transport provision.  Bus Éireann is not aware of any buses in the scheme which are 30 to 35 years old.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	459	I propose to take Questions Nos. 146 and 150 together.Under the current National Development Plan, a total of almost €4.5bn has been allocated to the school building programme.  This allocation was the result of discussions between officials in my Department and officials in the Department of Finance.The allocation of €581m in 2009, although a slight reduction over the 2008 allocation, represents a significant investment in the school building and modernisation programme.  As the Deputies will appreciate, the wider climate in which the 2009 Budget has been framed is very different to that of recent years.  The Government has been faced with very difficult choices across all areas of public spending.  This level of funding for the building programme, at a time of pressure on the Government finances, is a sign of the very real commitment of this Government to investing in the school infrastructure and will permit the continuation of progress in the overall improvement of school accommodation.This investment will build on the achievements of the last National Development Plan 2000-2006, when an aggregate total of well over €2.6 billion was invested in upgrading the existing school infrastructure and providing new school accommodation at both first level and second level. This programme delivered over 7,800 building projects in addition to investment in site purchases, the annual minor works grant to all primary schools, dust, asbestos and radon remediation programmes, science and technology initiatives, emergency works and grants for the purchase of furniture and equipment.Innovations in the delivery of school buildings such as the development of Generic Repeat Designs and the use of the Design and Build model ensure that new school buildings are delivered in the fastest timeframe possible.  My Department also adopted a policy of devolving much greater authority to local school management boards to manage and deliver smaller building projects, thereby freeing my Department to concentrate on the larger scale projects.The school building programme is primarily focused on meeting the demand for new school places across the state. Value for money is a key criterion in the implementation of the school building programme and competitive tendering, in line with public procurement procedures, ensures that this is achieved.  As I have indicated publicly, the current decline in activity in the construction industry is an opportunity for my Department to continue to pursue value for money in the procurement and construction of school buildings.

The resources available to the Department have meant that these choices have been very challenging.Since 2003, when the supervision/substitution scheme was introduced and the range of absences for which substitution cover was provided was extended to cover uncertified sick leave and official school business, we have significantly increased expenditure on substitution and the supervision / substitution scheme.  This expenditure increase has taken place for a range of reasons including the extension of maternity leave, the implementation of the terms of legislation in relation to part-time employment and increases in teacher numbers.  Expenditure on the substitution scheme at primary level has increased from €26.3 million in 2003 to a projected cost of €84.4 million in the current financial year.  The projected cost of substitution in secondary and community/comprehensive schools in the current financial year is €66.9 million and €38 million for schools under the control of Vocational Education Committees.Substitution cover will continue to be provided for all other categories of absences for which it is currently available including maternity leave and certified sick leave.  The existing arrangement will continue to apply for the supervision/substitution scheme with teachers continuing to be paid an annual payment of €1,789 for participation in the scheme.I am aware that from January the changes regarding substitution will present particular challenges for school managers but I felt that suspending part of the improvements made in 2003 to the substitution scheme was preferable to impacting more significantly on teacher numbers.Prior to 2003 schools managed without any of this provision and this did not impede on their capacity to participate for example in football and other sports competitions.I fully accept this was possible through flexibility and goodwill all round.

Once all requirements have been met by applicants, and their qualifications are recognised by the Teaching Council, applicants may apply to be registered as primary or post-primary teachers.In order to obtain full recognition as a primary teacher in this country, teachers must have satisfactorily completed a recognised primary teacher training course. In addition, Irish primary school teachers are class teachers as distinct from individual subject teachers and must be able to teach all aspects of the curriculum including the Irish language. Accordingly, fully recognised primary teachers must be qualified to teach the full range of primary school subjects to children aged 4 to 12 years.Teachers trained outside the jurisdiction of the State, who do not possess an appropriate Irish language qualification, are currently granted a five year period of conditional recognition to teach in mainstream classes in national schools.During this period these teachers are expected to obtain their Irish language qualification.  In order to satisfy the Irish language requirement such teachers must pass an Irish language examination (Scrúdú Cáilíochta sa Ghaeilge) and provide certification that they have resided in the Gaeltacht while attending an approved three-week course, or must complete an adaptation period.Notwithstanding the increase of €302 million in the education budget for 2009, which is a real achievement in the current economic climate, a number of tough and difficult decisions had to be taken. These included the decision to discontinue the grant paid to foreign trained teachers for attending courses in the Gaeltacht.The amount of the grant payable to foreign qualified teachers attending Irish courses in the Gaeltacht was a once-off payment of €431 per teacher. It should be noted that during the five year period allowed, such conditionally recognised teachers may teach in mainstream classes in national schools and are remunerated at the rate appropriate to that of a fully qualified primary school teacher.

He also oversees preparation of the Government's legislative programme.  In  addition, my statutory functions in relation to the Central Statistics Office have been delegated to him.I have also assigned responsibility for the Active Citizenship initiative in my Department to Minister of State Carey.  His role is to drive the initiative forward, to oversee the implementation of the recommendations of the Taskforce on Active Citizenship and, critically, to promote the concept of active citizenship in all spheres of Irish life.  He is also responsible for monitoring and identifying additional measures which would strengthen our social interaction and broaden the manner in which we view our responsibilities as citizens in the modern Ireland.  Minister of State Carey is supported in this work by a Steering Group chaired by Ms. Mary Davis, and by the Active Citizenship Office in my Department.Minister of State Roche, in a co-ordinating role in my Department, chairs an Interdepartmental Coordinating Committee on European Union Affairs.

The agency has developed flagship Business & Technology Parks in Castlebar and Westport which are being actively marketed.  There is now also 11.55 hectares of industrially zoned land on the Sligo Road in Ballina. There were 3,004 people employed in 19 IDA supported companies in County Mayo in 2007.   The agency continues to work with its existing base of overseas companies to encourage them to grow and expand.Enterprise Ireland is also actively involved in assisting its client companies to grow and develop their businesses.  In 2007, the agency worked with 124 client companies in the County employing 3,155 people and €3.8 million was approved by the agency for its clients.  In April 2007, Ovagen Ltd was launched with the announcement of 60 jobs for Ballina.  The agency also supported 2 "Spirit of Enterprise" seminars at the Incubation Centre in Galway/Mayo Institute of Technology in Castlebar.In addition, Enterprise Ireland has approved 16 innovation vouchers for Mayo companies.  These vouchers give companies access to the vast knowledge available in Irish Institutes of Technology, Universities and other public research bodies.  The agency has supported two Centres of Excellence in GMIT and approved support for the development of Campus Innovation Centres at GMIT.  The agency also supports Enterprise Centres in Ballina, Ballyhaunis, Brickens, Claremorris, Foxford, Killala and Kiltimagh.  The town of Westport was successful in the 2008 call for proposals.So far this year, Mayo County Enterprise Board has provided €443,850 in grant support to 24 projects located throughout the County. Between them, these projects have the potential to create up to 50 jobs most of which are expected to be in place over the course of the coming year. The Board has also provided business related training and mentoring support to 303 persons on a variety of programmes held throughout the County. By year-end, the Board also expects to have interacted with approximately 400 second-level students in one-day workshops aimed at promoting an enterprise culture in Mayo.I am satisfied that the ongoing efforts of IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and the County Enterprise Board together with local interests, will continue to attract investment and jobs to County Mayo.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	474	The Enterprise Development agencies under the aegis of my Department, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and Shannon Development together with the County Enterprise Boards, are responsible for growing indigenous enterprises and attracting and growing foreign direct investment. Strong, balanced regional development and a thriving culture of entrepreneurship in all parts of Ireland are key strategic objectives for my Department and the Development agencies under its remit.Over the last 10-15 years, Ireland has undergone a transformation from a low wage/low cost economy towards a high value and knowledge-based one.  Arising from this transformation, the nature of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) has changed and Ireland is now competing for premium mobile investments against the most advanced countries in the world. We face stiff international competition for these high value investments because of their economic impact and strategic importance.  A key aspect of the high value, knowledge intensive FDI Ireland now competes for, is that it increasingly favours locations in or near centres of urban scale, where it has access to the concentrations of infrastructure, skills and services it needs. Large urban areas tend to be where the various factors that drive modern economic growth assemble — an educated and skilled workforce, internationally trading firms, third-level institutions, Research and Development facilities, transport and other infrastructure, together with  culture, leisure and social facilities. In combination, these factors establish the type of basis essential for growth in the urban area itself, its wider region and the country as a whole.In order to support its efforts to secure these high value investments, while strengthening the enterprise base of the less developed regions, IDA Ireland has aligned its strategy with the Government's National Spatial Strategy and the agency is focused on delivering investments to the Gateway and Hub locations nationally, and specifically those in the Border Midlands and West (BMW) region.  This strategy involves matching investor requirements with the competencies, infrastructure and critical mass of the Gateway and Hub locations to secure the maximum number of investments for Ireland.  The key sectors of focus are Life Sciences, Information and Communications Technologies and high value Services activities.Taking account of the locational requirements of these sectors and the critical importance of centres of urban scale in attracting the high value investments, IDA Ireland has in recent years set a high level target to deliver in excess of 60% of investments outside  the Greater Dublin Area.  In 2007, this target was exceeded with 64% of investments locating outside the Greater Dublin Area.In relation to Enterprise Ireland, the agency is fully committed to assisting companies to grow and realise their full potential, working intensively with them on their business plans on a holistic basis to do so.  The agency provides a range of supports, both financial and non-financial for client companies and institutions. Enterprise Ireland also maintains extensive relationships with all regional and local development bodies and has a key partnership role to play with the country's agencies and organisations involved in entrepreneurial development.Enterprise Ireland's policy objectives for balanced regional development are reflected in the structure of its funding offer, whereby funding for existing company expansion and start-up businesses is biased towards the regions.  The maximum grant level is higher than in Dublin and the mid-East and a higher proportion of this funding is also non-repayable.  Enterprise Ireland's strategy ‘Transforming Irish Industry 2008-2010' includes the strategic target of continuing the drive for the establishment of High Potential Start Ups, with a target of delivering 50% of supported start ups outside the Dublin region.The most visible regional development programme in Enterprise Ireland is the Community Enterprise Scheme. Last Friday, I announced the awarding of over €11m in funding and management development support for 39 community enterprise centres spread throughout the country. This is the second tranche of approvals from the €21m 2007 — 2009 Community Enterprise Scheme.  Since the launch of the first scheme in 1989, a total of €50.8m has been approved and the impact of the programme at a local level, both urban and rural, is significant.  The Government through Enterprise Ireland has supported 134 communities, and the 105 completed centres are now home to approximately 1,000 successful businesses, employing approximately 5000 people.  These centres have a real and measurable impact on the economic and social development of local communities and are a tangible contribution to balanced regional development.  Of course, all of Enterprise Ireland's programmes are available to all companies regardless of location.Shannon Development is the regional Economic Development agency for the mid-West region.  It has responsibility for FDI in the Shannon Free Zone (SFZ) and complements the work of IDA and Enterprise Ireland through the provision of tailored property solutions for both FDI and indigenous industry in the region generally.  Other activities undertaken by the Company that promote regional development include promotion of Broadband services, the E-Towns project and participation in initiatives such as the Atlantic Technology Corridor and the Atlantic Way.In relation to County Enterprise Boards, the fact that the Boards operate at a local level throughout the country means that their interventions are targeted at assisting businesses, and those who are planning to establish businesses, in local communities including those in rural areas.  In this way, the CEBs are making a significant contribution to ensuring balanced regional development.I am satisfied that the policies and initiatives being adopted will continue to enhance balanced regional development.

I think this is, perhaps, best explained by way of an example.Ms Brown purchases her principal private residence during the 2006 tax year.  She subsequently marries and purchases, jointly with her spouse (who had not previously been entitled to the first time buyer mortgage interest relief), a new principal private residence during the 2008 tax year.   Ms. Brown is entitled to the first time buyer mortgage interest relief for each of the tax years 2006 to 2012 inclusive and her spouse is entitled to the first time buyer relief for each of the tax years 2008 to 2014.A similar situation applies in the case of co-habiting couples so that married couples are not disadvantaged as compared to co-habiting couples.

They do not include the numbers of potential claimants whose entitlements to other tax reliefs were sufficient to reduce their liability to tax to nil without reference to the specific relief. The numbers availing are rounded to the nearest hundred as appropriate. A married couple who has elected or has been deemed to have elected for joint assessment is counted as one tax unit.

This provides that such bodies are:"(a) the Garda Síochána(b) a body, organisation or group established(i) by or under any enactment (other than the Companies Acts, 1963to 1990) or any scheme administered by a Minister of the Government,or(ii) under the Companies Acts, 1963 to 1990, in pursuance of powers conferred by or under another enactment, and financed wholly or partly, whether directly or indirectly, by means of moneys provided, or loans made or guaranteed, by a Minister of the Government or the issue of shares held by or on behalf of a Minister of the Government,(c) any other body, organisation or group financed as aforesaid,(d) a company (within the meaning of the Companies Act, 1963) a majority of the shares in which are held by or on behalf of a Minister of the Government,(e) any other body, organisation or group appointed by the Government or a Minister of the Government,(f) subject to paragraph 2, any other body, organisation or group on which functions in relation to the general public or a class of the general public stand conferred by any enactment, or(g) a subsidiary of a body, organisation or group specified in any of the foregoing provisions of this subparagraph."The First Schedule provides that eligible bodies are prescribed by the Minister for Finance with the consent of the responsible Minister, where relevant.As regards consultation with organisations being prescribed for FOI this is a matter for the relevant Minister.  However, from the outset, when the FOI legislation was enacted in 1997, it has always been a priority to ensure that public bodies coming under FOI are well prepared and the Central Policy Unit of my Department oversees a programme providing for the preparation and training for new bodies coming under FOI.

For the same reason, I am not in a position to provide the data requested by the Deputy for the years 2008 and 2009.Based on information that has been received and collated to date for the tax year 2006, the position in terms of amounts of relief claimed and maximum tax cost for that year in respect of the schemes detailed above is set out in the following table:SchemeAmount ClaimedTax Cost€m€mConvalescent Homes4.11.7Qualifying (Private) Hospitals25.210.6Qualifying Mental Health Centres0.00.0Qualifying Specialist Palliative Care Units (subject to Commencement Order)0.00.0Buildings used for Childcare Purposes14.36.0Registered Nursing Homes35.514.7Qualifying (Nursing Home) Residential Units3.41.4Certain tourism infrastructure under the Mid-Shannon Scheme0.00.0Total82.534.4Apart from the schemes listed in the first paragraph of my reply which still remain in the tax code, all other property based tax incentive schemes terminated on, or before, 31 July 2008.As regards the remaining schemes, with the exceptions of the scheme of capital allowances for qualifying mental health centres which commenced in January 2007, the mid-Shannon scheme which commenced in June 2008 and the scheme for specialist palliative care units which has yet to commence, all of the other schemes were subject to review by independent external consultants in 2005.  The reviews (the reports of which are available on my Department's website) recommended the continuation of the schemes in question and I have no plans at this time to terminate those schemes.

Under the terms of the Acts, an officer who is the natural or adoptive parent of a child shall be entitled to parental leave for a period of fourteen working weeks.  The purpose of the leave is to enable a parent to take care of his/her child.  The leave must be taken before the child attains the age of eight years or 16 years in the case of a child with a disability.In the period from May to September 2008 a total of 25 staff of the Department of Finance took Parental Leave.An officer may take the parental leave as follows:(a) one continuous period of 14 weeks, or(b) subject to the agreement of the Head of the Department concerned—(i) one or more days on which, but for the leave, the officer would be working in the Department concerned(ii) one or more hours during which but for the leave, the officer would be working in the Department concerned(iii) any combination of periods referred to in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) above e.g. weekly blocks, monthly blocks etc.Staff who are on Parental Leave are not replaced.

It should also be noted that the VAT content of purchases of Auto Diesel is a deductible credit for business in the Irish VAT system.The figures provided for VAT receipts for 2008 are estimates of the amount of VAT yield that would be generated by the volume of clearances of oil products up to the end of September.  Mineral Oil Tax is paid in the month of clearance of the product but, depending on the nature of the registration status of a trader, VAT returns can be made monthly, bi-monthly, quarterly, half yearly or annually and this will dictate the point in time when VAT on sales will actually be paid.

A number EU Member States already apply a similar tax, for example the UK, France and the Netherlands. In addition, the Belgium Government recently announced its intention to introduce an air travel tax.

The Commissioners have also advised me that under the benefit-in-kind arrangements in place since 1 January 2004 employers are not obliged to make returns in respect of exempt benefit-in-kind.  There is therefore no way for them to know how many people have availed of the provision since that date.

I understand that payment of some claims was delayed because the pharmacy had charged the patient at the higher price, not the lower reimbursement price. Following a recent High Court judgment, reimbursement prices are being reinstated to the original level. Consequently, the HSE is now examining the issue of refund of payments to patients through local health offices. It is expected that this matter will be resolved shortly.  My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have the specific case mentioned by the Deputy investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.

Public resources, including for health, are very scarce indeed and will remain so.  I have decided that the best that can be achieved in these circumstances is to prioritise funding for the development of the cervical screening programme and treatment services at the eight designated cancer centres, which includes the challenge of funding very expensive cancer drugs.  I will not therefore be proceeding with the introduction of a HPV vaccination programme.  The continuation and expansion of the Cancer Control Programme under Professor Tom Keane remains a priority and funding of €15 million has been made available for this.At the moment we are rolling out the National Cervical Screening Programme, CervicalCheck.  The Programme will provide free smear tests through primary care settings to the 1.1 million women living in Ireland aged between 25 and 60 years. A successful national programme has the potential to cut mortality rates from cervical cancer by up to 80%.

I understand that under the auspices of this group there is ongoing monitoring and clean up exercises undertaken at both local and national level which is supported by the Primary Care Reimbursement Service.

In addition, it is proposed that:Any savings up to €36,000 (single) / €72,000 (couple) will be disregarded and only interest from savings above these figures will be considered as income for means testing purposes.Income will not be imputed from property (whether a family home, a holiday home or any other property) for means testing purposes, unless it is rented and only the net rental income will be included as income.  The income to be assessed will be the gross income, less any cost necessarily incurred associated with the property and such cost may include insurance premia, loan/mortgage repayments, maintenance, etc.Only dividend payments will be considered as income for means testing purposes in the context of shares and investments.Where a person receives money as a gift, only the interest which such monies earn will be taken into account and not the capital.It is intended to disregard income from prescribed repayments made under Section 8 of the Health (Repayment Scheme) Act 2006.  The detailed arrangements to provide for this will be finalised shortly.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	512	The Government recently announced, as part of its budget proposals, the withdrawal of automatic entitlement to the medical card from people aged 70 years and over and the introduction of new income thresholds for entitlement to a medical card for those aged 70 and over of €700 (gross) per week for a single person and €1,400 (gross) per week for a couple.  Legislation, which will give effect to these changes, will be enacted before the end of 2008 and will come into effect on 1st January 2009.The arrangements set out in the legislation will provide that persons aged 70 and over who automatically acquired their medical card on age grounds before 31st December 2008 will self-assess for medical card eligibility.  In the case of persons reaching age 70  on or after 1 January 2009, the intention is that they would be required to apply formally for a medical card, to confirm in their application that their income is below the specified limits and to provide appropriate supporting evidence.  The legislation will include appropriate provisions in relation to validating the initial self-assessments and the eligibility of those granted medical cards in future under the new arrangements.  It is not possible at this time to estimate the cost of administering these arrangements but full regard will be had to the need to balance cost-effectiveness and probity in the use of public funds.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	513	Chapter 7 of the Health Service Executive's (HSE) Medical Card / GP Visit Card National Assessment Guidelines states the following:"As a matter of policy, which can be altered at any time, and in the interest of fairness the following shall apply:If a person who previously qualified for a Medical Card / GP Visit Card and on subsequent review finds that s/he is no longer eligible due to a policy change in relation to certain disregards of income and/or other policy changes, such Medical Cards / GP Visit Cards will be renewable for a once off period of 3 years from the date of renewal. The decision maker should notify the person at that stage that the card will be renewed for 3 years and thereafter the Saver Clause will no longer apply and s/he must be assessed under the guidelines applicable at the time".I am advised by the HSE that the assessment guidelines were issued to promote consistency and fairness in deciding eligibility throughout the HSE.  In that context an administrative decision was taken by the HSE to insert a ‘saver clause' to support the transitional implementation of the guidelines and the delivery of consistent decision making and a standardised appeals system.  The HSE has advised that the Assessment Guidelines only refer to operational policies as set down by the HSE.  The ‘saver clause' is not intended to deal with statutory changes to the scheme, as this is not within the competence of the HSE.The HSE has also confirmed that when it inserted the "saver clause" in its assessment guidelines, it was not its intention that it would apply to non means tested medical cards, such as card holders aged 70 and over and EU cases, as the HSE would not have been reviewing the eligibility of this cohort of people.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	514	I propose to take Questions Nos. 210, 211 and 272 together.Following the recent Government decision to withdraw automatic entitlement to a medical card for persons aged 70 and over and to raise the means assessment threshold for persons in that age cohort, it is estimated that approximately 5% (20,000) of the current medical card holders aged 70 and over will no longer qualify for a medical card.  It is estimated that this will result in a saving of approximately €20 million in 2009, taking account of GP capitation fees, drug costs, superannuation costs, etc.  The estimate of 5% of persons aged 70 and over, who will lose automatic entitlement to a medical card as a result of this measure, was based on the best available information from the Central Statistics Office (CSO) and the EU wide Survey on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC), which is conducted by the CSO to obtain information on the income and living conditions of different types of households.In relation to the introduction of a single GP capitation rate, the Government appointed Mr. Eddie Sullivan to make recommendations on a new single annual capitation fee to be paid to general practitioners in respect of medical card holders aged 70 and over in the community.  Mr. Sullivan recommended a single capitation fee of €290, which would come into effect, subject to the proposed legislative changes, from 1st January 2009.  Mr. Sullivan's recommendations were accepted by Government last week.  Mr. Sullivan estimated that this would generate savings of the order of €16 million in 2009.The Government believe that there is potential for significant savings of at least €64 million in drug costs, without compromising on patient care.  Accordingly, it has decided to establish a process under the chairmanship of Dr. Michael Barry, to develop recommendations for good practice which will secure safe and effective prescribing for patients, while maximising the potential for economy in the use of public funds.  The initial report from Dr. Barry will be prepared by 1st December 2008.  The Government is satisfied that there is significant potential for savings arising from this prescribing initiative.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	515	My Department and the Health Service Executive (HSE) have been reviewing the pharmaceutical supply chain, from manufacturers and wholesalers through to community pharmacists, with a view to seeking value for money in the State's drugs bill. New agreements with the propriety and generic manufacturers (Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association/Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Ireland respectively), in place from September 2006, provide increased value for money for the State and the consumer through a reduction in the price of existing drugs and medicines coming off patent and through the use of a wider basket of countries for pricing new drugs.Over the period of the agreements, which run to 2010, the HSE expects to achieve savings of the order of €250 million across the General Medical Services and community drugs schemes, and in the cost of drugs to hospitals, through two off-patent price cuts, totalling 35%, for drugs with substitutable alternatives. In addition to the savings quantified, there will be further savings as generic manufacturers respond to the lower price of branded drugs, through the use of a wider basket of 9 countries (previously 5) for pricing new medicines, and through two price reviews for new medicines over the term of the agreements.The Government remains of the view that the cost of pharmacy services under the GMS and community drugs schemes is not sustainable and must be reduced to a more reasonable level. Expenditure on the medical card, drug payment and other demand-led schemes is approximately €2.6 billion and represents 18% of HSE current expenditure.  The average annual increase in expenditure in recent years has been 13%.  This rate of increase cannot be sustained.  It has been decided to introduce a range of further measures in 2009 to slow the rate of increase in these schemes and generate savings of €175m. These measures include an increase in the threshold for the Drug Payment Scheme from €90 to €100 a month; new guidelines on the prescribing of nutritional supplements; and other measures to reduce drug costs. These savings required by the 2009 budgetary framework will be achieved through the ending of automatic entitlement to a medical card for those with incomes in excess of the new threshold and through economies in drug usage.In this regard, I have decided to establish a process under the Chairmanship of Dr. Michael Barry, to develop recommendations for good practice which will secure safe and effective prescribing for patients while maximising the potential for economy in the use of public funds. The initial report from Dr. Barry will be prepared by 1st December. I am satisfied that there is significant scope for savings arising from this prescribing initiative. I will shortly be announcing the terms of reference for the group to be chaired by Dr Barry and I am hopeful that this group can achieve the necessary savings in accordance with the budgetary strategy.

The income to be assessed will be the gross income, less any cost necessarily incurred associated with the property and such cost may include insurance premia, loan/mortgage repayments, maintenance, etc.In relation to persons under 70 years of age, the following assessment currently applies: In respect of property (excluding the family home), where land/buildings are leased to another person, the income to be assessed will be the gross income, less any cost necessarily incurred associated with the property and such cost may include insurance premia, loan/mortgage repayments, maintenance, etc.Where land/buildings, which are not being used but are capable of being leased or sold, the following assessment options can be used, with the more beneficial option applying to the applicant:Notional assessment of the rental/lease "going rate" for the area.Assessment of capital value as set out below.The verified capital value of the property less any outstanding mortgage is assessed using the following formula:The first €20,000 of property for a single person will be disregarded and €40,000 for a couple will be disregarded.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	528	Under the Health Act 1970, eligibility for health services in Ireland is primarily based on residency and means.  Any person, regardless of nationality or citizenship, who is accepted by the Health Service Executive (HSE) as being ordinarily resident in Ireland is entitled to either full eligibility (Category 1, i.e. medical card holders) or limited eligibility (Category 2) for health services.  At present, medical cards (full eligibility) are granted primarily on the basis of means and individual circumstances.  The question of citizenship does not arise in determining eligibility under the Health Act 1970.Entitlement to health care in Ireland may also arise under the provisions of Regulation (EC) 1408/71, which coordinates health and social security arrangements among EU member states (it also applies in the remaining EEA member states and Switzerland).  Under these provisions, people who are insured with (covered by) the health care system of one EU member state are entitled to receive health care in the public system of another member state in certain circumstances, at the cost of the member state in which they are insured.  Such persons may include people who are employed in one member state and resident in another and their dependants, pensioners of one member state who reside in another and their dependants and visitors to one member state from another.  The provisions of Regulation (EC) 1408/71 supersede national eligibility provisions.  Persons residing or staying in Ireland who are covered by these provisions are entitled free of charge to all medical treatment provided for by Irish legislation, where the cost of this treatment is payable by a member state other than Ireland; those residing here receive a medical card as evidence of their entitlement under the Regulation.

As the Deputy may be aware, capital grant applications under the NCIP are assessed, in the first instance, by the County Child care Committees and are prioritised on the basis of local child care need.  In 2008, each Committee was given an indicative capital budget and was asked to prioritise applications on this basis.  In some cases, including the project in question, additional applications in excess of the indicative budgets were prioritised on the basis that some additional scope for approvals might arise in 2008.  However, as this is not the case, the application in question cannot be finally assessed at this point.  I understand that a further round of capital applications is expected to be assessed in 2009 and the County Child care Committees may wish to re-prioritise this application at that time.

When a person's means are in excess of the relevant income guidelines, the Health Service Executive may issue a medical card on a discretionary basis, having considered if the applicant would otherwise be caused undue hardship in providing general medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants.As part of the means test, any savings up to €36,000 (single) / €72,000 (couple) will be disregarded and only interest from savings above these figures will be considered as income for means testing purposes.  Income will not be imputed from property (whether a family home, a holiday home or any other property) for means testing purposes, unless it is rented and only the net rental income will be included as income.  The income to be assessed will be the gross income, less any cost necessarily incurred associated with the property and such cost may include insurance premia, loan/mortgage repayments, maintenance etc.  Only dividend payments will be considered as income for means testing purposes in the context of shares and investments.The HSE will shortly write to all persons aged 70 and over.  This letter will clarify the various issues that have arisen and will ask persons whose income is above €700 per week (gross) for a single person and €1,400 per week (gross) for a married couple to notify their circumstances to the HSE.

The new scheme will apply to public and voluntary nursing homes and to approved private nursing homes. In order to become approved for the purposes of the scheme, a private nursing home must be registered under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990 at present and, in the future, under the Health Act 2007 (once the relevant sections are commenced; have agreed a price for the purposes of the scheme with the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF)); hold a valid tax clearance certificate.The Nursing Home Subvention Scheme does not apply to private hospitals unless they are also registered as private nursing homes. The same will be the case for the Nursing Homes Support Scheme. It does not specifically exclude private hospitals from the scheme, rather it sets out the criteria a facility must meet in order to be included.Therefore, with regard to the specific hospital mentioned by the Deputy, this hospital will qualify for the scheme only if it is a registered private nursing home and meets the conditions for approval as set out above.

In accordance with the legislation, private bus operators apply to my Department for licences to operate scheduled bus passenger services within the State.It is open to any operator to submit proposals to my Department concerning the provision of bus services and my Department will consider any such proposal received. Guidelines for applicants are available from my Department  at www.transport.ie. While there are no statutory quantitative restrictions imposed on the availability of licences, all applications are considered within the framework of the 1932 Act and the guidelines deal with such matters as eligibility and the legislative provisions affecting the grant or refusal of a licence.In general my Department now turns around straightforward applications within a matter of weeks. However, where there are prior applications for licences from other private operators or notifications from State Companies a decision on applications must be deferred until such time as the prior application has been decided.While there have been improvements to the administration of the licensing system, I have consistently stated that the 1932 Act is in need of review and legislation is being prepared in this regard as a matter of priority. It is my intention that proposals for a new bus licensing regime will be contained in a Public Transport Regulation Bill which will deal with the replacement of the Road Transport Act 1932 and the provisions of the Transport Act 1958 that relate to the provision of bus services by the State Bus Companies. I envisage that the new licensing structure will apply in respect of all commercial bus services, including those provided by Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann. The new Bill will also encompass provisions relating to the subvented bus market outside the Greater Dublin Area.

The terms of reference for the consultancy are as follows:  To assess whether the resources (buses, people and funding) currently available to the companies are used in the most effective and efficient way possible to deliver an optimum public transport service and more particularly to:Assess the effectiveness and appropriateness of the network of services currently provided by Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann for public transport users and of their planning and management of the network including the criteria used for route selection and amendment, frequency setting and adjustment, service variations during weekday/ weekend, extent of peak/off peak provision, integration with other public transport services etc.Assess the operational efficiency of Dublin Bus & Bus Éireann with particular reference to resource utilisation (including bus scheduling and staff scheduling and rostering) and operational costs. This should include an examination of the utilisation of buses to determine whether the fleet is deployed in the most efficient and effective manner. The assessment should also examine the management of direct costs and overheads and of the issues (e.g. human resource, organisational etc), which might impact on the delivery of services to public transport users.Identify any issues (e.g. human resource, organisational) adversely impacting on the efficiency, effectiveness and sustainability of service delivery, indicating whether these issues are within management control.Make recommendations in relation to actions required to enhance efficiency, effectiveness and reliability of the delivery of public transport services. Each recommendation to be assessed in relation to its implications for the financial viability of the companies and the impact on the need for Exchequer support.While future investment decisions have not been delayed, the funding of further new buses will be considered in the light of the outcome of this review and the available funding. I expect the reviews to be completed in the coming weeks.

Subsequently, the Taxi Regulation Act 2003, which provides the legislative basis for the licensing and operation of small public service vehicles generally, does not provide a basis for the application of quantitative controls on the issue of licences for any such vehicles. The Commission for Taxi Regulation does not, therefore, have any remit or statutory power under the Taxi Regulation Act 2003 in relation to the control of the number of licences issued.  The Deputy may wish to note that, since September 2006, there is one single national taximeter area for the entire country.

#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	564	When the Marine Casualty Board (MCIB) publishes a report into an incident it forwards a copy of it to my Department.As soon as possible after receiving it, my Department undertakes an initial assessment of the recommendations of the report relevant to the Department. The report is then submitted to me with the preliminary views of my Department on the relevant recommendations.Some recommendations lend themselves to early implementation, for example the issue of a Marine Notice bringing particular information or advice to the attention of a specific sector or sectors. Frequently, however, recommendations are more complex and require detailed assessment, consultation with  interested parties and in some instances the introduction of new or amending legislation. In such instances the recommendations will be fully considered and proposals developed as appropriate as part of my Department's ongoing work programme, in the overall context of delivering improved maritime safety.It may be the case that following consideration of a particular recommendation that it is concluded that the  course of action recommended may not be feasible or the most appropriate and that an alternative approach may be preferable.  Such a conclusion would usually be arrived at following detailed examination by my Department's marine safety experts and consultation with relevant interests.I consider that the current system of assessing MCIB recommendations is working well but it will be kept under review.

They were refused asylum, following the consideration of their claims by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), the first named person concerned was informed, by letter dated 12 September 2005, that the Minister proposed to make Deportation Orders in respect of him and his daughter. He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of Deportation Orders or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he and his daughter should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.  Representations were submitted on their behalf at that time.Following consideration of their case under Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement, the Minister signed Deportation Orders in respect of the first named person concerned and his daughter on 22 March 2006.  These Deportation Orders were formally served by letter dated 24 March 2006.On the 10 May 2006, an application was made on behalf of the daughter of the first named person concerned requesting that she be re-admitted to the asylum process in accordance with the provisions of Section 17 (7) of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended).  Following consideration of this application, the application was refused and this decision was conveyed by letter dated 4 September 2006.  The first named person concerned and his aforementioned daughter remain the subjects of Deportation Orders.The second named person concerned claimed asylum in the State on 23 December 2004.  Her application was refused following the consideration of her claim by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), the second named person concerned was informed, by letter dated 20 May 2008, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of her.  She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why she should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.  In addition, she was notified of her entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006).The second named person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with these Regulations and, following consideration of this application, it was determined that she was not eligible for Subsidiary Protection in the State.  She was notified of this decision by letter dated 30 October 2008.The case file of the second named person concerned, including all representations submitted, will now be considered under Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement. When this consideration has been completed, the case file of the second named person concerned is passed to me for decision.The couple's other two children have lodged separate asylum applications. It is not the practice to comment in detail on individual asylum applications where a final decision has not been made.As the Deputy will be aware, applications for refugee status in the State are determined by an independent process comprising the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal which make recommendations to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on whether such status should be granted.A final decision on each application is made following receipt of the recommendation of the Refugee Applications Commissioner or the decision of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, as appropriate.

His application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.The person concerned initiated Judicial Review Proceedings against the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, challenging the decision of the Tribunal in his case. These Proceedings were ‘settled' resulting in the person concerned being afforded a fresh hearing before the Tribunal. This fresh Hearing took place but again the Refugee Appeals Tribunal concluded that the person concerned did not meet the criteria for recognition as a refugee.Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 28 October 2008, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.

The Community Garda for the area has attended several meetings with local residents from the area, the most recent being on 28 October.  The issues raised by the residents are receiving ongoing Garda attention, and the number of public disorder and anti-social incidents recorded in recent weeks has decreased, following the issue of fixed charge penalty notices to persons involved in such incidents.The area concerned is regularly patrolled by uniform and plain-clothes units, including the Community Policing Unit.  Patrols are supplemented by the District Garda Mountain Bike Unit and Detective and Drugs Units, the Divisional Crime Task Force and Traffic Corps personnel.Current policing plans in the area are designed to address issues of crime and public order offences.  Community policing is a central feature and core value of Garda policing policy.  Current policing strategies are predicated on the prevention of crime, public order offences and anti-social behaviour.  This will ensure an environment conducive to the improvement of the quality of life for residents in the community.  This strategy is, and will continue to be, central to the delivery of a policing service to the area in question. Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 28 October 2008, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.

Coolock, Raheny, Howth, Santry and Clontarf Garda Stations all form part of the Dublin Metropolitan Region North.  The personnel strength of the Juvenile Liaison Officers assigned to this Division on 30 September 2008 was 11.The number of Community Gardaí attached to each of these stations on 31 December 2005-2007 and on 30 September 2008, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was as set out in the following table:Station31/12/0531/12/0631/12/0730/09/08Coolock791311Raheny4666Howth5464Santry5345Clontarf5675It is, of course, the case that all Gardaí have a role to play in addressing  community policing issues as and when the need arises.  In that sense, community policing involves far more than a single unit within the Garda Síochána, and I agree with the view expressed by the Garda Inspectorate in their third report entitled "Policing in Ireland—Looking Forward" that community policing is a fundamental policing philosophy and that there is a strong foundation for it in Ireland. I am also looking forward to receiving from the Commissioner, in the near future, a copy of the final report of a working group developing proposals for a comprehensive model of rural and urban community policing.There is one Crime Prevention Officer allocated to each Garda Division throughout the country. The Crime Prevention Officer for the DMR North Division is based at Ballymun Garda Station.The Deputy will appreciate that, as with any large organisation, on any given day, the personnel strength of Garda divisions and stations may fluctuate due, for example, to promotions, retirements and transfers.It is the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner to allocate all resources, including personnel, throughout the Force taking everything into account. The situation will be kept under review and when additional personnel next become available the allocation of Gardaí to these stations will be fully considered by the Commissioner within the overall context of policing requirements throughout the country.

While the applicants were of many nationalities, the top six countries of origin were as follows:CountryNumberNigeria6,145Romania1,795China1,074Philippines993Pakistan613Moldova567To date, in excess of 14,100 applicants have been granted renewal of the IBC/05 permission for a further three years.  Some 2,000 Romanian and Bulgarian citizens who were granted permission to remain under the scheme do not now have to apply to have their permission renewed.This permission, once registered with the Garda National Immigration Bureau, entitles applicants to work in the State without the need for a work permit and to set up a business without my permission.

Following on from my answer, the person concerned was refused subsidiary protection and informed of this by letter dated 21 October 2008.  The person concerned is required to present herself at the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), 13-14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2 on Tuesday, 11th November 2008 in order to make travel arrangements for her removal from the State.If the person concerned can demonstrate new facts or circumstances it is open for her to make an application pursuant to section 3(11) of the Immigration Act, 1999 seeking revocation of the Deportation Order.  However such an application is not suspensive of the deportation process.The effect of the Deportation Order is that the person concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter out of the State.  The enforcement of the Deportation Order is operational matter for the Garda National Immigration Bureau.

I have requested the CSO to provide the statistics sought by the Deputy directly to her.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	578	It is not possible, without a disproportionate expenditure of staff resources, to provide the information in precisely the format requested by the Deputy.  In this respect, it must be borne in mind that asylum seekers are not allocated to particular centres based on their nationality, the current status of their asylum claim or their length of time in the asylum process.  Information as to the mean average length of time in the asylum process or the nationality profile of asylum seekers resident in any particular centre would have no practical application or value.Therefore, I propose to indicate the profile of the centre specified by the Deputy and explain, in general terms, the processing times in the asylum process.The Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) is responsible for the accommodation of asylum seekers in accordance with the Government policy of direct provision.  Direct provision provides full board accommodation and certain ancillary services to asylum seekers while their applications for asylum are being processed.  In addition to direct provision accommodation, the RIA operates a small number of self-catering units where residents cook for themselves and avail of a reduced rate of Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA).  These units are free of rent and utility costs to the asylum seekers and the reduced rate of SWA takes into account this benefit-in-kind.  Such units normally provide accommodation to persons with certain special needs which can best be addressed outside of the standard direct provision service.The centre at Davis Lane Apartments, Mallow is such a self-catering centre. There are currently 35 persons registered as resident at the centre, representing 12 nationalities.In relation to average processing times, the length of time taken to process asylum applications differs depending on whether an applicant is dealt with under prioritised arrangements or not.  With effect from the 25 January 2005, new arrangements for the speedier processing of applications from certain countries were implemented.  These arrangements apply in the main to nationals of Nigeria, Croatia and South Africa.  They also applied to Romania and Bulgaria prior to their accession to the EU on 1 January 2007.In terms of the average time taken to process applications at first instance — by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner — the average processing time for prioritised cases is 17-20 working days from the date of application.  For non-prioritised cases, the average processing time is 20-23 weeks from the date of application.I would point out that some cases take significantly longer to complete due to, for example, delays arising from medical issues, non-availability of interpreters or because of judicial review proceedings.  Further complexity arises because of the fact that applicants are from over 90 different countries.  Applicants continue to be scheduled for interview on the date of application unless there are medical or other compelling reasons not to do so.The Refugee Applications Commissioner continues to keep the procedures for processing applications for refugee status under review.  The objective remains to expedite the processing of asylum applications at first instance without compromising the applicants' rights to a fair and balanced examination of their case.Appeals against recommendations made by the Refugee Applications Commissioner are dealt with by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  The Tribunal advises that the average length of time taken by it to process and complete substantive appeals is 27 weeks.  For prioritised cases, this processing time is 11 weeks.  For accelerated appeals (appeals on papers only), the processing time is 8 weeks.As with first instance applications, the above average processing times in the Tribunal can be longer in certain cases.  Many factors such as adjournments, postponements, judicial reviews and requests by legal representatives for access to previous Tribunal decisions can impede the Tribunal from completing cases earlier.  High quality, consistent and fair decision making in all cases continues to be a high priority in the Tribunal.

This may occur as part of specific road traffic law enforcement activity or of general policing activity.  As part of this activity, members of An Garda Síochána carry out planned and unplanned checkpoints, including those carried out under Operation Anvil and mandatory alcohol testing checkpoints.I am informed by the Garda authorities that it is not possible to provide the information requested by the Deputy without a disproportionate expenditure of Garda time and resources.An Garda Síochána has increased, as part of a multi-agency approach, enforcement in the area of road haulage, so as to identify unlicensed haulage activity and non-compliance by road hauliers with relevant legislation.  In this regard a series of initiatives has taken place during 2008.  An Garda Síochána also conducts on an ongoing basis initiatives to increase driver awareness and promote an improved compliance culture among road-users.

My Department is, of course, available to assist them in every practical way that is possible. I consider there is sufficient funding provided for both bodies in 2009 to enable them to discharge their core functions.  I would also remind the Deputy that the provision in 2009 for the Equality Tribunal, the body which adjudicates on claims of inequality, has been increased by 15%.In relation to the matter of integrating administrative and back office facilities with a view to maximising operating efficiencies in both bodies, my department is currently assisting the Agencies in examining the issues which will need to be addressed to achieve these efficiencies.  These issues are likely to include shared IT and telecommunications facilities as well as office accommodation which is being addressed in the context of the decentralisation to Roscrea of further elements of the Equality Authority.

With regard to the child's mother, citizens of Thailand wishing to enter the State for whatever purpose are required to be in possession of a valid Irish visa.  It is open to an individual to make a visa application for any purpose, the onus resting with the applicant to satisfy the Visa Officer as to why the visa should be granted.Also, it should be borne in mind that a visa is merely a pre-entry clearance to seek permission to enter the State — no automatic right of entry or residence is conferred.  Whether the person is permitted to enter and the exact period for which s/he is allowed to remain is a matter for the Immigration Officer at the port of entry.Comprehensive information when making a visa application is available on the website of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service — www.inis.gov.ie.Where a person has been granted permission to enter the State, the person may seek an extension of their permission to remain in the State by writing to the General Immigration Division of my Department, outlining the individual circumstances of their case and their future intentions in the State.  All applications are processed by the Immigration Division on a case by case basis.

The 1875 Act was amended by the Criminal Justice Act, 2006 which  came into effect in August 2006, to provide for new offences governing the possession of illegally imported fireworks with intent to supply.  They also provided for significantly increased penalties governing the illegal importation, sale and use of fireworks.Under the provisions, it is an offence:for any person to possess a firework with intent to sell or supply, without a licenceto throw an ignited firework at any person or property, andto light unlicensed fireworks in a public placeThe penalty for such offences is now a fine of up to €10,000 or 5 years imprisonment or both.  The simple possession of fireworks without a licence is also an offence for which a person may be liable to a fine of up to €10,000.Given the new offences and increased penalties that now exist, the enforcement capability of An Garda Síochána is greatly strengthened in combatting the illegal importation, sale and use of fireworks.  In this regard, I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that  the number of  seizures are as follows:YearNo. of SeizuresValue (Approx.)€20082824,00020076431,307200676115,286Figures for 2008 are up to 21st October.

This includes the promotion of the integration of legal immigrants into Irish society, the establishment of new structures for this purpose, the management of the resettlement of refugees admitted as part of the United Nations Resettlement Programme and the administration of funding from national and EU sources to promote integration.Minister of State Barry Andrews has responsibility for the Children Act 2001 which encompasses child detention schools and includes functions such as making regulations and designating and certifying schools.  Minister of State Andrews is based primarily in the Department of Health and Children where he exercises his other responsibilities.  He does not have a private office or related staff in my Department.Minister of State John Moloney has special responsibility for equality, disability issues and mental health.  Minister of State Moloney is also based at the Department of Health and Children where he exercises his other functions.  He does not have a private office or related staff in my Department.

In this connection, I wish to refer  the Deputy to my Reply to Parliamentary Question No. 818 of 17 June 2008.The Deputy will be aware that not all young people under eighteen years are formally charged following arrest as other options are also available to the Gardaí in certain circumstances, for example, the Garda Juvenile Diversion programme.  Furthermore, a number of cases that come before the Courts are disposed of by way of non custodial sentences with detention viewed as a last resort.  It is the case therefore that arrest and detention numbers are not directly related.Since 1st March, 2007, responsibility for the management of the children detention schools transferred to my Department from the Department of Education and Science.  Boys aged under 16 and girls under 18 are detained in these schools while boys convicted at 16 and 17 are detained in St. Patrick's Institution which is managed by the Irish Prison Service.  The operational costs of the detention schools are provided in the following table for 2001-2007 on the basis of records transferred from the Department of Education and Science.  It should be noted that the figures may not be directly comparable year-on-year as pre-2006 figures include the pay costs of teachers in the education centres within the schools, and St. Joseph's Special School, Clonmel, ceased to be a detention school on 1st March 2007.YearOperational Costs of Children  DetentionSchools€m200122.4200226.6200326.9200428.2200527.0200627.7200722.9As St. Patrick's Institution is not used solely for the detention of sixteen and seventeen year old boys, it is not possible to provide the Deputy with the annual cost of keeping that specific age group at the Institution.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	604	The temporary release of prisoners is provided for in legislation by virtue of the Criminal Justice Act, 1960 as amended by the Criminal Justice (Temporary Release of Prisoners) Act, 2003. The Act provides that the Minister for Justice may direct the temporary release of a person in certain circumstances and these are:For the purpose of assessing the person's ability to reintegrate into society;For the purpose of preparing the person for release on the expiration of his sentence;For the purpose of assisting the Garda Síochána in the prevention, detection or investigation of offences, or the apprehension of a person guilty or suspected of those offences;On grounds of health or other humanitarian grounds;Where it is necessary to ensure the good governance of prisons or maintain good order, humane and just management of a prison;Where the Minister is of the view that the person has been rehabilitated and is capable of reintegrating into society.Temporary release is a feature of prison systems worldwide. It is an important vehicle for re-integrating an offender into the community in a planned way. The generally accepted view is that the risk to the community is reduced by planned re-integration of offenders compared with their return to the community on the completion of their full sentence. Each case is examined on its own merits and the safety of the public is paramount when decisions are made. In addition, all releases are subject to conditions, which in the vast majority of cases include a requirement to report on a regular basis to the offender's Garda Station. Of course, any offender who breaches his or her conditions may be arrested and returned to prison immediately by the Gardaí.Candidates for temporary release are identified by a number of different means but primarily on the recommendation of the Prison Governor or the therapeutic services in the prisons. The prisoner, their family or their legal representative can also apply for consideration of such a concession.Recommendations are also made to me in relation to long term sentence prisoners by the Parole Board. It is very important to note that it does not necessarily follow that a prisoner will receive temporary release even if the recommendation is to that effect. Before a final determination a number of factors may be taken into account including:the nature and gravity of the offence to which the sentence being served by the person relatesthe sentence concerned and any recommendation made by the Court in relation to the sentence imposedthe period of the sentence served by the personthe potential threat to the safety and security of the public should the person be releasedthe person's previous criminal recordthe risk of the person failing to return to prison at the expiration of the period of temporary releasethe conduct of the person while in custody or while previously on temporary releaseany report or recommendation made by the Governor, the Garda Síochána, a Probation & Welfare Officer, or any other person whom the Minister considers may be of assistance in coming to a decision as to whether to grant temporary releasethe risk that the person might commit an offence during any period of temporary releasethe risk of the person failing to comply with any of the conditions of temporary releasethe likelihood that a period of temporary release might accelerate the person's reintegration into society or improve his prospects of obtaining employmentThe Courts have determined that, with the exception of debtors or those serving a sentence for contempt of court, no category of sentenced prisoner can be excluded from being considered for temporary release. The periods of temporary release granted can vary greatly from a few hours following a family bereavement to, for example, a requirement to report to the prison every 12 months in the case of a life sentence prisoner who has been released into the community a considerable time ago.

Their application was refused and Deportation Orders were signed in respect of them on 11 August 2006.  The applicant instituted Judicial Review proceedings on 18 September 2006 challenging the Deportation Orders made in respect of her and her four children and accordingly, as the matter is sub judice, I do not propose to comment further.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	607	The issue of extraordinary rendition has been raised on numerous occasions in this House. As has been made repeatedly clear, the Government is completely opposed to the practice of the extraordinary rendition of prisoners.I wish to reiterate at the outset that none of the various investigations into allegations of extraordinary rendition have revealed any evidence, or even resulted in a specific allegation, that any person has on any occasion been subjected to extraordinary rendition through Ireland, including in the case mentioned by the Deputy.  The Government has received specific assurances from the US authorities that such prisoners have not been transferred through Irish territory, nor would they be, without our permission. These assurances have been confirmed at the highest level, including by Secretary of State Rice to my predecessor as Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Dermot Ahern T.D. and by President Bush to the former Taoiseach. The assurances are of a clear and categoric nature, relating to facts and circumstances within the full knowledge and control of the US Government.The Government has established a Cabinet Committee on Aspects of International Human Rights. As part of its remit, the Committee has reviewed the Programme for Government commitments in relation to our opposition to extraordinary rendition. The Committee has agreed that early contact should be made with the new US administration to seek a clear statement of intent that extraordinary rendition would cease and would not resume during the new President's term of office. Commitments are also being sought in regard to the closure of Guantanamo Bay and to the prohibition of intensive interrogation techniques such as water-boarding which are internationally considered to constitute torture. I have asked our Ambassador in Washington to follow up on this as a matter of urgency.With a view to strengthening as necessary the legislative provisions, the Committee is also to review the statutory powers currently available to the civil and police authorities regarding the search and inspection of aircraft, in the context of the obligations on the State under the Chicago Convention.

In recent weeks the Consul General has been in close contact with senior officials in the Scottish Government in relation to incidents of sectarianism of the kind referred to in the question. Following from these discussions, I am assured that tangible new steps to tackle sectarianism and racism in sport are currently being reviewed by the Scottish Government. I am also aware of ongoing efforts by the football authorities in Scotland to discourage this kind of behaviour. I am hopeful that the proposed measures will help to improve the situation. The Consulate General will continue to monitor closely, and to keep me apprised of developments.
#PeterPowerFF	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-party	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-dob	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	609	Ireland has played an important role internationally on the issue of alleviation of the debt burden on developing countries. The Government's policy strategy was prepared jointly by the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Finance, and was launched in 2002. It supports the total cancellation of the debts of the world's poorest countries. It is intended that a review of the strategy will be undertaken jointly by the two Departments in 2009.Ireland's bilateral assistance to the developing world has always been exclusively in the form of grants rather than loans. The Government has also provided very significant resources for initiatives to ease or cancel the debt burden. There are two main international instruments which address the problem of the debt burden, the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) and the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative. The MDRI came into effect on 1 July 2006, and provides for cancellation of eligible debt from the World Bank, the African Development bank and the International Monetary Fund for many of the world's poorest and most indebted countries. Ireland's share of the total cost of debt relief provided by the World Bank under MDRI is €58.64 million. The Government contributed this amount in full in 2006. Ireland has also contributed over €20 million to the HIPC initiative, which is implemented by the World Bank and the IMF, with the objective of reducing the debt burden of qualifying countries to sustainable levels.We regard it as important to ensure that these international efforts are not undermined by further irresponsible lending or borrowing. The Government supports the development of an international consensus on responsible lending and borrowing procedures and I welcome the dialogue which the World Bank has opened with civil society groups on the complex issues involved.

It also has a coordinating role in relation to Overseas Development Assistance administered by other Government Departments.Mr. Dick Roche, T.D., is Minister of State at my Department and at the Department of the Taoiseach with special responsibility for European Affairs.Minister Roche chairs an Interdepartmental Coordinating Committee on European Union Affairs, which covers the full range of issues on the EU agenda.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	611	There has been a substantial improvement in security in Iraq over the past eighteen months, although the level of violence remains quite high. Control of security has now been returned to Iraqi forces in all but five of Iraq's eighteen provinces. A large part of the improvement has been the general subsidence of inter-community sectarian violence. It is a matter of particular concern, therefore, that the city of Mosul has seen a resurgence of sectarian violence in recent months, much of it directed at the ancient Chaldean and Assyrian Christian communities who live in the city and its hinterland.The Chaldean Archbishop, Paulos Rahho, was kidnapped and later found dead in March 2008. It is possible he succumbed to poor health while in captivity, and his kidnapping may have been criminal rather than political in intent. More recently, however, there has been an upsurge of clearly sectarian attacks on Christian families and communities in Mosul through August and September. Many have been killed, houses and businesses have been destroyed, and over 12,000 are estimated to have fled the city for refuge in Christian villages in the surrounding plain.Mosul has long been a particular flashpoint. It is regarded as the major remaining stronghold in Iraq of both former Baathist and Al-Qaeda linked insurgents. It is on the fringes of Kurdish controlled territory. It is home to very long established Christian and other minorities, such as Turcomen, and also to numbers of comparatively recently settled Shia from southern Iraq, who were forcibly resettled there by the former regime. And it is the centre of one of Iraq's major oilfields. No clear picture has emerged yet of which group may be behind these attacks, which may be linked to the question of political control after the anticipated withdrawal of US forces, and to current political debate about provincial boundaries and autonomy.Christians and other minorities in Iraq have been especially vulnerable in the sectarian violence of recent years, since they have no area they control and to which they can flee. As a result, as many as half of the Iraqi Christian community may have fled the country, many to make new lives permanently in other countries. This is a tragedy which has befallen some of the most ancient Christian communities in the world.The EU has in its contacts with the Iraqi Government stressed its responsibilities to protect all Iraqi citizens, and in particular vulnerable minorities. The Government has acknowledged this responsibility and pledged to make every effort to meet it. However, long term security for Iraq's minorities is likely to depend on the Government's success in combating violence as a whole.I will be discussing the situation in Iraq with my EU colleagues at the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 10 November, when I intend to raise this issue. It will be important for us to urge the Iraqi Government, beset as it is with many problems, to do everything it can to protect vulnerable groups.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	612	I am deeply concerned about the situation in Afghanistan. Very clear difficulties exist in the country in relation to security issues, human rights, governance and the rule of law, and narcotics. The security situation of course remains a particular cause for concern, including in areas along the Afghan-Pakistan border.In this context, I welcome the meeting of Pakistan and Afghan political and tribal leaders to which the Deputy refers. The cross-border dimension is very important. The tribal meeting, or "mini-jirga", was held in Islamabad on 27th and 28th October, and was a follow-up to the larger "jirga" meeting held in Kabul in August 2007. Reports suggest that some fifty participants were involved, including government officials, representatives of political parties and members of the ethnic Pashtun tribes that straddle the Afghan-Pakistan border.The holding of the "mini-jirga" reflects the recent improvement in relations between the governments of Pakistan and Afghanistan which has been apparent since the election of President Zardari in Pakistan on 9th September — and which is highly significant and very much to be welcomed. The Foreign Ministers of the two countries also met in New York in September and reiterated their resolve to fight jointly extremist elements along the Pakistan-Afghan border.We understand that the Taliban were not invited to the "jirga" but reports indicate that participants agreed to establish joint contacts, through the "jirga", with "the opposition" — understood to mean the Taliban. This could certainly involve risk, but the approach of trying to dissociate the many Taliban members who are not strongly ideological fundamentalists from their hardcore, militant, leadership — leaving the latter more vulnerable to defeat — may be a risk worth taking.The situation along the border remains extremely difficult and it is extremely difficult for the Pakistani military to operate effectively within its own border areas. While it remains to be seen whether the new Afghan-Pakistan security cooperation will lead to significant gains against cross-border terrorism and the insurgency, I very much hope that the "mini jirga" initiative of the two neighbouring leaders will succeed in its objectives.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	613	I have received a letter from the group to which the Deputy refers.The Government remains deeply concerned about the treatment of Falun Gong practitioners in China. Questions in this regard — including specific cases — are raised regularly with the Chinese authorities, within the context of our own regular discussions with them on issues of human rights and fundamental freedoms and through the EU-China Human Rights Dialogue.We viewed very seriously allegations that have been made claiming live organs have been harvested from Falun Gong practitioners in detention. Extensive enquiries on this issue were made by my Department within the EU and UN frameworks in 2006/7, as well as through our Embassy in Beijing and with a variety of human rights organisations. Enquiries were also addressed to the Chinese authorities. The matter is being kept under review but, to date, we have failed to identify sufficient reliable and independent evidence to substantiate the allegations.I am aware of both the specific cases referred to in the correspondence to which the Deputy refers.The case of the individual arrested on 16 June has been referred to our Embassy in Beijing and it is also being taken up with the Chinese Embassy in Dublin. The second case referred to was raised by the EU with China in the context of the EU-China Dialogue process earlier this year. The Chinese authorities have responded to this case, stating that no appeal has been launched against the three-year sentence imposed on him on 22 December 2006. However, I will ensure that the case is raised again both bilaterally and by the EU.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	614	More than six weeks after the signing of a power-sharing agreement between Robert Mugabe's ZANU-PF party, and the Tsvangirai and Mutambara factions of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), there has still been no agreement on forming a Government, and the situation in Zimbabwe remains deeply worrying. Although political violence has diminished, it has not stopped. The rate of inflation is almost impossible to calculate, but has now reached unimaginable levels. Coupled with this, unstable exchange rates have caused the Zimbabwe dollar to lose credibility and value as a trading currency. Zimbabweans are unwilling to do business in their local currency, and increasingly use foreign denominated currencies, principally the US dollar and the South African rand, for trading. Transactions such as grocery purchases, property sales and rentals, legal fees and fuel sales, among others, officially or unofficially now require settlement in foreign currency. The World Food Programme estimates that 5.1 million people will require food assistance by January 2009.The EU is continuing to act on its concern for the suffering of the ordinary people of Zimbabwe at this very difficult time. The European Commission has allocated an additional €10 million in relief assistance for people affected by the humanitarian crisis in Zimbabwe, while Irish aid to the affected people for the period 2006 to 2008 (to date) amounts to approx €25m.The failure of the two sides to reach a deal on 27 October on the allocation of Ministries is extremely disappointing. The issue has been referred to a full summit meeting of the South African Development Community (SADC). This summit has been set for 9 November in South Africa. Given the disappointing rate of progress in the talks on forming a Transition Government, I do not believe that my colleagues and I will be in a position to lift the EU restrictive measures on the Zimbabwean leadership when we next meet on 10 November. We will of course review what we can do to assist our African partners in bringing the ongoing negotiations to a successful conclusion. It is Zimbabwe's neighbours, and above all South Africa and other members of the South African Development Community (SADC) which have the greatest potential influence and leverage, and therefore the greatest responsibility to act. I have instructed our Ambassadors in SADC countries to convey our concerns to the authorities in these countries.EU Foreign Ministers stated after our meeting of 13 October that the EU stands ready to support a transitional government which is taking steps to restore democracy and the rule of law in Zimbabwe. That commitment stands, and the EU very much hopes that the forthcoming SADC summit will result in the formation of a government of national unity which is credible and reflects the will of the Zimbabwean people, as expressed at the 29 March elections. Ireland supports a co-ordinated international approach to addressing Zimbabwe's problems, once an administration is in place in Harare which is committed to working with the international community to rebuild the country economically and politically.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	615	Rwanda is one of the most stable countries in the Great Lakes region. It has made enormous progress in establishing peace, security and good governance since the genocide of 1994. Rwanda's stability is underpinned by strong levels of economic growth and it has won praise from international donors for its innovative approach to development.On 15 September last the country held its second parliamentary elections since the genocide, and these were won overwhelmingly by the ruling coalition, which is led by President Kagame's Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF). An EU election observation mission, in which three Irish observers participated, deemed the elections to have been generally free and fair. The mission described the elections as an important step in the democratic development of the country. I join the mission in welcoming the positive example that Rwanda has shown in electing the world's first female majority parliament.In November 2007, the governments of Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) signed the Nairobi agreement, aimed at reducing tensions between the two countries, and jointly tackling the problem of the FDLR, an extremist Hutu militia, which includes many Rwandans who fled the country after participating in the genocide. This was seen as a positive step in normalising the traditionally difficult relations between the two countries. However, the upsurge in violence in the North Kivu province of DRC since late August between the DRC army and the CNDP, a Tutsi-aligned militia, has re-ignited Rwanda-DRC tensions. Both countries have accused each other of incursions into their respective territories, and the UN has expressed serious concern over the reported exchange of heavy weapons fire across the DRC-Rwanda border in North Kivu. While North Kivu has borne the brunt of the humanitarian crisis, I will continue to monitor closely the situation in Rwanda, as the proximity of the fighting to the Rwandan border poses a risk of a spill-over of both the violence and the humanitarian crisis.There is a consensus in the international community that only the full implementation of the Nairobi agreement can bring long-term stability to the Great Lakes region. To this end, Ireland fully supports the excellent work of the EU's Special Representative to the Great Lakes, Roeland van de Geer, who has been most active in encouraging dialogue between the governments of DRC and Rwanda. Last week, the EU Commissioner for Development, Louis Michel, made an emergency visit to Kinshasa and Kigali, and urged the Presidents of both countries to find a diplomatic solution to the current crisis. My British and French counterparts, David Miliband and Bernard Kouchner, have also been engaged in vigorous diplomatic efforts over the past week, including a visit to Rwanda, where they met with President Kagame. Thanks largely to EU pressure, the governments of Rwanda and DRC will meet for peace talks in Kenya this week, in which the African Union and the EU will also participate.In addition, Ireland and the EU will continue to strongly support UN mediation efforts. UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, has dispatched a senior envoy to both Rwanda and DRC, while MONUC, the UN peacekeeping force in DRC, has presented an emergency disengagement plan to all sides in the North Kivu crisis. I join the UN in urging the governments of Rwanda and DRC to convince or compel all sides to accept the plan.African leadership will be vitally important in bringing the governments of Rwanda and DRC back to the negotiating table. South Africa in particular, which has played a key role in the Great Lakes peace process to date, and which enjoys good relations with both Kigali and Kinshasa, will be an important partner for the EU in ensuring the future stability of the region.Ireland will continue to support Rwanda's development through the provision of overseas development aid and bilateral co-operation. Irish Aid funding to the country since 2006 amounts to more than €8 million.

Out of a total budget contribution of €2,692,472 in 2008, for which this Department was responsible, the Youth Foundation item amounted to €33,073. The Council of Europe budget for 2009 has not yet been finalised, but we would anticipate that there will be a slight increase in Ireland's 2009 contribution, including its contribution to the Youth Foundation.Under the Communicating Europe Initiative (CEI) a number of youth oriented projects were funded in 2008, including €30,000 in respect of the European Youth Parliament. In addition, 6 school and youth based projects received CEI funding of €29,000 in 2008 to celebrate Europe Day. While the extent of the youth-affairs element of the Communicating Europe Initiative budget depends on the quantity and scope of the applications received, I would expect that a similar amount will be available in 2009.My Department, through Irish Aid, also provides funding to the National Youth Council of Ireland (NYCI) in respect of the National Youth Development Education Programme (NYDEP). It aims to integrate development education into the core programmes of youth organisations through support for training, activities and the provision of learning resources. Under the current three year partnership agreement (2007-2009), Irish Aid will provide total funding of €925,930 to the NYCI. The budget for the programme this year is €309,806 and €325,758 is allocated for 2009.My Department also supports measures by community, voluntary, and other groups aimed at promoting reconciliation and tackling sectarianism on an all-island basis. While not specifically directed at the youth sector, many of the programmes assisted by both the Reconciliation and Anti-Sectarian Funds have a focus on activities organised by, or aimed at, young people. In 2008 total provision in the area was €3m, and this level of support will be continued in 2009.The budget for the Irish Abroad emigrant support programme for this year is €15.183 million and the 2009 allocation is set to match this. While it has no specific youth affairs budget, some of the programme's funding is directed to support projects which particularly benefit our younger emigrants. Earlier this year, for instance, I approved a grant of €50,000 to the FAI to enable the employment of a welfare officer to work with Irish football apprentices and ex- apprentices in Britain and help ensure that the welfare and education needs of these young people are met.

It is the main vehicle for development of sports facilities at local, regional and national level throughout the country.  Under the Programme, funding is provided for capital purposes and current or operational costs are a matter for the operator of the facility.Letters have issued to each of this year's unsuccessful applicants, including the ones in question, setting out the reasons why they were not awarded a grant. As those letters pointed out, given the level of demand for funding and the amount of funding available under the Programme, it is not possible for my Department to allocate grants to every applicant.  In the cases of the applicants in question, both of which related to replacement of existing outdoor playing surfaces and security fencing, one did not meet a qualifying condition of the Programme in that the proof of title and the evidence own funding provided was not sufficient, and the other was valid but the applicant did not achieve a high enough score to secure a grant.I do not propose at this point that there will be any further allocations under the Sports Capital Programme in 2008.There are no funds available in my Department to meet the running costs of local sports facilities.  The Horse and Greyhound racing fund which is currently under review provides much needed support to both the horse-racing and greyhound industries, both of which make a significant economic contribution, mainly to the rural economy in terms of employment and tourism.

These high profile sporting events attract global media coverage and international visitors and are a valuable means of promoting Ireland as a holiday destination.I am supportive of the efforts of the Tourism State Agencies and the National Governing Bodies of Sport to attract international events here, subject, of course, to an assessment of the costs/benefits involved in any State financial support.

Since 1998, over €725 million has been allocated to over 7,400 projects across the country.1,453 applications were received in 2008 seeking €296m.  The Department assesses all applications received.  For local projects, the level of funding to each county is on the basis of a pro-rata distribution of the available funding on the basis of the population as set out in the 2006 census of population conducted by the Central Statistics Office, subject to the number and quality of applications received for each county.  All applications from an individual county are assessed by one member of staff to ensure a consistent approach to applications from the county concerned.  These assessments are then subject to quality proofing by more senior officers to the officer which conducted the initial assessment.  Applications which meet the basic qualifying conditions each receive a score, which decides their order of priority within their own county.The following table sets out the minimum qualifying score for the counties concerned for capital projects and for equipment grants in 2008.CountyMinimum Score: Capital GrantsMinimum Score: EquipmentCarlow5544Kilkenny5453Waterford7248Wexford5740Wicklow4630

However, earlier this year, the Taoiseach announced that responsibility for youth affairs was transferring to the newly formed Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs (OMYCA). It was also announced that the Young People's Facilities and Services Fund (YPFSF), for which my Department has had responsibility, was to integrate into the OMCYA.  Arrangements to give effect to the transfers are expected to be completed shortly.Of the order of €21m is being provided this year to support the valuable work being done through the Fund. The funding to be transferred to the OMCYA in 2009 — though marginally reduced to approximately €20m — will continue to support the broad range of initiatives already in place. The Deputy will appreciate that it will be a matter for the OMCYA to oversee the management of the Fund in the context of funding available to them for 2009.  I am confident, however, that the Fund's integration into that Office will provide a cohesive and comprehensive response to the needs of all young people, including those at risk of drug misuse.The Deputy should also note that I recently announced funding of almost €2.3m for the development of 16 dedicated youth facilities in Regional Drugs Task Force areas not covered by the YPFSF.  I am confident that these projects will play an important and ongoing role in diverting young people away from the dangers of drug use.A number of the projects being run through the Local and Regional Drugs Task Forces also work with under-18s.  The type of projects funded range from drugs education workers, counsellors, youth information projects and outreach services.  Some of the projects funded are not exclusively for under-18s — rather they encompass family members under family support projects and initiatives run by community drugs teams.

Total expenditure on the scheme has increased by almost 300% during the same period.The Government has decided to limit overall expenditure on this scheme by lowering the upper age limit that currently applies from 19 years to 18 years. The impact of this measure is being phased in, with payment for existing and future qualifying children being halved from January 2009 and payment stopping from the 18th birthday from January 2010.However, it is recognised that any changes in child benefit entitlements may have implications for family budgets. Accordingly, in order to protect the more vulnerable in society, special alleviating measures are being introduced for those in low income and social welfare dependent households.A compensatory payment of €15 is being provided during 2009 and 2010 for any week during which those affected by this measure are receiving a social welfare payment which includes an increase in respect of the 18 year old child or a family income supplement payment which includes payment in respect of that child. In addition, households affected by the measure who also qualify for the back to school clothing and footwear allowance will receive an extra payment of €215, bringing the total payment in respect of such a child to €520.These compensatory measures will mean that social welfare families or low income earners with children between the ages of 18 and 19 years will, in general, be protected from the effects of this measure, as they will receive an additional €19.15 a week between the weekly compensatory payment and the back to school clothing and footwear allowance.

However, people who were in receipt of this scheme at that stage continued to receive their payment, and will continue to receive such payment, as long as they satisfy the conditions of entitlement.The projected €2.1 million (2%) decline in Deserted Wife's Benefit in the 2009 Estimate over the 2008 Estimate reflects the declining client base for these schemes as current recipients reach pension age or otherwise lose their entitlement through a change in their circumstances.

In the case of Irish project partners, the 20% matching funding is provided by the Department of Social and Family Affairs.Over the period of this programme, applications from Ireland for funding were fewer than originally anticipated. The funding of €90,000 provided for 2009 is considered to be more than sufficient to cover any project requirements which may arise. In this regard it should be noted that the highest expenditure in any one year to date did not exceed €64,000.

Applications for the allowance may be made between the beginning of June and the end of September each year.The 2009 rates are €200 for children aged 2 to 11 years old and €305 for children aged 12 to 22.  In Budget 2009, I have increased the income thresholds for entitlement to back to school clothing and footwear allowance by €50.  This will bring the income limits for the allowance for parents with one child to €559.80 (for couples) and €406.30 for lone parents.  The new income limits will enable an estimated 18,000 additional families to benefit from the scheme.A person may qualify for payment of an allowance if they are in receipt of a social welfare payment or Health Service Executive payment, are participating in an approved employment scheme or attending a recognised education and training course and have household income at or below the income limits.

Rent supplement is not payable in circumstances where the applicant or spouse is engaged in remunerative full-time employment.  A spouse is defined in the relevant legislative provisions as "each person of a married couple who are living together, or a man and woman who are not married to each other but are cohabiting as husband and wife".This decision has been upheld by the Executive's designated Appeals Officer.

Having reflected on these concerns the Government, on my recommendation, agreed that the existing arrangements, whereby DA is paid to 16 and 17 year olds, will continue pending completion of a full review of the DA scheme.The changes announced as part of the Social Welfare Budget were designed to address concerns raised by a number of bodies about the appropriateness of paying young people a social welfare payment in their own right at the age of 16.The National Federation of Voluntary Bodies in particular had argued in a submission to the Department's review of the Disability Allowance Scheme that "at present the age for receipt of DA is 16 years. We deem this to be too young. This does not give an incentive for a child to pursue work/education options.  Subsequently a child may fall into the dependency trap too early. Instead parents should receive the Domiciliary Care Allowance for the child until they are 18 years old."  The Government's motivation in making changes to the Disability Allowance was to address these concerns.Last week I met with six different groups representing people with disabilities and disability service providers (namely the National Federation of Voluntary Bodies, Inclusion Ireland, Down Syndrome Ireland, People with Disabilities in Ireland, the National Disability Authority and Rehab). At these meetings, the underlying principle of the Budget measure, i.e. that it is inappropriate to pay a social welfare payment to a 16 year old in his or her own right, was not seriously contested. The key concern expressed by the groups related to the loss of expected income at short notice to families of young people with disabilities.Following these meetings, I recommended to the Government that the Disability Allowance continue to be paid to 16 and 17 year olds pending a full review of the scheme. The review is considering a wide range of issues as identified by groups representing people with disabilities and their families, by service providers and will take account of a forthcoming report on disability and illness benefits by the OECD. It will also draw on new data published by the Central Statistics Office last week from the National Disability Survey 2006.

Where a national of an EU state is working in Ireland, she/he is entitled to payment of these benefits, even if his/her children are resident in the worker's home country.The social security rights of people living and working in the EU are governed by EU Regulations 1408/71 and 574/72.  The Regulations co-ordinate social security systems and are designed to ensure that people are not disadvantaged by moving within the EU to take up work.  This is achieved primarily by setting out rules as to which State's social security a person will pay insurance when, for example, s/he moves from one Member State to another to take up work or where s/he lives in one State and works in another.  In addition, the Regulations also set out rules as to which State will pay benefit in the event of the usual contingencies arising, sickness, unemployment old-age etc.The general rule is that a person is insured in the State in which s/he works.  Equally, the state of employment has, in general, responsibility for paying benefits when, for example, a person becomes unemployed or ill.  The Regulations also provide that, when entitlement to benefit is being examined, account must be taken of insurance paid in any other Member State where the person worked.For the purposes of the EU Regulation, Irish Child Benefit and Early Childcare Supplement are classified as Family Benefits and there are specific rules governing the payment of these benefits.Because entitlement to family benefits can often arise in more than one Member State (based on residence and/or employment) the Regulations set out a number of rules in order to determine which country pays family benefits.  The main ones are:Residence requirements in national legislation (such as the habitual residence condition in Ireland) are overridden.The level of payment of family benefits in the State of employment has priority over the level of payment in the State of residence. If there is employment in two States, the level of payment in the State of residence of the children has priority.If the level of payment of family benefits in the State of residence is higher than that in the State of employment, the State of residence is required to pay a supplement equal to the difference between the two amounts.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	639	I propose to take Questions Nos. 366, 367 and 370 together.There is no delay in processing the majority of Child Benefit applications.  Awards on behalf of Irish-born children are processed either automatically or in a partially automated way using the child's birth details when they are registered with the General Registrar's Office.  The average processing time for these claims is less than 10 days.  Payments on behalf of some 65,000 children were paid this way in 2007.Currently there are delays in processing Child Benefit claims for children born outside Ireland who have come to live in Ireland with their parents, and also claims for children who reside in another EU member state but have an entitlement to Irish Child Benefit under EU regulations (non-resident children).  In the case of non-Irish born children resident in Ireland, these cases are slower to process as the customer must satisfy the Habitual Residency condition test and this may entail contacting employers, the Department of Justice and other relevant bodies to confirm their status in the state. The residence of the children in Ireland must also be confirmed. This additional complexity, combined with an increase in the volume of applications received in recent years, has led to arrears of claims to be processed. This is currently being addressed. There is a total of 7,300 such claims awaiting processing, with a further 1,600 cases which have been partially processed and where the Department is waiting on additional information to finalise the claims.  Additional staff resources have been assigned to this area and it is envisaged that all claims on hand will be cleared in the early part of 2009.  Average processing time for these claims at present is 10 months.EU nationals who come to work in Ireland but whose families remain in their home country may have an entitlement to Family Benefits in Ireland under EU Regulation 1408/71.  Before payment of Child Benefit is made for these non-resident children it is necessary amongst other things,  to contact the authorities in the country of residence of the children to confirm details and establish what, if any, family benefits are payable in the home country as this will determine entitlement to Irish payments. This process can take a number of months to complete in normal circumstances. There are some 8,800 such claims awaiting processing, with a further 2,400 cases where the Department is waiting on additional information to finalise the claims. These claims are being processed with the assistance of additional temporary staff recruited for this purpose.  It is anticipated that these claims will be cleared during the first half of 2009.  At this point it is taking an average of 18 months to process these claims to completion.Details of the average waiting period between receipt of the application and the date of first payment as requested are not available. The processing time for a Child Benefit claim depends on the complexity of the individual claim and the volume of such claims that have been received at that point in time. Based on an analysis carried out in 2003 when the claim process for Child Benefit was automated, it is clear that the processing time for claim for children born in Ireland has reduced due to the automation. Such claims are now normally processed within 3-10 days, but would previously have taken between three and four weeks.Claims for children born outside Ireland, whether living in Ireland or not, are taking significantly longer to process at present than they did in the period 2000- 2005, this is as a result of the significant increase in such claims since 2006. The number of claims for non-resident children increased nearly twenty fold in the seven year period from 2000, while the total number of claims received is up 50% overall in this period.The number of Child Benefit claims received in each of the years 2000 to date is shown as follows:Year1st childAdditional ChildrenEU regulation claims non-resident childrenTotal200029,64832,07680862,532200131,60233,71088666,198200232,74637,0821,61871,446200335,81437,2771,30174,392200436,07239,8191,27577,166200541,32738,0032,38581,715200643,46738,34315,89797,707200745,64739,42610,65095,7232008 Sept34,01831,5104,72470,252

The Department is in the process of localising the One-Parent Family Payment Scheme to the network of local offices across the country.  Where a One-Parent Family Payment claim is held at the local office, that office, of course will, provide a statement to the customer where required.There is still a stock of One-Parent Family Payment claims administered centrally in the Social Welfare Services Office in Sligo.  Requests for benefit statements for these claims are handled centrally where staff have access to all the relevant claim papers.  The same applies to other schemes administered centrally such as State Pension, Widow's/Widower's Pension and Disability Allowance.  While Local Office staff have computer access to certain payment details in relation to these claims, they do not have access to the claim papers which may contain additional information in relation to payments made to a customer.  There is always a large increase in the number of requests for statements during September and October from those seeking college grants, rent reviews by Local Authorities and from customers making a self-employed tax return. Additional staff are deployed to issuing statements during this peak period and every effort is made to deal with these requests as speedily as possible. So far this year the Social Welfare Services Office in Sligo has received requests for almost 45,500 statements.  The average processing time for these statements is less than 7 working days.  In 2007, over 47,500 requests were received.   Any customer who requests a statement by phone will be advised of the likely timeframe involved.

Where there is employment prior to 1975 it can take up to six months to obtain a persons record as these records are not readily accessible.  With regard to requests for records from the United States (US), it takes approximately three weeks to obtain a social insurance record.The Department has established a good working relationship with the Department of Work and Pensions and the United States Social Security Administration. Regular direct communication takes place with these bodies to ensure the accurate, complete and timely transfer of the information required to decide pension claims.Delays in processing applications do not ultimately result in any losses to pensioners as payment is made from the due entitlement date.Overall, I am satisfied that the current arrangements and procedures are working effectively and efficiently.

The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term income support, to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.At the end of September 2008, there were 67,519 people in receipt of rent supplement. The average weekly rent supplement payment is €128.15.  Data on the average cost per unit size is not available.

These contributions provide cover for long-term pensions such as state pension and widow's/widower's contributory pension. However they do not provide cover for short-term benefits such as jobseeker's and illness benefits. Where a self-employed person had been in insurable employment and has PRSI contribution at appropriate class s/he may qualify for a jobseeker's benefit payment.To get a jobseeker's payment a person must fulfil certain conditions including that the person be available for work and be looking for work. A self-employed person with the relevant contributions paid may qualify for a jobseeker's benefit payment if they are unemployed for three days or more in any period of six consecutive days.If a self-employed person has not got sufficient PRSI contributions they may qualify for a jobseeker's allowance which is a means-tested payment. Generally, in assessing the means of a self-employed person, a Social Welfare Inspector will take into account the level of earnings in the preceding 12 months to determine their expected income in the following year. However, with the general downturn in the construction industry at the moment it is accepted that less work is available in that sector and that earnings in the previous 12 months may not be representative of expected earnings in the coming year.  The Social Welfare Inspector will take account of this fact in projecting future earnings.The means test also involves an assessment of the person's savings and investments, any property they may own apart from the family home, and any other income such as a pension from a former employer or from another country. If the weekly means assessed are less than the appropriate rate for the jobseeker's allowance scheme, the person will qualify for a payment regardless of the number of days worked in any week.  If the weekly means exceed the appropriate rate, the person will have no entitlement to a payment.Persons engaged in self-employment pay PRSI contributions as follows:Rates of contribution from 1 January 2008CLASS SThis covers self-employed people, including certain company directors, and certain people with income from investments and rent.SubclassWeekly Pay BandHow much of weekly payAll IncomeS0Up To €500 InclusiveALL3.00%S1More Than €500First €1,9255.00%Balance5.50%S2*More Than €500ALL3.00%*Subclass S2 applies to medical card holders and to people getting a social welfare Widow's or Widower's Pension, One-Parent Family Payment or Deserted Wife's Benefit or Allowance.The vast majority of persons in insurable employment pay a Class A PRSI contribution, details of which are set out in the following table:Rates of contribution from 1 January 2008CLASS AThis covers employees under the age of 66 in industrial, commercial and service-type employment who have reckonable pay of €38 or more per week from all employments as well as Public Servants recruited from 6 April 1995.Weekly pay is the employee’s money pay plus notional pay (if applicable).SubclassWeekly Pay BandHow much of weekly payFirst €50,700Over €50,700EEEREEERAO€38-€352 inclusiveALLNil8.5%Nil8.5%AX€352.01-€356 inclusiveFirst €127Nil8.5%Nil8.5%Balance4.00%8.5%Nil8.5%AL€356.01-€500 inclusiveFirst €127Nil10.75%Nil10.75%Balance4.00%10.75%Nil10.75%A1

Persons in receipt of a state pension contributory or non-contributory who satisfy the conditions for receipt of carer's allowance may qualify for a half-rate carer's allowance in addition to their pension.People in receipt of carer's allowance (regardless of age) are eligible for the household benefits package which comprises the electricity/gas allowance, the telephone allowance and the free television licence scheme. The annual value of the household benefits package is in the region of €1,000 a year. Recipients of carer's allowance also qualify for the free travel scheme.From June 2005, the annual respite care grant was extended to all carers who are providing full-time care regardless of their income. The rate of the grant increased to €1,700 per year from June 2008.

All authorities have been requested to operate the grant schemes on a prioritised basis, within available resources, in order to ensure that the available funding is targeted towards those applicants experiencing greatest need.To take account of particularly significant levels of activity experienced by a number of local authorities, supplementary Exchequer allocations totalling €8.6 million were made in September and October 2008.  The October supplementary Exchequer allocations included an additional allocation of €250,000 to Kildare County Council.In addition, and in line with my objective of prioritising the needs of the most vulnerable households, the total financial provision secured for housing in 2009 will allow for the level of funding allocated towards housing supports for older people and people with a disability next year to be increased by 8% over the initial estimate for 2008.

However, a new local government service indicator in relation to the taking in charge of estates has been introduced, and will provide benchmark data from 2009 onwards for monitoring the taking in charge process.  The information to be reported will include:the number of requests for taking in charge of estates on hands at the start of the year in question;the number of estates that were taken in charge in the year in question;the total number of dwellings in these estates; andthe number of estates in respect of which enforcement action was taken or remedial works were carried out in the year in question.Planning authorities have a range of powers under the Planning and Development Acts 2000-2006 which may be used to ensure the completion of housing estates in accordance with relevant planning permissions.A planning authority may attach a condition to a planning permission requiring the giving of adequate security for the satisfactory completion of the proposed development and, if subsequently found necessary, may apply any security given for the satisfactory completion of the development in question.A planning authority is empowered to refuse to grant planning permission where it forms the opinion that the applicant for such permission has substantially failed to comply with a previous planning permission.

However, an applicant may apply to the High Court for an order annulling such a decision.Non-completion of a housing estate in accordance with the conditions of the relevant planning permission may constitute unauthorised development, which would be subject to enforcement action by the planning authority.In the case of unauthorised development, a planning authority may also apply to the Circuit Court or the High Court for an order requiring that such development is carried out in accordance with the conditions specified in the relevant permission.As indicated in the reply to Question No. 30 of 23 October 2008, I will keep the issue of taking in charge under review and I will be informed in this regard by the information provided by local authorities for the service indicators report for 2008 which will be available in the middle of 2009.

The major priority for Cosc is to produce a National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence which has the support of Government and Non-Governmental Organisations in the sector.  This work should inform actions needed to improve service provision, including emergency accommodation and refuge provision places for women and children escaping domestic violence.Capital funding of up to 100% is available through my Department‘s Capital Assistance Scheme to approved housing bodies providing accommodation to meet special housing needs, including accommodation for victims of domestic violence.  This year the overall allocation under the Capital Assistance Scheme is €130 million.In accordance with Section 10 of the Housing Act 1988 my Department recoups to local authorities 90% of their current account expenditure on accommodation and related costs arising in respect of homeless persons, which could include persons who become homeless as a result of domestic violence.  The remaining 10% is provided from the revenue resources of the local authorities.  Decisions on funding for homeless services is a matter in the first instance for local authorities.  Current account funding provided by my Department for 2008 for homeless services is €53.2 million.   This funding is being increased in 2009 to €56 million.  Associated care costs are the responsibility of the Department of Health and Children/Health Service Executive.

I expect that legislation will be required and, in that event, I would intend that the necessary provisions would be introduced during the passage through the Oireachtas of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2008.No savings will accrue to the Exchequer in 2008 and the expected savings in 2009 will be dependent on the timing of the merger.  The full year savings arising are estimated to be in the region of €70,000 to €100,000 per annum.

The owner or operator of a quarry was required, within one year of commencement of the section, to provide specified information for the purpose of registration of the quarry.  Not later than 2 years from the registration of a quarry, the relevant planning authority could, in the interests of proper planning and sustainable development, and having regard to the development plan and submissions or observations made in relation to registered quarries(i) in relation to a quarry which commenced operation before 1 October 1964, impose conditions on the operation of that quarry, or(ii) in relation to a quarry in respect of which planning permission had been granted, restate, modify or add to conditions imposed on the operation of that quarry.Depending on its size and location, the owner or operator of a quarry that commenced operation before 1 October 1964 could be required, not later than one year of the date of registration of the quarry, to apply for planning permission and to submit an environmental impact statement.A quarry in respect of which the owner or operator failed to provide specified information or to submit a planning application as required is unauthorised development, open to enforcement action by the relevant planning authority.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	674	In its judgment of 3 July 2008, the European Court of Justice ruled that the retention permission system as it applies in Irish law with regard to projects that require or may require an environmental impact assessment (EIA) under the EIA Directives does not comply with the Directives and needs to be amended.  Irish legislation fails to ensure that EIAs will be conducted prior to the construction of a project and permits post development EIAs contrary to the intent of the Directives.As of 3 July 2008 any permission granted on applications/appeals for retention planning permission in respect of EIA development is in breach of Community law having been granted under a legislative system that the Court has found is inconsistent with the EIA Directives.Ireland is therefore obliged to respond to the judgment by introducing legislation that will amend the existing planning legislation insofar as it permits retention permissions on projects requiring EIAs.I have received approval of Government to the drafting of the General Scheme of a Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill, which will, among other things:remove the possibility of retention for unauthorised development which would otherwise have been subject to environmental impact assessment, other than in exceptional circumstances, andrevoke the current 7 year time limit within which enforcement action may be taken in respect of unauthorised development (section 157(4) of the Planning and Development Act 2000).The intention to make such legislation was notified to the European Commission in Ireland's initial formal response to the ECJ judgement.In the interim, action is necessary in relation to applications for retention permission for development that required an EIA, falling into two categories:applications currently awaiting determination by planning authorities; andapplications which have been determined favourably since 3 July 2008.In this regard, my Department issued a circular letter to planning authorities and An Bord Pleanála outlining the approach that should be taken in dealing with such casesIn respect of applications for permission for the retention of unauthorised development where such development should have been subject to prior EIA planning authorities are advised to return the application as invalid, on the basis that there is no jurisdiction to grant retention planning permission in those circumstances.Where relevant retention permissions were granted since the date of the judgement, planning authorities were advised to inform recipients that as a result of the judgment the permission granted is in breach of Community law and should not be acted upon.An Bord Pleanála has been advised to take similar action in relation to relevant planning appeals.At this time, I cannot quantify or detail the number of planning applications, appeals or permissions that are affected by the ECJ judgment.

The SEM Operator is a joint venture between EirGrid and the Systems Operator Northern Ireland.  EirGrid also publishes a monthly report on the availability performance of each generation unit on the power system.  I have asked my officials to liaise with EirGrid to ascertain how best the information needs of the Deputy can be addressed.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	677	Encouraging a competitive, least cost energy supply is a key policy objective for the Government.  Substantial improvements in the energy efficiency of the electricity sector have taken place since 1990 with the addition of more efficient plant and improvements in infrastructure.  There is scope however, for further enhancement.  The forthcoming National Energy Efficiency Action Plan will contain a number of measures to underpin ongoing enhancement of efficiency in the power generation sector.It is also the case that the prevailing market structures of the Single Electricity Market incentivise the adoption by power generators of any innovation or development that lowers the unit cost of electricity.  Generators with lower costs per unit of electricity produced are, by definition, more efficient than other generators and hence would be selected by the Single Electricity Market Operator to produce electricity more often than less efficient generators with higher costs.  The market structure essentially ensures that generators will receive an economic return for investment in new and more cost efficient generation technologies.I am facilitating the deployment of Smart Meter technology, through a pilot programme and subsequent national rollout.  Smart Meters will significantly enhance management of energy demand and enable greater energy efficiency by energy suppliers.  They will also empower individual consumers to lower their own energy bills by reducing and managing their energy usage.The Energy Policy framework includes a range of other measures which will improve the price competitiveness of our energy supply by encouraging greater efficiency and competition across the energy sector.My Department is in regular correspondence and have frequent meeting with the various State bodies involved in the energy sector to see how our energy policy objectives can be met.

Departmental officials are in discussions with the OPW and Fermoy Town Council regarding this prospect.  They are currently investigating whether it is possible, from a planning perspective, to avail of the opportunity to carry out the works at this time.  It is expected that the outcome of these discussions and investigations will be known in the near future.

The study is part of an agreed programme of further out-working of a range of aspects of the Grid Study.The study has been commissioned jointly by my Department and the Northern Ireland Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment, and the contract has recently been awarded to independent international consultants, Ecofys.  The study, which will cost €74,200 (excluding VAT), is scheduled to be completed in the first quarter 2009 and the intention is to publish the report, jointly with Northern Ireland, as soon as possible thereafter.My Department has not directly conducted studies or computer modelling of the electricity grid or market in 2008, nor are there any planned for 2009.  In the performance of its statutory functions, including in relation to the Single Electricity Market (SEM), the Commission for Energy Regulation undertakes various studies and modelling tasks on the electricity market.  The Commission jointly with the Northern Ireland Regulator, is currently modelling the effect of the incorporation of increased levels of wind power in the SEM.  It is expected that this study will be finalised before the end of the year.  The cost of this work and its publication is a day to day operational matter for the Commission, which is statutorily independent in the performance of its functions.The Transmission System Operator, EirGrid, publishes each year a number of key reports.  These include the Transmission Forecast Statement, which reviews levels of network capacity and locations available to connect to the grid.  The Generation Adequacy Report assesses levels of electricity demand over a multi annual period and also assesses related power generation requirements.  The Transmission Forecast Statement has recently been published and the Generation Adequacy Report is expected to be published in December.My Department currently makes a contribution towards the overall running costs of the ESRI's Energy Policy Research Centre, which conducts a range of research relevant to energy policy under its annual work programme.  This research programme has included in previous years simulation modelling of the Irish electricity system and analysis of interconnection and energy efficiency.  I am advised that the work of the Centre in this area includes the cost of renewables integration into the electricity system and the development of a dynamic model of power generation to inform consideration of appropriate electricity generation investment for Ireland.

Broadband service providers operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated, where appropriate, by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.  I have no role in private sector broadband infrastructure investment undertaken by broadband service providers.  However, it is hoped that the facilitation of greater competition in the sector via the introduction of broadband from different technology platforms, will encourage more rapid enabling of all exchanges for broadband.I would add that in addition to fixed landline broadband, otherwise known as Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) or broadband over telephone lines, broadband services are available from competing service providers over multiple platforms including cable, fixed wireless and increasingly mobile.  I understand that Castlemaine already has broadband on offer from a number of service providers.

Amending primary legislation will be required to give effect to the new body.  Work has commenced on drafting the scheme of the required Bill, which I would hope will be published early in 2009.The most visible and immediate savings will occur as a result of the reduction in the costs of servicing eight separate boards and associated board expenses that are currently estimated to be in the region of €300,000 per annum.  As the new body is not expected to be in place until later in 2009, there will be only partial savings in 2009 compared to 2010, which will be the first full year of the new body's operation.  In addition to these financial savings, I anticipate that the new model will, over time, ensure through consolidation, the better use of existing resources and deliver improved value for money.

The Terms and Conditions governing the scheme require, inter alia, that applicants maintain a minimum stocking density on their holding of 0.15 livestock units per forage hectare declared for at least three consecutive months.  However, where the holding of an applicant is identified as not meeting this minimum requirement, the person in question is invited to submit evidence of satisfactory stocking i.e.  Flock Register, Horse Passports. Alternatively the applicant can submit details of a REPS or Commonage Framework Plan, if appropriate, which provides for a lower stocking level.The persons named were written to on 10 October 2008 and invited to submit appropriate evidence of the numbers of livestock maintained on their farm.  On receipt of a satisfactory response from the persons named, the application will be further processed with a view to payment at an early date.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	693	I outlined the purpose and acceptance of AHCS 1 forms in my replies to the Deputy on 24 September 2008 (Ref No. 30581/08) and on 7 October 2008 (Ref No. 33381/08).  A detailed breakdown of the very precise and detailed information requested by the Deputy is not readily available and it would place excessive demands on scarce staff resources in the Department to compile this data.The AHCS 1 form was introduced by my Department because it was acknowledged that incomplete test reports or reports containing errors could be submitted by testing practitioners, particularly when a new electronic data transfer system was being introduced.  As I explained in my reply dated 7 October 2008, AHCS 1 forms are used to clarify or amend a range of data relating to a test, only one of which is the submission of test result data in respect of animals not previously submitted.  A manual system was chosen to ensure that the process for requesting correction or amendment of a submitted test would be a very visible process.  In general, most errors are identified close to the time that they happen; however, occasionally they are not identified until some time later.  While there are a number of genuine reasons why private veterinary practitioners wish to add animals to the test report after the report has been submitted, my Department uses such requests by veterinary practitioners to amend test details as a quality control parameter in the context of assessing the totality of the performance of testing veterinary practitioners.The acceptance of submitted corrections on the AHCS 1 forms is at the discretion of the Superintending Veterinary Inspector (SVI) in my Department's local District Veterinary Office (DVO).  I can confirm that no disciplinary procedure or referral of cases to the Veterinary Council of Ireland has taken place specifically relating to the use of AHCS 1s, as such outcomes would only result from the identification of evidence pointing to the misuse or abuse of the AHCS1 forms.With regard to the query as to whether ‘supervisory' veterinary inspectors were former large animal practitioners, this information is not readily available. However, as the vast majority of veterinary staff within my Department are Irish graduates and would have had experience in veterinary practice in Ireland, most of these would have experience in large animal practice prior to joining the Department.  Such experience is seen to be a positive and desirable competence in the staff engaged in this task.Regarding question 15 posed by the Deputy, I assume that, in referring to ‘suspect AHCS 1 forms', the Deputy is referring to those forms which the DVO does not act on and/or requires further information or action on the part of the veterinary practitioner and/or the farmer. I can confirm that, contrary to the presumption in the query, it is not the practice to return these forms to the practitioner.  I am particularly concerned about the inference that these forms are returned to the veterinary practitioner in order to get rid of evidence of false certification, which implies some collusion on the part of staff of my Department in some suggested illegal activity.  I strongly reject any such assertion which is put forward without any supporting information or evidence. As stated in my reply dated 24 September last, if the Deputy has any evidence of illegal practices in relation to the carrying out of TB tests, he should provide this information to my Department immediately and I assure him that the matter will be fully investigated.Given that the Deputy has raised issues regarding the use of AHCS 1 forms on a number of occasions recently, I can readily arrange for officials from my Department to be available to meet with the Deputy and brief him on their background and purpose.

It represents a very substantial commitment from the Government in bringing the Irish fishing fleet into balance with available recourses and ensuring that those remaining in the industry can be assured of a profitable future.The scheme was announced last February and the closing date for receipt of all applications under this scheme was 30th April 2008.  The scheme was open to vessels which, inter alia, at the time of application were registered on the Irish Register of Fishing boats in either the polyvalent or beam-trawl segment and in possession of a sea fishing boat licence.  The vessel was also required to be operational, that is in compliance with all relevant legislation and capable of putting to sea.The aim of the scheme was to remove fully functioning and active older and larger fishing vessels in the polyvalent or beam trawl segments of the Irish fleet.  The removal of these vessels will increase the quotas available to the more modern competitive fishing vessels and to smaller vessels and will ensure a more sustainable and profitable fleet.

No reimbursement of aid already paid is sought. Where a contract is in joint or several names the surviving participants can see out the remaining period of the contract.Following the death of a sole participant in REPS, succession may not be established for some time and the land may not transfer into new ownership as a single farm unit.  In cases like these in the past, farmers who attempted in good faith to continue a deceased person's contract found themselves in a position where they had to refund payments.  It is to avoid such problems that the Department now terminates the contract on the death of a sole participant using the force majeure principle.  The successor or successors in title are free to apply for a new contract in REPS.

Article 79 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007, states that the surplus levy shall be entirely allocated among the producers who have contributed to each of the overruns of the national quotas and that producers shall be liable for payment of their contribution to the surplus levy due.The herd-owner in question exceeded his milk quota in the 2007/08 marketing period. He received a temporary allocation of 22,477 litres from the Milk Quota Appeals Tribunal on grounds of animal disease following an application received by the Department on 2nd November 2007. This allocation reduced the amount of levy that would have been incurred. I have no further discretion in the matter.

Responsibility for the Loughs Agency is a matter for the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.In relation to lobster fishing, a discussion document on Managing Access to the Irish Lobster Fishery was launched on the 28th of April 2008 and the public consultation process closed on 21st July.  The discussion document had been prepared in close association with inshore fishermen's representatives and involves new arrangements to manage access to the lobster fishery on a regional basis that would form the foundations of a management regime that will encourage a sustainable lobster fishery.  The proposals may involve a secondary licensing regime for lobster fisheries.  A significant number of views and responses were received and these are currently being accessed with a view to bringing forward arrangement that have a high level of support within the sector.  There are no specific proposals for a secondary licensing regime for crab fisheries at this time.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	709	The implementation of the Habitats Directive is a matter, in the first instance, for the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.Agreement was reached between the NPWS and the farm bodies on additional measures to reduce the grazing pressure on the Twelve Bens/Garraun Complex and Maumturk Mountains Special Areas of Conservation (SACs).  The objective of this agreement, for which NPWS are making additional payments to farmers, is to establish a sustainable grazing regime to allow for regeneration of overgrazed areas which, in turn, will satisfy the European Commission that a judgement of the European Court of Justice against Ireland is being fully respected.Lambs born in the previous year were classified as hoggets from the commencement of the following calendar year for the purpose of drawing down ewe premium. I understand that the NPWS have no plans to revisit the terms of the agreement or the methodology of calculating the destocking requirement.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	710	I propose to take Questions Nos. 445 and 446 together.Coillte Teoranta was established as a private commercial company under the Forestry Act 1988, and day-to-day operational matters are the responsibility of the company.  I have, however, been advised by Coillte that, to protect young seedlings against the Large Pine Weevil, the company dips seedlings in a flexcoat and cypermethrin mix prior to dispatch from its nurseries. Cypermethrin is registered as an approved pesticide by the Pesticide Control Service (PCS) of my Department while Flexcoat does not require registration as it is outside the scope of the current legislation (because it acts by creating a physical barrier to harmful organisms) and consequently does not require registration and approval in Ireland.The company assure me that it is not in breach of any United Kingdom Pesticide Safety Directorate (PSD) standards or guidelines relating to the export of cypermethrin-flexcoat treated trees into the UK market and that UK PSD does not regulate pre-treatment of products prior to their entry into the UK.  Coillte are of the view that flexcoat and cypermethrin are applied separately in the UK as the combination of the chemicals there would be to use those chemicals in a way in which they are not licensed.Coillte further advise that this combination of flexcoat with cypermethrin has facilitated a 25% reduction in cypermethrin usage in its nurseries. In terms of worker and environmental safety, the company anticipates that prolonging the efficacy of cypermethrin (through the use of flexcoat) will reduce the need for top-up sprays after planting. A further reduction of pesticide usage after planting must be considered beneficial in terms of the health and safety of forest workers and also the environment. In addition, by applying the chemical in the controlled environment of a dipping unit the company is reducing the threat of spray drift, which again can only be beneficial to workers and the environment.  Another factor is that reduced chemical usage is one of the core principles of Sustainable Forest Management.The usage of pesticides is an operational matter for the company and, once this is compliant with the relevant standards and guidelines, I have no plans to intervene in this matter.

The current allocation is based on an average of 27 pupils per teacher and the fact that schools make individual choices in assigning teachers to class groups. With over 20,000 individual classes spread across all schools throughout the country there will always be differences in individual class sizes.It is of course the case that some schools can have class sizes of greater than 27 but this is often because of a local decision by a school to use its teaching resources in order to have smaller numbers in other classes. Indeed, very often when a particular school has a class of over thirty in a particular grade, it is because there is another class in the same school with just 20 pupils or so.Class Size RangePupils0-191,96320-297,65630-392,83940 +41

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	713	I propose to take Questions Nos. 450, 451, 452, 453, 455, 456 and 549 together.The 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure.  These decisions were made to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run. In this respect Education while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure could not be totally spared.Prudent management of the Government finances is particularly important at this time of global economic uncertainty when tax revenue has fallen so significantly and when world economic conditions are so serious. Even with the Budget measures in place there will still be a significantly increased borrowing requirement in 2009.The Government's commitment to education is clear both from its track record over the past decade in providing substantial additional resources, most notably extra teachers to meet previously unmet needs and from the programme the Government set for itself when it came into office. A lot has changed in the past year and the first and foremost imperative is that we stabilise the public finances. It is only by doing so that we can shelter gains made and put ourselves in the position of being able to make improvements in the future.  What we are doing in primary schools from September next is staffing them on the same basis as they were staffed just over one school year ago.In terms of the position in respect of any one school for September 2009, schools are currently returning data to my Department in relation to their enrolment as of 30 September last. My Department has commenced processing these data although all schools have not yet made their returns. The allocation process including notification to schools will commence early in the New Year.The allocation process includes appellate mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules. The final allocation to a school is also a function of the operation of the redeployment panels which provide for the retention of a teacher in an existing school if a new post is not available within the agreed terms of the scheme.

In this respect Education, while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure, could not be entirely spared, and I acknowledge the impact of funding restrictions in a number of areas, including at school level.  However, these are the inevitable result of the challenging economic environment and the need to prudently manage Exchequer resources.The positions of individual schools, including those referred to by the Deputies, will not be known until the staffing and budgetary allocations are finalised in the New Year.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	717	In framing the budget, a range of very difficult policy choices had to be faced by the Government across all areas of public expenditure, including in the field of education.While education remains a priority for the Government, it has been necessary to curtail expenditure in some areas.  While certain grants are to be abolished, I would like to emphasise that the capitation grant for post-primary schools has been increased by 4.3%,  representing an increase of €14 per pupil, to bring it to €345 per pupil from January 2009.Voluntary secondary schools will benefit also from an increase in the school services support grant by €8 per pupil from January 2009. This will mean, for example, that a secondary school with an enrolment of 500 pupils will receive an additional €11,000 in funding in 2009.At junior cycle, the foundation for enterprise is promoted by ensuring that students follow a broad and balanced programme which features an appropriate mix of skills, including communications, personal effectiveness, ICT, languages, and a range of academic and vocational options.In senior cycle students taking the Transition Year option, the Leaving Certificate Vocational programme and the Leaving Certificate Applied are provided with specific opportunities to acquire enterprise skills. These programmes place a strong focus on action learning, community-based approaches, personal development and teamwork. Students also engage in work experience.Typically, Transition Year students engage in mini-company activities whereby they plan, develop and manage a mini enterprise or organise a major event such as a trade fair or fashion show. Teamwork, multidisciplinary learning, interpersonal and communications skills, planning, evaluation, and mastery of business concepts are all part of this process. Approximately, 28,000 students take the Transition Year annually. These activities should continue despite the abolition of the Transition Year grant, which is expected to yield a saving of €2.55 million.

The OPW has submitted a technical report on a number of proposals to my Department.The further progression of the site acquisition for the school will be considered in the context of the capital budget available to my Department for school buildings generally. In light of the many competing demands on the capital budget of my Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the acquisition of the school site at this time.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	719	As the Deputy may be aware the staffing of a special school is determined by reference to the recommendations outlined in the Report of the Special Education Review Committee, 1993, also known as the SERC Report. In accordance with SERC, the staffing level in the school in question should be a teaching principal and two class teachers. In recognition of the extent of planning work associated with setting up a new school, my Department permitted the principal to operate in an administrative capacity to ensure the successful establishment of the school. The school is now well established and the administrative status of the principal was discontinued for the 2008/2009 school year when the principal has returned to teaching duties.My Department initially advised the school of this arrangement in a letter dated 16th August, 2007. However, in recognition of the complexity of the special educational needs of the pupils in the school, the National Council for Special Education has approved a temporary teacher in the school for the 2008/2009 school year.The overall number of teaching staff in the school for the 2008/2009 school year will therefore remain the same as in 2007/2008. The staffing of the school referred to by the Deputy for the 2008/2009 school year is a Teaching Principal, two permanent mainstream class teachers, one temporary classroom teacher and 10 special needs assistants to cater for fourteen pupils.The recent budgetary announcements do not affect the criteria used for the allocation of additional teaching and care resources for children with special educational needs.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	720	I propose to take Questions Nos. 463 to 468, inclusive, together.Bus Éireann, which operates the school transport scheme has informed my Department that there are about 4,000 vehicles in the school transport scheme and 3,350 of these vehicles are owned by private operators on contract to Bus Éireann.In April, 2006, it was only possible to estimate the number of private contractors buses to be retrofitted with seat belts. It subsequently emerged that the actual number of buses without seat belts was about 400. This number was further reduced, as some contractors decided to avail of the enhanced rates on offer, and replaced their vehicles with more modern buses fitted with seat belts.The breakdown of costs for the private contractors seat belt programme is as follows:€872,940 for the visual inspections of seat belts fitted to vehicles;€250,763 for the retrofitting of vehicles;€319,121 for the development of specifications.Seat belts retrofitted to vehicles, under the scheme, are to the pull-test standard and in accordance with the guidelines published by the Department of Transport in June 2006.  All remaining buses operating under the school transport scheme, with the exception of those with type approved certification for seat belt installations issued by the manufacturer, are inspected by an independent company engaged by Bus Éireann to confirm that the seat belts are properly and suitably maintained to an acceptable standard of roadworthiness and with reference to the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency standard in the UK.

It is only by doing so that we can shelter gains made and put ourselves in the position of being able to make improvements in the future.What we are doing in primary schools from September next is staffing them on the same basis as they were staffed just over one school year ago.  The specific information requested by the Deputies in relation to the detailed staffing allocation of the schools in question for the academic year 2009/10 cannot be determined until the allocation process has fully concluded.  There is nothing exceptional in this.  The allocation process includes appellate mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules. At primary level the final allocation to a school is also a function of the operation of the redeployment panels which provide for the retention of a teacher in an existing school if a new post is not available within the agreed terms of the scheme.Schools are currently returning data to my Department in relation to their enrolment as of 30 September.  My Department has commenced processing this data although all schools have not yet made their returns.  The allocation processes including notification to schools will commence early in the New Year.  I appreciate that the abolition of a number of grants for some schools will impact on funding levels in 2009 but it is also the case that the enhanced levels of funding announced in the Budget for the capitation and ancillary services grants will help to alleviate the impact of this. Budget changes will take effect in 2009.The Education Budget for 2009 has provided for improvements to the overall level of funding for the day to day running costs of primary schools which will see funding increase from €167 million in 2008 to almost €190 million in 2009.The Government is committed to making further improvements as resources permit.  The Primary Professional Development Service offers a wide range of supports for primary schools.  The PPDS team are currently providing seminars on child  protection and language support as well as in school support through the cuiditheoir service.  Support is also available for schools teaching the Staysafe programme through the Child Abuse Prevention Programme and support for teachers in special educational needs is provided through the Special Education Support Service. Leadership training and support is available through the Leadership Development Service and substance misuse prevention training is provided through the Walk Tall programme.Given the budgetary position in 2009 it is likely that there will be reduced personnel available in the support services but the wide range of supports on offer will remain in place. Decisions have yet to be made on the likely position beyond September 2009.

It has a statutory quality assurance role in relation to education provision at first and second level, as set out in Section 13 of the Education Act, 1998.  One of its core functions is to report on the quality of education provision in  schools and centres for education.Inspection reports are designed to inform the school community, the Department of Education and Science and, since February 2006, the general public about the quality of education provision in individual schools.  Procedures are in place whereby inspectors inform the relevant administrative sections within the Department of any significant issues that arise during inspection visits.  This means that due cognisance is taken of the views and recommendations of inspectors in the Department's decision-making processes.The position in relation to the school referred to by the Deputy is that my Department is examining the feasibility of allowing the school to proceed in the 3rd Bundle of school projects to be procured via Public Private Partnership.  This examination is nearing completion and I will be making an announcement about the matter as quickly as possible.

In doing this we have attempted to afford some shelter to the education sector but given the scale of public expenditure on education it is simply not possible to avoid tough decisions.  These decisions are justified by the imperative of securing the future economic stability of the country.I have called for co-operation from all the education partners in meeting the challenges facing us both as an education community and as a country.  I have already met the ASTI at their request. I am organising to meet other unions and management bodies, including the INTO and TUI.

The existing bodies have had considerable success in developing and enhancing work in the area of qualifications and quality assurance in vocational education and training and in higher education.  The challenge is now to deepen implementation of the  National Framework of Qualifications, ensuring a wider understanding of the Framework, further facilitating progression through the system, aligning quality assurance practices and pooling resources to deliver a high quality service to learners and providers.  The linkages from the Framework to progression and access policies and onwards to awards certification and quality assurance are now such that it is considered that separate bodies operating in this area is no longer the best organisational response.  Progress can now be most efficiently and effectively achieved through the establishment of a strong single organisation prioritising the needs of learners and delivering quality service to providers.Establishment of the new body will require legislation, but options for closer co-operation and sharing of administration support between the existing agencies prior to statutory establishment will be explored.  Allowing for planning and consultation, it is anticipated that legislation could be published in the second half of 2009.It is difficult to quantify savings until more detailed work on administrative planning is undertaken. It should be noted that the primary reason for the amalgamation is not to achieve cost savings in themselves, but to ensure a more coherent approach by establishing a single integrated organisation.  Savings would not arise from the abolition of functions but from efficiencies resulting from them being performed by a single body.

The role of the EDC was to advise the Minister for Education and Science on policies and strategies to be adopted to identify and correct educational disadvantage.  The Committee's final report Moving Beyond Educational Disadvantage was published in December 2005.During the committee's term of office, between 2002 and 2005, the committee was allocated €100,000 per annum.  The EDC's term of office expired in 2005 and it had not been re-established prior to its abolition.  While €50,000 was allocated to the EDC for 2007 and 2008, no actual expenditure was incurred.The abolition of the EDC will not adversely impact upon my Department's commitment to ongoing consultation on educational disadvantage and the wider social inclusion agenda.

In this regard, my Department is subject to the provisions of the Prompt Payment of Accounts Act, 1997.  The Deputy will appreciate, however, that queries may arise in specific cases that need to be resolved before payments can issue.  These may arise in cases such as where invoice amounts differ from the amount approved by my Department or invoices are not forwarded promptly to my Department by schools in cases where they are the client for a building project.Currently there are over 360 major projects in architectural planning, the vast majority of which would have incurred design team fees to date.  Fees are paid on approval of individual design stages.Given the number of projects involved, it would require an inordinate amount of staff time to assemble the requested information.  However, if the Deputy wishes to clarify the situation in respect of individual cases then I would be happy to provide him with the information.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	732	As outlined in PQ No. 608 of 21 October 2008, the Universities Act (Section 52), 1997 and the Qualifications (Education and Training) Act, 1999 prohibit the use of the terms ‘University', ‘Institute of Technology' or ‘Regional Technical College' where the organisation is also engaged in the provision of education services unless the Minister for Education consents to the use of the term.  In the past officials from my Department have contacted a number of organisations which were using the title "university" without consent and in most cases when the legislative requirements were explained, the organisations concerned voluntarily agreed to stop using the title.  Agreement has also been reached with the Companies Registration Office whereby any business name applied for which features the term ‘university' will not be accepted without the express approval of the Department of Education and Science.The National Framework of Qualifications enables providers in public, private, workplace or community settings to offer recognised awards in further or higher education, in compliance with the processes set out by the Further Education and Training Awards Council or the Higher Education and Training Awards Council.  Such providers must agree their quality assurance arrangements with the relevant awards council, and satisfy the council that the awards are of an appropriate standard, the necessary supports are in place for learners and the assessment arrangements are fair and consistent.In addition, the Department maintains an Internationalisation Register containing programmes which are approved for the purpose of access to work by students who are citizens from outside the EU/EEA and Switzerland.  Only programmes which have been quality assured and/or lead to recognised qualifications are included on the Register.  Both the Internationalisation  Register and a list of approved higher education providers are maintained on the Department's website.Learners are advised to carefully review the accreditation of any intended course of study before paying fees or beginning a programme.The Government intends to take a number of steps to bring greater clarity and focus to the promotion of Irish educational programmes overseas.  This will include the development and implementation of a Quality Mark for international education programmes, the award of which will be based on appropriate certification of educational programmes and implementation by institutions of a Code of Practice for the delivery of international education services.

In June 2007, there were a total of 28,735 teachers at primary level and 27,363 post-primary teachers.  The corresponding figures for June 2008 are 30,184 and 27,725.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	734	I propose to take Questions Nos. 484 and 485 together.The specific information sought by the Deputy is not readily available within my Department and would involve an inordinate amount of administrative time to compile.Primary schools' running costs are met by my Department's scheme of capitation grants. These grants are intended to contribute towards the general operating costs of schools which would include heating, lighting, cleaning, insurance, painting, teaching aids and other miscellaneous charges.  The Ancillary Services grant provides additional funding for primary schools towards the cost  of secretarial and caretaking services.The Education Budget for 2009 has provided for improvements to the overall level of day to day funding for primary schools which will see funding increase from €167 million in 2008 to almost €190 million in 2009.The primary capitation grant has been improved by more than €21 to bring the rate to €200 per pupil and the ancillary services grant for primary schools will also be improved by €3.50 to €155 per pupil.This builds on the progress has been made in recent years that has seen the primary school capitation grant increased from €81.26 per pupil in 2000 to its current rate of €200. This represents an increase of 146% in the standard rate of capitation grant since 2000.Taken together, these increases mean that primary schools eligible for the full ancillary services grant will get €355 per pupil — or almost €25 extra — in this school year to cover their day to day running costs, with a primary school of 300 pupils getting €7,475 more. In 2000, a primary school with 300 pupils was in receipt of less than €40,000 to meet its day to day running costs. That  same school under these new rates will receive €106,500. This excludes the salary of teachers and Special Needs Assistants which are paid by the Department.Furthermore enhanced rates of capitation funding are paid in respect of children with special educational needs who attend special schools or special classes attached to mainstream schools. The current rates range from €512 to €986 per pupil — an increase of 59% from the rate in 2006.By any standards there have been very significant improvements within a relatively short period of time and the Government is committed to further increasing funding for schools as resources permit.

Schools and vocational education committees were informed of the scheme by circular letters issued in May 2005.

This amount includes the cost of benefits paid in each financial year to those who retired in that year together with the ongoing pension costs for those who had retired under the scheme in previous years.The cost of benefits awarded on retirement is influenced by the amount of actual service already accrued together with any added service that may be awarded and the salary and allowances of the individual teacher. The average annual rate of pension in 2007 was of the order of €30,000 while the retirement gratuity would be of the order of €90,000These figures relate to teacher retirements from primary, secondary, communityQuestion No. 492 answered with Question No. 457.Question No. 493 answered with Question No. 128.Question Nos. 494 to 496, inclusive, answered with Question No. 457.

The information gathered will be used to produce a database of information on rented prefabricated accommodation which will be maintained on an ongoing basis and will inform my Department's future decision-making in this area. This work is well advanced and I anticipate it will be completed shortly.  When the information from the survey on rental of prefabricated accommodation is complete I will write to the Deputy.  The information in the database will be available on a county by county basis, rather than by region within each county.My Department provides grant-aid towards the provision of temporary school accommodation to the management authorities of education providers where it is established that a need for such temporary accommodation exists.My Department has undertaken an assessment of the rental of temporary accommodation with a view to identifying the point at which purchase of such accommodation provides better value for money than rental. As a result of this assessment, my Department now has a policy of purchasing temporary accommodation where the need for this is likely to last for more than three years.The Permanent Accommodation Scheme was introduced in 2003 to reduce the need for prefabs. It was designed to give value for money in terms of providing permanent accommodation in place of prefabs, where an accommodation need was likely to exist for a considerable length of time. Since its introduction, over €100m has been allocated to schools under the scheme and it has resulted in the provision of an additional 625 classrooms and 275 resource rooms in schools around the country. This is in addition to those classrooms provided under the major capital projects managed by my Department.Had the Permanent Accommodation Scheme not been in place, a very significant proportion of those classrooms and resource rooms would have had to be provided using temporary accommodation such as prefabricated classrooms.In July of this year I introduced a further innovation which allows those schools with an urgent and pressing need for additional accommodation and who are being given approval for grant-aid to avail of the option of using their grants to purchase prefabs or to construct permanent classrooms for the same amount.Despite this, it will continue to be necessary for prefabricated accommodation to be provided because competing priorities mean that it will not always be possible to have a permanent accommodation solution in place in a short time-frame. My Department will continue to provide funding for such prefabricated accommodation and the decision on whether to rent or purchase will depend on the likely length of time it will be required. In all cases, the approach will be to ensure best value for money.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	741	The standard size of a classroom at primary level is 80 sq metres and this has been the standard size for rooms constructed in recent years.  It allowed plenty of space for the range of activities carried out under the modern school curriculum in times before the pupil teacher ratio was reduced and therefore will not need to be adjusted in light of the current adjustment in the pupil teacher ratio.When the country was able to afford it, we reduced the basis on which primary teachers are allocated to schools from being based on an average number of pupils per teacher from 35 pupils down to the current level of 27 pupils. The change to a new average of 28 pupils per teacher has to be viewed in that context. It means primary schools will be staffed exactly as they were during the 2006/2007 school year during which they operated well.  The net overall position is a reduction of about 200 posts from the primary teacher payroll next September compared to this September across all the staffing measures involving primary schools.While I appreciate the change will impact on class sizes and accordingly on the number of pupils in a classroom the reality is that it will not impact on every school rather the change will impact on the total number of teachers in some 10 to 15% of primary schools.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	742	As the Deputy is aware, due to current economic constraints, the Government has had to make extremely difficult decisions and choices across all public services and education is no different. There is an inescapable fact that pay constitutes the bulk of current expenditure on education and therefore measures impacting on the teaching resources available to schools were necessary.  The specific measures I have had to take in relation to the staffing schedule have to be seen in this light. I had to take a measured and balanced view of what was reasonable in the circumstances.The position is that detailed staffing allocations to individual schools for the commencement of the academic year 2009/10 will not be finally determined until the allocation processes have fully concluded.There is nothing exceptional in this. The allocation processes include appellate mechanisms under which schools can appeal to increase the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules. This is particularly relevant at post-primary level where the appellate process considers in particular any specific curricular needs of the school/schools concerned. At post-primary there is no effective system wide redeployment scheme at present and discrete allocations are made to post-primary schools for example to cater for pupils with Special Educational Needs and those with Language difficulties can alter the ultimate position of the school in relation to any over quota posts.Schools are currently returning data to my Department in relation to their enrolment as of 30 September. My Department has commenced processing this data although all schools have not yet made their returns.  The process of notifying schools of their allocation will commence early in the New Year.On completion of the allocation process the deployment of teaching staff in the school, the range of subjects offered and ultimately the quality of teaching and learning are in the first instance a matter for the school management authorities.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	743	The general allocation scheme has been in operation since September 2005 under which mainstream primary schools have been provided with resource teaching support, based on enrolment figures, to cater for children with high-incidence special educational needs such as dyslexia and those with learning support needs.In addition to the general allocation, hours may be allocated for individual children with low incidence disabilities based on each child's assessed needs.The general allocation for the school referred to by the Deputy is 1.6 full-time teaching posts and the school has also been allocated 26 resource hours in respect of children with low incidence disabilities. A full-time resource teacher is expected to teach for up to 25 hours per week. Accordingly, for the current school-year the school has sufficient hours to retain 2 full-time teaching posts.Where schools are in receipt of support in respect of pupils with low-incidence special educational needs, those hours are allocated subject to the ongoing attendance of the pupils in respect of whom the hours were granted.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	744	In making the announcement of the Budget measures for education I stressed that tough choices had to be made in meeting the needs of the education sector in difficult economic circumstances. The resources available to the Department have meant that these choices have been very challenging and I acknowledge the impact of funding restrictions in a number of areas, including at school level. However, these are the inevitable result of the more challenging economic environment and the need to prudently manage Exchequer resources.This Government's continued prioritisation of education over the last 11 years is evidenced from our investment in 2009 of €9.6 billion — over treble what it was in 1997.The increase of €302m in the Education budget for 2009 is therefore a real achievement in the current economic climate. Education is one of only three Government Departments to have increased funding in 2009.The Education Budget for 2009 has provided for improvements to the overall level of day to day funding for primary schools which will see funding increase from €167 million in 2008 to almost €190 million in 2009.Notwithstanding the increase of €302 million in the Education budget for 2009, in making the announcement of the Budget measures for education I stressed that tough choices had to be made in meeting the needs of the education sector in these difficult times.  The resources available to the Department have meant that these choices have been very challenging.  The decision made to suspend the substitution cover was a difficult one.The provision of substitute cover for uncertified sick leave and official school business at second level was only introduced in 2003.  Prior to 2003 schools managed without any of this provision, a fact I fully accept was possible through flexibility and good will all round.As we manage through this difficult period I am asking teachers in all schools to co-operate fully with school managers in coping with this change in the interest of the students.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	745	I propose to take Questions Nos. 502 and 503 together.The 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure. These decisions were made to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run. In this respect Education while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure could not be totally spared.Prudent management of the Government finances is particularly important at this time of global economic uncertainty when tax revenue has fallen so significantly and when world economic conditions are so serious. Even with the Budget measures in place there will still be a significantly increased borrowing requirement in 2009.The Government's commitment to education is clear both from its track record over the past decade in providing substantial additional resources, most notably extra teachers to meet previously unmet needs and from the programme the Government set for itself when it came into office. A lot has changed in the past year and the first and foremost imperative is that we stabilise the public finances.  It is only by doing so that we can shelter gains made and put ourselves in the position of being able to make improvements in the future. What we are doing in primary schools from September next is staffing them on the same basis as they were staffed just over one school year ago.In terms of the position in respect of any one school for September 2009, schools are currently returning data to my Department in relation to their enrolment as of 30 September last. My Department has commenced processing this data although all schools have not yet made their returns. The allocation process including notification to schools will commence early in the New Year. The allocation process includes appellate mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules. The final allocation to a school is also a function of the operation of the redeployment panels which provide for the retention of a teacher in an existing school if a new post is not available within the agreed terms of the scheme.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	746	The budget measures will mean that the level of language support will be reduced from a maximum of six extra teachers per school to a maximum of two teachers per school, as was the case before 2007.However, the ongoing requirement for current levels of language support teachers in schools should also start to reduce in line with lower levels of immigration and in line with improvements in the levels of proficiency of those pupils for whom this resource has been available.Nonetheless, schools that require language support will still be entitled to get it. We still envisage having over 1,400 language support teachers in our schools in September 2009 and up to about 500 other teachers in part-time posts. By any standards this is a very significant resource and the challenge will be to ensure that it is used to maximum effect.As I announced on budget day we will also provide for some alleviation for the position of those schools where there is a significant concentration of newcomer pupils as a proportion of the overall enrolment. This will be done on a case by case basis.The allocation process for language support teachers is an annual one and existing provision is not rolled over automatically. Schools will be applying afresh in the spring and early summer of 2009 for the 2009/10 school year, based on their assessment of the prospective needs of existing pupils and any new pupils they are enrolling.Moreover, OECD research in this field (PISA 2006) shows that Ireland is the OECD country with the highest distribution of newcomers across schools meaning that schools with higher concentrations of newcomer children are relatively unusual. ESRI data also shows that only a small percentage of schools have high concentrations of newcomer children.I realise that standards are not simply achieved by supplying teaching resources and that the quality of the supports that the child receives and the inclusive atmosphere cultivated in schools are important factors influencing the quality of learning achieved by migrant children. My Department recognises that we must monitor and review the educational experiences that are provided  to migrant students so that we can improve the quality and effectiveness of our provision. The Department is undertaking a range of research to consider the question of integration in schools and how best to deploy our resources to ensure that all the children in our schools can benefit from learning in an intercultural Ireland.

The resources available to the Department have meant that these choices have been very challenging.  The decision made to suspend the substitution cover for school business in second-level schools was a difficult one.The provision of substitute cover for uncertified sick leave and official school business was only introduced in 2003.   The supervision/ substitution scheme was also introduced at that time.The supervision substitution scheme will continue to operate without any changes and teachers who agree to participate will continue to receive an annual payment of €1,789 in addition to their normal salary.I am aware that from January the changes regarding substitution will present particular challenges for school managers but I felt that suspending part of the improvements made in 2003 to the substitution scheme was preferable to impacting more significantly on teacher numbers.As we manage through this difficult period I am asking teachers in all schools to co-operate fully with school managers in coping with this change in the interest of the students. I am also requesting the school managerial bodies to ensure that the supervision substitution scheme is operated with maximum effectiveness in all schools.

Youth services funding by the Department of Education and Science expanded from €35.5m in 2004 to €52.6m in 2008. While this funding has allowed for some expansion in the sector, there has been a growing emphasis on consolidation.The 2009 budget allocation for youth services from the Department of Education and Science is €48.2m, a decrease of 8% on the 2008 figure.  Funding is also provided for youth services from a number of other Government Departments and agencies.  The reduced allocation in the youth budget from the Department of Education and Science will require much tighter budget management and prioritisation which may impact on pay and administration costs.

The next identification process is scheduled to be held at the end of the current DEIS programme which runs from 2005-2010.  There will not be an opportunity before this to be included in the current DEIS programme of supports.This school together with 72 other post primary schools retained resources, both teaching posts and financial, under pre-existing schemes and programmes for addressing educational disadvantage. When DEIS was introduced, a commitment was given as a concessionary measure to these schools that they would retain a level of support for the duration of the DEIS Initiative.In the light of the recent economic downturn the Government has had to make a number of difficult and challenging decisions in Budget 2009. One of these decisions was to advance the withdrawal of such supports from non-DEIS schools to the beginning of the next school year.The main focus of Social Inclusion Measures will be to retain resources in DEIS schools. There is a need to focus targeted resources on the schools in most need and this approach is in line with the broad thrust of the recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General which are set out in his report on Primary Disadvantage of 2006, which recommended that the Department should focus its educational disadvantage measures on those schools serving the most disadvantaged communities.

In the interest of fairness and consistency for all schools it has been established practice that schools deal with Department officials and the Independent Appeals Committee in relation to the allocation of teaching resources rather than have one or more schools seeking direct access to the Minister to plead a special case. I was concerned that if I met directly with this school or with members of the Oireachtas that I would in effect be prejudicing the future effectiveness of the independent appellate process. The school authorities met with Department officials on Monday 6th October 2008. This meeting was to provide the school authorities with an opportunity to clarify how they propose to plan future subject provision at the school in order to operate the school within allocation. Having considered the matter and recognising that the school had clearly acted on advice provided by the Department at that meeting, as an exceptional matter my Department allocated an additional 12.59 hours. It is regrettable that it was only subsequent to the meeting with my officials on 6 October last, that the school provided assurances for the first time that it would address the core issue of how in future it would operate within the approved allocation and that this happened after the Appeals Committee had concluded its work for the 2008/2009 school year.   It has been forcefully put to the school authorities that this allowance must be regarded as an interim measure in the current school year simply to provide the school with time to make the necessary adjustments.

#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	755	DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools), the action plan for educational inclusion, which is being rolled out on a phased basis over the period 2006-2010 provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and a new integrated School Support Programme (SSP). DEIS brings together and builds upon a number of existing interventions in schools with a concentrated level of disadvantage.The plan represents a shift in emphasis away from individual initiatives, each addressing a particular aspect of the problem, while adopting a multi-faceted and more integrated approach. This is the first time that an integrated educational inclusion strategy has been developed for 3 to 18 year olds in this country.The process of identifying schools for participation in DEIS was managed by the Educational Research Centre (ERC) on behalf of my Department and supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through the Department's regional offices and the Inspectorate.The ERC's overall approach was guided by the definition of educational disadvantage in the Education Act (1998), section 32(9), as: ". . . the impediments to education arising from social or economic disadvantage which prevent students from deriving appropriate benefit from education in schools".In the primary sector, the identification process was based on a survey carried out by the ERC in May 2005, from which a response rate of more than 97% was achieved. The analysis of the survey returns from primary schools by the ERC identified the socio-economic variables that collectively best predict achievement, and these variables were then used to identify schools for participation in the School Support Programme. The variables involved were: unemployment; local authority accommodation; lone parenthood; Travellers; large families (5 or more children); and pupils eligible for free books.In the case of second-level schools, the Department supplied the ERC with centrally-held data from the Post-Primary Pupils and State Examinations Commission databases. Based on an analysis of these data, the variables used to determine eligibility for inclusion in the School Support Programme were as follows:Medical card data for Junior Certificate candidates (including Junior Certificate School Programme candidates) 2002, 2003, 2004Junior Certificate retention rates by school for the 1995, 1996 and 1997 school entry cohortsJunior Certificate exam results aggregated to school level (expressed as an OPS — "Overall Performance Scale" — score). This was based on each student's performance in the seven subjects in which s/he performed best aggregated to school level for the 2002 and 2003 examination cohortsLeaving Certificate retention rates by school for the 1995, 1996 and 1997 school entry cohorts.The identification process was in line with international best practice and had regard to and employed the existing and most appropriate data sources available.A review mechanism was put in place to address the concerns of schools that did not qualify for inclusion in DEIS but regarded themselves as having a level of disadvantage which was of a scale sufficient to warrant their inclusion in the programme. The review process operated under the direction of an independent person, charged with ensuring that all relevant identification processes and procedures were properly followed in the case of schools applying for a review.Out of a total of 3,300 primary and 733 second-level schools, 876 schools have been included under the DEIS action plan. These comprise 673 primary schools and 203 second-level schoolsIn the region of €800 million will be spent by my Department this year on tackling educational disadvantage at all levels — from pre-school to further and higher education. This represents an increase of nearly €70 million on the comparable 2007 figure and is testament to the Government's determination to prioritise social inclusion and ensure that all our children and young people get the supports they need to do well at school. Social inclusion measures across all Government departments have also been prioritised under the Towards 2016 agreement, the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion 2007-16 and the National Development Plan.Targeting resources at the most disadvantaged schools that are working to counteract educational disadvantage will continue to be a priority for the Government.

The information in relation to the 2007/2008 school year is as follows.Schools have flexibility in the way in which they assign pupils and teachers to classes and the Department does not allocate teachers to specific classes or age groups.In any discussion of class size and classes where the number of pupils exceed the average it is important to understand how the main staffing schedule sets out to treat schools in like circumstances in a fair and consistent manner. The current allocation is based on an average of 27 pupils per teacher and the fact that schools make individual choices in assigning teachers to class groups. With over 20,000 individual classes spread across all schools throughout the country there will always be differences in individual class sizes.It is of course the case that some schools can have class sizes of greater than 27 but this is often because of a local decision by a school to use its teaching resources in order to have smaller numbers in other classes. Indeed, very often when a particular school has a class of over thirty in a particular grade, it is because there is another class in the same school with just 20 pupils or so.0-1920-2930-3940 +SumPUPILSPUPILSPUPILSPUPILSCarlow3644,2331,5906,187Cavan1,2885,6161,5448,448Clare1,9637,6562,8394112,499Cork City3,0088,2472,46013,715Cork County4,2932,460010,69039,583Donegal3,30011,1833,58218,065Dublin City8,91225,1507,0824241,186Dún Laoghaire/Rathdown1,44710,5733,58815,608Fingal1,10920,0716,13327,313Galway City1,2983,6501,2456,193Galway County4,00811,5653,17018,743Kerry2,28410,2892,51315,086Kildare1,04917,3916,04824,488Kilkenny1,1116,5912,0949,796Laois8665,7511,5028,119Leitrim8672,0943193,280Limerick City1,3453,8811,1636,389Limerick County1,8168,7833,43614,035Longford8622,8665034,231Louth1,4249,6273,42614,477Mayo3,5068,0872,0658013,738Meath1,36114,0035,3504020,754Monaghan1,0434,2421,2766,561Offaly9696,8931,4589,320Roscommon1,6294,1698776,675Sligo1,1274,4551,1666,748South Dublin3,92219,3164,81128,049Tipperary N.R.1,2215,2781,3057,804Tipperary S.R.1,5846,3881,6169,588Waterford City5853,9701,1935,748Waterford County8724,9121,4157,199Westmeath1,2247,1751,4439,842Wexford1,74911,4493,06616,264Wicklow1,4969,4413,60214,539Sum64,90230,959595,57020347,0270

The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.The NCSE will undertake to review a decision taken by a SENO on foot of a request from a school or parents/guardians, when accompanied by relevant additional information, which may not have been to hand at the time of the decision. The NCSE has outlined this process in its Circular 01/05.All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.In addition, the Deputy will be aware that there is a Value for Money and Policy Review of the Special Needs Assistant scheme underway at present. It is expected that the review will be completed during 2009. The terms of reference for the review are as follows:(1) Identify the objectives of the SNA Scheme and the role of an SNA.(2) Examine the relevance and continued validity of these objectives and role as they relate to the objectives of the Department's Strategy Statement in "providing a range of resources and supports for learners with special needs".(3) Define the outputs associated with the SNA scheme and examine the duties allocated to and undertaken by SNAs in the context of the objectives of the scheme.(4) Examine the extent to which the objectives of the SNA scheme have been achieved and the effectiveness with which these objectives have been achieved.(5) Identify the level and trend of costs associated with the SNA scheme and comment on the efficiency of the scheme.(6) Evaluate the degree to which the objectives warrant the allocation of public funding on a current and ongoing basis and examine the scope for alternative policy or organisational approaches to achieving these objectives on a more efficient/effective basis and make appropriate recommendations for change, if necessary.(7) Specify potential future performance indicators that might be used to better monitor the performance of the SNA scheme.(8) A VFM review should not, as a general rule, recommend an increased resource allocation for the programme concerned. Where, in exceptional circumstances, it is proposed to recommend such an increase to deliver better overall VFM, the Department's/Office's overall Steering Committee (or MAC) should be consulted in advance and should identify possible savings and/or additional income on other lower priority programmes (for the Department/Office concerned or another public body) that would be sufficient to meet the additional costs involved: full details of these offsetting measures should be included in the VFM review report.

My Department has commenced processing this data although all schools have not yet made their returns.  The allocation process including notification to schools will commence early in the New Year.  The allocation process includes appellate mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules.  The final allocation to a school is also a function of the operation of the redeployment panels which provide for the retention of a teacher in an existing school if a new post is not available within the agreed terms of the scheme.

The resources available to the Department have meant that these choices have been very challenging.  The decision made to suspend the substitution cover was a difficult one.The provision of substitute cover for official school business at second level was only introduced in 2003.  The supervision/ substitution scheme was also introduced at that time.  The supervision substitution scheme will continue to operate without any changes and teachers who agree to participate will continue to receive an annual payment of €1,789 in addition to their normal salary.Prior to 2003 schools managed without any of this provision and this did not impede on their capacity to participate for example in football and other sports competitions.  I fully accept this was possible through flexibility and goodwill all round.As we manage through this difficult period I am asking teachers in all schools to co-operate fully with school managers in coping with this change in the interest of the students.  I am also requesting the school managerial bodies to ensure that the supervision substitution scheme is operated with maximum effectiveness in all schools.

The role of the EDC was to advise the Minister for Education and Science on policies and strategies to be adopted to identify and correct educational disadvantage.  The Committee's final report ‘Moving Beyond Educational Disadvantage' was published in December 2005.The Government has decided as part of the decision on rationalisation of agencies in the 2009 budget, that a formal statutory Committee is no longer required in order to advise on the issue of educational disadvantage.  This will require an amendment to existing legislation which will be brought before the Dáil at the earliest available opportunity.DEIS, the Action Plan for Educational Inclusion, focuses on the educational needs of children and young people from disadvantaged communities.  The Action Plan,which was launched in 2006, draws upon and complements a number of conclusions of the EDC's final report as well as contributions from the Education Partners.The abolition of the EDC will not adversely impact upon the Department's commitment to ongoing consultation on educational disadvantage and the wider social inclusion agenda.

It brings together, and builds upon, a number of existing interventions in schools with a concentrated level of disadvantage. There are 876 schools in DEIS. These comprise 673 primary schools and 203 second-level schools.DEIS provides various supports for both primary and post primary schools.  In urban areas with the highest concentrations of disadvantage, know as Urban Band 1, primary schools benefit from a reduced pupil teacher ratio.  Urban schools in DEIS also receive the following supports:additional non-pay/capitation allocation based on level of disadvantage;financial allocation under schools books grant scheme;access to numeracy/literacy supports and programmes at primary level;access to Home School Community Liaison services;access to School Completion Programme;enhanced guidance counselling provision at post-primary level;provision for school library and librarian support for the post primary schools with highest concentrations of disadvantage.All the schools that the Deputy has referred to have received these supports in 2007 and 2008 and will continue to following Budget 2009.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	772	I am aware of the correspondence referred to by the Deputy.  The Government's commitment to education is clear both from its track record over the past decade in providing substantial additional resources, most notably extra teachers to meet previously unmet needs and from the programme the Government set for itself when it came into office. A lot has changed in the past year and the first and foremost imperative is that we stabilise the public finances. It is only by doing so that we can shelter gains made and put ourselves in the position of being able to make improvements in the future.What we are doing in primary schools from September next is staffing them on the same basis as they were staffed just over one school year ago. Schools have flexibility in the way in which they assign pupils and teachers to classes and the Department does not allocate teachers to specific classes or age groups.In any discussion of class size and classes where the number of pupils exceed the average it is important to understand how the main staffing schedule sets out to treat schools in like circumstances in a fair and consistent manner. The current allocation is based on an average of 27 pupils per teacher and the fact that schools make individual choices in assigning teachers to class groups. With over 20,000 individual classes spread across all schools throughout the country there will always be differences in individual class sizes.It is of course the case that some schools can have class sizes of greater than 27 or 28 but this is often because of a local decision by a school to use its teaching resources in order to have smaller numbers in other classes. Indeed, very often when a particular school has a class of over thirty in a particular grade, it is because there is another class in the same school with just 20  pupils or so.We are dealing with an economic situation of unprecedented difficulty. The Government has a collective duty to respond to this and to take very difficult decisions in the national interest. In doing this we have attempted to afford some shelter to the education sector but given the scale of public expenditure on education it is simply not possible to avoid tough decisions. I fully accept that these decisions are not of themselves desirable and that they can only be justified by the imperative of securing the future economic stability of the country. I have called for cooperation from all the education partners in meeting the challenges facing us both as an education community and as a country.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	773	Notwithstanding the increase of €302 million in the education budget for 2009, in making the announcement of the Budget measures for education I stressed that tough choices had to be made in meeting the needs of the education sector in these difficult times.  The resources available to the Department have meant that these choices have been very challenging.  The decision made to suspend the substitution cover for school business in second-level schools was a difficult one.The provision of substitute cover for uncertified sick leave and official school business at second level was only introduced in 2003.   The supervision/ substitution scheme was also introduced at that time.  The supervision substitution scheme will continue to operate without any changes and teachers who agree to participate will continue to receive an annual payment of €1,789 in addition to their normal salary.I am aware that from January the changes regarding substitution will present particular challenges for school managers but I felt that suspending part of the improvements made in 2003 to the substitution scheme was preferable to impacting more significantly on teacher numbers.  Prior to 2003 schools managed without any of this provision and this did not impede on their capacity to participate for example in football and other sports competitions.  I fully accept this was possible through flexibility and good will all round.As we manage through this difficult period I am asking teachers in all schools to co-operate fully with school managers in coping with this change in the interest of the students. I am also requesting the school managerial bodies to ensure that the supervision substitution scheme is operated with maximum effectiveness in all schools.

The 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure. These decisions were made to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run. In this respect Education while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure could not be totally spared.We are dealing with an economic situation of unprecedented difficulty. The Government has a collective duty to respond to this and to take very difficult decisions in the national interest. In doing this we have attempted to afford some shelter to the education sector but given the scale of public expenditure on education it is simply not possible to avoid tough decisions.

The current income limit for the Special Rate has been substantially increased by 11.6% from €18,055 to €20,147.I am committed to ongoing improvements in the student support schemes such as increasing the income limits as resources permit.

However we are dealing with an economic situation of unprecedented difficulty.  The Government has a collective duty to respond to this and to take very difficult decisions in the national interest.

I have called for co-operation from all the education partners in meeting the challenges facing us both as an education community and as a country.  I am confident that as the global economy improves it will be possible to build again on the significant achievements of recent years and do so in a manner consistent with overall prudent management of the Irish economy.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Prelude	778	I propose to take Questions Nos. 543, 546, 547 and 552 together.Under the current National Development Plan (2007-2013), a total of almost €4.5 billion has been allocated to the school building programme.The allocation for school building in 2009 is €581 million. Although this is a slight reduction over the 2008 allocation of €586 million, it represents a significant investment in the school building and modernisation programme. As the Deputy will appreciate, the climate within which the 2009 Budget has been framed is very different to that of recent years. The Government has been faced with very difficult choices across all areas of public spending. This level of funding for the building programme, at a time of great pressure on public finances, is a sign of the very real commitment of this Government to investing in school infrastructure and will permit the continuation of progress in the overall improvement of school accommodation.This investment will build on the achievements of the last National Development Plan 2000-2006, when an aggregate total of well over €2.6 billion was invested in upgrading the existing school infrastructure and providing new school accommodation at both first level and second level. This programme delivered over 7,800 building projects in addition to investment in site purchases, the annual minor works grant to all primary schools, the asbestos and radon remediation programmes, science and technology initiatives, emergency works and grants for the purchase of furniture and equipment.The allocation for 2009 will allow my Department to complete 26 major projects and commence construction on another 62 major projects. It will permit completion of 100 smaller projects on site and allow another 80 projects previously approved to progress to completion as well as funding the other elements of the programme such as the annual minor works grant, site purchases, emergency works etc. It is also my intention to have a Summer Works Scheme in 2009.As the Deputy will be aware, projects are selected for inclusion in the School Building and Modernisation Programme on the basis of priority of need which is reflected in the band rating assigned them under my Department's published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects.  In this way, my Department ensures that funding is targeted on a priority basis at schools most in need of such works.The progression of all large scale building projects, including the projects in the areas referred to by the Deputy, from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in the context of my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.

The current position regarding this school's building project is that the Stage 2b documentation (Detailed Design & Bill of Quantities) was received in my Department's offices recently and following a satisfactory review of the documents, tender action will be commenced as soon as possible.

There is nothing exceptional in this.  The allocation process includes appellate mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules.  At primary level the final allocation to a school is also a function of the operation of the redeployment panels which provide for the retention of a teacher in an existing school if a new post is not available within the agreed terms of the scheme.Primary schools are currently returning data to my Department in relation to their enrolment as of 30 September.  My Department has commenced processing this data although all schools have not yet made their returns.  The allocation processes including notification to schools will commence early in the New Year.Teacher allocations to second level are approved by my Department on an annual basis in accordance with generally applied rules relating to recognised pupil enrolment.  Each school management authority is required to organise its curriculum, teaching time-table and subject options including Irish, English and Maths having regard to pupils' needs within the limits of its approved teacher allocation.Significant improvements have been made in the staffing of our second level schools in recent years.  In the 2001/2002 school year, there were approximately 24,477 wholetime equivalent teaching posts allocated to second level schools.  For 2006/2007, the corresponding figure is 25,454 wholetime equivalent posts.  This increase in staffing has improved the pupil-teacher ratio at post primary level in recent years.  The pupil-teacher ratio has fallen from 13.85:1 in the 2001/2002 school year to 13.13:1 in the 2006/2007 school year.The number of teaching posts in primary schools in June 1997 was approximately 21,000.  The number in September, 2008 was over 31,000 which is an increase of over 10,000.  The average primary class size for the 2007/08 school year was 23.9 down from 26.6 in 1996/97.  The pupil-teacher ratio — which includes resource teachers etc.- was 16:1 compared to 22.2 in the 1996/97 school year.

These decisions were made to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run.  In this respect Education while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure could not be totally spared.The Government's commitment to education is clear both from its track record over the past decade in providing substantial additional resources, most notably extra teachers to meet previously unmet needs and from the programme the Government set for itself when it came into office.  A lot has changed in the past year and the first and foremost imperative is that we stabilise the public finances.  It is only by doing so that we can shelter gains made and put ourselves in the position of being able to make improvements in the future.The increase of €302m in the Education budget for 2009 is therefore a real achievement in the current economic climate.  Education is one of only three Government Departments to have increased funding in 2009.  However, I am not going to pretend that this amount is sufficient to maintain the current level of service in all respects.  It is simply the best that could be done in the  circumstances.On Budget day I made it clear that tough and difficult decisions had to be taken throughout the Education Sector in order to work within the level of resources available.  I took no joy in making those decisions.  They would not have been taken if we were not facing such ominous financial circumstances.The following document outlines the impact of these decisions on various aspects of the Education Sector.  The 2009 Estimates were framed and agreed by Government in the same manner as in previous years.Minister outlines key Budget measures for Education in ‘difficult economic times'O'Keeffe calls on education partners to ‘work with him in collectively meeting challenges'Expenditure increase of 3.2pc to €9.6bn‘Tough choices' made on savings in difficult Exchequer positionCapital spend up €79m to €889mThe Minister for Education and Science, Batt O'Keeffe TD, today outlined the detail of the 2009 Budget provision for his Department, saying ‘tough choices' had to made in meeting the needs of the sector in difficult economic times.The gross allocation for the Department of Education and Science is €9.6 billion — an increase of €302 million, or 3.2pc, on last year's allocation.Minister O'Keeffe said: ‘In framing this Budget, the Government faced very difficult choices. However, the increase for the Department of Education and Science reflects the Government's commitment to prioritising investment in the sector in very difficult economic circumstances.'The capital allocation for next year will amount to €889 million — an increase of €79 million, or almost 10pc, on the 2008 outturn.Minister O'Keeffe said: ‘This will allow me to continue to significantly invest in school buildings throughout the country, to provide additional school places and to refurbish existing schools, as well as investing in higher education infrastructure including strategic research programmes under the Government's Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation.'However, Minister O'Keeffe acknowledged the impact of funding restrictions in a number of areas, saying they were the inevitable result of the more challenging economic environment and the need to prudently manage Exchequer resources.‘The resources available to me next year mean that difficult choices had to be made in order to try to meet the full range of needs in the education sector.‘While teachers and special needs assistants have been exempted from the general 3pc payroll cut across the public sector, a number of measures had to be taken in the education sector, including increasing class sizes from next September, to help contain public sector pay while providing for demographic and other changes,' said Minister O'Keeffe.The Estimate provides for increases in capitation for schools. This means that a primary school's capitation and ancillary grants will increase by €25 per pupil to €355.  For a voluntary secondary school, the capitation and school support services grants will increase by €22 per pupil.  A number of specialist grants have been abolished, with the general capitation increases aimed at giving schools maximum flexibility in how they use their grant allocation.Minister O'Keeffe said €10 million is being allocated to the Department of Education and Science to further enhance services to children with special needs pending the implementation of the EPSEN Act.  Included as part of this investment is the expansion of the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) to cover all schools in the country by the end of 2009.  In the past academic year, national coverage by NEPS was provided to 60pc of schools.‘In the more challenging period ahead for the Irish economy, it will be necessary for us to continue to target and prioritise our resources to maximum effect across the education sector.  I would ask all the education partners for their co-operation in working with me through the challenges we now face together,' said Minister O'Keeffe.Minister O'Keeffe said he would now be implementing the agency rationalisation measures in the education sector announced by the Minister for Finance in his Budget statement.‘The proposals for agency rationalisation are logical and appropriate.  In the case of the qualifications bodies, I will immediately be working with those concerned to work out the practical details.  The amalgamated body will allow us to build on the internationally recognised strength that has been developed across our qualifications and quality assurance systems,' said Minister O'Keeffe.

These decisions were made to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run.  In this respect Education while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure could not be totally spared.Prudent management of the Government finances is particularly important at this time of global economic uncertainty when tax revenue has fallen so significantly and when world economic conditions are so serious.  Even with the Budget measures in place there will still be a significantly increased borrowing requirement in 2009.The Government's commitment to education is clear both from its track record over the past decade in providing substantial additional resources, most notably extra teachers to meet previously unmet needs and from the programme the Government set for itself when it came into office.  A lot has changed in the past year and the first and foremost imperative is that we stabilise the public finances.

There is nothing exceptional in this.  The allocation processes include appellate mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules.This is particularly relevant at post-primary level where the appellate process considers in particular any specific curricular needs of the school concerned.  At primary level the final allocation to a school is also a function of the operation of the redeployment panels which provide for the retention of a teacher in the existing school if a new post is not available within the agreed terms of the scheme.At post-primary there is no effective system wide redeployment scheme at present and this can mean that schools retain teachers, though over quota, and in addition discrete allocations are made to post-primary schools for example to cater for pupils with Special Educational Needs and those with Language difficulties and these allocations can also alter the ultimate position of the school in relation to any over quota position.I want to clarify again that my Department's budget for next year has been prepared on the same fundamental basis as any other year by estimating the number of teachers that will be employed under the different categories (e.g mainstream, special needs and language support) and allowing for any change in overall demographics.Schools are currently returning data to my Department in relation to their enrolment as of 30 September.  My Department has commenced processing this data although all schools have not yet made their returns.  The allocation processes including notification to schools will commence early in the New Year.

It is only by doing so that we can shelter gains made and put ourselves in the position of being able to make improvements in the future.  What we are doing in primary schools from September next is staffing them on the same basis as they were staffed just over one school year ago.In terms of the position in respect of any one school for September 2009, schools are currently returning data to my Department in relation to their enrolment as of 30 September last.  My Department has commenced processing this data although all schools have not yet made their returns.  The allocation process including notification to schools will commence early in the New Year.The allocation process includes appellate mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules.  The final allocation to a school is also a function of the operation of the redeployment panels which provide for the retention of a teacher in an existing school if a new post is not available within the agreed terms of the scheme.There is a need to focus targeted resources on the schools in most need and this is in line with the broad thrust of the recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General which are set out in his report on Primary Disadvantage of 2006 which, inter alia, suggested that my Department should focus its educational disadvantage measures on those schools serving the most disadvantaged communities.  Therefore, while having to make difficult decisions for the 2009 estimates, particularly in the current financial climate, my main focus has been to retain resources in the schools targeted under the Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools (DEIS) initiative.DEIS, the action plan for educational inclusion, provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and an integrated School Support Programme.  As a result of the identification and review processes, 876 schools have been included in the programme.  These comprise 673 primary schools (urban and rural) and 203 second-level schools.In the case of those schools that have not been identified for inclusion in DEIS it will now be necessary to withdraw disadvantaged posts and additional financial resources from them with effect from 31 August 2009.  These resources had been historically provided to schools under previous disadvantage schemes.As the school referred to by the Deputy was not identified for inclusion in the DEIS programme it is now necessary to withdraw its Disadvantaged Areas scheme post and additional financial resources with effect from 31 August 2009.
