I have selected the matters raised by Senators Fitzgerald, McHugh and Bradford and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senator Bannon may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.

#JohnMinihan	unknown-#JohnMinihan-party	unknown-#JohnMinihan-dob	unknown-#JohnMinihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	2	The Order of Business is No. 1, statements on the Ferns Report, resumed, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and to conclude not later than 1.30 p.m., with the contributions of Senators not to exceed 15 minutes each.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	3	All Members of the House will welcome the fact that the organisers of a rally that was due to be held in Athlone on Sunday, on foot of the Nally case which was dealt with in the courts last week, have decided not to stage it.We all have a responsibility to reduce the tensions between the settled and Traveller communities. We should recognise that the State, since its foundation, has been a cold house for the Traveller community. Those of us in positions of responsibility need to ensure that the Traveller community is welcomed and recognised in this country. Adequate accommodation should be given to Travellers to ensure they can have a decent quality of life for themselves and their children. We should also examine the issue of property rights and the question of how people can defend their own homes. That is not just an issue in isolated parts of rural Ireland; it is also an issue in Dublin.The phenomenon of cars being stolen to order has developed recently. As Senators are aware, forms of security like immobilisers mean that the only way to steal a car today is to rob its keys. People are now breaking into houses in Dublin and other cities to steal car keys. We must examine whether the correct balance has been struck between giving home owners the right to defend their property and ensuring intruders can be brought before the courts.The election of Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf as President of Liberia — the first female president of an African country — is a positive development. Liberia has been frequently debated in this House because of the involvement of Irish troops in that country over the past two years. We must welcome the fact that Liberia now has a democratically elected government and president and the central role played by Irish troops in ensuring that the country had free and fair elections last Sunday. We should honour the excellent work done by Irish troops in Liberia and recognise that it now has the beginnings of a democratic establishment after the appalling tyranny and dictatorship that prevailed there for many years.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	4	Senator Brian Hayes made a valid point about how people can be locked in their own communities in cities and the country. People in Dublin's inner city districts lock and bar their doors at 7 p.m. and are afraid to venture out after this hour. This issue faces quiet people and elderly people around the country and should be debated.I ask the Acting Leader to respond to me on the question of Ireland's progress towards implementing the provisions of the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. I recently raised the fact that the EU insulation directive, which requires every new house and every house offered for sale to have a certificate of insulation, comes into operation on 4 January 2006. I understand the Government has given an period of grace to construction initiatives for the following two years, which is appalling. This development puts Ireland outside the demands of the EU and worsens its position regarding the Kyoto Protocol. A more adverse development is the fact that houses are being built, particularly in Dublin, with 9 inch hollow concrete blocks. It is not possible to use this block to raise a house to the insulation standard found in other houses. We must discover why the practice of using this block has not ceased. The involvement of the HomeBond scheme in this issue raises questions of self-regulation.The Government and the ESB have taken the retrograde step of informing the wind farmers' association that its members cannot apply for connection to the national grid for the next two years. Wind farms are being built around the country, the Government is attempting to persuade people to save energy and we are not harnessing natural energy. Why did the Government and the ESB decide to take this step? Vested interests in the concrete industry and the energy sector are at work here. How can we address this issue? The single housing issue could be resolved. If every new house was required to have a 1 kw wind energy generator and solar panels for water heating, in addition to proper insulation, we would save approximately 30% of our requirements under the Kyoto Protocol. I would welcome a debate on this issue.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	5	I agree with the sentiments expressed by Senator O'Toole. It is approximately six months or possibly a year since the Taoiseach rediscovered socialism and approximately two months since he rediscovered republicanism. He rediscovered the Irish language yesterday. As a token of this reconversion, will the Government agree to adequately fund TG4 and help a very successful television channel which runs on a shoestring budget instead of uttering rhetorical flourishes? It is ironic that the former British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, was prepared to give substantially more funding to Sianel 4, the Welsh language television channel, than Irish Governments have been willing to give the equivalent service as Gaeilge.If white phosphorous had been used by the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, in Caracas; the President of Cuba, Fidel Castro, in Havana; the President of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin, in Grozny, Chechnya; the President of Syria, Bashar al-Assad, in Damascus or by the Iranian Government, the EU would be in emergency session today demanding a range of measures. The UN Security Council would also be in emergency session demanding penalties, sanctions and an immediate investigation. If our ostensibly non-aligned and neutral State now declines to state that the use of chemical weapons is repulsive, it has abandoned its aim of doing anything serious about such matters.Am I the only person who finds the idea of the Minister for Defence grinning down the barrel of a gun on the pages of two newspapers repulsive and annoying?
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	6	That point is not relevant to the Order of Business.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	7	I grew out of playing with guns when I was around six years of age and it is about time the Minister for Defence did the same.
#MarcMacSharry	unknown-#MarcMacSharry-party	unknown-#MarcMacSharry-dob	unknown-#MarcMacSharry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	8	A report entitled Rural Ireland 2025, which is the latest in a very long line of reports on rural Ireland produced over the last number of years, was launched yesterday. Could the Acting Leader arrange a series of debates on this issue? While much has been done for rural Ireland, this report highlights the fact that the north west and the west will suffer most and a greater regional imbalance will be created over the next 20 years. The Taoiseach should come to the House to discuss in a meaningful fashion what could be done to rejuvenate the west and address the regional imbalance.Is there an appetite to create viable alternatives to Dublin? One million people will attempt to live in the Dublin area over the next 15 years but the towns and hubs in Sligo and Donegal identified in the national spatial strategy could play their part if they received the necessary resources. It is time that Ministers, led by the Taoiseach, came to this House to debate the issue.

The Government made a commitment to meet over 13% of our energy needs by wind power, which is classified as "green energy", by 2010. There has been much discussion about wind energy but enthusiastic promoters of it who are prepared to enter the business at considerable expense face prohibitive charges when trying to gain access to the national grid. I outlined my concerns in this regard to the energy regulator yesterday. We need a serious debate on this subject because there is a considerable amount of confused thinking about what is feasible, even within Government circles and relevant bodies. We should offer much more encouragement to those who wish to enter the wind energy business rather than impede them.
#BrendanDaly	unknown-#BrendanDaly-party	unknown-#BrendanDaly-dob	unknown-#BrendanDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	11	I agree with Senator Brian Hayes's point regarding the widespread sense of relief at the cancellation of the demonstration scheduled to take place in Athlone on Sunday. However, he should speak to his colleague, Senator Jim Higgins, who supported the holding of that demonstration in an interview broadcast on national radio yesterday.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	12	That is not relevant to the Order of Business.

#BrendanDaly	unknown-#BrendanDaly-party	unknown-#BrendanDaly-dob	unknown-#BrendanDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	23	There has been a serious breakdown of law and order in Kilrush. The misconduct over the past six months in one part of Kilrush culminated in the firing of shots last night into the private dwelling of a local councillor whose daughter was treated for serious injuries in Ennis General Hospital last August. This is a serious problem in Kilrush. Will the Acting Leader ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, to outline how the serious situation in areas of Kilrush can be dealt with effectively?
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	24	On numerous occasions over the past 12 months many Members from this side of the House have called for a debate on the Border, midlands and western region and the worsening imbalance in investment. The report published this week, Rural Ireland 2025 — Foresight Perspectives, endorses everything that has been said on this issue. Last week the Government compounded this imbalance with the publication of Transport 21, which indicated the imbalance of infrastructure investment in favour of the east and south. The rural Ireland report cries out for the west to be saved. We have said it time and again and the Government has not listened.Everybody should read the editorial in today's edition of The Irish Times which outlines Government inaction on western development and the absence of genuine policies to save the west. If we are to have only 10,000 full-time commercial farmers by 2025, we must highlight the failure of a Government with plenty of money that does nothing but pay lip-service in the intervening period. The Dublin agencies and groups that pontificate on how the west should be developed must be made to realise that the west is dying, that the problem is spreading to Munster and Ulster and that——

The acquiescence by many nations worries me and can have only one result. It will come back and haunt us in the future. One cannot build a stable democracy in Iraq against a background of torture, which we have recently learned about, and the use of chemical weapons.The United States invaded Iraq with some backup, particularly from Britain, against the wishes of the United Nations. In my first comment in this House on the invasion I said it was immoral, unjustified and would lead nowhere, and my comment stands.

#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	32	Will the Acting Leader invite the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan, to a debate on the consolidation of farm holdings through reinvestment and tax relief? Ireland has the highest level of farm fragmentation in Europe and this must be tackled. Approximately one quarter of farms are in a single parcel of land. It goes back to the divide and conquer policy of our landlord days. The time has come to consolidate farm holdings. Young people will no longer drive long distances to look after stock at different locations. Consolidation would improve infrastructure by reducing the number of farm vehicles on roads. We must have a debate on this issue and relief must be given in the forthcoming budget. Last year relief was discussed but little resulted. Only six farmers availed of last year's scheme so it needs to be amended and broadened.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	33	That is a matter for the debate.

It is not just a rural subject but extends to urban areas. Local government has a role to play in lighting and security; insurance and alarm systems also have a role. This is a global debate so I ask the Acting Leader to place it on the agenda quickly.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	35	Will the Acting Leader get some information and take some action on genetically modified food? On 7 September, EU Commissioners approved Monsanto's GT73 oilseed rape for use as animal feed despite opposition from 13 member states. While six member states voted for it, because of qualified majority voting and the abstention of countries such as Ireland, it went through undemocratically at the whim of the Commissioners.This decision has serious consequences for Ireland because we are in a good situation. We are geographically isolated and are not affected by pollen spread by wind. We have the lowest exposure to GM food and that is a good marketing strategy. This modified seed can cross-pollinate with members of the brassica family such as cabbage, kale and turnips.Will the Acting Leader clarify the situation and ask the Government to look at the implementation of the so-called safeguard clause, Directive 2001/18/EC, recommended by the Oireachtas Joint Committees on European Affairs and Environment and Local Government? This would protect an important national asset from a potential threat from generically modified organisms.I propose an amendment to the Order of Business, which is close to the Acting Leader's heart, namely, that No. 18, motion 22, be taken before No. 1. The time limit on the Order of Business should be extended to a maximum of 45 minutes to facilitate the proper ventilation of topical matters of current public interest by Members. The motion is in the names of the Independent Senators.

Taking Senator MacSharry's comments we could have a good debate on what is needed and what is happening with the spatial strategy and transport policy.There is an investigation into the lack of response to an ambulance call in the south west. However, this problem exists in many parts of the country. The ambulance service in the Castlebar centre or Galway city is on call to serve north Galway. However, the service in Galway city has indicated it is so busy it cannot serve north Galway. I would like this issue debated.I have collected 4,000 signatures in a petition calling for an ambulance base in Tuam, which I have given to the Tánaiste. It is important to have an ambulance base prior to discussing the provision of a proper ambulance service. Will the Acting Leader bring the matter to the notice of the Tánaiste? If we have a debate on health, we should discuss the ambulance service, which is the first point of contact with the health service for many people in rural areas. Many people in the west are not served well by the ambulance service.

I asked yesterday if Operation Anvil had lagged. If I recall correctly, the Leader said she had asked that question but I do not believe she got an answer to it. Garda confidence in what is being done is vital. I assume the Minister responsible has consulted with the force. I hope this is adequate because something went wrong in terms of Operation Anvil. Is a complement of 50 gardaí sufficient for this new unit? If it is not adequate, we will go nowhere in addressing this problem. We cannot combat these thugs and the increasing level of crime if we do not have an adequate and properly resourced force. Is the force adequate? I hope it is. I hope it is not a case of too little, too late.

I agree with Senator Kitt, that the west is alive and well. We acknowledge the great progress and work of this and the previous Government. It is time for a serious debate on agriculture in the west.I congratulate the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, on creating places in midwifery and paediatric nursing. Leaving certificate students will have direct entry into both of those specialties. Those places will come on stream in September 2006. We have debated this matter in this House and those places will address the serious shortage in those specialties. I congratulate the Tánaiste on creating them.
#PaulBradford	unknown-#PaulBradford-party	unknown-#PaulBradford-dob	unknown-#PaulBradford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	45	At a meeting of the Sub-Committee on European Scrutiny this morning we reflected on a proposal from the EU Commission, agreed by the Council of Ministers, to set aside a fund to develop intercultural relations. This fund is modest in scale and it is intended that it will be provided from 2008 onwards. The idea is to allow countries to invest money in intercultural dialogue and development.With the debate on the issue of Travellers in this House and at a broader level across society, we could usefully reflect on the purpose of this fund. We should look for solutions rather than problems, and answers rather than questions. Given that this fund will be provided by Europe, we should try to use some of that money to engage in dialogue with those people who live on the margins of our society and do not feel part of the community. In each case, blame does not lie on any particular side; everybody has work to do. I hope we will be able to utilise that programme to make progress in uniting rather than dividing people.I support what Senator O'Toole said about energy use and energy need. I hope the Minister for Finance in the budget in three weeks' time will set aside funding for grant aid towards the insulation of the older housing stock. While different grants for housing were available during the years, grants for insulating houses would be worthwhile from an economic and energy conservation points of view.
#JimWalsh	unknown-#JimWalsh-party	unknown-#JimWalsh-dob	unknown-#JimWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	46	I join with others in welcoming the cancellation of the rally in favour of Mr. Nally. In doing so, the House must be mindful of some of the underlying difficulties which gave rise to the circumstances of that case. We should have a debate on this issue. A contributory factor to not tackling this issue is the hypocrisy of political correctness, and I would like the debate to be on that subject. Political correctness is gone mad. We need to arrest some of the move in that direction such that we will have political leadership and straight-talking from people on issues which give rise to certain problems within communities.I concur with those who have condemned the use of chemical weapons in Iraq. A debate on Iraq is overdue. It is unconscionable that this would have arisen following the pretext for the invasion of Iraq which was to do with chemical weapons. The consequences of it and the example it gives are far reaching. I would like us to have a debate on Iraq as soon as possible.I support the call for a debate on the west. I ask that the south east be included in that debate because we rank below the west in many economic development league tables.

While all of us support, as does the UN since its resolution of June 2004, the establishment of democracy in Iraq and the withdrawal of the multinational force, the continued revelations of abuses of power, breaches of international law and evasion of obligations that belong in any civilised society are hampering that process and making it more difficult. They are also a source of embarrassment to the friends of the United States throughout the Western world. This is a message that this House needs to convey. Very few of us here are in any real sense anti-American. We support the best values of United States democracy. This situation cannot continue.

Some valid points were made in contributions about the approach we should take on this matter.Senator Brian Hayes also raised the issue of property rights and people's right to defend their own homes. In light of recent events we could make a serious contribution to the national debate. I will raise the matter with the Leader and seek to have such a debate.Senator Brian Hayes also referred to Africa's move towards democracy, particularly in Liberia. He paid tribute to the Irish troops there. I am sure all Members of the House would join with him in congratulating the Defence Forces on the role they have played, which is a credit to this country and to the individuals concerned. It is a mark of the major contribution this country makes on the international stage. Given our size and population, we make the highest per capita contribution to UN peacekeeping missions, which is something of which we should all be proud.Senator O'Toole stated that the difficulties of rural Ireland are not just confined to those areas, they also affect urban communities. We all agree with that. This point was supported by Senator Ormonde. I hope we will have a debate where we can discuss those issues in more detail.Senator O'Toole also raised the issue of the Kyoto Agreement. I support the call for a debate on this agreement and alternative energy in general. The Senator highlighted a number of related issues such as the wind farm industry. We could well examine the side issues associated with grants for wind farms and wave energy. A number of issues in the broader context of alternative energy should be debated in this House and I will seek to arrange such a debate.Senator O'Toole, interestingly, referred to vested interests in connection with the concrete industry, which is something we could well debate in this House. Senator Ryan raised a number of matters. He was unable to refrain from making a comment on the Taoiseach's alleged new found interest in the Irish language. That comment was unbecoming of Senator Ryan, but only to be expected.

This point was supported by a number of other speakers, including Senators Ó Murchú, Jim Walsh and Mansergh. Everybody knows the position I took on the Iraq war but I support the comments made on this issue. One of the main reasons for going to war was the potential use of chemical weapons and now we find that this substance is being used, which is highly inappropriate. Yesterday, the Leader of the House undertook to urge the Government to protest in the strongest fashion and I fully support that.

I am glad Senator Ryan grew out of the habit of playing with guns at six years of age. Regarding the press photographs today, the Minister for Defence interacts with the Defence Forces and this will happen if a sharp photographer takes a photograph at a particular angle. I am sure the Minister was handling a weapon in a very safe and controlled environment. I congratulate the photographer. That is as much as we can say about it.

His call for a debate on the west was supported by a number of other speakers, including Senators Ulick Burke, Kitt and Feeney. We have a basis to seek a debate in the House on the report. I will raise the matter with the Leader and seek to arrange one.Senator Daly raised the issue of law and order in Kilrush. That is an operational matter for the Garda. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is not directly involved, it is a matter for the Garda and I am sure that would be the reply from the Minister to any query on the issue. There will be an opportunity to raise it in the proposed debate on law and order and people's rights.Senator Ulick Burke also spoke about the west. Senator Ó Murchú referred to Iraq. Senator Bannon sought a debate on agriculture. It is some time since we had a debate on this matter in the House and I will seek to arrange one. Senator Bannon may also wish to use his party's Private Members' time for such a debate.Senator Norris sought information on genetically modified foods. I would be happy to speak to him afterwards about that and I will endeavour to get the information he seeks. He also proposed an amendment to the Order of Business which was seconded by two Members. The Committee on Procedure and Privileges is currently reviewing the area of time limits for the Order of Business. The matter will be further considered by the committee after the Christmas recess. In the light of this information I am not sure if Senator Norris will wish to proceed with his proposed amendment. If he is happy with what I have said he may wish to withdraw it.Senator Kitt sought a debate on the ambulance service, particularly in the Tuam area. Given that we will have a debate on the west in general we could integrate this matter into such a debate.Senator Coghlan raised the issue of gangland crime, Garda confidence and the new force announced yesterday to deal with this matter. The deployment of gardaí is an operational matter for the Commissioner and the Garda authorities. I am sure discussions took place between the Minister and the Commissioner but it is an operational matter. I do not have any information that the Garda is unsatisfied in any way with——

It would be highly inappropriate for the Minister to become involved in decisions on the deployment of gardaí.Senator Bradford made a point about funding that is available from the European Union. We should examine the area of intercultural relations, as has been highlighted by recent events.Senator McHugh raised the issue of the Irish language. He seconded the proposed amendment to the Order of Business. He made the point that the Irish language was thriving in Northern Ireland where it is not compulsory. Senator Ross asked if there would be a debate on budget day. I understand there will be as has been the case for the past number of years.

#PaulCoghlan	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-party	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-dob	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	99	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, back to the House. There has been a unanimous condemnation of all that was revealed in the Ferns Report. The question now, however, is "where do we go from here?" I thought the speech in the Lower House by Deputy O'Donnell was over the top. For a Dubliner — and someone, I am told, is a northsider, close to the Minister of State's own constituency, near the Phoenix Park — she displayed a lack of knowledge of recent history, as well as theposition of All Hallows and Archbishop's House.The special position of the Catholic Church was formally written out of the Constitution in a referendum in 1971, so Deputy O'Donnell was a bit wide of the mark. I do not think there has been any special church-State relationship since then, although I do not know what it was like even then. I was not conscious of it. Deputy O'Donnell told the Dáil: "The track record is such that we cannot accept that the church will be truthful or capable of self-regulation." Self-regulation has now gone for all professions, but it is a bit strong to say that the church would not be truthful. I would not accept that and I feel the comment was over the top.Deputy O'Donnell implied that the special position has gone on for too long, almost as if it still existed, but that is not true. As someone said in the earlier debate, although in a slightly different context, if anything, the pendulum has swung in the other direction. Instead of politicians getting a belt of a crozier, politicians are bishop bashing.

In fairness, Deputy O'Donnell apologised for her over the top remarks. She wronged the Taoiseach by her silly reference to All Hallows.The church's role in education must be put in context. We would not have our current education system were it not for the number of national schools that are effectively church controlled. The system would not have been as good as it is, nor would it have been possible to provide it, without the church's input.During the previous debate, Senator Maurice Hayes referred to the role of the De la Salle Brothers. I was also a student at a De la Salle school for years and I never witnessed a single instance of abuse, nor was there any talk of it. I do not believe that any abuse took place there or in the other schools I attended, including St. Brendan's in Killarney. I never came across or heard a reference to a single instance of abuse.I accept the arrangements the Government has put in place concerning the Dublin archdiocese, but we do not need to go digging holes all over the country. I think that is also the Minister of State's view. We can be satisfied with the procedures that have been established.The Ferns Report states:The Inquiry believes that the appointment as Chairman of the Board of Management of national schools... should be made with utmost care and diligence. As will be obvious from the allegations set out in this Report, some priests appear to have abused their position as Managers of national schools in order to access children.Now that new procedures are in place that cannot happen again, so we can be satisfied that it has been overcome.The report recommended that consideration be given immediately to the creation of a new criminal offence to apply where persons fail to take action to protect a child from abuse. I wholeheartedly endorse the use of soft information in our child protection procedures, which is also supported by the inquiry through the interagency review committee.We all accept that overall responsibility for child protection lies with the State, and that no one organisation or group is above the law in this matter. This report must prompt a unified response from the Government with action needed from the Department of Education and Science, the Department of Health and Children, and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. All three Departments have a clear and vital role in the protection of children, young people and vulnerable people of any age.The Minister of State accepted those points in his address on the previous occasion. We are all in step in agreeing on those points. Once we are satisfied with the audit, we do not need to dig holes all over the place.
#LiamFitzgerald	unknown-#LiamFitzgerald-party	unknown-#LiamFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#LiamFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	102	I welcome the Minister of State and compliment him on the time he has given to this debate both here and in the Lower House. I note that he has attended this House since the debate began. I agree with a number of matters raised by my Opposition colleagues. This is not the first time references have been made in a report to child sex abuse by members of the clergy. We have already seen the report on residential institutions in which some extremely unsavoury references appeared. There is a difference in this case, however, in so far as the Ferns Inquiry will be acknowledged as a watershed. It is the catalyst that shattered the hitherto unmentionable taboo of paedophilia. In the past, people adopted a hush-hush approach and did not want to accept there was such a thing, let alone talk about it. That is why the Ferns Report marks a watershed in changing attitudes both in rural and urban areas, whereby people are facing up to the reality of paedophilia. Not alone is the subject being discussed, but action is also being demanded because people realise paedophilia may be part of a behaviour pattern of some individuals, albeit an unacceptable one.The report confronts the last remnants of complacency in our society regarding this heinous crime. There was a great deal of complacency and denial based on a refusal to accept this was happening. There was a veil of secrecy over it for years. As a society we have no choice but to confront this evil crime. The report marks the beginning of a new maturity in relations between church and State.I am horrified at the nature of the findings in the report on clerical child sex abuse in Ferns. Even allowing for the social structures of those decades, it is difficult to understand why there was such an inadequate response, in some cases no response. In other cases there was outright denial and alleged destruction of evidence by the church and health authorities, and the Garda Síochána.I sympathise with the victims of the abuse and hope they will find healing as a result of this inquiry and the Government decision to refer the report to the Director of Public Prosecutions. It was imperative that it be immediately referred to the DPP and I support that action. The Government's swiftness in that regard will be asignificant part of the healing process for the victims.I sympathise too with the thousands of priests, brothers and nuns throughout the country who have led exemplary lives and are shocked and horrified at the revelations in the report. I make no apology for saying this. I know many priests, nuns and brothers who have made a significant contribution to this State, in the education of this and previous generations. Some people hammered the Taoiseach for saying that without them we could not have afforded the education. Not alone is that true but in my case, living in a fairly isolated rural region, and for many others, it would have been extremely difficult to avail of second level education. There were two religious orders located in my small rural community in the foothills of a mountain.
#PaulCoghlan	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-party	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-dob	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	103	That is absolutely true.
#LiamFitzgerald	unknown-#LiamFitzgerald-party	unknown-#LiamFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#LiamFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	104	They brought education to us and to many similar communities. We owe them a debt of gratitude, irrespective of the terrible, inexcusable, heinous crimes committed by some of their colleagues. It is hard to accept that balance, fair-mindedness and a sense of proportion and context do not prevail in much of the public debate on this crime. It is all too easy to go over the top and incriminate everybody for the sins of the few.One priest abusing a child is one too many. To judge, however, by some of the anti-Catholic invective since the publication of the Ferns Report one would conclude that every priest, and in some cases, every Catholic, was a paedophile. The facts provided by the authorities speak for themselves. The central one being that the Catholic and other clergy are responsible for only a fraction of the abuse, less than 4%.In using that statistic I am not trying to diminish the horror of what the priests in Ferns or any other diocese are alleged to have done but to maintain a sense of balance and proportion. We must keep these events in context. Most paedophiles are male relatives, stepfathers, teachers, carers, sports coaches and perhaps scout leaders. As a member of the scout movement I have known a couple of leaders who came under suspicion, although I have the utmost admiration for the scout movement and will always support it. If we tar all priests with the brush some journalists want to use because of the sins of the 21 priests in Ferns, and those in other dioceses, logic dictates that we do the same for all other categories of people in positions of trust with children. I am calling for a sense of balance and perspective in this debate.Before I give the wrong impression, let me stress that we must ensure any member of the clergy who is a paedophile is subject to the full rigours of the law. There must be no hiding place for them, no more than for any paedophile in any position of trust. Nobody should get away with such a heinous crime. We must also ensure that as we go after the 4% of clerical paedophiles we pursue the other 96% or more lay paedophiles with equal vigour.This report achieves a great deal but especially it brings this heinous crime into the full glare of public scrutiny in a way that previous reports did not. The welfare of our children and the victims makes it imperative that everybody in authority and every member of the public has a duty to report such a crime. While I do not have legal training, as the Minister of State does, I have strong views on mandatory reporting. There are forceful legal arguments against this, which I could not take on, but considering the situation in the round, if we are to confront this evil once and for all, thoroughly and effectively, we must choose mandatory reporting. I look forward to the comments of the Minister of State on this proposal.Another issue arising from this debate is the conflict between civil law and Canon Law. We must all agree that Canon Law can and must never be invoked to protect clerical paedophiles from civil law. Some people have recently fudged this issue. There can be no fudge on this matter. I was heartened recently to read an article by Dr. Michael Mullaney a lecturer in Canon Law at St. Patrick's College, Maynooth. He was also one of the advisers on Canon Law to the inquiry. He wrote that he wished:categorically to dispel some of the myths . . . regarding the relationship between canon law and civil law with respect to paedophilia.Firstly, no priest, religious or bishop as a citizen of the State is exempt from civil law, much less the civil law that pertains to the crime of paedophilia.That helps to clear up this issue, coming as it does from a man of good standing and prominent legal background, a man whom the State saw as appropriate to call in to be one of the Canon Law advisers to the Ferns inquiry.Dr. Mullaney goes on to say that those clerics who commit such crimes must face the penalties imposed by the State for such offences. He points out that Canon Law does not claim precedence over the civil law, nor does it prohibit reporting sexual abuse where the civil law requires it. There is great clarity in the statement and presentation of the legal side of Canon Law from Dr.Mullaney. It is categoric and definitive, I am prepared to accept it and I look forward to the views of other people of equivalent legal standing, whether those views are to the contrary or reinforce those of Dr. Mullaney.Turning again to the victims and their families, one of the most horrible aspects of this crime is that it was so secretive and private. It was carried out in secret, private places and involved hideous actions by adults, manipulating young innocent children, robbing them of their innocence and potentially destroying a child's life. Children were also manipulated on the basis on the inevitable guilt feelings they would have about what was done to them.It is hard for us to imagine what those young, innocent children must have gone through during that horrible experience, what they went through subsequently and what their fathers, mothers and other family members went through because in the culture of that time one did not talk about such matters. They have had to deal with those taboos and face terrible traumas and ghosts. We know this has resulted in suicide in certain cases, and in other cases in emigration, with a decision never to return to Ireland. It resulted in people living their lives almost in privacy, concerned that their neighbours were constantly talking about them. I have spoken to some people in the Ferns diocese whose neighbours have told them they feel like that.Overall, I am reassured that safeguards have been put in place. I am also reassured by the determination of the Minister and the Government, on the basis of the national audit, to have those safeguards monitored on an ongoing basis to ensure they are adequate, and that in the archdiocese of Dublin no priest against whom serious allegations have been made will be allowed continue in ministry; or if allowed do so, the Government will see to it that it can move the commission of inquiry into the relevant parish or diocese. This particularly refers to the archdiocese of Dublin, where any priest against whom serious allegations have been made should not be allowed continue in ministry.It is also reassuring that one of the key recommendations by Mr. Justice Francis D. Murphy is that the High Court should have the power to issue an order against a person who is deemed to be a risk to children and prevent that person from having anything to do with children in an employment or recreational capacity.What Dr. Willie Walsh said is true. He acknowledged publicly that it will take quite a while for the wounds of this horrible period in our recent history to heal. Last week the Archbishop of Dublin said he now hopes for a mature relationship between church and State. Regarding the Government decision to investigate the Dublin archdiocese and conduct a national audit, I compliment the Minister of State for the forceful way in which he came forward to articulate what he is determined to do in that regard with full Government support. These are welcome signs of a new maturity by both church and State with regard to this hideous crime.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	105	For any citizen of this State, this is in many ways perhaps the most distasteful debate the Oireachtas has ever had to deal with. I remember the shock in this House at the first appearances of the X case, but however, awful, sad, tragic and anger-creating that was, it was a unique, once-off situation. The Ferns situation can not be something unique to one small part of Ireland despite all of us wishing it was not a widely replicated experience around the country. The situation is an enormous tragedy of neglect by institutions in which this State, rightly or wrongly, put its faith. Indeed the State had little choice because those institutions demanded that faith and that this role be entrusted to them. In this respect terms like "parental choice" and so on are very much a new language. Before the foundation of the State it was demanded and granted that the national school system be under what the Church would like us to believe was the service of the Roman Catholic Church, but was not.This is a huge tragedy of violence against the most innocent in society. It is a huge tragedy of deceit — I use the word deliberately — by people who set themselves up as moral leaders and expected to be given credibility as such, and who got involved at the very least in disingenuous arguments. I remember a very eminent member of the Roman Catholic hierarchy telling us that because Father Brendan Smith was a member of a religious order, it was very difficult for any of the bishops to deal with him. If Father Smith had been marching around the country preaching the joys of contraception, he would have been dealt with very quickly by the same bishops who tried to explain to us, after the event, that there was nothing much they could about him abusing children. I find such disingenuous attitudes very difficult to accept in politics or elsewhere, though we all acknowledge our limitations, our humanity and our frailties and we are all liable to lose our jobs because of how we perform.As I said before, and recently in another venue, when one gets into a position where one is accountable only to God, and to nobody else, that opens the door to megalomania unless one is a saint — and putting it mildly, not all bishops are saints. I am slow to canonise anyone. Most of us have profoundly fragile feet of clay.The scale of institutional interest being put ahead of the terrible suffering of children is extraordinary, as is the distortion involved. What troubles me currently is the succession of little things which suggest we are now in the process of putting the scale of what happened behind us. To put it mildly, I was disappointed when the Taoiseach's words to describe his reaction were that we were all, as he put it, "disappointed". We were a lot more than disappointed. We were extremely angry and horrified. When the Taoiseach was responding to Deputy O'Donnell, I wish he had used a stronger word than "disappointed". There is much more than disappointment involved. I am disappointed when Kildare has not won an All-Ireland title for 65 or 75 years or whatever period it is. I am very angry when the church to which I give my allegiance turns out to have behaved in a way that no politician would ever have got away with, been forgiven or excused for.Let us remember the fiery coals heaped on a former leader of Fine Gael for his statement, following legal advice, on the issue of hepatitis C. We should compare the language used then with the benevolent attempts to explain away the present circumstances. Last May, the current leader of the Catholic Church said in discussions with Polish bishops that the declining profile of the church in Ireland was partly due to perceptions of clerical sexual abuse. That was under 18 months ago, yet perceptions rather than the facts of neglect were being discussed.Celibacy has been eulogised in today's newspapers. While I do not have an issue with this lifestyle, it is important to note Mr. Justice Murphy's finding in the Ferns Report that each of the experts he consulted believed celibacy was a contributory factor to the matter. I do not want to take part in that debate but to pretend or ignore it represents an attempt to move on.At present attempts are being made to rewrite the significance of the guidelines on Canon Law. The late and wonderful John Kelly wrote what most lawyers regard as the authoritative guide to the Constitution. If a Supreme Court judge announces next week that the book's interpretations are incorrect, the majority of lawyers who rely on it will not claim they do not grasp the significance. The guidelines relied on by priests and bishops gave incorrect advice on dealing with child sex abuse, advice which involved reducing the risk of civil society becoming aware of the church's role. It is not entirely honest to declare in the current embarrassing circumstances that it was an insignificant book. It was essentially the only book people relied on to explain Canon Law.An eminent professor of moral theology, who was once a colleague of mine, argued in an edition of The Irish Times last week that the post-Vatican II dilution of clear roles of authority played a role in this matter. We even have the 3% issue. While I accept that the vast majority of clergy are good people, the people in question were given higher moral authority and the right to tell us how to live, based on their sacramental ordination and the quality of their lives. They claimed to be holier than others, albeit using humble words. It is not simply a question of 3%, which, if true, implies there are approximately 700 paedophiles in Ferns alone. I am sceptical as to whether the problem is that significant. I believe that evidence will indicate a disproportionate incidence of paedophilia among the ranks of the clergy, although many are fantastic people. We cannot allow the horror of what was reported to be diluted by the careful use of words.The fundamental problem in terms of what happened in the Ferns diocese is that a large institution had the power to control education and health care. It still has that power. Today, I read in a newspaper that bishops are about to insist on the right of Catholic parents to send their children to Catholic schools. Nobody in politics, even those in the most extreme left-wing parties, wishes to deny people the right to choose. However, the official position of the Roman Catholic hierarchy is that a school is not Catholic unless a bishop is the boss. The parents of one gaelscoil voted to have a Catholic ethos while also being under the patronage of Foras Pátrúnachta na Scoileanna Lánghaeilge. However, the Catholic hierarchy told them a bishop had to be in charge if the school was to be Catholic. This issue concerns episcopal control rather than parental choice. The role of the church in education needs to be debated, although not with the over the top language used last week, because we have not yet reached an honest agreement on that role.The efforts made by religious orders 150 years ago to educate people who were abandoned by state and society were heroic but, while these orders are withdrawing from education, they continue to teach in prestigious fee-paying schools. They have not given to lay boards the control of Gonzaga, Belvedere or Clongowes Wood.

They are still Jesuit or Holy Ghost schools. However, they have pulled out of middle of the road secondary schools in country towns and no longer influence these. The same situation arises with regard to health. The hospitals which were established to serve the poor have become instruments for the preaching of particular views. We saw a recent example of this in the ethical conflicts in certain major hospitals.The role of the State is to demand that issues are addressed. I do not have a simple prescriptive solution to this problem. While parents have the right to send their children to schools with the ethos they prefer, limits must exist to that choice. It is appropriate for the State to take an interest in the curricula of Muslim and Catholic schools and it has the right to refuse to exempt clergy from being fully accountable to civil law. Such a situation does not yet obtain. Take, for instance, the cloak and dagger relations among schools' boards of management, where it is pretended that significant parental responsibility is involved but where bishops continue to place people in the majority of positions. They are only accountable to the bishop concerned.Last year, the current Pope issued a letter on women in society, which began with the phrase "The church, expert in humanity...". Each bishop in Ireland should acknowledge he is not an expert in humanity if this issue is to be confronted. Like the rest of us, they can only learn from experience.The framework document which is supposed to guide bishops in addressing these issues was submitted to Rome in 1996. A decision in that city is required to give that document the force of Canon Law in Ireland but, almost ten years on, it has not yet been given that force and continues to be entirely voluntary. That raises a fundamental question about whether they really accept the gravity of what has happened and the need for fundamental change. If the Roman Catholic Church authorities do not give that document the full force of Canon Law it is our duty to give it the full force of civil law.
#JohnGerardHanafin	unknown-#JohnGerardHanafin-party	unknown-#JohnGerardHanafin-dob	unknown-#JohnGerardHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	108	I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, to the House. The bishops have rightly called what happened at Ferns an horrific litany of abuse. That is exactly what it is. Much of the conduct was simply indefensible. It raises questions about betrayal. Children, those who were abused and the church itself, including those who put their trust in it, were all betrayed because the church is clearly and damningly against anything that would harm innocence in any small way, not to mind such a vicious way.It is no harm to consider how we look at different groups in society who are in positions of trust. The law recognises there are a number of professions that have particular access to people's personal lives, such as doctors, lawyers and clergy. Having that personal access is a privilege. For doctors and solicitors there is regulation, and there is Canon Law in the church, but there is also the law of the land. It should be the case that those clergy who have abused, albeit a small number, and which was horrific in terms of their responsibility and the privileged position they held, should be subject to the full rigour of Irish law and Canon Law. I would like to see a strengthening of the law to ensure that those who hold a position of trust and who are in this privileged position bear more responsibility and have more responsibility under the law.I wonder where clericalism and anti-clericalism comes into this. Of the 12 apostles who stood with Jesus, one betrayed Him, another denied Him, another doubted Him and every single one of them ran away. Why do we expect men and women with feet of clay, like the rest of us, to take on a standard they could not have by virtue of their humanity? Everybody can sin. Unfortunately we have got into a position where we doubted whether this could happen. It has happened and we must deal with it very severely.The Ferns Report is very disturbing. It is almost as if those who were in authority were, like a family, hiding a dark secret. It was unacceptable and it is still unacceptable. The future, our church and our children must be taken on board by the church. As legislators we have a duty to ensure we never again allow a situation where a presumption is made, because everybody should be held accountable and should be seen to be accountable, with those in a position of authority even more so. We will have to take that on board. That is our responsibility having seen the Ferns Report.The report makes disturbing reading going back over 40 years. It is a severe criticism of diocesan authorities and individuals in Ferns. It is scandalous that so many suffered horrendous abuse from people in positions of trust. Victims were deeply scarred by the abuse and when they sought help they were not believed or suitable action was not taken. We have a profound responsibility to do our best to ensure this never happens again. In 1996, the church, locally and nationally, implemented new procedures for dealing with accusations of child sex abuse among its clergy. We have to see if the position has improved since then.Data on the incidence of child sexual abuse is vague and imprecise, being based on random sample surveys. I am not convinced as yet that there is a higher percentage of child sex abuse among the clergy than among the population at large but figures may show otherwise. Even if the incidence is as low as 3% it is a chilling thought that those figures could be accurate. How to deal with it is problematic as, for one reason or another, only a minute fraction in respect of civil society seems to come to the attention of the Garda or the courts and much of it is not prosecutable due to lack of evidence and the passage of time.Another chilling thought is how widespread is this evil in today's world. The destruction of innocence and the exploitation of children is one of the most horrific crimes imaginable, yet it affects most societies in the modern world. Child pornography is rampant on the Internet and so is child prostitution in many parts of the world. In the 1990s there were well publicised cases in Belgium involving members of the Government. In Holland, in 1990, legislation was passed making it legal for a child of 12 to have consensual sex with an adult. That law was rightly denounced here.What has happened in Ferns is a truly horrendous and regrettable fact. Some bishops who had been assured by professionals that paedophilia could be treated sent priests away for treatment and reassigned them when pronounced cured, only to find they were not cured and reoffended again. I believe, in the future, that this knowledge and failure to act on it will be seen and taken by the courts as criminal negligence. There was negligence and mistakes were made by bishops, health authorities and the Garda.At the heart of this issue rests the dignity and value of every human being. Everyone is entitled to be protected from the horrors of physical and sexual abuse by virtue of their humanity and inherent worth as an individual. To fail to recognise this and, in some instances, to turn a blind eye to the extent and severity of the suffering and pain involved is inexcusable. Let us hope we all learn from what has happened and that it will never be allowed to happen again.Much of the anger raised in the media concerning the failure of church and State authorities to protect children from abuse is justified. Publication of the Ferns Report will in the long run do the Catholic Church a great service, hopefully leading to a purification and a more authentic witness for the future. The church has a monumental task going forward to reach out to the victims of abuse in a truly penitential and considerate way to commence the long process of healing. It is a long process because the taking of innocence is akin to the taking of a life. The victim of abuse must be of primary concern. The church, in the years to come, will be judged not on how many public statements it issued on the matter but on whether victims sincerely feel it and its members are truly remorseful for what happened through word and deed.Many priests, nuns and members of the laity are also suffering hugely at present out of a sense of shame. I feel for those good people. Perhaps it is a time to remind ourselves of the amount of good, the Christian caring, the charity and the justice with which many clergy work and for which respect was given to all clergy. We should also remind ourselves of the sense of betrayal those good people must feel. The vast majority of people working for and serving the church do so in an exemplary manner under extremely difficult and often thankless circumstances.We must also be mindful of the many elderly priests and religious who have devoted their entire lives to the message of the gospel and feel a deep sense of betrayal in their twilight years. We cannot allow ourselves to become so hardened as a society that we fail to also acknowledge this deep and lasting hurt. If we are sincere about ensuring that such abuse never happens again we must focus on ensuring that best practice is fully implemented to protect all our children in future. While it is a time to face facts, it is not a time to opportunistically make a scapegoat of the church in pursuit of other political and personal agendas. Some people have tried to make a scapegoat of the church, which was also betrayed by this action. The victims of abuse deserve better than this. While sensationalism may help to sell newspapers, it does nothing to bring about realistic solutions to extremely important societal problems. Just like the clergy and the church, each of us will be judged on how we react to this tragedy.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	109	I have been very impressed by this debate in the House over the past two weeks. I am also impressed that the Minister of State has taken the time to be present throughout the debate for which I thank him. Following publication of the report, some excellent contributions have been made. Before discussing the church, I wish to say that the State has an obligation to apologise, as the Taoiseach did when the scale of the problem first emerged. This is not just an issue for the church. It is an issue of failure on the part of the State and its agencies including the Department of Education and Science, the Garda, the health boards and the Oireachtas over many years to open our eyes to the scale of child sexual abuse in this country. We in the Oireachtas have a responsibility to apologise to the victims and use this opportunity to restate that.It is very important that the inquiry undertaken by Mr. Justice Murphy and his team in the past two years put in place a structure whereby people wanting to keep their anonymity could choose to tell their stories. We should not forget that many victims who were traumatised 30 or 40 years ago are now fathers and mothers, and have their own lives. However difficult it has been for them, they have moved on. The report was structured in such a way that stories could be told anonymously without people compromising their families. We need to respect that people have moved on. The scale of this problem goes back to the 1960s.We owe a great debt of gratitude to Colm O'Gorman, who through the programme, "Suing the Pope", had the courage to come forward as a representative of victims, and to the One in Four group. We also owe a debt of gratitude to Marie Collins from Firhouse. I know her very well and she is one of the most articulate and compassionate people I have come across despite the horrendous experience she had in Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, some years ago. We are blessed to have people with the courage to stand up so that politicians and everyone else could take a position on the matter. I understand that the One in Four group has seen a substantial increase in visitors to its website and in those seeking counselling services following publication of the report. Our first responsibility must be to ensure it has adequate financial resources to deal with people who come forward looking for help with psychotherapy etc.The House should put on record its debt of gratitude to Bishop Eamonn Walsh who since his appointment as apostolic administrator to the diocese of Ferns has dealt with the issue in an exemplary way. In his pronouncements one can feel the genuine humility and sorrow of ordinary Catholics throughout the country. As Senator Hanafin said, the key issue is to set out exactly how we as a Legislature will deal with this issue in the future to ensure that first and foremost we create an environment where children can come forward and their views will be taken with a degree of importance that was not previously the case. The most important recommendation of the report was that cultural change must come about so that children's views are taken seriously. We must also set out a very clear radical programme of reform of our legislation and reform of best practice in the various State agencies and Departments that deal with the issue, a matter to which I will return shortly.I agree with Senator Hanafin that it is not the time for anyone to engage in opportunistic debate. It does nothing for any of the victims of child sexual abuse in Ferns or any other part of the country for some politicians to feel they have a free rein to bring us back to a debate that took place in 1980s, most of which was not very useful. People will see through that kind of nonsense which does nothing for the victims. As a Legislature, we must on a cross-party basis deal with the issues and not deal with a debate that took place 25 years ago. People love to hark back on that debate because they get enormous publicity as a result. It is not fair to the importance of the report and to the story of victims that people should act in such a way as they did in the other place. This does nothing to advance the cause of child protection and the public can see through it.We must deal with this issue over a period and through a number of Departments. I would like the Minister of State to outline how we will implement the recommendations. I understand that health care workers need legislative power to intervene. We have come across many cases in the past where a degree of publicity follows an intervention and people question the right of the health board, now the HSE, to intervene. We need to err on the side of the child and to use the legislation not as a stick to beat parents but as a precautionary device to help children.The Garda has a particular role and responsibility here. The Garda is not attuned to this problem and its prevalence in society. The Garda will need to acquire expertise particularly through recruitment and training. At an operational level it needs to attune the force to the scale of the problem and get the kind of professional help from the outside to allow it to deal with such cases. The report outlines the scandalous way complaints were handled by some members of the force in the Ferns diocese.We need to consider mandatory reporting. Up to now I took the position of the Minister of State in that I was not in favour of the introduction of mandatory reporting. Having read the report I have reconsidered the issue. We had a debate on the matter approximately 18 months ago and we need a further debate. The issue needs to be reconsidered to see whether it can be used as another defence for the protection and safety of children.Two weeks ago we discussed the Stay Safe programme in the House. I understand that not every school offers this programme, which is an issue. It is basic common sense that children at a relatively young age would be informed of what is and is not appropriate behaviour. Much of this comes at home from fathers and mothers. However, sometimes that level of knowledge is best imparted in a classroom setting when children are with their peers. In discussions with the Department of Education and Science, the Minister of State should try to push this programme through, as it is very important. While parents have the right to remove their children from such classes, I question whether they do so. I question it because peers have a much greater influence in terms of the imparting of knowledge than any knowledge that can be honed at home. I urge the Government to examine this issue again.The Fine Gael Party has considered the issue of the register of persons. When will the Government legislate for this? We must ensure we have a secure list in place of the names of people unfit to work with children.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	111	Yes. I support the offence of reckless endangerment which has been outlined and prioritised in the report. We need legislation in that area.As a lay member of the Catholic Church I would like to touch on issues affecting the church. Senator Hanafin said that while the church must respond in a legal and public way, it must also respond in a penitential way. In any of the responses I have heard from the bishops or senior members of the Catholic clergy since the publication of the report, I have not heard the church respond spiritually to the issues raised. If one is a Catholic, the question of seeking forgiveness is an important aspect of the faith. However, it is not enough to ask for forgiveness. One must also, through actions and observance, show one is serious about it and do penance.I suggest the church needs to do more than simply ask for forgiveness from victims. For example the 28th December, the feast of the Holy Innocents, would seem to be the perfect opportunity for the Catholic Church to fast en masse. Fasting is an historic way in which the church seeks forgiveness, personal and collective. I urge the clergy to consider doing more than just expressing, albeit in a heartfelt manner, sorrow for the circumstances that arose in Ferns and other dioceses. It should do something more and respond in a spiritual way to this catastrophe that has affected the church and society at large. A public penitential request on a day of significance to children, might be a way for the church to get this view across.The church must reconsider the issues of celibacy and a married clergy. I wonder whether the abuse would have occurred if priests were married and had children and worked with them or whether, in circumstances where they understood the appropriateness of certain behaviour, all of this would have emerged. The House is well aware that St. Patrick's father was a deacon and his grandfather was a priest. If married clergy were good enough for St. Patrick in the fifth century, I do not know why the issue of celibacy causes such difficulty to Catholic clergy today or why it cannot be addressed. Formation for the priesthood is an important issue. It is unnatural that men should commit themselves to a life of celibacy and a life where they do not have a close family connection in the same way as others. Many of the problems we are discussing relate to the formation of priests over the past 30 or 40 years and to the lifestyle they lead. I urge the Catholic church to have another look at this issue.It is important in this debate to recognise the scale of abuse of children in the country. The majority of abuse is domestic, but that should not in any way cause us to underestimate the scale of the problem in the church, where it is systemic and must be addressed. The one positive from this report must be that we create a new environment and culture in which the position of children in society and how the State deals with children will be completely transformed. If that can be achieved by the publication of this report and the putting in place of the recommendations, it will give some measure of comfort to the victims who have so bravely and openly highlighted this dark secret of the State and the church within it.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	112	This has been a long debate. I was very interested in Senator Brian Hayes's excellent contribution to which I would make just one correction or addition. It struck me when he was discussing the morality of forgiveness that one of the most shocking aspects of this report is that the concept of reparation does not seem to be part of the concept of repentance and forgiveness. I always understood that one was not forgiven until one had made reparation to the victim of the wrong. Grave wrongs were committed, yet there seems to be a complete mental incapacity on the part of those with institutional command in the church to realise that reparation is a fundamental aspect of repentance. I note the report stated that many of the cases were handled through spiritual remedy. True spiritual remedy requires reparation to the victim. It is not enough to be sorry and to promise to make amends in the future. One must undo, so far as is in one's power, the damage the victim may have suffered. For me, the lack of a concept of reparation is another shocking element of the report and that is why I pick up on the Senator's excellent contribution.Senator Ryan mentioned the Taoiseach's comments last week. Those comments were made in a particular context. I made it very clear at the launch of this report and in this House that the Government condemned in the strongest possible terms the abuse of authority by those who perpetrated these acts in the diocese of Ferns and those who failed to prevent and deal with those who perpetrated these acts. This was a gross dereliction of duty with regard to the protection of children. The Government was very clear that this conduct had to be condemned and there was no question of equivocating on that issue.This debate was very interesting and I thank Senators for their good wishes to me on the work upon which I have embarked and for the many practical suggestions they made. I will try to take as many suggestions into account as I can on the practical issues raised. The question of listening to children was raised by Senators Brian Hayes and Glynn. This is an area where we have made some progress in the past decade. The goal in the national children's strategy, that we must listen to the voice of the child, has been substantiated in many different ways. The National Children's Office is working hard on this goal with different State agencies and we have established the Office of the Ombudsman for Children. The Children First guidelines seek to create the culture of mandatory reporting we all wish to see and a culture where children will confide a difficulty and will not feel inhibited about disclosing to others any difficulty in which they may be. It is important to broaden and deepen this and to devise structures to do so.The question of cross-Border co-operation was raised by a number of speakers. This is an important issue because of the freedom of movement that obtains within the European Union, not just within this island. We must have a wider international approach to this issue and within these islands.The terms of reference of the commission examining the Dublin archdiocese and the other dioceses in the State refer to the phrase "in the State". I have been asked what the position is with regard to dioceses in Northern Ireland. In accordance with the Good Friday Agreement, we cannot exercise jurisdiction there. Therefore, the terms of reference apply within the State. The arrangements which will be put in place by the HSE to monitor the adequacy and protection procedures in each diocese are being examined in conjunction with the Department. Issues concerning dioceses that straddle the Border will be considered in that context. An initial meeting between officials at the Department of Health and Children and officials from the Department of Health and Social Services and Public Safety in Northern Ireland took place on 8 November. Child protection was also discussed at the meeting between the Tánaiste and the UK Minister, Mr. Woodward, in Belfast on Tuesday last. Consideration of that issue is well under way.Issues relating to the educational system were raised by many Senators. It is important to bear in mind that a legislative framework is now in place, which was not the case for a substantial duration of the period of time to which the Ferns Report relates. Many of the various matters described in the Ferns Report took place before we had a clear statutory framework in respect of primary education. The Education Act 1998 carefully delineates the respective positions of patrons, parents, students and the State.Of course there is scope for debate about what the respective provinces of the various interests should be. Much of the debate in this House and the other House revolved around this issue. The Ferns Report did not make any recommendations on this specific issue, other than to say that great care must be taken in the selection of a chair of a board of management. The rules for boards of management of national schools, which are drawn up under legislation, are to be revised. The four-year terms of office of the current boards will expire on 30 November 2007. The departmental procedure relating to the drawing up of boards of management, their constitutions and their rules of procedures was drawn up following discussions between the Department and representatives of the relevant interests — parents, teachers and the relevant management bodies. I felt that the characterisation of the current primary education system during this debate belonged, to some extent, to a past that no longer exists. I do not claim that what exists now is not capable of improvement. There is statutory scope to do so within the framework prescribed in legislation. There are also some wider constitutional considerations in this regard.I welcome the fact that we are debating this issue. As I said at the outset, I am glad the recommendations in the Ferns Report have received a broad welcome. I assure Senators that I do not intend merely to write letters to people to seek reassurance that the report's recommendations are being implemented. It is important to ensure that the recommendations are implemented on the ground and that the necessary structures which need to exist if we are to ensure that the civil authority has full access to relevant information are available. When people are arguing about the position of the church as school patron that was investigated in the Ferns Inquiry, they should bear in mind that other churches, denominations and bodies are involved in the management and patronage of schools. The State, in recognising that the church in question can be involved in such matters, is also entitled to insist on certain standards when church personnel are getting involved in such bodies. That is an unavoidable conclusion when one considers that we have made statutory provisions in that regard.It is natural and understandable that Senators spoke at length about relations between the church and the State. I would like to give the House my views on the church — I was fascinated by the contributions of Senators on that subject — but I am not sure if it is my place to do so as part of this debate. The Government is establishing an interfaith dialogue with all of the religions and faith groups in this State. That is an important and welcome step because we need to have a dialogue between civil society and the various churches, especially in light of the decline of the more conventional denominations which have always existed in this jurisdiction and the arrival of a substantial number of new faiths and religions which were not represented in significant numbers among the population of this State in the past. I do not doubt that every state needs the co-operation of the various faith groups within its borders. Faith groups assume a large importance for people from migrant communities, as organisers of a basic sense of community for such people in this State. Such groups played a huge part in the formation of the consciousness of the people who have lived here for generations. The Government's decision to engage in dialogue with such groups was a good one. Many of the issues which have been raised in this debate can be further teased out in the course of that dialogue.There was a sense during this debate that many Senators spoke not only as Members of the Oireachtas but also as lay members of the church or other Christian churches which have close ecumenical relations with the Roman Catholic Church. Such people spoke about their concern about the state of the church. Those who have internal authority in the church, which is respected under the constitution, would do well to heed the opinions of those who have voiced their thoughts as part of this debate. I do not doubt that the church was a very important institution in Irish life — it still is for many people. The voices of those who have expressed their views on various issues should be heeded.The position of the State has to be very clear. The Members of the Oireachtas operate as legislators on behalf of the people. If we enter into arrangements in education and other areas, we must be satisfied that the child protection standards which apply in such institutions are unassailable. The Government is responsible for ensuring that all of the recommendations of the excellent Ferns Report are implemented. I am certainly determined to ensure they are, so that people can be assured that the terrible things we have read about in the Ferns Report and which we have to infer from the report will not happen again. I thank Senators for their contributions to this valuable debate. Many Senators mentioned the need to ensure that the Stay Safe programme is extended to every primary school. I will draw that issue to the attention of the Minister for Education and Science.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	113	I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise this matter of concern. It is only a matter of time before innocent bystanders are killed or seriously injured as part of the ongoing gangland warfare in Dublin. Law-abiding citizens are genuinely frightened that their communities will be targeted next, as gunmen roam the streets. Eighteen people have lost their lives already this year as a new, younger and more vicious criminal culture takes root. The lethal combination of drugs and guns has resulted in the creation of a small and ruthless subculture in which certain individuals believe they have the right to determine who lives and who dies. It is not that such people think they are above the law, but that they do not recognise the law at all.I propose that the Government should consider the introduction of administrative detention for a limited period to take such individuals off the streets, where they are a danger to themselves and the public. We are told regularly that the Garda knows who such individuals are and from where they operate. The detention of 40 or 50 individuals for a limited period on a charge of gang membership might help to break up the command structure within gangs and to act as a serious deterrent to those who make a living from wielding such control. Crucially, it would help the Garda to build a case against such people, as witnesses could come forward without the constant fear of intimidation and threat.A decision to detain an individual in this way should be a matter for the Special Criminal Court, upon application by the Garda and after a charge of gang membership has been preferred. This proposal would, in effect, give judicial discretion to the courts to refuse bail on the grounds that an individual is a member of a gang. There must, of course, be some prima facie evidence linking the individual with gangland crime. There are many examples of similar systems throughout Europe. Under Belgian law, suspects can be taken into custody for 24 hours, after which they must appear before a judicial tribunal to confirm their detention. The tribunal must sanction the continued detention of a suspect every month, while the prosecution builds its case.Gangland crime must be challenged because it is an affront to the State and to the institutions of the State. Earlier this year, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, described an upsurge of gangland crime as "the last sting of a dying wasp". That statement shows how out of touch he is with the crisis we face in Dublin. I ask the Government to consider the measure I have proposed. Some people might regard it as draconian, but I believe it is the right response to the crisis we face in Dublin at present.

#LiamFitzgerald	unknown-#LiamFitzgerald-party	unknown-#LiamFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#LiamFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	118	Rationalising the provision of secondary education is a demographic imperative. Despite the rapid increase in our population, demand for secondary education is considerably lower than it was in the late 1990s. This is attributable to the sharply declining birth rate from 1983 to 1994. The number of births in 1983 was approximately 75,000, while the number was less than 48,000 by 1994 after ten years of continuous decline.The children in this cohort are now 11 years of age and about to enter secondary education. There are 17,000 fewer children entering secondary education compared with ten years ago. We have an immediate slump in demand, which is unlikely to increase in the foreseeable future to the level that prevailed in the past. There is an irrefutable case for rationalisation. Many schools are no longer viable because they are not of sufficient size to offer the kind of subject choice or the desired variety of course levels — foundation, ordinary or higher. These schools are also unable to offer the junior certificate school programme, the leaving certificate applied programme and the leaving certificate vocational programme. If every student is to have access to the subjects and courses that best suit his or her aptitudes, interests and aspirations, he or she must be in a school that is adequately resourced. The prevailing pupil-teacher ratio dictates that only large schools can offer a comprehensive range of subject levels and courses.Rationalisation is therefore inevitable and desirable, however, it should be carried out strategically. Leaving the demise of schools to the sole criterion of enrolment numbers is unwise. There is a plethora of schools with declining enrolments in my own area of Dublin, although it is politically unwise for me to say so. None of the 14 second level schools serving north-east Dublin is full to capacity. There are over 9,000 secondary school places in the area but only approximately 6,000 pupils.The closure of one third of these schools is realistic, if not inevitable, although I will never live down having said so. However, communities must be consulted about such closures. Schools which operate under a broad remit and provide adult education and a comprehensive range of courses, programmes, subjects and social interventions, must be preserved in preference to narrowly-focused schools which are selective, exclusive, disinterested in the social dimension of education and only open for six hours a day over the 167-day school year.The Minister of State is aware that schools are expensive utilities which are provided and funded by the Exchequer. It is not unreasonable to allow communities to have access to and receive services from them for a greater part of each day and throughout the year. This is sufficiently reasonable to merit being a sine qua non in determining school closures.I was dismayed to learn that one of the schools targeted for closure in my area is Greendale community school. This school caters for over 1,000 adult students and its facilities are open to the public seven days a week on a year-round basis. It is widely recognised for its innovative and student-friendly teaching methods and has an extraordinary catalogue of accomplishments and an international reputation for its pedagogical initiatives. It is short-sighted folly to close such a school.The Department of Education and Science has dissociated itself from the decision to close the school but the trustees only delivered the coup de grace after they were invited to do so by the Department. It appears they had little choice but to fall on their own swords.I accept that the decision to close the secondary school function in Greendale community school will probably not be reversed. However, I trust that the premises, which are State-owned, will remain dedicated to community development through adult education and community recreational programmes. Kilbarrack is a disadvantaged area with virtually no amenities other than those provided by local football clubs and Greendale community school. I call on the Minister of State to ensure that the school is left in the service of the community of Kilbarrack.
#SiledeValera	unknown-#SiledeValera-party	unknown-#SiledeValera-dob	unknown-#SiledeValera-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	119	I thank Senator Fitzgerald for raising this matter, as it provides me with the opportunity to outline to the Seanad the position with regard to the planned closure of Greendale community school in Kilbarrack.Greendale community school was built in 1975 to accommodate no less than 800 pupils. The school expanded quickly to exceed its enrolment capacity. An extension to provide accommodation for up to 900 pupil places was, therefore, subsequently provided in the early 1980s. However, in line with more recent demographic changes in the area, the school is now continuously experiencing a steady decline in enrolments. Since 1996-97, for example, enrolment has declined by 50%, down from 449 students then to 215 students in the 2003-04 school year. Current enrolment trends at primary schools in the area indicate that this decline will continue.The school made an application for major capital investment in 1999. A feasibility study commissioned by my Department on foot of this application estimated that an investment of €2.4 million would be required to address the remedial works necessary. In common with all applications for large-scale capital investment, an analysis of the long-term accommodation needs of the area where the school is located was carried out. From this analysis, it emerged that a general decline in enrolments had resulted in spare capacity of an estimated 2,300 places at post-primary level. In the circumstances, my Department did not consider that the level of capital investment required for Greendale community school was warranted. There was sufficient accommodation in the area to cater for all those seeking places. However, grant aid was made available to ensure immediate health and safety issues at the school were addressed. During this period, Greendale community school was developing its provision of self-funded adult education courses.Subsequently, my Department held meetings with the trustees to discuss the future of the school because the evidence from primary school enrolments in the area strongly suggested that there would not be adequate pupil numbers in the locality to enable the school to regenerate. My Department was also concerned at the ability of the school to offer a broad and balanced curriculum given the relatively small number of day pupils enrolled. The trustees advised my Department in March 2004 that a decision had been taken to close the school in June 2007 and that there would be no intake of pupils in September 2005. Taking all of the circumstances into consideration, my Department concurred with the trustees' decision.The further education section within my Department funds the provision of adult education and community education courses. Courses are usually delivered locally by vocational education committees. The general aim of adult education and community education courses given with departmental funding is to provide second-chance education for those who have left school without obtaining a leaving certificate and vocational-type courses such as the vocational training opportunities scheme, Youthreach and senior Traveller training centres, adult literacy and basic education. Self-funded night-time adult programmes are also offered.The bulk of the provision in Greendale community school appears to be self-funded night-time adult education, rather than second-chance courses. The returns from the school for 2004-05 indicate 18,858 tuition hours, which would correlate to 800 to 1,000 adult education students. Courses on offer include FETAC-accredited business and IT-type provision, in addition to health and safety and work experience.The school has received funding from my Department over the past number of years for places under the back to education initiative. In 2004, it received an allocation of €17,500 for 19 part-time back to education initiative participants. This year, it received an allocation of €20,000. The number of participants for the period from January to June 2005 was nine. Full participant numbers are not due to be returned until the end of the year. In 2005, some €8 million was allocated for community education through the vocational education committees. In addition, the back to education initiative was allocated some €10.87 million in 2004, accounting for 6,000 participants.The City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee has an extensive number of venues on the north side of Dublin, including Killester College of Further Education and Coláiste Dhúlaigh in Raheny. The back to education initiative is also made available in a range of venues, including schools, community centres and family resource centres. When Greendale community school closes in 2007, ownership of the school property, which is currently vested in the trustees, will revert to my Department. In the period leading up to the closure of the school, my Department will consider all available options with regard to the future use of the school property.With specific regard to adult education, my Department is aware of the existing community and adult education provision currently offered at Greendale community school and it will be working in partnership with the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee to ensure this provision is continued in the context of the overall provision in the area.

I have raised this issue before and it is close to the Minister of State's heart. She has acknowledged difficulties in the facilitation and distribution of higher education grants. This issue is usually raised by politicians when they are under pressure from constituents in August, September and October. I raise it now because I want to know where the Government's policy is going.The distribution of grants and the facilitation process is not working. The Minister of State will agree that it is not a question of poor competencies but of resource disparities between the VECs and local authorities. The VECs receive core staff and resources to deal with grant allocations but in my experience as a member of Donegal County Council, local authorities have no funding for staff to allocate higher education grants. Local authorities do not complain enough about this. Their staff have been grinning and bearing this for a number of years as dedicated personnel and through their secretaries offices do work for which they are not paid. Will the Minister of State outline the Government's present and future policy? The system does not work. This is not due to negligence by the people who administer the grant applications but the lack of a proper system and dedicated staff resources.Many families who celebrate leaving certificate results in August find the elation subsides quickly when they find their efforts to get funding for their students are logjammed due to lack of resources. They approach politicians at every level while we trample over each other trying to facilitate them. They come to politicians because the proper staffing and approach, including computerisation, is not there. I hope the Minister of State will outline the Government's policy.

I thank the Senator for affording me the opportunity to outline to the House the position on putting in place a more centralised facility for issuing higher education grants.My Department currently provides third level student support through three means-tested maintenance grant schemes. The higher education grants scheme operates on a statutory basis, while the vocational education committees' scholarship scheme and the third-level maintenance grants scheme for trainees operate on an administrative basis. The statutory framework for maintenance grants under the higher education grants scheme is set out in the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts 1968 to 1992.In accordance with the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government, my Department plans to introduce a single unified scheme of maintenance grants for students in higher education. This will provide for a more coherent administration system which will facilitate consistency of application and improved client accessibility. My Department believes this is necessary if we are to ensure public confidence in the awards system and also ensure the timely delivery of grants to those who need them most.My Department has been engaged in ongoing consultations with the key stakeholders such as the Irish Vocational Education Association, the Association of City and County and Managers, various social partners, other relevant Departments, including the Department of Social and Family Affairs, and the Revenue Commissioners to map the most logical and effective arrangements for the future structure and administration of the student support schemes.There are major implications, including resource issues, in any proposals to change the administration of the maintenance grants schemes, and that is why there has been ongoing consultation with the stakeholders. These discussions have substantially clarified the positions of the stakeholders in relation to the future administration possibilities for student support and their possible role. My Department expects to be shortly in a position to determine the best strategy to give effect to the programme for Government commitment to the payment of the maintenance grants through a unified and flexible payment scheme.Whatever new arrangements are eventually decided on will, as previously indicated, be provided for in new statutory arrangements through a student support Bill. This Bill, which will provide statutory underpinning for the schemes, will have as a key objective the promotion of equality of access. It is also envisaged that the Bill will provide for an independent appeals system. The timescale for the publication of the Bill is contingent on the range of issues which are the subject of the deliberations following the consultations already referred to.

#PaulBradford	unknown-#PaulBradford-party	unknown-#PaulBradford-dob	unknown-#PaulBradford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	126	I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for allowing me to raise the important issue of the Irish sugar industry and I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Browne, who comes from a constituency where sugar beet is an integral part of the tillage industry.The Minister of State knows how important the growing of sugar beet has been to Irish agriculture and how many thousands of people benefit annually from the production of the crop. I refer not just to those who grow the crop and the thousands of people who have worked in the factories over the years, but to all those employed in the associated industries such as transport and factory maintenance. Thousands of people depend on the sugar beet industry for their livelihood and are worried about the future of the industry arising from the proposed sugar reform measures being considered at European level.In Mallow next Sunday, I expect thousands of people will protest to highlight their fears about the industry's future. The Minister of State is aware that next week there will be further discussions at European level on the current set of proposals. I need not tell the Minister of State that this set of sugar reform proposals would, if implemented, wipe out the Irish sugar industry.We are aware that during the years there were many cases where negotiations and agreements made in Brussels produced difficulties, concerns and cuts in various industries and enterprises. However, never has there been a proposal which, as a single entity, would wipe out an entire industry. That is what the current proposed sugar regime cuts would do to the Irish sugar industry. It would literally wipe it out overnight. If what is being proposed by Brussels and what is on the table is implemented, we will not have a beet industry next year. That would be a tragedy for Irish agriculture. Beet production commenced here in the late 1920s or early 1930s with four factories and now there is only one factory. We want to protect that industry.Greencore has become extremely efficient at sugar production. I am advised that the Irish sugar industry is one of the most efficient industries in Europe. It is in the top half of industries from the point of view of efficiency. A level of streamlining, cost-cutting and rationalisation has been carried out and no further such measures can be taken on board. It is a question of what progress we can make politically at European Council level to save this industry.From the point of view of the World Trade Organisation talks and the arguments being made about liberalising trade, we must knock on the head the suggestion that in some way what is being proposed in Brussels concerning the sugar regime would be good for the least developed countries and that we have an obligation to take that on board. The least developed countries currently have access to the European sugar market by way of a special agreement with the European Union.If what is being proposed is taken on board, Irish farmers will suffer and the sugar industry will close but the least developed countries will also suffer. The only groups which will benefit are the sugar barons of the world in Brazil and elsewhere. They will dominate the European sugar industry. They will be the beneficiaries plus a small number of European Union member states where a handful of wealthy sugar barons will rule the roost. That is what next week's talks are about, namely, to stem that tide and to try to reintroduce a balance.I am very much aware of the difficulty of the task facing the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, the Minister of State and the Government. There is no point in our being unrealistic, but it is a battle we cannot afford to lose. I hope the Taoiseach will use his undoubted negotiating skills to impress directly on European Union Prime Ministers the need to set aside this set of proposals and to examine afresh the putting in place of a regime which will allow the industry to remain in place and our sugar industry to remain viable. We are not asking for the EU to subsidise an industry that is inefficient or to keep an industry alive that is loss-making. The Irish sugar industry is a profitable operation. It produces a crop that is required and used. There is also a major spin-off from the industry for rural Ireland and that has always been the case.Of all the talks that have taken place at European farming level since Ireland became a member of the European Community in 1973, our biggest task will be faced next week. The talks may not be finalised next week but we will move some way towards a conclusion.The stark reality of the current position is that unless we stem this tide and reverse the set of proposals on the table by Christmas of this year, the Irish sugar beet industry could be shut down. We cannot allow that to happen. Every political party on this island supports what the Government is trying to do. I hope we recognise the scale of the problem and that the Government's approach will stretch beyond the efforts of the Minister for Agriculture and Food, who will do her best, and reach prime ministerial level.The days of being able to use a veto at European level are long gone but whatever political pressure we can impose and political demands we can make we must exercise them next week. We must ensure that sugar beet continues to be grown in Ireland, that the industry continues to flourish and that the thousands of people who depend on it for a livelihood will have a livelihood next year and beyond.I look forward to hearing the Minister of State's reply and to receiving his support for what I have said.
#FeargalBrowne	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-party	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-dob	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-17 00:00:00	Prelude	127	I thank the Senator for raising this issue and for his offer of support to the Minister for Agriculture and Food next week in her discussions at European level.I welcome the opportunity to inform Members of the current state of play regarding the discussions on the proposed reform of the EU sugar regime which will be the main item on the agenda of next week's meeting of the Council of Agriculture Ministers in Brussels.While it is over a year since the Commission first outlined its thinking on the future shape of the sugar regime, the formal legislative proposals only emerged at the end of June 2005. In the meantime, the proposals have been discussed at Council and in the European Parliament and the UK Presidency is striving to achieve political agreement before the WTO ministerial meeting in Hong Kong next month. The sugar regime in its current form expires at the end of June 2006, therefore, there is a need, in any event, for a decision on future arrangements to avoid a legal vacuum from next July.Everybody is familiar with the reason reform of the sugar regime is currently high on the EU agenda. As well as the internal EU pressures to bring the sugar sector into line with other agricultural sectors, there are also international pressures. These fall under three main headings — the Everything But Arms, EBA, agreement, the WTO Doha Round of trade negotiations and the ruling by a WTO panel last April against aspects of the EU regime, following on a complaint by Brazil, Thailand and Australia. The WTO arbitrator recently decided that the EU must implement the panel ruling by 22 May 2006, which adds to the pressure for early action.From the outset, we have highlighted the serious repercussions that the reform proposals would have for the Irish industry. Beet growing has long been a valuable cash crop for farmers, as well as playing an important role in the tillage cycle as a break crop. Currently, we have 3,700 beet producers and there are about 1,000 people employed in the sugar processing sector and ancillary activities.Soon after the Commission's initial ideas were published, the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, made a joint submission with ministerial colleagues from nine other EU member states to the Commissioner for Agriculture pointing out the devastating effect the proposals would have on producers and industrial enterprises in the sector. While all ten Ministers acknowledged the need to modify the existing regime, they also argued that the reform should aim at keeping the existing pattern of sugar beet and sugar production across the entire EU territory.The legislative proposals which emerged in June of this year turned out to be even more severe than anybody had anticipated and they went even further than the Commission had initially envisaged, not least because of the WTO ruling in April 2005 against aspects of the EU regime. There were two key differences — the price cuts were deeper and the proposal for compulsory quota cuts along with the proposal to allow quota mobility between member states was dropped, being replaced by a voluntary restructuring scheme for factories. The Commission's stated objective in presenting these particular proposals is to develop a sustainable future for the EU sugar industry by enhancing competitiveness and, at the same time, to attain a sustainable market balance between domestic production levels and international commitments.The key elements of the proposals are a 39% price cut in the institutional price for sugar, a corresponding reduction in the minimum price for sugar beet and 60% compensation to farmers for the price cut. A voluntary restructuring scheme is proposed to encourage factory closures and the renunciation of quota.From Ireland's perspective, the proposals are completely unacceptable in their current form. The price cuts proposed are so severe as to make sugar beet production in a number of member states, including Ireland, uneconomic. As Senator Bradford pointed out, it is unprecedented for the Commission to make proposals that could lead to the demise of an entire sector in a number of member states. The restructuring scheme, as proposed, is inequitable since the closure of a sugar factory would have major implications for sugar beet growers and this is not sufficiently appreciated. Apart from going against the expressed views of many member states, the proposals for price reductions have not found favour with the least developed countries either.During the first political debate at the July Council meeting, the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, argued strenuously that the price cuts proposed are too severe and that the reforms should be based on a longer lead-in time for the Everything But Arms agreement. She has kept in close contact with like-minded ministerial colleagues in other member states who are also opposed to the proposal. In this context, a further letter from a group of 11 member states, that is the ten who signed the initial joint ministerial letter plus Poland, was submitted to the Commission in advance of formal discussions at last month's Council meeting, setting out the objections of the group to the proposals. The Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan, also met the Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development on a number of occasions to voice Ireland's strong reservations.Meanwhile, there has been ongoing contact at official level with other member states and the Commission in regard to reform proposals. A high level working group of officials has been engaged in extensive discussions in Brussels in advance of next week's crucial ministerial meeting.Given the severity of the Commission's proposals, we are under no illusions about the challenge facing us as the negotiation process moves into a critical phase next week. I assure Senator Bradford and the House that we will remain resolute in pursuing our overall objective of achieving a balanced outcome that will take Irish interests into account.
